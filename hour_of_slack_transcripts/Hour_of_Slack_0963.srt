1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,420
It's not a radio show at all.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,280
No, no, no way.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,220
It's a map! My God, it's a map!

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,420
And now, the subgenius hour of swag!

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,440
That's too bad, fella.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,300
Like the fruit stand that turns into a filling station.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,660
But the footprints and signs from the past are everywhere.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,740
They've been fighting over this land ever since the first Spanish missionary

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:45,700
showed the Indians the benefits of religion, horses, and a few years of forced labor.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,340
The Indians had it right all along.

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,900
They respected ghosts.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,520
Memories are like that, as unpredictable as nitro,

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,800
and you never know what's going to set one off.

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,120
Like the clues that keep you on the right track are never where you look for them.

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,920
They fall out of the pocket of somebody else's suit you pick up at the cleaners.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,640
They're in the tune you can't stop humming that you never heard in your life.

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,240
They're at the other end of the wrong number you dial in the middle of the night.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,480
The signs are in all those old, familiar places you only think you've never been before.

19
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,980
But you get used to seeing them out of the corner of your...

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,240
...eye.

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,480
And you end up tripping over the ones that are right in front of you.

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,800
And some days, I just feel like I've been bombarded by bozons.

23
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,200
And some days, I just feel like I've been bombarded by bozons.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,580
And some days, I just feel like I've been bombarded by bozons.

25
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,520
What are you doing, Dad?

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,220
I'm developing a compound that, when applied to the soles of shoes,

27
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,140
keeps gum from sticking to them.

28
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,380
What a wonderful gift to mankind!

29
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,640
Hon, what are you gonna do today?

30
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,860
I'm very busy.

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,660
After I rake a perfect crosshatch pattern in the pea gravel in the driveway,

32
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,720
I'm going to change the air in the spare tire of the station wagon.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,540
I'd better make some sandwiches.

34
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,100
Maybe you've just been sitting there all this time,

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,160
waiting, wishing, and hoping against all hope

36
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,960
that you would live long enough to experience, at least once more,

37
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,200
a lady's heart.

38
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,040
And just once, that fabled event which truly is...

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Dockstop.

40
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,340
Ah, yes.

41
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,440
Just when you thought that the church had breathed its last gasp

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,920
and that Bob went down for the last time instead of whipping it,

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,440
you thought you might never get another chance to groove on down the backside of reality

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,240
while stoking on your fine fropster with your best beach bunny rolling blood.

45
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,200
The proceeding was judged politically, and, in the end, it was a failure.

46
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,520
It was politically incorrect, and...

47
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,740
Against Federal Bureau of Demonology...

48
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,780
Photo op!

49
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,620
Wow, these photo op things, they keep running down!

50
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,300
Why don't you put in another loophole card!

51
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,540
I think, well, that fixes it.

52
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,380
So, anyway, you and all the other subjects may gallimate...

53
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,240
Uh, come on, Dr. Howe.

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,400
...sprended on stop trains.

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,200
We have been hearing, of course, about what's been happening in the New York City subway system.

56
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,300
And I believe that I have Bob Dobbs, who is with the New York Transit Authority, with us.

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,440
Mr. Dobbs, can you hear me?

58
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,760
Hello, Ted. Are you there?

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm here. You tell me where you are and what you can tell me about what's going on or what's not going on.

60
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,240
It's an honor to speak with you. Thank you for taking my call.

61
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:25,940
We would ask, we're down in the subway tunnels, we would ask everyone to remain in the cars until the power is restored.

62
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,500
All drivers should cut their power until instructed by their supervisors to restore that power.

63
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,980
Things are quite chaotic, as you would imagine there, Ted.

64
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,860
Wait a second. I understand what you're saying, and I wish I could think that what you were telling me was somehow getting to those people.

65
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,800
How are you getting information to them?

66
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,300
They obviously can't watch television, can't hear it on the radio at the moment.

67
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,040
How are you conveying this information?

68
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,380
We have a wireless radio telepathic system set up for communication.

69
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,260
One of those drivers we use interconnecting radios and so forth.

70
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:10,080
Once the power is restored, I would ask everyone, pretty much everyone in the town, if possible, to log on to thankyoufortakingmycall.com.

71
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:17,560
That way they can get instructional video and audio clips and various things to help them through this state of emergency.

72
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:25,760
If people begin to wander around the tunnels, they may uncover certain reserved areas.

73
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,780
For example, where Beauty and the Beast might be waiting there.

74
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,220
But we want to make sure that everyone logs on to thankyoufortakingmycall.com during the period of time after the blackout.

75
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,100
Immediately get onto that site and download the video and audio clips as an instructional measure.

76
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,160
Yeah, all of that sounds a little bit pie in the sky at the moment.

77
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,820
What are people supposed to do at the moment?

78
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,120
You're talking about people staying on the trains.

79
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,340
We've been hearing...

80
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,360
The transit authority workers have been escorting people off the trains.

81
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,000
I mean, that's what they're supposed to do, isn't it?

82
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,620
Well, that's correct. That's correct, Ted.

83
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,000
And I'm afraid that the problem here is that you're not listening to me very closely.

84
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,400
What I'm asking is everyone to log on to thankyoufortakingmycall.com.

85
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,640
What about penis? Is penis a bad word?

86
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,700
No, penis...

87
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,800
Only depending on how it's used.

88
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,980
Just as it is in life.

89
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:19,740
Right.

90
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,500
In the law books.

91
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,200
It can be...

92
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,260
It is bad depending on how it is used.

93
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,200
It can be used for good or for evil.

94
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,960
I shall go before the United Nations and demand that they accede to our total and absolute control.

95
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,340
I think he rolls his own.

96
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,220
Please be serious.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,180
The final...

98
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,600
The final...

99
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,680
The final time.

100
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,060
The final...

101
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,480
The final...

102
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,780
Finale?

103
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,200
The final...

104
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,740
The final days.

105
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,320
Hi, me.

106
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,560
The final days.

107
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,620
The last moments of our existence on this benighted, besotted planet.

108
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,520
Amen, it's like all over.

109
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,920
I can smell spoiled milk from horizon to horizon.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,460
Yeah, I get that too, yeah.

111
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,540
I see the birds flopping and twitching.

112
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,000
They're dying.

113
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,780
Yeah.

114
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,760
The birds are dying.

115
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,740
Yeah.

116
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,460
The birds are dying.

117
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,020
Yeah, the dying are weird.

118
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:25,480
Charleston was just asking whether we thought, what we thought of the state of democracy.

119
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,920
And I had to say, I didn't think it had ever existed yet.

120
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,360
Well, it's like asking about the state of grace.

121
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,860
When does it ever really exist?

122
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,200
It was a state of insanity, state of Ohio, state, state, God is a state, dog is a state.

123
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:46,160
Why does there have to be these dividing lines, these walls, these signs, signs, everywhere a sign.

124
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,480
Breaking up the scenery, freaking my hair.

125
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:55,160
Boy, I had my dendrites and my pockmarks all rubbed down for this engagement tonight.

126
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:55,720
Wow.

127
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,540
And I still can't think of anything but like the letters I've been getting from Bob Dobbs.

128
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:00,780
What?

129
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,360
I've been getting correspondence.

130
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,680
Not bills?

131
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,680
Not bills.

132
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,660
I've been getting very, very cynical, anti-me, anti-

133
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,360
No, Bob.

134
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,620
Why don't you go jump off a bridge?

135
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,340
Why don't you remove one of the eyeballs that are obstructing your real vision, you know?

136
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,720
Not from Bob.

137
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,660
That doesn't sound like our Bob.

138
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:25,240
Well, when the pink foam is coming out of his mouth, I think even you jump inside.

139
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,460
Yeah.

140
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,760
No, man, not the pink foam.

141
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,580
Not the cotter.

142
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,520
Were there cotter pins or gelatin involved?

143
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,280
No, no.

144
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,060
Because that's usually a bad sign.

145
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,600
It's just a little bit of what he called hermaphroditic cerebral fluid or something that comes out of the spinal tap.

146
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,740
Or that area near there.

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,380
Well, so he's, Bob is in a state of bum-didness.

148
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,900
He's mad at me for some reason.

149
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,300
I don't know why he's mad at me.

150
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,940
I don't know what.

151
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,040
He won't even speak to me.

152
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,580
Well, he's, I don't know if you'd call this a language.

153
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,020
Well, he owes me so much.

154
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,760
Is the reason why I can't get him to return any calls, I think.

155
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,480
He owes you his very, very existence, if you ask me.

156
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,000
And I think maybe that's one of the reasons why he's flopping me.

157
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,400
Well, now, Dave, see, you're venturing into heretical territory.

158
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,420
You know, some people like to say that man made Bob.

159
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,380
You know, that since there was no Bob, there had to be one that man made Bob.

160
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,580
But to me, that's a heresy.

161
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,680
That's a heresy of all.

162
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,100
Bud, we welcome the heretics.

163
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,900
You know, we'd love to hear from them.

164
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,900
We'd love to get their names, their addresses, their phone numbers, any embarrassing information about them.

165
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,760
And send it right off to Langley or to Fort Meade for the composites that are being made nowadays or nowadays.

166
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:49,100
We'd also like to have your, if possible, we'd like to get your cranial size so when the refitting takes place, we don't have to, you know, go to parts stores and stuff.

167
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,060
Hey, remember when we used to joke about the conspiracy?

168
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,980
Yeah, I was.

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,600
We used to joke that there was this conspiracy.

170
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:54,620
It was funny, then.

171
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,480
Of.

172
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,860
Well, we would describe it as the normal people.

173
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:12,500
But really, we always said that there were these elite super normals, rogue subgeniuses that twisted the minds of the poor normal cattle by using the media and so forth.

174
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,220
And cattle products.

175
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,480
It was so funny.

176
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,600
The psychic cattle product.

177
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,600
It was so funny, you know, because, you know, we were making fun of conspiracy.

178
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,820
I used to laugh and cry myself to sleep.

179
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,640
It was so funny.

180
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,560
So funny.

181
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:22,840
Cartoons.

182
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,600
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,680
Yeah.

184
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,740
It's all true.

185
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,960
Oh, so funny.

186
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:28,620
Shut up.

187
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:35,080
Unfortunately, the mirth has kind of dried up like the vagabond wind around us.

188
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,220
Yeah.

189
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:44,540
The sci-fi parables like 1984 and Brave New World of the various different kinds, those were just, you know, warning parables.

190
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,280
It's not like anything like that could ever happen.

191
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,880
Or has already happened and is seeping beneath our prods, our cattle prods.

192
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,500
It's already happened.

193
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,940
It's already happened.

194
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,880
What we're most afraid of is it getting worse.

195
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,460
Right.

196
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,660
We can't even really remember how good it might have been.

197
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:10,640
Well, if we think with our third nostril, if we push back on the sinus areas behind our third nostril,

198
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,100
we can not only get a good idea, but a good sizing, kind of like the way if a tailor was to make a pair of hats or something like that,

199
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,500
and he was pandering to an electric crowd of infidels or some group of people that were intent on taking over.

200
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,720
He's taking over his thoughts.

201
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,240
But we don't have that.

202
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,380
It's not impossible for one to control another's thoughts.

203
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,180
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,520
Is it possible?

205
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,020
It is possible for one to control another's pots.

206
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,240
Duh.

207
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:53,220
Don't you feel like your life has been pretty much controlled by your income from birth to death?

208
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,900
Yeah.

209
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,180
You've had a pen.

210
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,860
It's called your income.

211
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,980
That was the cage.

212
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,220
How big is your cage?

213
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,740
It was never very big, was it, Dave?

214
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,880
Yes, I know how that is.

215
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,680
It's a small pen to run around in.

216
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,420
But we're not veal yet.

217
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,300
That's for the next couple of generations.

218
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,200
Are we venal yet?

219
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,780
No.

220
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,720
The people will be true veal when they're really satisfied to stay in their little boxes,

221
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,340
to go from one box to another and never, ever see the sky.

222
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,100
I'd never put it in pancake batter or anything like that.

223
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,920
It's like soy sauce.

224
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,760
I'd never see a butterfly coming true in my own lifetime.

225
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,640
In your own backyard.

226
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,100
The special effects about the future were so much better than I ever expected the future to offer.

227
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:35,660
I know.

228
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,200
But that was the only thing that got better.

229
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,580
Everything else got sort of cruddier in a way.

230
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,780
I remember the 50s.

231
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,280
It was great if you were a white guy.

232
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,640
Little kid.

233
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,580
Middle class.

234
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,520
In America.

235
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,860
It was great if you were a coyote.

236
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,300
Not from a broken home.

237
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,380
Well.

238
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,380
Oh, wait a minute.

239
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,540
I just kind of pretty much X'd out.

240
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,560
Pretty much everything.

241
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,060
Yeah.

242
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,420
Yeah.

243
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,980
So if you were really, really lucky.

244
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,320
If you were really rich.

245
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,820
A senator.

246
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,060
Like in the McCarver Trouble Committee.

247
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,140
If you were rich, the 50s were great and the 90s were great.

248
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,740
And now it's probably really great if you're rich.

249
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:16,260
And I got to admit, as a have-not, I'm jealous, bitter, angry that the haves have and I do not.

250
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,400
I'll admit that.

251
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,200
I'll admit it, too.

252
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,820
I'm jealous of Jonathan Demme.

253
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,100
Jim Jarmusch.

254
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,760
I'm not jealous of...

255
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,680
Guys like you.

256
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,420
Terry Gilliam.

257
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,060
I identify with...

258
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,400
But what I'm saying is, it's not as...

259
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,200
You know, I was about to say it's not fair.

260
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,660
But like my sister said, fair is where you take your pig and hope you win a prize.

261
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,440
Now ain't it?

262
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,120
Yes, that's absolutely true.

263
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,040
And sometimes bacon soon ensues.

264
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,540
And that's the case here.

265
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,740
And are we not offed the bacon ourselves?

266
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,120
The human bacon.

267
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,520
Aren't we the suet and the flag from which this earth is created?

268
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,200
Aren't we the...

269
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,360
The...

270
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,580
The...

271
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:55,920
The...

272
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:55,920


273
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:02,400
the lower, lower, lower creations that the higher mind forms into its stupid mold.

274
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,180
And here we are.

275
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,420
Right.

276
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,440
Are we like the parasites upon the skin of the higher mind?

277
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,100
The over mind, the over bob?

278
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,600
Of course we are.

279
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,980
We are always taking what is of the parasites.

280
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,400
The lock and the warp, the twists and turns.

281
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,900
Indeed, from an ecological point of view, the human race is a virus.

282
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,660
It's a...

283
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,920
It wipes out other species.

284
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,660
species. We're embarked on a vast

285
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,600
new extinction campaign

286
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,540
now, whether we want to or not.

287
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,260
I mean, it started with

288
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,240
those nice, natural Indians.

289
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,500
Well, who gets the antidote?

290
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,640
The nice, natural Indians or us people with

291
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,700
no hair?

292
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,840
In the end, what does it matter?

293
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,700
For are we not but specks of

294
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,340
tiny, tiny motes of

295
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,560
brief flickering consciousness inside

296
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,860
a great, tumbling

297
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,820
barrel of nothingness with a few

298
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,060
little planets here and there?

299
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,560
An expanding and contracting consciousness.

300
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,220
Yes, yes, yes.

301
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,820
As they re-enter different bodies.

302
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,240
Now, on the other hand, we could

303
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,780
eat a bunch of

304
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,280
mushrooms or take the pills

305
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,340
and feel connected and

306
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,660
interconnectedness of all things that's real

307
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,740
as long as you are good and

308
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,380
high. But you know,

309
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,600
then your 30 days is up

310
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,680
and the bills come in.

311
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,400
What's that rumbling? That deep, deep

312
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,720
rumbling I'm hearing.

313
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,920
2.6 billion.

314
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,840
Yes. Ding dong.

315
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,040
Yes, one can wax

316
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,560
philosophical and

317
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,340
as Hell Pope Huey was saying

318
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,000
on Alt Slack, words are bricks.

319
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,220
Because I was bitching about how most of these people

320
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,920
never do anything, they just talk.

321
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,620
He said words are bricks. And you know, a subgenius

322
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,880
can crap a lot of bricks.

323
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,100
But they have no right to build a house until

324
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,040
they can stand on their own two.

325
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,320
As we prove here.

326
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,720
Whatever those things are.

327
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,240
We build our own house using our bricks of bull.

328
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,700
Our bull bricks.

329
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,560
Crab made bricks.

330
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,100
Mixed with straw. We'll build our house.

331
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,360
We'll build our ship. Own Amsterdam

332
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,220
and then own spaceship out of

333
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,560
out of Adobe.

334
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,680
Made from crab.

335
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,700
Eat us.

336
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,680
We will cast away the wolf.

337
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,860
Leave him at the door where he belongs.

338
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,660
I always

339
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,860
understand those parts later when I hear the

340
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,820
tape. I was just, you know, like

341
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
the three little pigs. I imagine

342
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,580
them as kind of like Ulysses.

343
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,880
And some other spiritual traveler

344
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,240
looking for freedom, conquest, and some sort of spiritual enlightenment.

345
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,320
It's so hard to see those things when you have to have your crew

346
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,840
lash you to the mast and blindfold you and plug your ears.

347
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,220
Because of those silent babes over there singing,

348
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,840
trying to get you distracted.

349
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,020
And get you to pull and to not even bother to vote.

350
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,860
Yes, that's what it is.

351
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,560
They're trying to get you to stay home and watch MTV instead of going home.

352
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:52,560


353
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:52,560


354
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,320
Bring Ulysses to the mast.

355
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,840
Alas, till there.

356
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,180
And those are the ones that hate Bush the most

357
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,840
is the ones who won't get off their butt to vote.

358
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,180
Well, they don't necessarily hate Bush.

359
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,960
The ones who are distracted by the sirens.

360
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,380
They do, but they're distracted.

361
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,140
They hate George W. Winfred.

362
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,200
High pooky, left wing,

363
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,060
right wing, armpit Bush.

364
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,560
Well, that's what you would think

365
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
hanging around the street

366
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,420
and the people of such

367
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,160
and the lowly workers.

368
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,940
But if you're around office worker types,

369
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,340
it's a whole different world.

370
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,920
That's contracting a little bit.

371
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,280
I'm sacred scribe of the church of the subgenius.

372
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,720
And almost everybody that I have to deal with

373
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,180
is so liberal and left

374
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,300
that it makes me feel like Rush Limbaugh

375
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,000
by comparison.

376
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,220
And I'm really kind of a bleeding heart pinko myself.

377
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,840
Well, you don't want to compare yourself to anything.

378
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,340
No, I'm actually a patriopsychotic

379
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,340
anarcho-materialist.

380
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,040
I'm actually a turntable.

381
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,020
It's all silly primate politics.

382
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,700
I know that I'm right

383
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,060
and everybody else is wrong

384
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,320
because I'm a subgenius.

385
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,240
I was granted that right

386
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,520
by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

387
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,600
the living avatar of slack

388
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,780
on this planet,

389
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,460
this benighted planet Earth.

390
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,500
That man, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

391
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,180
who sold for us,

392
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,440
who walked that hot pavement,

393
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,080
who sweated in the polyester suit

394
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,100
and who sat in the board meetings

395
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,460
of the high conspiracy itself

396
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,600
and for what?

397
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,400
To get rich, to get powerful

398
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,280
and to sell.

399
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,920
To start his church of the subgenius

400
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,980
to inspire us.

401
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,900
Even Dave,

402
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,180
that lost soul over there

403
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,140
muttering into his coffee tub.

404
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,520
The link between good nutrition

405
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,840
and Heidi Tubbs

406
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,560
is clearly demonstrated by Heidi Tubbs

407
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,260
with the State Department of Pyramids.

408
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,300
We invite you to start tomorrow.

409
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,800
Heidi Tubbs is not a real woman.

410
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,780
Put me through to the actual commander in chief.

411
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,320
Heidi Tubbs is not a real woman.

412
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,700
I must be head of W4 Warrior.

413
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,580
I must be head of W4 Warrior.

414
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,360
I want his nose.

415
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,920
I want his ear.

416
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,840
I must smell his hand.

417
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,520
Give me the number.

418
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,940
Take no notice if he begins to levitate.

419
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,480
It's a common side effect.

420
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,700
Anyway.

421
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,120
12, 30, 43, 30, 20, 37, 49, 30.

422
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,980
6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 8, 8.

423
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,160
So, so, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch.

424
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:21,940
Hi, Erica.

425
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,820
Hi, Lisa.

426
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,380
Why do you say you feel trapped in a man's body?

427
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,840
Well, sometimes I get the menstrual cramps real hard.

428
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,180
The, the, the, the, the, the, the.

429
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,280
If they're not killed, they'll take over the earth.

430
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,720
What?

431
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,480
What?

432
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,240
It would be so bad if it wasn't so funny.

433
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
I mean, it wasn't so funny that you were hurt.

434
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,560
It wasn't so funny.

435
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,700
It wasn't so funny that you were hurt.

436
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,300
If only it wasn't so funny that you were hurt.

437
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,900
You can laugh at, laugh at his pain.

438
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,020
Nice job.

439
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,960
Nice job.

440
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,500
Nice job.

441
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,000
Nice job.

442
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,500
Nice job.

443
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,460
Out, out, rock out.

444
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,240
Glove out.

445
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:17,880
Dry out.

446
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,660
Hang on.

447
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,980
Diamonds gleam.

448
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,080
Uh-uh, bye-bye, boing-boing, star-star

00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,500
Rotating helpfully in an arranged composition

534
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,780
These are your fictional dogs

535
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,020
Look at them babbling like little children

536
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,460
Their minds totally disconnected from the world around them

537
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,460
Look at them, they seep in their moon pants

538
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,240
And diapers like the elderly

539
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,060
And yet they make as much sense as that common monkey

540
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,020
Well, quite an uncommon monkey, really, aren't you?

541
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,760
That uncommon monkey was, uh...

542
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,960
An artiste, that great artiste was Black Loud

543
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,000
One word, but not Black Cloud, Black Loud

544
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,360
And he just sent this CD to us

545
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,040
Which you open it up and there's an out of focus picture of a hippie inside

546
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,160
And I guess that's him

547
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,260
And then there are some bizarre scents in there

548
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,540
That he sent you

549
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,880
Some odors that you didn't want to describe

550
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,520
Because you said they were so repugnant that you cried

551
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,920
Like a little baby

552
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,080
Well, that happens a lot with the mail that we get

553
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,680
Well, you know, in your job, I think you should be able to take it by now

554
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,800
People sending you feces and parts of their arms

555
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:12,600
For those with tape recorders, that's P.O. Box 344 West Sand Lake, New York 12196

556
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,940
Sand Lake, I remember the massacre at Sand Lake

557
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,020
Yes, yes, yes

558
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,440
Sand Lake

559
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,200
While we're discussing such things

560
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:26,180
What's this rumor going around that you're selling submarine sandwiches now or something?

561
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,680
Or are you selling sandwiches?

562
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,480
No, that's the church of the subgeniuses

563
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,880
And we're selling souls to the highest bidder we've collected over the years

564
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,280
They said you have a sub-site

565
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,020
Almost 25 years

566
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,980
I thought you bought Gumpy's down in Coventry

567
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,660
They said you have a sub-site or something?

568
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,440
You're selling meats and errands of buns?

569
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,300
On, uh, on...

570
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:54,300
For those interested in subgenius artwork, there are some new galleries on the subgenius.com website

571
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,640
Which a person might look at artwork that is...

572
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,860
I like the way they did Tina's eyeball

573
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:04,500
Well, I can't even begin to try to describe the artwork of Heart Ignition and I.M.B.J.R.

574
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,440
And the wrapped out snake with three kidneys

575
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,660
And I also might mention, for those who hate to read the insanity of alt.slack on the internet

576
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,780
It's been somewhat de-insanitified in that Reverend...

577
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,840
Herpetic Soar

578
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,340
Herpetic Soar

579
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:34,620
Mrs. Salacia, the overseer, helped me edit the subgenius forum, alt.slack, down to the best, juiciest, most disgusting stuff

580
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:43,640
So there's this whole giant online magazine that just blew into existence today at subgenius.com

581
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:43,640


582
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,880
Well, talk about it

583
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,680
Calm down!

584
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,560
The Picassos are...

585
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,520
I mean, I was going to talk about the brilliant art worms that are found there on the sub-site

586
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:00,120
The burl-colored art worms and the giant concrete gorilla sculptures

587
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,080
Oh, those are beautiful

588
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,160
That are available there

589
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,240
Yeah, they're kind of po-buckery

590
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,220
Well, you can't live in them

591
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,960
Let's be frank, let's go ahead and say it like it is

592
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,620
It's low class

593
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,700
It's trashy

594
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,500
Yeah, but...

595
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,640
It's trashy, but yet it's cool in a sort of...

596
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:13,640


597
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:13,640


598
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,000
It's sort of a retro bull-dotter undercranked way

599
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,960
I would put a flanky old flamingo in front

600
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,860
And I'd put like, perhaps a...

601
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,540
Somebody carrying a horse or something behind

602
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,180
And I would live there

603
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,160
As long as I could possibly live, I'd draw my air there and anything else I could draw

604
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,280
Yeah, but Dave, you're kind of a parasite on society in that respect, aren't you?

605
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:43,620
Well, how can anybody be a parasite on society when society itself is a parasitical force?

606
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:43,920
Nothing!

607
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,640
Which feeds off the body politic of nature

608
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,920
Which sucks the very source and soul of the essential being of this planet

609
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,680
Bright Lucifer shining!

610
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,900
Schooled by Satan!

611
00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:00,640
Sorry, I don't know whether that was part of the old school rhythmic training

612
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,860
You're scaring me, and you're scaring all the listeners too

613
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,880
What do you think you're doing?

614
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,520
All this talk is frightening talk

615
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,620
I'm gonna play another spin on it

616
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,620
Okay, this is a spin on it

617
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,660
And another platter

618
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,820
I should have taken a nap

619
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,620
This must be taught

620
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,360
They can't learn

621
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,240
There's only five people listening and they're...

622
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,320
I don't know what they're after, I really don't

623
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,920
But I do have some great music here from Kings of Feedback

624
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:37,560
Wank My Whammy by the great Reverend Bill T. Miller

625
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,620
The only subgenius who was ruptured on X Day, by the way

626
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:40,880
Yep

627
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,380
He's gone

628
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,140
He's gone?

629
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,200
Yes

630
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:58,160
Don't let him shoot you

631
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,220
Absolutely not

632
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,220


633
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,900
Actually a乳 limit

634
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:58,900


635
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,140
No ha ha

636
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,700
Oh I do have something interesting right here

637
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:10,700


638
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:10,700


639
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,540
I wanna whack my women to the strings

640
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:31,580
Quick up the beatbox, blast the megamix

641
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,220
I'm gonna stomp my stick

642
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,860
Overdrive the bass in your face

643
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,820
Until your speakers explode

644
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,580
Bass it, pump it, pop it, thump it

645
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,680
Thump it up nice and greaser

646
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,000
Low take, high take, big love, fuss face

647
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,340
It's all finger licking good

648
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,640
Grinch it up, baby

649
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,740
Show your love

650
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,760
I'm gonna slam it in your beatbox

651
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,180
I'm gonna whack my women till the strings pop off

652
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,140
Gonna jack it in your ear till you scream for mercy

653
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,820
Gonna tweak my new drive to the mothership

654
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:38,800
I'm gonna whack my women till the strings pop off

655
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,860
Big Leia!

656
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,340
Big Leia!

657
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,220
Big Leia!

658
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,780
Rub my Johnson with a battery

659
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,800
Rub my Johnson with a battery and watch it

660
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:08,800


661
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,300
Weecha!

662
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,400
Straight up, stripped down, spinning the remix

663
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,100
Got my twelve hundred dollars, carry on down

664
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,020
Scratching the vinyl, slamming the beat

665
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,700
Melt the groove, the crank and the heat

666
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,860
Go slam it in your beatbox

667
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,220
Gonna whack my whammy till the strings pop off

668
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,780
Gonna jack it in your ear till you scream for mercy

669
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,900
Gonna treat my mute rock to the mother shit

670
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,120
Say you need it

671
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,200
Go slam it in your ear till you scream for mercy

672
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,980
Gonna ten and a half, get a shot

673
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:54,220
Gonna fight it killed to death

674
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,220


675
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,500
Go slam it in your ear, don't stop on the beat

676
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:57,500


677
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:57,500


678
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,260
We just go slam it in the fucker's ear

679
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,500
Double track it and rock it

680
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,560
Rhythm〇50

681
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,440
It's Bill T. Miller dear friends.

682
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,380
There's a ton more kings of feedback

683
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,840
at BillTMiller.com

684
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,480
calm.

685
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,440
Okay.

686
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,380
And also assisted there on Bass Drum

687
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,960
by Built Like a Woman.

688
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,480
It was an action, but it is

689
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,120
a man with one eye.

690
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,560
Is the T in Bill

691
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,220
T. Miller, Bill the Miller?

692
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,620
Is that right? No, it's Bill T.

693
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,640
As if, you know, like you

694
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,480
were some sort of

695
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,520
Lovecraftian

696
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,280
avatar, like the

697
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,340
lower forces or something, like you were the

698
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,780
Jesus of the dinosaur

699
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,180
Antarctic frog people or something.

700
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,800
Oh, speaking of which,

701
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,160
I have to go see them in Austin.

702
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,040
We've got a devival at a

703
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,080
pagan. There's pagans in

704
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,820
Texas now.

705
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,220
They were hiding when I lived there,

706
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,000
but now they've come out and they're having

707
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,720
some sort of thing near Austin.

708
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,880
The High Spirit Alliance.

709
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,740
I wonder what that means. It's a yearly

710
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,520
anal thing that goes on there.

711
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,740
My friend told me about it. He said,

712
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,440
I went to the hippie thing in Austin

713
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,400
and I made fun until it was fun.

714
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,940
It was actually fun for him.

715
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,400
But, you know, he's easily funned.

716
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,960
Well, I am too, generally.

717
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,840
Yeah, I know you are.

718
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,300
I have several old buddies down there.

719
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,480
We'll check it out.

720
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,300
We'll wrestle some longhorns.

721
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,940
You know, the pagans there do rodeo.

722
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,840
Wrestle longhorns to the ground,

723
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,840
hogtie the cattle, that kind of thing.

724
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,400
It's part of nature.

725
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,240
It's the Samhain

726
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,300
bullfight.

727
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,440
Yeah, like the Minnowan Rites. You know, you get the bare-naked women.

728
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,100
Yeah, bare-naked women and the bulls.

729
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,420
And Minnowan Ancient Crete.

730
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,300
The Minnowan Brain Eaters.

731
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,260
I think, no, they're not going to be there.

732
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,740
What about the Sarcomas from Greece

733
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,240
or just the regular old Cretans?

734
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,500
Yeah, the Cretans will be there for sure.

735
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,060
And the Rainbow people.

736
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,300
I love the Cretans.

737
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,120
That's the worst band I've never heard.

738
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,180
I used to watch them

739
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,920
very, very silently at the bus stop

740
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,840
until I got arrested.

741
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,440
Stop watching.

742
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,140
Oh, speaking of the anal event,

743
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,080
the third or is it fourth

744
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,140
anal frock cup is happening

745
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,560
in Amsterdam in November.

746
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,340
And they're actually bringing

747
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,160
us out there.

748
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,800
There's a whole slew of European...

749
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,300
We're trying to save

750
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,320
souls over there in Europe because here in

751
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,980
America there is no slack.

752
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,340
But there's still a slight

753
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,500
hope for slack

754
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,620
for the penniless

755
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,580
common subgeniuses

756
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,120
there in Europe

757
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,120
because they're better pickpockets.

758
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,260
Basically, most of them.

759
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,540
They're more desperate.

760
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,600
And so we'll be at the

761
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,120
butt pipe

762
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,040
and the butt cup in Amsterdam

763
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,060
during the...

764
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,660
So you're plugging the butt cup.

765
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,000
The frock cup.

766
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,320
Right.

767
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,660
And then there's Hamburg in Germany.

768
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,880
There's a frock cup in Hamburg too?

769
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,740
The fast food festival at Hamburg in Germany

770
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,700
will be at that.

771
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,240
And in London

772
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,500
at the Foundry

773
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,120
and in Brighton.

774
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,300
At the beach.

775
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,140
At the beach.

776
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,160
Covered in sand with little umbrellas.

777
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,680
In November.

778
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,540
So that'll be like freezing.

779
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,220
Yeah, that's the way they have to do it.

780
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,800
You know, they...

781
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,320
Subgeniuses in Europe are not allowed indoors

782
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,360
in most places.

783
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,120
Indoors?

784
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,440
Right.

785
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,540
And they have to stay outdoors

786
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,980
because, you know, like...

787
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,600
Porcupines.

788
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,960
The same laws that apply to cattle

789
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,680
apply to subgeniuses

790
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,560
in most of Europe.

791
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,060
Do you have a copy?

792
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,380
Well, because of the mad cattle.

793
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:36,380


794
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,780
And the cow disease,

795
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,180
it turned out the vector was

796
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,560
the church of the subgenius.

797
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,960
And they don't want that to happen again.

798
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,860
Insolent, insolent vector at all.

799
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,320
The cows that had

800
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,600
that had been touched by Bob,

801
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,500
shall we say.

802
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,420
Tipped.

803
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,460
In the night by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

804
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,400
That was how the mad cow epidemic started.

805
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,780
And so they're not...

806
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,140
It's like we can't use our real names

807
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,080
when we go into the country.

808
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,780
There's all this silly customs crap.

809
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,020
We have to...

810
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,240
Well, it started off simply enough

811
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,160
as a disgruntled cow effect.

812
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,600
A disgruntled cow festival.

813
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,340
You can hear them in the background.

814
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,660
There's the disgruntled...

815
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,080
And they weren't that really mad.

816
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,760
They were just kind of, you know,

817
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,940
talking about things, saying,

818
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,480
hey, have you noticed?

819
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,580
The Borborygmes.

820
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,960
That was another great band.

821
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,440
Pygmies actually wrote these?

822
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,300
Cow Borborygmes.

823
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,900
It's in the bellies of the cows.

824
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,220
They're not really groaning.

825
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,240
It's just they have indigestion.

826
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,080
That's how somebody said

827
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,100
that the first album

828
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,360
Doctors for Wotan album

829
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,200
sounded like that.

830
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,400
So cows are growing indigestion

831
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,300
or indigestion is growing cows?

832
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,420
I'm missing something.

833
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,220
There's indigestion in the cow's groins.

834
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,160
Oh, yeah, we all have that.

835
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,820
I mean, how can a cow have a groin?

836
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,900
Well, it's down there, you know.

837
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,000
Okay.

838
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,960
Yeah, and we can't talk about down there.

839
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,560
We can't talk about what's down there

840
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,560
because, you know, there's all kinds of cows.

841
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,400
Special and bad and good

842
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,340
about down there.

843
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:05,860
There's a thousand breasts

844
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,120
like a goat with a thousand breasts

845
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,760
that suckles its feeding

846
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,260
and its needy

847
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:11,320
and its greedy

848
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,340
I worship it all.

849
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,320
Each of those breasts

850
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,360
one after another.

851
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,420
Oh, what a goat.

852
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,220
Oh, what fine cabrito

853
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,440
is possible.

854
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,620
Some of my finest books

855
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,040
from down there press.

856
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,820
Cabroot, cabroot, cabroot.

857
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,280
Really?

858
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,100
Yeah, that's the goat sound you make

859
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,400
when you're making it.

860
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:27,900
Oh.

861
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
And it's not a panic sound, really.

862
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,220
It's more of a sound of like

863
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,340
of a huge ship

864
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,380
going down.

865
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,860
Or perhaps just, you know,

866
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,500
the engine stopping

867
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,160
and everybody

868
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,780
en masse shooting themselves.

869
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:40,200
Like a gurgling and screaming.

870
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,640
And the pimple.

871
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,420
Uh-huh.

872
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,280
Some people shoot faster

873
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,600
and some people are just, you know,

874
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,620
when the gunfight at the O.K. Corral

875
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,120
is over, they're not, you know, there.

876
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:50,940
Right.

877
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,500
I don't know.

878
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,740
Remember that the first injections

879
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,520
they gave me

880
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,820
caused all the chafingness

881
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,080
in the side of my head.

882
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,760
And then when they started

883
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,880
giving me the blue stuff,

884
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,320
the next thing,

885
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,760
you know, stuff was dripping

886
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,400
out of my nose.

887
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:06,780
Right.

888
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,240
And that'll leave the patches then,

889
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:08,840
the blue stuff.

890
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:09,660
Yeah.

891
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,700
So like I'm patching

892
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,060
and I'm dripping at the same time.

893
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,340
Right.

894
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,200
And I don't know what to do about it.

895
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,220
I talked to Nurse Normal.

896
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,500
And Nurse Normal says,

897
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,520
well, I just have to wait

898
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,480
until I get out of here

899
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,660
so I can get back to normal.

900
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,120
Well, you know,

901
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,840
don't always go by

902
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,900
the advice of nurses.

903
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,020
Sometimes nurses

904
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,520
can really, really mess you up.

905
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,060
So you think she's trying

906
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,980
to run a scram on me

907
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,640
or she's trying to keep me?

908
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,080
You never know.

909
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,140
I mean, just, you know,

910
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,960
look into her eyes.

911
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,640
Check her out.

912
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,720
Well, as you know,

913
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,020
she has no real eyes.

914
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,640
She has those red glowing things.

915
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,440
Oh, right.

916
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,100
Yeah, she's model 47.

917
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,980
Oh, yeah.

918
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,420
Okay.

919
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,140
I forgot.

920
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,840
They get aggravated

921
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,380
when they get

922
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,180
toot whistle disease

923
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,520
and then, you know.

924
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,060
You know, in that case,

925
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,220
it's really,

926
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,700
that's a tough judgment call.

927
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,080
Really.

928
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:53,940
Yeah.

929
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,920
I've tried it.

930
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,960
I've tried slapping her.

931
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,100
And I used a golf club

932
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,880
on her one time.

933
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,760
But she just didn't seem

934
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,640
to respond

935
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,240
in any kind of positive way.

936
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,100
She just kept on instructing me

937
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,980
and instructing me

938
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,940
and destructuring me.

939
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:07,860
Well, you know,

940
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,260
those are textbook methods

941
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,160
for addressing it.

942
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,940
I don't know what else

943
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,480
to tell you.

944
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,100
You know, you've done

945
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,300
the main basic, you know.

946
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,620
How about molecular shift?

947
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,780
Something like that.

948
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,520
You think that might work?

949
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,160
Yeah, you got a point there.

950
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:19,460
Yeah.

951
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,740
If I can only get her

952
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,020
to sit on the toilet long enough

953
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,160
and get the lights off.

954
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:23,940
Right.

955
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,920
And then, you know.

956
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,420
And then with the brownie mix.

957
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,780
Yeah, well, that's what,

958
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,420
that's how you lure them in there.

959
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:30,620
Right.

960
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,060
Yeah.

961
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,480
Good night.

962
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,420
Good night.

963
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:20,500
Good night.

964
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,400
Good night.

965
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:32,720
It's been so long,

966
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,220
a long time

967
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:33,220


968
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,720
This ain't been enough to let me come back

969
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,840
I bet you're so lonely, baby

970
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,960
I bet you're so lonely

971
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,980
I bet you're so lonely, baby

972
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,000
I could die

973
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,080
People talking all about

974
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,240
About the way you left me flat

975
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,380
I don't care what those people say

976
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,540
I know where that jive is at

977
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,880
One thing I do have on my mind

978
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,840
And it terrifies me too

979
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,120
The way you call me another guy's name

980
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,380
When I try to make love to you

981
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,020
And you, and you

982
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,940
And you, and you

983
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,800
And you, son

984
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,520
Oh my God

985
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,680
You, you

986
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,300
I, I, you, you

987
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,140
You, you

988
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,480
I, I, you, you

989
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,440
Yeah, Cleveland

990
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,600
How about Cleveland?

991
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,340
Cleveland?

992
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,300
Okay, okay

993
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,700
Cleveland has been cancelled until further notice

994
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,500
Sure, it's a nice town

995
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:02,820
Yeah, but...

996
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,740
Hey, everybody.

997
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,100
An old man's talking.

998
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:05,940
That's me.

999
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,740
His number is 13013.

1000
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,940
He also has an email address.

1001
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,100
It's, uh, uh, at, uh, uh, dot org.

1002
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,900
That's, uh, uh, uh, dot org.

1003
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,520
I see it, but I hardly dare believe it.

1004
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,880
You can believe it.

1005
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,140
The Yeti have taken vengeance into their own hands.

1006
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:27,840
Strong fish.

1007
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,600
Come over now.

1008
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,340
Oh, Mr. Brave Baby.

1009
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,740
There's shaking in my head.

1010
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,000
This is soft.

1011
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,160
I think...

1012
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,160
It sounds like the wind is blowing.

1013
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,340
This show is making me feel a bit queasy.

1014
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,180
It's not a violent strain.

1015
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:47,800
Don't worry.

1016
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,120
He'll live through it.

1017
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,740
You know why?

1018
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,180
He may not withstand the fever that comes later.

1019
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,580
Oh, man, I was dreaming I was in the bakery.

1020
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,440
I was eating pie.

1021
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:00,960
You know?

1022
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,340
Like, all of a sudden, man, I could see my own, my own brain, my hands, you know?

1023
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,020
It's like I was eating my own brain, man.

1024
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,800
I know it wasn't real.

1025
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,000
I mean, I know it's just something I...

1026
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,580
Strange idea.

1027
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,200
I'm sorry.

1028
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,360
I could, like, eat or just took something too many times.

1029
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,360
He stuck in his thumb and he pulled out a plum and he said...

1030
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:23,580
Flash.

1031
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,920
That's just it.

1032
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,320
American Nazi Party rules the earth.

1033
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,080
Don't take it out on me.

1034
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,240
That wasn't supposed to be funny.

1035
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,360
Now get your head out of my pants.

1036
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,460
Come on, stand back there.

1037
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:34,860
Get some...

1038
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,440
Mr. Brown shirt.

1039
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,100
Oh, yeah, well, that's a big deal now for you.

1040
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,360
Out the circumstances.

1041
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:50,320
Then you cannot go out.

1042
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,180
Oh, yeah.

1043
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:56,580
Oh, yeah.

1044
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,960
Oh, yeah.

1045
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:20,400
Oh, yeah.

1046
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:29,440
Don't you know that the stars up above are running off?

1047
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:30,360
Oh, no.

1048
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:35,940
Little girl, don't you know that they're blinking at you?

1049
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:43,420
Now the sun can sunburn you, but not as bad as the worst.

1050
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,460
Oh, people do.

1051
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:47,900
Yeah.

1052
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:15,080
Oh, what you find out in the circumstances?

1053
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,860
Can I go out?

1054
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,740
Oh, yeah.

1055
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:29,120
Little girl, don't you know that the stars up above

1056
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,060
are blinking at you?

1057
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,200
Running on love.

1058
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:37,600
Little girl, don't you know that they're blinking at you?

1059
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:45,580
Now the sun can sunburn you, but not as bad as those.

1060
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,220
Oh, people do.

1061
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,020
Yeah.

1062
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:20,400
Oh, what you find out in the circumstances?

1063
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,820
Then you.

1064
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,700
Then you.

1065
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,200
Then you.

1066
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:29,380
Then you.

1067
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,220
Then you.

1068
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,780
Can go out.

1069
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,920
Oh, yeah.

1070
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,680
You can go out.

1071
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,920
Captain Beefheart.

1072
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,700
The great Captain Beefheart from Clear Spot.

1073
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,500
Great album, Clear Spot.

1074
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,760
Oh, wait.

1075
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:58,760


1076
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,400
Our, uh, we have, we have here.

1077
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:01,960
What was it?

1078
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,380
There's a lonesome cowboy Dave.

1079
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,080
There's a polished weasel.

1080
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,680
There's a, there's a frankincense bug.

1081
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,300
And Princess We Are Doe has the frankincense bug.

1082
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,020
Put that up to the mic a little closer.

1083
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:11,260
One part bergamot.

1084
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,040
One part slag nostril.

1085
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,020
What, what do you think about this evening here?

1086
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,400
What do you think?

1087
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,080
I, uh, I've been having a hard time keeping track of the various, uh,

1088
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,600
You like being on the radio tonight?

1089
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,040
Dave, let him talk.

1090
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,120
Do you like it?

1091
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:27,720
He is talking.

1092
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,080
He's pure.

1093
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,500
He's unsure.

1094
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,500
I thought she said she was pure.

1095
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:34,680
Unsure.

1096
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,200
You know, that's a very bad thing.

1097
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,100
She was when we got her.

1098
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:42,480
Of course, everyone is defiled after a few short moments, but, you know, some of us try

1099
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:42,820
to keep it.

1100
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,620
And, uh, the princess is a creature of antiquity.

1101
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,060
Uh, 50 million years, at least in age.

1102
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:50,900
That's me.

1103
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:58,060
Well, as the sun slowly slips, uh, a slip knot around its neck and begins gagging and

1104
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:58,740
puking as she goes.

1105
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,620
And the, the blood vessels constricted.

1106
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,260
It's harder and harder to get air.

1107
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:12,140
And then the, uh, it's time to say, you know, there was something important that I wanted

1108
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:16,840
to get across to the, uh, before we got off the air.

1109
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,560
Sue it or like blanket fudge.

1110
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,820
They're not, we're not, we're just being oppressed.

1111
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,360
No, you didn't want to say that.

1112
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,080
Okay.

1113
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:23,420
I'm sorry.

1114
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,480
Well, no, I can't remember what I was going to say.

1115
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,520
I was distracted.

1116
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,460
I know what you wanted to say.

1117
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,160
It was about sub site.

1118
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,740
No, I did say that.

1119
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,680
We discussed that already.

1120
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,340
We just saw was discussed.

1121
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,680
The impertinence of the common Claude.

1122
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,960
Co are they pertinent to have?

1123
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:39,200
No.

1124
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,300
Oh, you had a boss groove going on.

1125
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,360
There was something about having of getting off your ass instead of just griping and complaining

1126
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,600
endlessly for the next four years.

1127
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,860
You can do that on your ass.

1128
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,040
That's right.

1129
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,060
You can complain endlessly about your ass.

1130
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:05,800
No, but it was like the, the, the, no, instead of complaining instead of complaining or along

1131
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:12,300
with complaining, it was something you could do register to vote and then vote.

1132
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,560
There's a website that to own and turned us on to.

1133
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,680
I can't kind of fully remember.

1134
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:17,940
That's the masturbation site.

1135
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,240
No, it was young naked.

1136
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,280
Women were invited to show their vote by writing it across their bare chest.

1137
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,660
Photographing that and sending the pictures in brilliant idea.

1138
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:33,040
Of course, part of this because I had those automatically get a lot of yes.

1139
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:42,280
Nipples talk and uh, uh, I think a three out of four were, were, were wanted carry and

1140
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,260
the ones that wanted Bush weren't even nipples.

1141
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,220
They were those miscreants.

1142
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:52,660
Well, they were supporters, but not of end of Bush, but they're all the wrong kind.

1143
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,760
It was just awkward to even talk about.

1144
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:01,700
Because personally, I don't believe that, uh, they, I, I feel that the best way to overcome

1145
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:07,600
the conspiracy is to make yourself stronger and try to pay, try to just stay away from

1146
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:07,820
them.

1147
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,440
My friend, isn't there something about two nipples in hand beats one in the bush or something?

1148
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,760
Yeah, but nothing beats three nipples.

1149
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,440
Antiquity 10 million years, at least an age.

1150
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:18,960
Yes.

1151
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:24,060
And the storm has driven the Yeti out of the high mountains into the old palace.

1152
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,660
That is not good.

1153
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:32,360
If the Yeti cut our contact with the outside world, it could mean a slow death to the village

1154
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,640
and to us.

1155
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,140
I thought Sir Edmund Hillary proved that Yeti or the abominable snowmen don't exist.

1156
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:47,520
That's true, but sometimes native superstitions are just as powerful as scientific proof.

1157
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,400
Looks like a Yeti convention.

1158
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:54,880
Seeing as how you know everything, what's the scoop on this Yeti stuff?

1159
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,980
They're also called abominable snowmen.

1160
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,240
They have feet that point backward, scream like a banshee, and are invisible.

1161
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:11,100
Well, if they're invisible, how can anybody see a Yeti?

1162
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,500
No one has Yeti.

1163
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,060
Oh, come on.

1164
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,780
It is the cry of the Yeti.

1165
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,000
The Yeti.

1166
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:39,840
Nub.

1167
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:40,700
Nub.

1168
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,600
Nub.

1169
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,680
Only a Yeti could bring on such terror.

1170
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,540
There must be something we can do about those monsters.

1171
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,660
You know, I'm for going on a Yeti hunt.

1172
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,380
No, I'm not.

1173
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:50,380


1174
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:50,380


1175
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:50,380


1176
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:50,380


1177
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:50,380


1178
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:50,380


1179
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:50,380


1180
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:50,380


1181
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:50,380


1182
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:50,380


1183
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,740
It would only further arouse the Yeti.

1184
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,100
You lie with the Yeti.

1185
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,860
There are enough Yeti outfits and supplies here to equip a small army.

1186
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,340
The terrible snow creatures have come out of the high snows.

1187
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,840
It is the cry of the Yeti.

1188
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,020
The Yeti.

1189
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,320
Nub.

1190
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:12,820
Nub.

1191
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:14,740
Nub.

1192
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:16,640
Nub.

1193
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:17,240
Nub.

1194
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,700
Nub.

1195
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:18,920
Nub.

1196
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:19,360
Nub.

1197
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:19,800
Nub.

1198
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:19,940
Nub.

1199
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,360
Nub.

1200
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:20,360


1201
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,200
Nub.

1202
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:21,300
Nub.

1203
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,240
Nub.

1204
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:23,820
Nub.

1205
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,820
Nub.

1206
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,160
Nub.

1207
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:29,000
Oh, can I get that info at subgenius.com?

1208
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,920
What other news is there?

1209
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,360
Fastenbulbous.

1210
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,740
That's right, the mascara snake, fastenbulbous, also a tin teardrop.

1211
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,560
Bulbous also tapered.

1212
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:46,980
That's right.

1213
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,180
That's right.

1214
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,340
And, friends, this has been an unusually long episode of the Genie and the Mermaid.

1215
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,340


1216
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,340


1217
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,340


1218
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,340


1219
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,340


1220
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,340


1221
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,340


1222
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,340

00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,680
