1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,160
Howdy there, Bob. How you feeling?

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,660
Oh, now, Bob.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,540
Well, now, if you're so anxious to help Crow-Bait Bob,

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,900
why don't you go out and pay some of his bills around town?

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,020
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,200
Well, I'd suggest that you get a room at the Dodge House and think about your sins.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,800
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,540
Well.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,400
Well, you know, I kind of think old Crow-Bait Bob might approve of that.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,340
From PR News in Washington, I'm standing on the world stage,

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,840
armed with metal bars and sticks, meeting with Mexenese, Chiken, and Russianese, Japanese.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,860
PR reports that Reporting Reports is an Illusional Attorney,

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,760
and Family members did not fully understand PR News.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,880
Shut down the PR News TV network to prove it's fighting with Katjipt.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,920
Witnesses known to have severe mental illness say the government mob announced that this is PR News.

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,440
Oh, yes, dear friends, and this is hour of Slack number 1690.

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,780
It's not a rerun.

18
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:23,780
I should be getting Tarzan's radio studio in the mail next week.

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,840
I wish I could.

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:24,840


21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:24,840


22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:24,840


23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:24,840


24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:24,840


25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:24,840


26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:24,840


27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:24,840


28
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,460
I could get Princess Wee with it, but she has to stay in Ohio for now.

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:41,080
And meantime, I'm using Boy's radio station and a lot of recordings by a lot of other subgeniuses, such as this one.

30
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,460
I'm using Boy's radio station and a lot of other subgeniuses, such as this one.

31
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,840
I'm using Boy's radio station and a lot of other subgeniuses, such as this one.

32
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,840
I'm using Boy's radio station and a lot of other subgeniuses, such as this one.

33
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,920
I'm using Boy's radio station and a lot of other subgeniuses, such as this one.

34
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,200
Raindrops and roses and whiskers on bums.

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,420
Dried copper kettles and warm silken scum.

36
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,840
Vestic of the sun.

37
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,720
Vestigal remnants from odor of dung.

38
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,820
Vestigal remnants from odor of dung.

39
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,320
Marby Spectacled.

40
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,580
Hog rigs.

41
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:24,840
Zodiac.

42
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,940
The film from the face he has sprung.

43
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,660
Vestigal remnants from odor of dung.

44
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,060
Odor of dung.

45
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,880
Odor of dung.

46
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,040
Odor of dung.

47
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:50,700
Odor of dung.

48
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,340
Ah, yes.

49
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:05,680
Yes, that was The Odor of Dung by none other than the Rudy Schwartz Project from their new album Postal Code for Ham.

50
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,900
Before that, we heard L'Emeur and PR News and titles and so on.

51
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,360
And now, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

52
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:23,240
One of the things that bothers me is that people think that there has to be something.

53
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:38,760
Something so amazingly powerful and wonderful up there looking after us, taking care of us, smiting our enemies, rewarding us with manna and good deeds.

54
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:53,220
But at the same time, it bothers me that nobody seems to realize that there is something up there that is more powerful, more amazing, and more incomprehensible.

55
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,220


56
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,960
Than any of these so-called deities.

57
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,420
It's the universe.

58
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,700
And let's face it, the universe is a very singular place.

59
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,200
It's a place where a very simple molecule of gas.

60
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,200
Spend a little time changing itself into clouds and stars.

61
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,420
And galaxies and solar systems and planets and.

62
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,840
Dare we say it, life and life evolved to reach a point at which.

63
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:46,920
Somewhere in this vast universe, there is a life form that has evolved with enough faculties and abilities and mental acuity.

64
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,480
To realize that the universe is amazing.

65
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,140
Enormous.

66
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,800
Fantastic.

67
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,300
Incomprehensible.

68
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,720
But wonderfully entertaining.

69
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,460
And that's what we need to realize.

70
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,060
The universe has created us.

71
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,820
So we can appreciate the universe for what it is.

72
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,020
That's the only reason we're here, folks.

73
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,080
So just enjoy.

74
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:19,920
Sit back.

75
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,240
Relax.

76
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,100
And be.

77
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,980
Entertained.

78
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,640
Just.

79
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,720
Is this thing loaded?

80
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,560
I don't think it's loaded.

81
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
One way to find out.

82
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,480
Look, I need that book.

83
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,600
I mean, I want the book.

84
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,160
And you.

85
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
But if you make me choose.

86
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,560
I'll kill you.

87
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,320
I'll take the book.

88
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,840
Why? Why do you want it?

89
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,660
I grew up with it.

90
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,220
I know its power.

91
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,420
And if you read it, then so do you.

92
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,040
That's why they burned them all after the war.

93
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,600
Just staying alive is an act of faith.

94
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,000
Building this town is an even bigger act of faith.

95
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,360
But they don't understand that.

96
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,640
None of them.

97
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,760
None of them have the right words to help them, but the book does.

98
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,720
I admit.

99
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,360
I've had to do things, many, many things.

100
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,160
I hate to build this, I confess that.

101
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,280
But if we have that book, I wouldn't have to.

102
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,060
I imagine.

103
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,620
Imagine how different, how right it is.

104
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,480
It's just this little world could be if we had the right words for our faith.

105
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,880
Well, people would truly understand why they're here and what they're doing,

106
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,500
and they wouldn't need any of the ugly motivations.

107
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,440
It's not right to keep that book hidden away.

108
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,220
It's meant to be shared with others.

109
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,300
It's meant to be spread.

110
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,380
Is that what you want?

111
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,300
With all my heart and soul.

112
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,740
I always believed that I'd find a place where this book,

113
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,940
where it belonged, where it was needed.

114
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,840
I haven't found it yet.

115
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,460
I love this guy.

116
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,320
I love this guy.

117
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,020
Shoot him, please.

118
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,740
Ah, yes, and that was from a movie called The Book of Eli,

119
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,520
but they were describing the book of the subgenius.

120
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,840
And now for a short story, kids.

121
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,540
This is called The War Between the Futures.

122
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,560
See if you can guess who wrote this, old timers.

123
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,560
There was a limitless number of ways to imagine the future,

124
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,980
but only a few of them come to pass.

125
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,080
The most likely futures, the ones that make sense and are self-consistent,

126
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,300
become realer than the unlikely ones that are nonsensical or silly.

127
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,340
There is a very likely future in which humans have become immortal,

128
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,740
and have developed the ability to make their every wish come true.

129
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,620
Because they were able to do or have anything they wanted the moment they wanted it,

130
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,540
they became dreadfully bored,

131
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,500
and suffered awfully from listlessness and ennui.

132
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,060
They learned how to swap bodies with each other just for fun.

133
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,100
And after thousands of years had swapped bodies so many times,

134
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,280
they had no idea which body was theirs originally.

135
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:15,280
The people of this effete elite future became so desperate for amusement

136
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,920
that they created devices to see into other futures, timelines parallel to their own.

137
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,040
One of the other most likely futures was a post-apocalyptic

138
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,700
Warriors of the Wasteland future,

139
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:36,840
in which people drove around an endless desert in cars with plastic domes and ductwork stuck on the outside,

140
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,260
or huge trucks with a huge truck.

141
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,080
Trucks crazily frankensteined out of half a dozen other trucks,

142
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,580
with whole heavy metal bands on them, howling and shooting things up.

143
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,380
In between driving around howling and shooting things up,

144
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,200
they had plenty of time to work on their purple mohawks,

145
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,480
or build exotic weapons out of hand tools and farm implements.

146
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,700
And did they ever stink!

147
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,800
My God, you would not believe the smell.

148
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,920
When the effete elite future discovered

149
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,140
the Warriors of the Wasteland future,

150
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,720
they were shocked and appalled.

151
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,080
They took its existence as a personal affront.

152
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,180
It insulted their dignity to acknowledge that such a lowbrow, tasteless,

153
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,660
and unrefined future could possibly dirty up the continuum with its filthiness.

154
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,160
They resolved that it must be abolished.

155
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,480
The effete elite finally had something to do.

156
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,560
They created magnificent death machines

157
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,840
that looked like gloriously gorgeous angels,

158
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,700
which split open down the front to expose a thousand fantastic weapons of destruction.

159
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:52,300
The effete elite sent them through portals into the Warriors of the Wasteland future,

160
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,980
and the carnage was astonishing.

161
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,020
What the effete elite did not reckon with

162
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,420
was that carnage was meat and drink, milk and honey,

163
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,300
to the Warriors of the Wasteland.

164
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,980
To them, brutal savage warfare was a mere pastime.

165
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,060
The right of adulthood was simply to go out and murder someone

166
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,560
in the most startling way you could think of.

167
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,060
Torture was to them a form of humor,

168
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:26,100
and the most admired persons were those who could keep a victim barely alive

169
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,300
but in incredible pain for as long as possible.

170
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,660
In short, the effete elite didn't know what they were up against.

171
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,040
The Warriors of the Wasteland quickly learned to defeat the elite's magnificent death machines

172
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,400
and then to capture them.

173
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,300
They set their wise ones to work,

174
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,300
who wizened monkey-like folks with straggling gray locks and spectacles

175
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,000
that had a dozen interchangeable lenses of wonderful shapes and colors.

176
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,040
And before long, the warriors were rampaging down the broad avenues

177
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,300
of the effete elite's lovely dreamlike cities,

178
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,200
messing stuff up and making all sorts of noise.

179
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,880
They even killed people, lots of them, in the most insulting ways.

180
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,320
Then they created imaginative displays of the mangled remains

181
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,720
which offended every sense simultaneously.

182
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,140
Clearly, there was nothing to do but escalate.

183
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,280
The effete elite contacted other futures, tasteful and elegant futures,

184
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,820
and enlisted their aid in combating this scourge,

185
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,780
which was of their own making, by the way,

186
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,540
but somehow they failed to see that.

187
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,940
The warriors of the wasteland were ugly and stinky and noisy

188
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,260
and had shocking taste in everything.

189
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,160
But they were not stupid and they learned fast.

190
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,800
So it wasn't long before they too began allying themselves

191
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,000
with all manner of terrible monsters from other futures,

192
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,940
and it was all-out war everywhere.

193
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,900
The result of all this intertemporal and trans-dimensional warfare

194
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,180
was that nobody knew what might happen next

195
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,480
or what unbelievably violent monstrosity might instantaneously appear.

196
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,080
You might be about to dive into the swimming pool

197
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,340
when there before your eyes is an armored vampire whale

198
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,380
with rocket launchers on its back shooting the hell out of everything.

199
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,700
You might be pulling up to the fuel terminal

200
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,380
in your Frankenstein Megadeth super truck

201
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,680
when suddenly an army of beautiful wraiths

202
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,300
rises out of the ground to snatch you up

203
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,580
and shake you into a cloud of glittering dust

204
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,840
and your Frankenstein Megadeth super truck along with you.

205
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,860
It was chaos.

206
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,780
And not good chaos either.

207
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,080
It was terrible chaos.

208
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,600
Eventually things got so crazy that the shockwaves of chaos

209
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,560
passed far into the most distant future,

210
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,740
near the very end of time,

211
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,660
when all sentient beings had combined

212
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,480
into one group mind

213
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,480
which differed from our ideas of God

214
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,080
only in the fact that it had a beginning.

215
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,580
The end of time group consciousness wondered to itself

216
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,600
what in the world those ancient past people were up to.

217
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,380
It created a vehicle for a fragment of its awareness

218
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,580
and sent it way, way back to where all the ruckus was being raised,

219
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,280
said, tut-tut, this will never do,

220
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,820
and set about straightening things out.

221
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,620
In literally no time at all,

222
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,540
everyone was back in the future they came from

223
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,460
with the vague feeling that they were just about to do something,

224
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,380
or that something odd had happened that they could not quite recall.

225
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,620
The end of time group consciousness set up automatic controls

226
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,320
to prevent such a ridiculous thing from ever happening again,

227
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,500
and they shifted the most troublesome futures

228
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,600
to a more remote likelihood.

229
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,820
The most likely future now is the one you are in,

230
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,600
the one that's not extremely exciting

231
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,040
or full of monsters, magic, and destruction.

232
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,840
And that's why sometimes you might have a vague feeling

233
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,500
that you were just about to do something,

234
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:24,260
or that something odd had happened that you cannot quite recall.

235
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
It's to keep us from fighting.

236
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,120
The end.

237
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,220
Friends, that was written by the former subgenius,

238
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,340
formerly known as Orton Nenslow.

239
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,300
And this was published in the book

240
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,460
New Fairy Tales for Old Children

241
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,500
by Kenneth J. DeVries.

242
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,740
And you can find that on Kindle,

243
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,920
New Fairy Tales for Old Children,

244
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,580
published by the Cooke's Museum International University Press,

245
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,600
Kindle edition.

246
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,860
And now this.

247
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,740
So this is an experiment here, right, Dr. Howell?

248
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
That's right.

249
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:21,100
We're just producing a certain cultural signature of X-Day.

250
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,780
This has an interesting flavor.

251
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,560
Yes, one shouldn't easily...

252
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,260
Tastes kind of dreamy.

253
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,520
Just don't speak when...

254
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,540
Tastes kind of blue, too.

255
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,560
Just don't attempt to exhale.

256
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:35,820
Here it goes.

257
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,280
Just don't breathe out.

258
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,300
If it's blue, is that like blue raspberry?

259
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,800
Icy? Ever had one of those?

260
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,280
To get the raspberry is something we all have to risk.

261
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,520
Oh my gosh.

262
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,020
A blue raspberry, icy.

263
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,140
It's a thing that doesn't exist in nature at all.

264
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,020
Blue is...

265
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,640
Blue ain't the word for the way that I feel.

266
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,080
It's completely artificial.

267
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,340
Yes.

268
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,560
Concocted in a laboratory by crazy...

269
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,660
Flipped out...

270
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,800
By visionaries.

271
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,480
Well, some people say visionaries.

272
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,680
Like Dr. Niemann.

273
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,260
Dr. Niemann.

274
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,460
He was...

275
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,460
Smart maniacs.

276
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:14,680
Yes.

277
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,540
Yes, sure, smart maniacs.

278
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,840
But maniacs nonetheless.

279
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,680
Well, he had his axe to grind.

280
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,720
His murderous hunchback friend who did most of his dirty work for him.

281
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:34,840
Then there was Dr. Knox in London who used the services of Burke and Hare, the famous

282
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,040
resurrection men.

283
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:44,560
And they got in trouble, but Dr. Knox, being of the rich class, got away with everything.

284
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,680
What, Dr. Knox?

285
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,400
Did you say that?

286
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,800
Did I think I heard you say that?

287
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,660
Did what I heard...

288
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,260
Did you hear what I heard?

289
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:51,260


290
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:51,400
Yes, I heard what you said.

291
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,380
Yes, you heard it.

292
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:59,460
And I'm afraid there's no expunging the pellucid pages of history.

293
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,060
Now, you know, these lights are blinding us right now.

294
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,860
Yeah, the special effects is really hard to deal with, you know.

295
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,160
In a little while, when we walk out there, we're going to not be able to see anything.

296
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,600
We're just going to walk in the sides of buildings and cars.

297
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:12,900
It's like those...

298
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,980
No, no, it's okay.

299
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,560
It's all right.

300
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,380
That meteor shower in the beginning of the day of the...

301
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,340
I think I got a hat somewhere.

302
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,380
Everybody watches.

303
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,020
Yeah, a special hat.

304
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,200
You don't mean a poop dog hat.

305
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,160
Oh, there's your hat.

306
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,880
Okay, right.

307
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,200
No, it's not the poop dog hat.

308
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:30,980
Not this time.

309
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,840
But, of course...

310
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,900
I left that one at home.

311
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,040
...you're uniquely privileged to see this particular...

312
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,380
That poop's getting pretty old.

313
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,380
Yes, magical wizard poop's...

314
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,020
You know, it turns white after a while.

315
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:44,760
Uh-huh.

316
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,460
Like the scat of the seagulls.

317
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,060
Why does that happen?

318
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,300
Because...

319
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,360
I think it has more to do with the...

320
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,360


321
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,360


322
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,360


323
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,360


324
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,360


325
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,280
The dog food and the poop.

326
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,420
Aerial spirits tend to cast their leavings in the same fashion.

327
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,440
It's like ashes, exactly.

328
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,820
Like ashes.

329
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,840
Not only that, some people chew it for gum.

330
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,620
Some people who don't have gum.

331
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,540
No, we're talking about different ashes, Doctor.

332
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,800
We're talking about dog poop that turns white.

333
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,820
Oh, not dog poop.

334
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,500
No, nobody chews that for gum.

335
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,280
I wouldn't want to...

336
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,080
Other dogs do.

337
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,560
Well, they might.

338
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,060
But, when I say nobody...

339
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,640
They're a little bit...

340
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,340
They're a little bit complicated.

341
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,340


342
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,340


343
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,340


344
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,340


345
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,340


346
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,340


347
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,340


348
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,340


349
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,340


350
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,700
...aprophagic, you know?

351
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,400
You see, they are so...

352
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,740
A little bit.

353
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,140
...in love with the olfactory world...

354
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,660
Particularly...

355
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,380
...and the intensity of its sensations.

356
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,180
...you know, rabbits.

357
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,060
It's like little nuggets of candy for them.

358
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
There's that rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit.

359
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,760
And when I say them, I mean my dog.

360
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,000
My God's Bigger Than You.

361
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,960
Hoping it's like a more of a...

362
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,560
My God's Bigger Than You.

363
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,380
...worldwide thing, not a unique phenomenon.

364
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,020
But...

365
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,720
Worldwide.

366
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,140
He definitely likes them.

367
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,900
Then you're a Frankenstein death cat.

368
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,540
Loves them.

369
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:49,840
Dark side.

370
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,340
There's just like a...

371
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,340


372
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,340


373
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,340


374
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,340


375
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,700
...a snack.

376
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,740
Your liver and lights are...

377
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,360
He keeps walking across the yard.

378
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,560
...a kosher, a vulture, a sane doctor.

379
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,860
Scent hits his nose.

380
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,620
I know exactly the face he makes when he smelled bunny turds.

381
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,380
As he loops and larapes out over the countryside...

382
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,360
He gets excited, you know.

383
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,360
...howling, yowling, and drooling, the giant mastiff...

384
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,380
...it's like candy.

385
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,480
...murderously moves forward.

386
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,200
He has the huge, slavering mongrel who cannot be...

387
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,340
...mocked.

388
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,660
Stopped.

389
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,320
Yes, Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound.

390
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,360
And, uh, you never killed a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine.

391
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,520
Friend of mine.

392
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,340
Friend of mine.

393
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,000
And that was Dr. Howell, Dr. Philo Drummond from X Day.

394
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,340
And now, Reverend Philo Drummond.

395
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,760
We'll fight, see, Taj and Reverend Fanboy at X Day.

396
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,600
Thank you.

397
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,820
You just reminded me of a letter written to National Lampoon Magazine years ago.

398
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,480
Okay.

399
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:08,160
It said, the letter, the text of the letter said, and it's entirely, I'm here.

400
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,380
You can't see me, but I'm here.

401
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,760
Signed, a booger.

402
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,220
In the egg salad.

403
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,920
Burger King salad bar.

404
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,780
That was back when Burger King actually had a salad bar.

405
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,320
Remember when all those fast food joints actually had salad bars?

406
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:27,800
Oh, no.

407
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,660
Yes, I do.

408
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:37,220
And, uh, now I, in the very early part of stage of life, I put together salad bars for,

409
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,060
for a fast food, for Ponderosa restaurant, if you recall those.

410
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,120
And, uh, yeah, it's, they're not, um, great.

411
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,840
But if you're...

412
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,920
I'm trying to eat more vegetables now, because I'm trying to, I'm trying to be a smaller person.

413
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,680
And, um, you just have to give in at some point and eat the salad bar.

414
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,880
Not the whole salad bar.

415
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,520
I start at one end, and I just keep shoveling in until they either throw me out or salad bar's gone.

416
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,740
It's the cure for salad bars, is to just, uh, eat them until they're gone.

417
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,200
That's what she said.

418
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,400
Ha ha ha.

419
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,820
Thank you, Reverend Fanboy and fight, see, Taj from 21XL.

420
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,900
See you next day and now this.

421
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,740
Bob, stop.

422
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,960
Stop.

423
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,980
Oh, are you hurt?

424
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,040
Bob, Bob.

425
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,800
Finance.

426
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,780
You faker.

427
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,080
Steve, you know what this is, don't you?

428
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,500
It's a time space warp.

429
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,460
Sure, I know exactly what that is.

430
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,160
I don't suppose anybody really does.

431
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,740
We've seen some strange things tonight. Strange creatures that we know don't

432
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,980
belong on our planet. God only knows where they came from.

433
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:06,980
Jenny and Beth. The vortex took them. Just took them away.

434
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:18,000
Prophecy Heated is prophecy fulfilled. We all know that. But did you ever give half a moment

435
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,200
to consider what it would be like if Bob did things halfway? What if instead of laughing till

436
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:35,720
your guts bleed, you just had guts bleed? What if instead of having sex with a beautiful live girl

437
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,960
or anything else, you just had a beautiful live girl? What if instead of having sex with a beautiful

438
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:36,960


439
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:44,240
dead girl or anything else, you got a dead girl? What if instead of having sex with a beautiful

440
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,940
live girl or anything else, you got a dead girl? What if instead of the subgenius must have slack,

441
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:56,900
the subgenius must want, must thirst, and have no slack? You see, it would be a sad day if Bob

442
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:04,820
was a man of half measures. If he just ate the hamburger. If he gave you pills that were not

443
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,940
necessarily them-kind.

444
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,260
Salvation, 50 cents or 1.5 times your money back?

445
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,700
That's crazy talk.

446
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,820
You don't get a say-so in how Bob does things, and you can thank your lucky stars for that.

447
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,300
But you do get a vote in how you do things.

448
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,000
The only vote.

449
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,240
You can tyrannize yourself, bully yourself to happiness.

450
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,820
Don't let yourself boss yourself around.

451
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,980
Grab yourself by the short hairs and pull.

452
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,920
You can and may be the last subgenius on Mars.

453
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,500
Better start acting like it.

454
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,260
No half measures.

455
00:26:50,560 --> 00:27:01,200
And friends, that sermon of half measures was written by Uncle Dr. Onan Canobite.

456
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,100
See Onan Canobite.

457
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,560
And oh, foe.

458
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,280
I can't remember.

459
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,300
I don't think I ever bought any single.

460
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:19,680
I think some singles were given to me as gifts when I was much younger, but I don't remember what they were.

461
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,780
I was such a nerdy kid.

462
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:30,260
The first single I ever bought was Monster Mash, which came out when I was about 10.

463
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,740
And I was thrilled.

464
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,760
And then my brother stepped on the record.

465
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,160
I'll never forget.

466
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,000
But I think the next one I bought was probably a movie soundtrack.

467
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,680
I was such a nerd.

468
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,220
I didn't.

469
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,620
I had no interest in the Beatles or any of that nonsense.

470
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,140
I was strictly into movie soundtrack music.

471
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:01,140
James Bond movies and the early Sergio Leone stuff.

472
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,220
Marconi soundtracks for those spaghetti westerns.

473
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,580
That's pretty damn nerdy.

474
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,540
You know, the Beatles have just appeared and you don't even know who they are.

475
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,960
Yeah, it's pretty nerdy.

476
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,840
Well, I remember I was in fifth grade the night the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan's show.

477
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,020
And the next day, all the kids are going, oh, my God.

478
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,940
Well, nobody said, oh, my God.

479
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,700
They said.

480
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,120
Did you?

481
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,120


482
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,200
Did you see the Beatles?

483
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,640
And I was like, oh, what?

484
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,320
Bugs?

485
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,860
I don't understand.

486
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,080
God, don't you know anything?

487
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,600
Yeah.

488
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,040
No.

489
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,200
Well, yeah, I knew the names of all 20 known dinosaurs.

490
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,380
That's that's that's hard for people of my generation to imagine as having been revolutionary.

491
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,920
You know what they were doing in 1964 seems so tame by today.

492
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,360
These standards.

493
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:02,920
They're hot.

494
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,540
Sure.

495
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,740
Really used to not have sad inside new anything you understand that they do and on a basic

496
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,200
how fast things change, you know,

497
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,260
Things really didn't change very much for for thousands of years.

498
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,800
You know, a thousand years ago, you'd have a kid saying, hey, grandpa, what were things

499
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,120
like when you were my age?

500
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,180
And your grandpa is a pretty much like they are now.

501
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,880
If you, Grandpa even was still alive.

502
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,640
And then the industrial revolution happened and things start changing.

503
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:30,900
It was from Εύαυ permit.

504
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:30,900


505
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:30,900


506
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:30,900


507
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:30,900


508
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:30,900


509
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:30,900


510
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,000
faster and faster. And the rate

511
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,660
of acceleration

512
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,420
of social change

513
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,900
in and of itself is

514
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,520
accelerating, you know?

515
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,040
To the point where...

516
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,940
Then it'll all grind to a halt when the human race

517
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,840
manages to extinctify

518
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,020
itself by wrecking the entire

519
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,120
environment. Yeah, that's a very real possibility.

520
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,120
But we don't know for sure how that's going to work

521
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,000
out. But even... It's not going to be

522
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,740
just like an overnight, everyone's already...

523
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,920
Everyone's suddenly dead. That's not how it's going to work.

524
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,840
It's going to be a thousand years of horror.

525
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,860
Yeah, you know, maybe that's

526
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,520
a thousand years of tribulations.

527
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,080
That might be one thing the authors of the Bible got right.

528
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,980
But you just think about, like,

529
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,900
if you take a hundred-year-old person today

530
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,460
and

531
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,040
ask them about how

532
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,560
they've seen things change over their life,

533
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,420
they probably don't even recognize

534
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,240
the world they live in today.

535
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,940
Oh, yeah, I mean...

536
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,540
And me! Me! Like, I'm not

537
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,560
even 40 yet, and I barely recognize

538
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,960
the world I grew up in anymore.

539
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:29,680
And...

540
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,960
Holy crap, like, you know...

541
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,620
You know, if I live to be a hundred, or

542
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,580
if, you know, somebody

543
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,320
who's a teenager today lives to be a hundred,

544
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,600
and

545
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,780
things keep changing faster and faster and faster,

546
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,040
like, who wants to live forever?

547
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,280
You're going to be living in an alien world.

548
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,600
Maybe some people might be turned down by that idea.

549
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,580
You know, who

550
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,580
needs intergalactic or interstellar

551
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,260
or interplanetary travel when

552
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,500
you just

553
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,640
wait long enough and you'll be living in an alien world?

554
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,020
The faster things keep changing.

555
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,740
Well, if they ever got cryonics

556
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,720
down well enough,

557
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,660
that would be kind of a kick

558
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,820
if you were trusting enough to believe that

559
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,760
the cryonics company

560
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,720
would always keep

561
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,900
their generators running.

562
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,600
You know what else is a funny thing to me? The history

563
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,580
of futurism.

564
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,320
Oh, God. What is that?

565
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,560
It's sad. It's a real sad history

566
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,520
because the futurists never get it right.

567
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,520
They always miss

568
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,660
really important stuff like the internet.

569
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,640
Yeah, well, you know, it's, yeah, I mean,

570
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,020
every time, you know, you see

571
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,760
depictions of the, either

572
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,880
like, you know, the distant future or the not-too-distant

573
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,840
future, it's always

574
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,860
a reflection of what the people at the time were

575
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,880
thinking when they wrote it.

576
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,800
And then you have the phenomenon of

577
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,660
retrofuturism. That's one of my favorites.

578
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,620
You know?

579
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,040
For example,

580
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,260
the phenomena of

581
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,960
steampunk or dieselpunk.

582
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,820
Uh-huh.

583
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,900
Or, uh,

584
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,460
you know, the ray gun futurism.

585
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:04,940
Well,

586
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,840
what's always really fun is

587
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,880
to watch a movie, a movie that

588
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,720
was made 50 years ago that takes

589
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,980
place this year.

590
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,900
Or a movie made 30 years

591
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,000
ago that took place three years

592
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,240
ago.

593
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah, they, uh, on the other hand,

594
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,760
there is a science fiction

595
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,920
book called Stand on

596
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,760
Zanzibar that was written in the

597
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,280
60s that

598
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,920
takes place

599
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,140
you know, in

600
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,580
roughly around this time

601
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,660
of this century. And it's

602
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,460
the most accurate when it's like

603
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,360
reading a newspaper.

604
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,640
And I read that, when I read the book

605
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,520
when it came out, it's written by

606
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,560
John Bruner. I think it got a

607
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:46,820
Hugo.

608
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,540
I remember

609
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,380
thinking, this is such a

610
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,580
nightmarish world, but the people that live

611
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,080
in it will just think it's normal.

612
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,120
And I live in it.

613
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:58,560
Now,

614
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,960
I'm afraid it is normal.

615
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,780
You know, I'll never...

616
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,100
And it's all on a

617
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,180
pretty tenuous basis because if

618
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,940
the ocean goes

619
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,740
bad, everything's going to follow.

620
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,000
Yep.

621
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,160
You know... I mean, like 90% of all

622
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,500
life on the planet is in the oceans.

623
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,320
Right. And...

624
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,260
People think about, oh, we need to save the trees

625
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,100
for us to have oxygen. But no,

626
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,260
actually, most of the oxygen is coming from the oceans.

627
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,040
Yeah, yeah. I don't... Most people

628
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,020
don't understand how precarious that

629
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,080
situation is.

630
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,900
It's the plankton, you know,

631
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,500
the microscopic

632
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,100
life that's the most vulnerable.

633
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,000
And when you take out the very

634
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,780
lowest level of the food chain,

635
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,420
it

636
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,640
snowballs backwards,

637
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,040
you know. Yeah, you know, there's going to be

638
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,860
some kind of forced adaptive change

639
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,880
in a lot of those microbes, but

640
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,020
you know, we don't know what that's

641
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,960
going to do to their overall biochemistry,

642
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,460
the ones that are still able to survive.

643
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,500
We don't know what kind of

644
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,900
downstream effects

645
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,920
that those changes in their biology are going to have

646
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,120
on the rest of the planet. So it's

647
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,620
going to be weird.

648
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,900
It's going to be a bummer, man.

649
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,820
Yeah, the climate stuff

650
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,180
is already out of control.

651
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,320
That's not going to get

652
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,240
better.

653
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,120
In any foreseeable

654
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,560
future, I can see

655
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,600
as long as we keep

656
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,140
making so many people

657
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,580
and they keep being such greedy

658
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,280
bastards.

659
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,160
Me included.

660
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,500
I'm still driving a car.

661
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,480
I'm not riding bicycles and storing

662
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,360
that. Well, the society

663
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,260
we live in is

664
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,360
it's almost like

665
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,480
I don't know,

666
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,020
you know, 50 years ago you had the choice

667
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,480
of either having high

668
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,660
population density

669
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,160
and great efficiency,

670
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,640
in energy

671
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,220
distribution

672
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,600
or like,

673
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,620
you know, sparse population density

674
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,580
and

675
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,600
extremely low efficiency and energy

676
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
distribution. Like that's kind of like the

677
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,000
difference between America and Europe

678
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,580
or like

679
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,260
America and Japan, you know.

680
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,320
But

681
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,180
you know,

682
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,640
as new

683
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,460
technologies emerge to

684
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,280
harness energy,

685
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,140
this could completely change the equations,

686
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,720
but it might be a little too late.

687
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,440
I mean, there's so much that's been done already

688
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,980
that it's going to cause feedback loops

689
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,620
for hundreds of years to come.

690
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,820
Yeah.

691
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,240
Yeah.

692
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,000
And that stuff's really unpredictable.

693
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,680
Yeah.

694
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,720
Because I live in a land that's very rich in fossils,

695
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,420
I've learned,

696
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,240
and it's mostly sea fossils.

697
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,540
Yeah.

698
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:57,540


699
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:57,540


700
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:57,540


701
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:57,540


702
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:57,540


703
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,400
Mostly under,

704
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,260
from shallow oceans.

705
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,940
I've learned a lot more about

706
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,560
extinction.

707
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,640
Extinction.

708
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,540
Extinction.

709
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,560
Thank you, Dr. Sinister,

710
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,680
for continuing to do your show

711
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,320
Radio Sinesthesia

712
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,220
on WCSB.

713
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,740
And now this.

714
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,000
теlegram.com.

715
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,000


716
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,660
Thank you, puesto.

717
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:53,060
I won't look bad tonight.

718
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,060
Thank you.

719
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,040
Thank you.

720
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,840
Thank you.

721
00:37:59,420 --> 00:37:59,480
Thank you.

722
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,840
Thank you.

723
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,500
And that was the Psychoskeletons.

724
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,180
Once again, a little ditty called Popular Tight Squeeze.

725
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:44,020
Quite frankly, when people say politics, I reach for my Dobbs head.

726
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,920
He was insane.

727
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:53,160
He has a weird, crazy look on his face, much like Bob Dobbs and Chief Wahoo.

728
00:38:53,160 --> 00:39:00,760
I was just about to mention Bob Dobbs as having his origins in something completely unlikely.

729
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:07,440
Well, I mean, he was born in the Midwest, but I can't tell you which state.

730
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,600
It's not Texas.

731
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,280
But the actual icon that we're all familiar with.

732
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,420
Well, you know, we found a predecessor to it.

733
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,260
It's a photograph.

734
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,980
The classic Dobbs head with the dot pattern that we used.

735
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,440
Originally, the original image is only about an inch high.

736
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,900
It's small.

737
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,220
It was in Yellow Page's clip art book.

738
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:44,420
And Philo and I both saw it at the same time flipping through this book, and we just knew that was it.

739
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:44,780
That was it.

740
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,260
But subsequently, about five years ago, somebody found it in an old...

741
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:55,020
A couple of different old newspapers from a small Virginia town.

742
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:01,280
They found ads that had the photograph that that clip art was made from.

743
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,600
And it's creepy as hell.

744
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:08,260
You can superimpose them, and people have done this.

745
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,980
And everything winds up exactly.

746
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,760
There's the white rim around the pipe, the glimmer in his hair.

747
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,720
The big difference is he looks older in the photograph.

748
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,620
And his face looks fuller.

749
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:25,000
And he looks like a normal human being.

750
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,680
If this is the original Bob Dobbs, you mean to say...

751
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,100
Somehow in the idealized version, he looks more than human.

752
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:35,880
If this is the original image of Bob Dobbs, are you sure it was from Virginia and not, say, Canada?

753
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,700
No.

754
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,620
And are you sure he didn't have five bodies?

755
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,440
Right, exactly.

756
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:49,420
No, the only place we've seen any sign of it were these two different...

757
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,700
No.

758
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:49,700


759
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:49,700


760
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:49,700


761
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:49,700


762
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:49,700


763
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:49,700


764
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:49,700


765
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:49,700


766
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,480
Newspaper ads.

767
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,900
And they were ads for...

768
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:57,080
I think one was for a barber shop, and one was for a pipe tobacco store.

769
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,020
Friends, I gotta tell you, there's nothing better than waking up in the morning.

770
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,020
And first thing, look at that smiling face.

771
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,160
Check out that pipe.

772
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,440
Yes, I'm talking about the face of Bob.

773
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,400
Look at that first thing, and you're set for the day.

774
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,220
And you know, friends, a little Dobbs will do you.

775
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,100
Yeah.

776
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,220
Hi, uh, how's it going, Dr. Brujaha?

777
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,700
Overlord Animal! What a surprise!

778
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:34,140
Yeah, hey, I'm just out here in the wild. I've been adventuring, foraging, if you will.

779
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,820
Me too, I just went to the, uh...

780
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:45,520
Uh, the Far East Asian Trading Company and Bazaar.

781
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,080
I too went to the dollar store!

782
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,640
Yes, the dollar!

783
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,180
The dollar store!

784
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,100
The gems of the Orient prevail!

785
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,100
I, um...

786
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,760
I found some things today, and they're so amazing.

787
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:08,220
I got this thing, it's like the head of a bear, and you stick it onto a thing, and then it spits out mist.

788
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,040
Like the kind that you see on the movie Pet Cemetery.

789
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,540
Like fog.

790
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,100
But it's supposed to be able to help you breathe.

791
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,880
So I think it zombifies.

792
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,460
Bears.

793
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,740
It's a bear zombifier.

794
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,700
I think so, I think so.

795
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,500
It makes my sinuses just open right up and ready for bears.

796
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,220
I got a frozen poop maker.

797
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,820
Oh my gosh, you do!

798
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,100
That's, uh, that is gonna be lumpy.

799
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,460
Makes little lumpy logs.

800
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,400
That's, uh...

801
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,940
I think they're supposed to be cartoon worms, but, you know...

802
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,620
Yeah, as opposed to the real worms.

803
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,400
Yeah.

804
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,800
Because you can't get worms in the store.

805
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,700
You can't put them in your...

806
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,800
You can't put them in your freezer either to make frozen...

807
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,300
I mean, you could...

808
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:52,920
Well, never mind.

809
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,660
You totally could.

810
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,760
I could probably buy a tapeworm at one of those places.

811
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:58,420
Tape...

812
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:58,960
Do...

813
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,420
Does tapeworm segments work in frozen drinks?

814
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,900
I don't know!

815
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,060
No, you use it as a stick, a stir stick.

816
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:05,460
Oh!

817
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,900
You freeze them, and it's like the tapeworm is a great stir stick and appetizer all in one.

818
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,620
A flatworm stir stick.

819
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,440
Like a pretzel rod, but...

820
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,520
But doesn't disintegrate in your drink.

821
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,680
But will make you just want to consume worms.

822
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,100
More and more.

823
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,680
It's much like American television.

824
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:23,800
Yeah.

825
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,260
It's...

826
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,760
Now available as seen on TV.

827
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,260
Tapeworms!

828
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,920
Tapeworm stir stick stir!

829
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,440
Oh!

830
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,940
Oh, my goodness!

831
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,280
Oh, but there was, uh...

832
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,400
There were, uh, these things that I got.

833
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,640
Most people use them, uh, for, uh, cleaning dishes.

834
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,880
I give...

835
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,760
My cats take them as toys, though.

836
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,940
It's like these cute little sponges in various shapes.

837
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:46,840
Oh, yeah.

838
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,700
And all.

839
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,540
And also, uh...

840
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,160
What was the...

841
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,180
Oh, and I just wanted to clarify those.

842
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,680
The tapeworms, they're 8-track.

843
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,340
They're not cassette.

844
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,440
Mm-hmm.

845
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,420
It does...

846
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,020
They're, like, not the small cartridges that you would...

847
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,160
Yeah.

848
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,700
Eight cassette tapeworms.

849
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,620
It is an 8-track...

850
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,740
8-track tapeworm.

851
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,720
8-track tapeworm.

852
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,620
Yeah.

853
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:08,320
Gotcha.

854
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,960
Very, very, very specifically.

855
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,020
Yeah.

856
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,980
This is a...

857
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,020
Like the wide flat noodles.

858
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:18,620
I got the, uh, narrow mouth spell bottle, uh, strainer.

859
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,680
That's what this is.

860
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,160
It's part of your, your, uh, magical drip system.

861
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,840
Yeah, for when I need to make extractions and whatnot.

862
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,100
And infusions.

863
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,640
Oh, gosh, Dr. Bruja.

864
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,440
I, I wish you could make an infusion for me.

865
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,480
I, uh...

866
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah?

867
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,280
Well, to, to not have to need to go to this magic...

868
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,560
To, to, to this fantastic place to get all these acqui...

869
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,320
To do acquisitions, like, once every season.

870
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,820
I'd rather not.

871
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,100
I'd rather just have them, like, show up on my doorstep.

872
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:55,520
Yeah, but then you'd have to use those companies that make that one guy really rich and kill whales.

873
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,800
Doesn't every company, like, sacrifice a whale if they want to be good at business, though?

874
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,260
Um...

875
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,680
I thought that was, like, part of the deal.

876
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,440
Like, that's what the Illuminati, like, script says.

877
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,600
Like, you want to be rich in business, you've got to kill a whale!

878
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,980
Well, I mean, if it involves, you know, shipping con...

879
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,180
Container ships.

880
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,560
Yeah.

881
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,460
Full of shipping containers.

882
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,400
Oh!

883
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,200
I...

884
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,660
Going across their hunting grounds.

885
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,440
Then, yes.

886
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,840
Yes, it does.

887
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,340
I got those snack boxes.

888
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,680
A set of snack boxes with, with family snack...

889
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:34,900
So, it starts with the dad-sized snack box, and the next is the mom-sized snack box,

890
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,740
and the next is the older child...

891
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,980
I'm going to say it was a girl, possibly.

892
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,420
A bob-tailed...

893
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,140
A bob-headed...

894
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,100
A bob-tailed...

895
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:45,740
Yeah, there was no...

896
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,580
You couldn't see the tail.

897
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,260
It was bobbed.

898
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,660
But the bob haircut as well.

899
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,320
Yeah.

900
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,240
Um, and then there was the small mutant.

901
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,440
And I'm not even sure if it was a child.

902
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:03,280
It might have just been a very, like, a demure, diminutive, like, an adult that wasn't fully hatched.

903
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,320
Was it...

904
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,040
Well, that's kind of what children are, aren't they?

905
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,100
They're, like, half-hatched adults.

906
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:09,900
I guess.

907
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:10,660
I don't...

908
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,240
I don't know.

909
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:11,740
I just...

910
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:16,520
I thought, like, you know, kids make a lot of noise, and this box wasn't making any noise at all.

911
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,280
So, I was just like, you know, maybe this is just a small...

912
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:19,880
A little adult.

913
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,280
It could be.

914
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,420
A very small adult.

915
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,000
You know.

916
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,460
And not even...

917
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:33,680
Not even necessarily an endodorf, or a dwarf, or a midget, or any of those particular size terms.

918
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,380
But possibly just someone from South America.

919
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:45,440
Like, in Peru, they're quite not as tall as a lot of people here in this part of North America.

920
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,080
That's only because they starve for their childhood.

921
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:48,960
Cool!

922
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:49,480
Okay!

923
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,980
So, I could, like, just not feed kids, and they'll stay tiny?

924
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:53,540
Yeah.

925
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:53,960
Forever?

926
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,160
Yeah, that's the reason why I'm...

927
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,600
Oh, my...

928
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,600
Wait, forever, ever?

929
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,580
I mean, you know, they'll stay tiny-ish.

930
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:58,840
I mean...

931
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,780
I bet if we, like, put a Mount Vesuvius kind of action on it, they would stay tiny forever.

932
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:04,720
Yes.

933
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,380
Definitely.

934
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,680
If you pom-paid them, they would never get any bigger.

935
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,420
You know, I was going to say, my grandparents, they all starved during, like, the wars and stuff.

936
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,380
So, they're...

937
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,760
They never got to be above 5'4".

938
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,820
Like, they're, like...

939
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,660
So, what's your excuse?

940
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,400
Uh, just...

941
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,180
Bad genes.

942
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,700
I just carry the starvation gene!

943
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,700
It's just...

944
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:27,920
Yeah.

945
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,100
Well, you know, it's...

946
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,320
Well, like I say, it's...

947
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,240
Oh, they hear that rumble?

948
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,400
Half-hobbit.

949
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,940
Yeah, they're rumbling with the glacier moving by.

950
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:35,920
Oh, jeez.

951
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,940
Is the glacier calving again?

952
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,980
I think so.

953
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:39,660
No.

954
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,180
I think so.

955
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:40,800
Just don't...

956
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,480
Don't yodel.

957
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,380
Yeah.

958
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,080
That tends to create an avalanche effect.

959
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,040
It's...

960
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,600
You know, it really gets going sometimes when the...

961
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:49,660
Yeah.

962
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:49,660


963
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:49,660


964
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:49,660


965
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:49,660


966
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:49,660


967
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:49,660


968
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:49,660


969
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:49,660


970
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,600
...sun shines on it, where the...

971
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:59,320
It really starts calving, and, like, it groans and screeches and grinds and makes all kinds of crazy noises.

972
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,260
So, that's not just the cat on the outside of your glacier box?

973
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,960
The cat that's hungry and wants some kibble?

974
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:06,420
Yeah.

975
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,900
The cat is plotting to murder us all.

976
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,020
I, uh...

977
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,480
I'm sorry.

978
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,760
Your cat's nice.

979
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,720
I keep forgetting.

980
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
Not everybody has a murder cat.

981
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,420
Yeah.

982
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,660
She's too old and tired to be a murderer.

983
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,400
She's too old and tired to be a murder cat anymore.

984
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:21,520
Some days.

985
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,520
She used to be, but she's retired from murder catting.

986
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,280
Murder catting.

987
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,040
Murder catting.

988
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,780
Murder catting.

989
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,500
Murder catting.

990
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:37,220
Thanks to Reverend Anna Mall and Dr. Brouhaha, the subgenius uberwomen of Austin, who just

991
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,620
sit down and whip out a tape now and then.

992
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,740
And now, this.

993
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:05,120
Just a little while ago, I packed up all my stuff to go to a little campsite with chilly

994
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:13,880
nights, kind of like the Bohemian Grove, to listen to some acts, some more fictional than

995
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,940
facts, and to take a ride that was long denied.

996
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,580
But my hopes were up.

997
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,820
All but shattered.

998
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:29,420
Standing in the lurch with my church and Ivan Stank said they'd pass us by, and who

999
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,260
knows why.

1000
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,780
At least it isn't raining.

1001
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,760
Packed my stuff into my ride.

1002
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,700
Been saying my goodbyes.

1003
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,900
Go home again.

1004
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,820
Naturally.

1005
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,520
To think that at 98.

1006
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:49,440
Oh, my God.

1007
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:50,900
And it still is gray.

1008
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,320
And subgenii kept with bated breath a vigil of hope and hate.

1009
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:03,160
For a heap of pleasure ships, on which they take a trip.

1010
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:09,860
And by the by, as a last goodbye, blow the earth to little pieces.

1011
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,160
Leaving for the stars and a secret destination.

1012
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,360
And though the countdown came and went.

1013
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,740
No permanent vacation ever came to pass.

1014
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,760
Never that unless.

1015
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,900
Go home again.

1016
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,000
Naturally.

1017
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:44,920
Subgenius forces will abandon planet earth for lives of leisure and endless pleasure.

1018
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,680
Why won't we screw?

1019
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,840
Why won't we screw?

1020
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,720
Big will송.

1021
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,540
Com inmates plus grand Otisinga max.

1022
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,340
Dont' forget the tastius and�

1023
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:19,340


1024
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:25,900
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

1025
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,280
Oh, that's a big shot.

1026
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,500
Oh, that's real nice.

1027
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:39,280
And home again, naturally

1028
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,560
Now looking back over the years

1029
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,420
When I saw so many views

1030
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,260
I remember I said when I joined the rest

1031
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,680
That I'd look till they got here

1032
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,700
Then at 45 years old

1033
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,600
When my brain began to mold

1034
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,460
I could understand why the only man

1035
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,540
Who I guaranteed salvation

1036
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,880
For just 20 bucks

1037
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,780
Said he'd let Goldbeard's around

1038
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,780
Ships down here I am with wretched hands

1039
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,880
And when sooner it'd be finished

1040
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,340
Then I'd run some guests

1041
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,280
Take off for penitence

1042
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,320
And home at last, naturally

1043
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:35,160
We're home at last, naturally

1044
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,440
And home at last, naturally

1045
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,680
When I saw so many views

1046
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,260
I'd look till they got here

1047
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,000
Then at 45 years old

1048
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,580
I'd look till they got here

1049
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,420
And home at last, naturally

1050
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:00,420


1051
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:00,420


1052
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,860
I'll find a home for me

1053
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:07,940
And you'll find me

1054
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:15,760
What a good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good

1055
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:23,400
shrink-wrapped product, which is to say, quote, political outsiders are preferable to career

1056
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:30,280
politicians. This is akin to saying you'd like to have a house painter handle your taxes and

1057
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:37,340
your investments because, by gosh, that bastard can paint like a champ. I don't think you were

1058
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:42,900
paying attention, hence the yelling. Or maybe you're one of those other bastards who won't

1059
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:50,320
shut up about, oh, the medical benefits of eating kale or maybe huffing lavender oil.

1060
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:57,440
I have news for you. People have been using lavender oil in whorehouses since the 1500s

1061
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:03,480
and nobody got any healthier. Yes, I know that big pharma are a pack of bandits,

1062
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:11,220
but that fact doesn't invalidate biochemistry. This may all sound like mansplaining,

1063
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,880
only most of the bad guys don't.

1064
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,300
Biochemists I know happen to be women and also the fact that the universe is

1065
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:24,380
binary as hell, often fatally so. I don't mean it's gendered binary. That's goofy.

1066
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:33,280
The universe has no gender, but it is binary. It is yes and it is no. No, kale will not make

1067
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:41,500
your lymphoma go away. No, lavender oil will not cure you of allergies. No, chlorine and fluoride

1068
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,880
properly injected into your body. No, it will not cure you of allergies. No, chlorine and fluoride

1069
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:42,880


1070
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,540
will not cure you of any kind. No, chlorine and fluoride will not cure you of any kind. No,

1071
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:44,540


1072
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:53,180
will not hurt you, but yes, drinking raw water will fuck your shit sideways. No, vaccines will

1073
00:54:53,180 --> 00:55:04,940
not give you the autism. Yes, chemtrails are just condensation. It pains me that I have to explain

1074
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:10,920
this to a population that used to be space-faring not so long ago.

1075
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:21,660
I shouldn't also have to explain that magic, not stage magic, mind you, but actual magic, doesn't work.

1076
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,340
Friday the 13th is just another day.

1077
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,420
Mercury in retrograde means nothing at all.

1078
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:36,860
There is no undocumented person's crisis, and there never really was one,

1079
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:42,760
nor was there a credible terrorist threat after noon of September 11th, 2001.

1080
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:52,860
You are told that all these things are true by people who have a vested interest in having you believe anything other than actual reality.

1081
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,760
Sometimes not directly.

1082
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:05,540
You may have, in fact, been told that huffing essential oils is a thing by some other hippie,

1083
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,640
but,

1084
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,720
that hippie heard it from somebody else.

1085
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:16,640
Gwyneth Paltrow, maybe, for obvious reasons, or maybe the Koch brothers for totally different reasons, or maybe,

1086
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,540
probably, both.

1087
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:27,060
The reason this sort of crap is easy to sell to otherwise intelligent people is that it rewards the receiver in three ways.

1088
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:35,860
One, they get to know more than you and tell you what, without all the bother of going to medical school.

1089
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:44,440
Two, they get to feel like an insider, like one of the cool people, the privileged few that know the real truth.

1090
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:50,300
More to the point, they can congregate and get validation off of each other.

1091
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:59,140
Number three, they can sneer at the mundanes who still believe in penicillin and other actual functional things.

1092
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,180
This is why I hate you.

1093
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,840
This is why I should be allowed to walk around with you.

1094
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:10,600
This is why I should be allowed to walk around with a two-foot dildo with reality written on it, thumping hipsters.

1095
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:23,400
Yeah, beaten to death with a dildo sounds awful, when the police have to explain what happened to precious Dakota or Scout or whatever Gen X named their kids,

1096
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,340
but there really isn't any choice.

1097
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,400
When looked at from altitude, it's clearly self-defense.

1098
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,820
I mean, just look at you, people.

1099
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:35,820


1100
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:35,820


1101
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:35,820


1102
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:35,820


1103
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:49,280
And friends, that was a rant by the good Reverend Roger called, that's not how any of this works.

1104
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,880
Thank you, good Reverend Roger.

1105
00:57:54,680 --> 00:58:00,980
And thank you, dear listeners, for putting up with this hour of slack.

1106
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,380
Praise Bob.

1107
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,820
If you need more information about the Church of the Settlement, please contact me at the address on the screen.

1108
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:13,500
You can visit subgenius.com once this comes, or individual contributors, you can look at subgenius.com.

1109
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,220
There's a radio section at the top.

1110
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:25,660
It has a radio page that leads to logs and text of everything that's on the show.

1111
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:35,800
And it also has downloadable MP3 copies of well over a thousand previous episodes.

1112
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:41,900
hours of Slack. I think pretty soon we're probably going to have literally all of the

1113
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:52,780
hours of Slack available for download, free for a limited time. Because friends, we are thinking of

1114
00:58:52,780 --> 00:59:00,540
starting to charge for hour of Slack downloads. A buck a show? Five bucks a show? I don't know.

1115
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:09,820
We'll see. We'll see how that works. Because we don't really make money off of this radio show.

1116
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:18,080
It's free advertising on several wonderful public supported and independent radio stations.

1117
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:29,700
But it doesn't support us. You can help. If you look at subgenius.com, the homepage and the radio

1118
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:30,140
page.

1119
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:39,760
Both have little buttons that lead to donations. Yes, you can donate. You can have it set up an

1120
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:49,380
automatic monthly donation. One buck a month. 500 bucks a month. 500 bucks a day. A penny a day.

1121
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:56,820
Well, actually, you probably can't do that. But yeah, subgenius.com if you really want to help.

1122
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:03,560
Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise Bob.

1123
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:11,660
Okay, friends on the internet, where I can flog or swag legally. If you want to help yourself

1124
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:18,680
and the Church of the Subgenius and get a pretty cool package with like 25 different nifty things

1125
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:25,940
in it, like pins and bumper stickers and a real preacher card, you need to go to subgenius.com

1126
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,540
and click to become a minister.

1127
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:30,680
And if you want to get involved, you just need to go to the Subgenius.com website and click on

1128
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:30,680


1129
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,540
And as I said in the beginning, you get to see photos and a list of all the stuff you get.

1130
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:39,940
And you really do get to go to the Scrub Genius Forum, which is members only and where we talk in

1131
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,000
ways that people don't talk on Facebook.

1132
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,700
Much, much smarter ways, ironically enough. Isn't that funny?

1133
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:52,320
We also have things like T-shirts and damn near everything you can think of with Bob's face on it.

1134
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,460
That and a huge selection of other subgenius graphics.

1135
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:04,440
And we sell several very weird DVDs and CDs of the Bob songs and old MP3 stashes of this show.

1136
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:12,860
And best of all, from our main online store, you can buy the Book of the Subgenius, which is by far the greatest thing we've ever done.

1137
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,260
It's an actual Simon & Schuster book, 22 bucks, in print for over 30 years.

1138
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:22,520
And every copy that we send out is signed by yours truly.

1139
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:27,360
For that matter, your address on the puffy envelope is handwritten by me also.

1140
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,740
Keep my fingers nimble.

1141
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,720
That's subgenius.com.

1142
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,880
And remember, it's only money.
