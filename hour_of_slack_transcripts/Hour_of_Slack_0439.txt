I wish I knew about any of them
That song we just played was by our good friend Joe Newman
Last week we played a rough mix from his new album
Which is called Enhanced Florence Henderson
And that by the way is by Rudy Schwartz Project
Is the name you'd see on the cassette tapes or the CD
There is a CD that's hard to find
It's all Joe Newman pretty much though
And we also said last week that we never would devote a whole show to one album or one artist
But this week we're going to play basically the entire rest of that
And we're going to play a whole show of Joe Newman

Not quite yet to be released Joe Newman album
And I'll be giving the address to write for information on Rudy Schwartz Project
Joe Newman
Nearer to the end of the broadcast
There was one song on this album that I want to play first
Because it is, oh the timing was so perfect
Last week on the poor little Dallas Cowboy
Fence
The fans here in Dallas got their little hearts broken
The coach is gone
And the owner is drunk
And everybody's so sad
Well you can imagine the glee that we felt when we heard this upcoming
Lovely piece of music
And the timing of it arriving when it did
Obviously planned by Bob
The first few minutes of this Rudy Schwartz Project song
By the way are edited
Like the last song I had to play
There's just a couple of places on the album
I had to run them to tape
And replace the bad words with the good word of Bob
And but then we'll switch back to the master D.A.T. dump
Oh by the way following this amazing song
Will be Joe's touching eulogy to the great Frank Zappa
Oh and by the way I'm going to play a little bit of this
Uh huh
Right now I'm waving to Jenny


Oh oh yeah

Who raised up brain squelchy, made it glisten with pink,

The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.
Lift a conlandry, won't you come out tonight?
With your cowboys in need and sweet Jesus inside.
Crumpish on pickup trucks, who could it be?
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.
Who dance around naked with long dangling meat?
Down at the schoolyard, let the girls get a peek.
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.
Who says he's sorry for what he's done?
For playing pre-birded and flashing his buns?
He's a good ball player.
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.
Could Roger Stavart be the governor's aide?
Illegal abortions and white bread to eat?
Ask any Cretan you happen to see.

You know, and of course we sell bonds also.
I walked up to a person one afternoon and I said, what's your name?
And they said, Jonathan Joseph Jeremiah, Timothy Titus Obadiah,
William Henry Walter Simm, Reuben Rufus Solomon Jim,
Nathaniel Daniel Abraham, Walter Peter Frederick Simm,
Simon Timon, Nicholas Pat, Christopher Dick Jehoshaphat,
Chita Jose Gonzalez, Bustamante Rafferty.
And I said, that's a nice name.
I never heard it again until you told me the name of your church.
And I can relate to that now.
Now, Dave, I appreciate your calling.
And do call me when the show's over.
I'd like to talk to you a little more.
Oh, yes, friends.
And we appreciate Radio Jihad.
And I'll give their address.
They put these tapes out.
It's actually Brother Russell Ministries tape called Radio Jihad.

You know, there's a lot of great tapes being made in Austin,
and none of them are played on Austin radio because there's not a decent radio station in Austin.
When I was driving around down there,
oh, this weekend I had to go there and finish up this stuff real quick in between Easter and back.
And as I got closer to Austin, I just had to leave the car on scan
because there was not a single radio station I wanted to stop on.
Scan was more like what I wanted to hear than any one station in Austin.
Here you got the hour of slack, dear friends, for what it's worth.
And, well, as soon as this tape turns over here, which I'm waiting for my show tape to die,
then, my friends, we can go back in.
We are healed.

Keep me searching for a heart of gold.

Now, Reverend Ivan Stang, many people have said that you're not Mediterranean.
You're not Mediterranean and you're not African and you're not white, whatever that means.
Exactly what nationality does the bob come from?
What's your ethnic class?
He's a damn yeti.
He's a bigfoot.
He's an abominable.
Abominable snowman of the Himalayas.
That's what bob is.
He's half Irish.
Has anyone ever said that?
Half Irish.
Did anybody ever make fun of you when you were a kid and go like, bob the slob, bob the slob?
Where do you think the subgeniuses come from?
They're the ones that got put into the trash cans by bigger kids.
Bob the slob.
They got all the balls thrown at them.
And they're all peeped.
They're the ones that get picked last for sports.
They hate everybody normal and I don't blame them.
Sure, you're saying...
Kill them all, I say.
Let Bob sort them out.
Kill them all that slob.
Blort them out.
Blort them out.
I haven't been blorted in months.
I'm getting the hang of this religion thing now.
Praise the Lord, Pastor Bob.
That's what I...
Praise the...
Praise the Lord.
I'm praising the Lord.
Ask the Pope about that.
He gets the best of Trappists.
They make the best liquid frass.
Yes, but they're afflicted with having almonds in their prostrates and stuff.
They're not allowed to see or speak.
Nor hear.
Or hear anything.
But they can make a hell of a brew.
The Trappist monks have my full approval.
I've had it.
I've had a Trappist monkey.
I've had a Trappist monkey too.
I don't...
They have terrible personal habits.
They have terrible personal habits.
They have terrible personal habits, but they make a hell of a brew, guys.
I heard a story about a Trappist monk who...
Hey, did you drink that mushroom tea the other night?
You?
Are you talking to me?
Dave?
Dave?
No, you...
That mushroom tea, how was it?
Oh, it was fine.
Just fine.
What do you mean?
Is she talking mushrooms you bought at the health food store?
No, that mushroom tea at that party you went to.
You look nervous, Dave.
I thought you were talking about...
Dave, I thought you were talking about the mushrooms you bought at the...
How was that mushroom tea?
Because I didn't get to have any of it.
It was just fine.
It was just fine.
Anyway, I was...
You know, Reverend...
He's sweating.
I don't know, but I may...
He smells like mushrooms.
Let's lick him.
He's flooding again.
Get a slide and scrape some of that stuff that Dave's sweating and roll it up.
I'm sweating beads of corn.
Snort it.
Look, I'm an Indian deity and I'm five foot high.
Can I snort your armpit for a minute?

Little beads of corn coming out of my armpit.
Those are nipples.
Again with the prairie squid nipples.
I can't win with this.
You just keep talking about them and tantalizing me.
That's what nipples are for.
But prairie squid nipples, what an awful thing to be tantalized by cup-like things crawling out of gopher holes.
It's a natural thing.
It's natural, Dave.
Just...
You have to get past your childhood thing, you know, where they say nipple pleasure is bad.
Nipple pleasure is good.
Enjoy it.
Go with it.
Go with it.
Yeah, go with it, man.
Loosen up.
Inflate, dude.
Rise above it all.
Inflate.
Rise above it.
Don't worry about what the nuns say.
Blow up like an amphibian, especially if you're making love to a shaflopod.
They look to me like tiny little peppercorns.
But what did the priest say?
What kind of love could I make to something like that?
What did the priest say in sixth grade to you, Dave?
He told me that I would probably never grow up and he said it would be a shame to my family.
And he said also that I would probably wind up in either jail or some kind of mental institution.
But instead he became a high priest in the church.
The church of the subgenius.
And you can too for only 20 easy monthly payments.
One dollar per month is enough to last a lifetime.
A lifetime of salvation.
We cannot guarantee that prices will remain at 1994 levels.
And due to inflation over the last few months, a 5% rise per month should be expected.
So what is the church of the subgenius?
Your master or Visa card.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for that voiceover.
Stop on.
What is the church of the subgenius planning for the year 2000?
Everything will be gone.
Yeah, that's a moot point.
We'll be doing whatever the hell we want to do.
Actually, the earth will still be here.
What is that date again?
July 5th, 1998, 7 o'clock in the morning.
I won't even be up.
In any time zone.
It starts in the middle of the date line.
The international date line.
And where does it wait for this?
It moves along with it with the sunlight.
Well, basically, imagine this row of spaceships hovering over the earth and letting the earth turn underneath.
Yeah.
And people bursting into flames.
Those are the subgeniuses bursting into flames and rising up to the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.
And then the rest of the people, the subgeniuses who didn't pay their $30, which it'll be by then, or the humans.
I thought you said it would be $50.
You know, just the general everyday humans will suffer nearer.
Are you guys peace?
Pardon me?
And I didn't even...
Are we peace?
No, shit, they'll be suffering.
We'll be suffering at the hands of the Amalians.
Yeah, that's what's the question.
Are you at peace with yourself?
Yeah, you mocker of Christianity.
Does this church bring peace to you?
Well, who wants to know?
What do you mean?
What kind of a question is that?
Who wants to know?
Hey, maybe.
That's like saying...
Well, I don't know what...
It's like saying axolotl is your regenerative organ.
It's sort of like saying, hey, why don't you give me all your credit card numbers?
That's a cockamamie phrase if I ever heard one.
That's a good one.
I had a guy come up to me and go, Ray Richstang, have you ever seen the white light?
Now, obviously, if I said yes, I'd be lying.
If I said no, then he might suspect the truth.
That you...
That I, you know, the reverse flip around.
Yeah, yeah.
You know, those who know don't say no, those who say don't know.
So I said, I said, I said, my friend, I guess there ain't much white light.
We had to spray our yard for it.
So you can take that and shove it in the place where Bob Dobbs don't care to look.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
And speaking of the white light, I've got a little story here about a woman who either
is never going to see it again or that's all she's ever going to see.
But...
But...
But before I forget, let me give credit where credit's due.
To begin with, you are listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.
Spokesorgan, you might say, for the Dallas headquarters of the Church of the Subgenius.
Praise that man, JR Bob Dobbs.
However, that stretch of tape that you were just listening to?
Was recorded a couple of months ago at WCSB at Cleveland State University.
That was Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Reverend Chaz Smith with yours truly, Reverend Ivan
Stang in the background.
And I believe the giggles of Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs.
They're on the radio.
On Reverend Chaz's show, ESO Radio.
With, benefiting there from Lonesome Cowboy Dave's show with Psychopath Finder, Brain
Rot Radio Theater.
Once again, thanks to WCSB at Cleveland State University for letting people do that sort
of thing.
And, uh...
Dallas police are investigating the case of a Louisiana school teacher who came to Parkland
Memorial Hospital last week with her eyes removed and chanting,
Thank you, Jesus.
She has no eyes, said Detective M.J. Ned of the assaults unit.
It was a pretty clean job.
They took everything out.
Yeah, they, uh...
This woman and her two sisters had ended up in the hospital Friday evening, Friday week
ago, back.
He said, the detective there said the woman's sisters were being questioned in the case.
They may have assisted her in removing her eyes, Detective Ned said.
At this point, we don't know anything.
Anything for sure.
It's a very strange deal.
They're talking about possession by spirits, and that definitely has some kind of religious
overtones.
According to police reports, the two sisters who are also, uh, like the victim, from Louisiana,
told police their car broke down and the three women became separated.
They had agreed to meet at a hotel near Dallas.
And when they met again, the victim, Ms. Obazi, told them she had been assaulted with a pipe
by several people she didn't know.
The women then apparently went in search of someone to help them pray for Mrs. Obazi and
ended up at the home of Mattie Bradfield.
Now, the great Mattie Bradfield told police that when the sisters, uh, were being arrested,
the two women arrived, Ms. Obazi had her eyes.
But at some point during the visit, Ms. Obazi's eyes were, according to this newspaper, torn
or cut out.
According to the report, Ms. Bradfield did not witness the removal of the woman's eyes.
She and another woman found the eyes in the trash wrapped in tissue.
Police said they were unable to talk to Ms. Obazi at the time, but did not say if they

the hospital because she was incoherent and kept chanting, thank you, Jesus, over and
over and over.
One of Ms. Obazi's sisters were taken to a county psychiatric facility for evaluation
after she kept, quote, talking wildly about the devil, unquote.
Now, see, that's proof of liberal control media, because when she's talking about the
devil, they always add in talking wildly about the devil.
I don't see what's so wild about talking about the devil, do you now?
It's a really strange deal, Detective Ned said.
The sisters also kept saying that Ms. Obazi was possessed by the spirit of Chester, their
father, who has apparently, Chester has caused this tape of Tommy Lopez background music
to go out, run out.
I need more minutes of that.
And we'll put some Joe Newman or Zoox, or I don't even know who it is in the background.
I get mixed up.
Detective Ned said, I really haven't been able to get a straight answer from her or
her sisters.
They were under the impression that she was possessed, and they went and had this nice
little prayer, and somehow, someone removed her eyes.
Well, friends, actually, there's more to that story that came up later this week.
There's been some more information.
Police say, yeah, they had.
As it.
Had ascertained.
This is after Mrs. Ms. Myra Obazi, the self-blinded or sister-blinded woman, has gone back to
Louisiana, and I guess the spirit of Chester, her father, has been driven from her, and
so forth.
But Detective Ned has added to the story, she is kind of cloudy on what all was said,
but she remembers her.
The body of her home, memories took all of the people.
Brutally sick, a job confused Mrs. Obazi.
When she realized that her bond is going on, sheぇr
Credit for calling us up.
she was thinking she should be interested in hurting her or fossil else.
Now that
way, we may not know exactly what she was asking but it doesn't seem it enough.
Working at Elizabethan speaking Is there any
reason that she wants to know?


A h u s p r i s t h a k a u t.
n


And it can't.
Ok.
Let's go.
Ms. Bradfield, who has been leading prayers at her home for more than 25 years,
said she began to fear something horrible was about to happen
when she placed her hand on Ms. Obazi and heard her speak in a different voice.
Quote,
The sisters started asking her questions, and she would answer in different voices,
Ms. Bradfield said.
They asked her if she was jealous of someone else, and she responded that she wasn't.
They asked her a lot of things, things I didn't understand.
Oh, by the way, friends, Ms. Obazi was also known in the past as the radio commentator...
What was her...
Aunt Bertha, that's right, Aunt Bertha, in Tucson, Arizona,
and for the last five years has taught elementary...
Elementary school in Shreveport.
I guess she ain't gonna be teaching anymore, friends.
Uh...
But poor Ms. Bradfield, who had allowed these women to come into her house and pray,
I saw blood coming from her eyes, Ms. Bradfield said.
It was running down her face.
Her eyes were shut, and I couldn't tell anything was wrong with her.
But then Ms. Bradfield made a horrifying discovery.
I was picking up the trash bag when I looked down.
I saw...
I saw this bloody tissue.
When I opened it, there was this eye in there.
It was the weirdest feeling I ever felt.
I felt like I was going to pass out.
And friends, the two sisters who did this act of mercy on their sister,
one of them, Mrs. Johnson, drives a van for the Council on Aging,
and the other, a Ms. Crawford, is a housewife.
Um...
And the, uh...
Ms. Bradfield said she will not soon forget the incident.
It seemed to me they were acting like they were in another world, she said.
There was something terribly wrong with them.
It looked to me like they were under some kind of self-spell or something.
Well...
Well...



Well, friends, it just goes to show that you can in fact see your own eyes.
At least for a short period of time.
According to subgenius doctrine, you can in fact see your own eyes.
If that woman had pulled one eye out a little ways,
just enough to keep the optic nerve connected.
I've been thinking about this all week.
She would be able to actually turn that one eye around
and gaze into the other eye while still seeing through both.
Friends, according to the word of Bob,
you can in fact see your own eyes.
Thank you.
Back to, uh...

Uh, when I was asked to be guest speaker at this concert, I asked myself this.
Who are you to be the guest speaker at this concert?
I thought about my answer about being a guest speaker for a long time.
What is a guest speaker?
Let me clarify this.
I have been called brave.
What is brave?
Let me clarify this.
Of course, we all know that it is true.
We are all brave.
