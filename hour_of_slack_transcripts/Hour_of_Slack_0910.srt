00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,720
Bud Light presents

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,260
The subgenius power of

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,160
SWAG!

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,780
Real American Heroes

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,600
Today we salute you, real American Heroes.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,640
Don't stay in too long, or everyone will shout you.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,860
Finish quickly and come back.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,800
The naughty bits.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,640
Ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,980
The hard-hitting words of

11
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,720
Brave and deep in the sands of time

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,100
Are the names of those who struggled for perfection in the dream.

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,680
Ah, yes dear friends, welcome to Hour of SWAG number 910!

14
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:17,880
And it's another wonderful show comprised of recordings made while we had the famous Dr. Howland Owl in town.

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,620
How was in town to do the Indie Vival in Indianapolis sponsored by the Cui-Gee-Bo Clench

16
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,100
Who make the great subgenius magazine called Cui-Gee-Bo.

17
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:29,980
Ahem.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,620
Of which there's a new issue out.

19
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,560
And you should look at sub-site www.subgenius.com

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,140
And find out where to write to Cui-Gee-Bo.

21
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,480
Actually it's 18 Main Street, Greenfield, Indiana.

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:55,540
And, but, you must, you must be amazed at the incredible preaching that Dr. Howell does at the Indianapolis Indie Vival.

23
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,560
And the other preachers, yours truly, Reverend Nikki Deathjit, Duke of Butte, Sang,

24
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,240
and lots of great music.

25
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,120
And also friends, this show will feature the radio appearances.

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:14,680
I have been praying for years for a chance to get Dr. Howell and Lonesome Cowboy Dave in the same studio.

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,000
And I managed to get them together for three solid hours of recording.

28
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,540
Some on ESO radio on WCSB and some on a radio show called Synethesia.

29
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,540
The one which follows Hour of Slack on WCSB.

30
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,740
Dr. Synethesia's show.

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,960
He was kind enough to let Dave and Howell just go at it for an hour and a half.

32
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:46,520
And friends, also we have some of the greatest collages yet by the great collagiast, Fernandinende Lemur.

33
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,760
Not just him, but also some of the other alt-binary Slack artistes.

34
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,440
Um, New Monet and Blackout, I think.

35
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,260
And El Rep, the El Queso All-Stars have been cranking out more stuff.

36
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,260
So friends, it's just amazing. It's fantabulous. It's fantastical.

37
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,620
And Bob loves you.

38
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,880
So there's nothing to be, to fret about.

39
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,960
It's all Slack and everything is perfect.

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,860
And now this.

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,720
Alright!

42
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,400
Good evening.

43
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,360
Good evening.

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,120
Alright. Good evening.

45
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,640
Thank you.

46
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,420
Thank you.

47
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,220
Thank you.

48
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,020
Thank you.

49
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,840
Thank you.

50
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,940
You're welcome.

51
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,220
Alright, good evening everybody.

52
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:49,560
Ladies and gentlemen, sub-geni and normal alike, alike welcome, welcome one and all to IndieVival 2003.

53
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,360
Alright, very good, very good.

54
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,280
I see out there a lot of faces that I recognize and a lot of faces that I don't.

55
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,620
More of the latter, actually.

56
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,280
Thank you all for coming out.

57
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,980
My name is Pope Fred.

58
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,040
I am Pope of all Joliet and environs.

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,240
Thank you once again for coming out.

60
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,280
As I said, I don't recognize many of you folks, but there is one thing, one thing that brings us all together.

61
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,740
Sickness!

62
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,620
Exactly.

63
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,120
You're a sick bastard.

64
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,420
You're a deviant.

65
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,140
You're abnormal.

66
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,860
You're strange.

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,240
You follow a man and a belief which has set you apart from the normals.

68
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,640
You follow a religion which has been shunned by the nation.

69
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,080
And we have been shut out by normal society.

70
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,460
We have been cursed by our abnormality.

71
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:56,800
Which reminds me of another religion, another group of people that were shunned for their deviant beliefs.

72
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,740
They were shunned by our government.

73
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,240
They were shunned by their very families.

74
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,660
And they had to leave their homes on a pilgrimage.

75
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:13,040
A pilgrimage to a land where they could live out their deviant lifestyle in peace.

76
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,540
They traveled through the desert.

77
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,180
Through storms and...

78
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,200
Dust storms and starvation and disease.

79
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,160
And they went out into the wilderness.

80
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:38,160
And when their leader came to the destination on today's date in 1848, he stretched out his hand over the great Salt Lake Valley and said,

81
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,980
This is the place.

82
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,080
Let's hear it for the Mormons!

83
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,180
Yee-haw!

84
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,180
Yes!

85
00:05:50,620 --> 00:06:01,420
The Mormons found their place of freedom where Utahns could perform anything in a free state of love and religious freedom.

86
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,740
This is the place, my friends.

87
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:16,900
This is the place where you, my fellow sub-geni, deviants, abnormals,

88
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,700
can pursue religious freedom.

89
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,320
Yee-haw!

90
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,900
Yee-haw!

91
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,320
Thank you.

92
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,280
Kill me! Kill me!

93
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,260
Well, I'm taking donations and setting up tithes, okay.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,220
God willing, we will prevail in peace and freedom from fear.

95
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,220
And in true health, through the purity and essence of our natural...

96
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,300
Fluids.

97
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,140
God bless you all.

98
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,460
God bless you all.

99
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,480
You and I need fresh, pure water.

100
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,660
To replenish our precious bodily fluids.

101
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,000
niños

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,040
Wonderful reality.

103
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,040


104
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,780
We're still trying to figure out the meaning of that last phrase.

105
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,860
I want to hear some power, you...

106
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,840
All right, man.

107
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,780
This is the end of today's lesson.

108
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,360
I'm going to force you into a bad dream.

109
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,180
I'm going to force you into a bad dream.

110
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,660
Ah, yes, dear friends.

111
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,700
Precious Fluids by Champion Jack Codini.

112
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,020
Hey, give us a call up here at 216-687-4255.

113
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,620
We can shoot the breeze.

114
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,860
Actually, we can answer any question.

115
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,580
That's right, any question.

116
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,440
Any question.

117
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,280
Anything that is personally burdening your heart.

118
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,460
Ask Dr. Howell.

119
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,080
Dr. Howell is a doctor, and you can ask him, and he will answer.

120
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,800
Ask, and it shall be answered.

121
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:55,020
If you live in San Francisco, you have to pay to go see the Ask Dr. Howell.

122
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,220
Dr. Howell's show every week.

123
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,820
Well, ultimately, you will pay to know what you really think.

124
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,920
But if you attend my nightclub act, you will be immaculated and seized up in the rupture.

125
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,240
Ow!

126
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,080
And given the wedgie of faith.

127
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,320
Well, it's been there to happen.

128
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,300
That's right.

129
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,440
Bob by proxy, a bob by direct action.

130
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,480
It's still the same footprint that investigators have learned to recognize

131
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,020
over the years.

132
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:31,680
The large, dobsly presence can not be hidden from the adroit.

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,720
Black eyes, swimming pool, congressman.

134
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,820
There's only one thing wrong.

135
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,420
Now, what's this new scuttlebutt you're spreading?

136
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,560
Well, there's a lot of things we don't know.

137
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,560
I'm aware of that.

138
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,320
Outside of clubs and bar rooms.

139
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:49,900
Yes, sir.

140
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,280
Now, we've got a country yelling, fight those voters every blame two years.

141
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,360
Hit the public.

142
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,300
We can keep hitting them.

143
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,500
By the way, there's a lot of things we don't do.

144
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,200
Here's some of the things we do.

145
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:00,980
No, sir.

146
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,740
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,440
You shut up.

148
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,080
Oh, drop dead.

149
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,720
Yeah, that would be nice.

150
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
It's the dance of the sacred pumpkin.

151
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,940
Calling the demise due to all things.

152
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,780
Hey!

153
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,700
It's the dance of the sacred pumpkin.

154
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,760
Rufus doubled over and released his stink.

155
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,380
Hey!

156
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,560
It's the dance of the sacred pumpkin.

157
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,220
Calling the demise due to all things.

158
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,840
Hey!

159
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,880
It's the dance of the sacred pumpkin.

160
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,920
Rufus doubled over and released his stink.

161
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,560
On the side of sand.

162
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,040
The last of the land.

163
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,340
Oh, hey!

164
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,620
Hey!

165
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:54,620


166
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,280
Rufus double over and reset the

167
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,540
должен deathщ

168
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:57,540


169
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,800
When he finally got the shull

170
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,600
You know.

171
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:00,980
Kelley pergunta

172
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:22,360
Why did King forget Oaxaca?

173
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:23,940
Hey!

174
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,140
I'm in here.

175
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,760
every last bit to the walls of the stall.

176
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,920
In the shithouse they built, it was fashioned of lies,

177
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,200
and they couldn't wipe their asses, Rufus cut them down to size.

178
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,700
No, no, they couldn't wipe their asses, Rufus cut them down to size.

179
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,920
But while inside, he met the flies, and they were sorely oily and thick,

180
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,940
and not just any trick would have worked, so Rufus had to exercise,

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,620
he had to dance, and dance.

182
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,740
It's the dance of a sacred pumpkin,

183
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,640
calling the demise due to all things pain.

184
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,180
It's the dance of a sacred pumpkin,

185
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,060
calling the demise due to all things pain.

186
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,920
The El Queso All-Stars, dear friends, from their new album,

187
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,700
Crotchless Leather Wheelchair.

188
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:38,300
Oh, this music in the background, by the way, is by Hell Pope Huey himself.

189
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,060
But now this.

190
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,820
Submissions first.

191
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,040
Submissions.

192
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,680
Submissions first.

193
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,560
Submissions first.

194
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,420
Oh, no.

195
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,200
I want more of his little buddy.

196
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,240
Buddy.

197
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,160
The duchess of kindness often misread dominant wolf behavior as weakness.

198
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,640
Oh, come on.

199
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,220
But in fashions secure each wolf, strengthen each wolf,

200
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,220
and above all reassure each wolf.

201
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,120
Such close co-op.

202
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,080
Such co-operation can mean death as a teen.

203
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,240
You run down sidewalks land.

204
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,860
There's no rhyme or reason to it, you know, you just let it.

205
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,560
In thermosilk.

206
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,100
Cell phone.

207
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,540
Backup.

208
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,180
Catsons included.

209
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,100
Backup.

210
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,620
Every day.

211
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,200
It's back.

212
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,700
The wolves live in a civilization,

213
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,700
unlike their endangered wolf hunters and trappers.

214
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,120
With abundant natural inclination,

215
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,340
the nation of wolves submissions fierceness.

216
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,040
Amid security that was televised live to hundreds of millions of countries.

217
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,480
He urged Chris Limbs to try everything possible so that the name of God is exploited for works of death.

218
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,260
Along with a hot meal, the event offered little holiday cheer this Christmas.

219
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:19,940
Israeli tanks and troops arrested seven militants from the Israeli army just hours after Palestinians held a midnight Michigan back into an area of low pressure off the East Coast.

220
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,000
There could be a tonight.

221
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,580
Fuck it.

222
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,740
And Cape Clip Coastals 39.

223
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:23,920
39.

224
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,140
39 up here on the river.

225
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,340
And 40 not a bad East Coast.

226
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,420
Boston Midwest.

227
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,440
More South.

228
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,140
Fuck it.

229
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,160
Here's Christina.

230
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,260
Pirates of Southern Florida.

231
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,080
Tomorrow, fronts scattered around Miami by the afternoon.

232
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,380
Miami, your highest.

233
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,640
Let's take a look at a little more tails in its wet, wet area for you.

234
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,840
Submission.

235
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,460
Submission.

236
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,060
Submission.

237
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,640
Submission.

238
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,400
Submission.

239
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,140
Submission.

240
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:49,820
Submission.

241
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,720
You are being murdered, my friends.

242
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,720
Day after day.

243
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,940
Day as long as you live.

244
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,900
Never ask for whom the grave is dug.

245
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,000
It's dug for you.

246
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,180
You are in walking distance of your grave.

247
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,060
But you can't see it.

248
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,880
Tears shed by your left eye are blinding your right eye.

249
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,300
Tears shed by your right eye are blinding your left eye.

250
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,540
Wake up.

251
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,560
We are not suffering from a million or more diseases.

252
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,260
But from one disease and one only.

253
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,100
The hidden disease.

254
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,140
The original, the fundamental disease.

255
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,580
And it cannot be cured by chemistry or surgery.

256
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,200
By skullduggery or blackstrap molasses.

257
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Let the doctors examine themselves.

258
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,020
Let them have a good look at their own distorted, two legged, upright position.

259
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,740
Their hind legs.

260
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,880
But can they think straight?

261
00:16:51,880 --> 00:17:04,200
Their spines are caving in, their livers have putrefied, their discs have slipped, their sciatica is dislocated, their noses have bulbified.

262
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:20,120
What do these learned garbage cans, these boil catchers and abominationists, these troubadours of diarrhea and constipation,

263
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:35,220
what do these sinister fools, these hand-picked morons, what do they know about quadrupedism, about four-leggedism?

264
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,200
That was Brother Theodore.

265
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,020
There are subgeniuses who don't really...

266
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,060
They don't really qualify for our church because they really are geniuses.

267
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,280
And everything they say is sort of correct.

268
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,060
And everybody hates them.

269
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,220
You know, everybody hates the guy that's always right.

270
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,220
Just because a statement is correct doesn't mean that it's a smart thing to say.

271
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,420
And trying not to be a dumbass is...

272
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,380
It's hard to...

273
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,800
You know, for some of us subgeniuses, it's a full-time job.

274
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,360
But that doesn't work.

275
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,140
Once again, you're just trying to act normal.

276
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,160
Maybe the way to do it is to fully be that dumbass.

277
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,300
To be that dumbass to the hilt.

278
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,040
Actually, isn't Banjo Bob here?

279
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
He should probably be here.

280
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,520
Boo-la-ga-la.

281
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,300
Boo-la-ga-la.

282
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,780
Boo-la-ga-la.

283
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,420
Boo-la-ga-la.

284
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,080
Boo-la-ga-la.

285
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,840
Boo-la-ga-la.

286
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,820
Boo-la-ga-la.

287
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,600
Boo-la-ga-la.

288
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,320
The World Helpful Health Information Service

289
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,140
invites you to take six minutes to invade our bodies.

290
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,660
One of the biggest complaints we hear from anyone who walks or runs a lot

291
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,760
is children living in poor areas.

292
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,420
A tragic fact of life in many parts of the world

293
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,340
is that two million children live in feces

294
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,720
and contaminate our water and food.

295
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,920
As we get physically closer to one person's feces,

296
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,120
we're living closer and closer to feces.

297
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,880
Because so much disease and death

298
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,160
comes from improper human feces,

299
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,160
a lot of developing countries are trying hard

300
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,640
to contaminate our food and water supply.

301
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,840
Tell us, George, the methods of human feces

302
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,440
that have proven effective in the past.

303
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,320
Some modern solutions have evolved.

304
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,180
Some have proven effective.

305
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,160
Spreading unprocessed human feces onto the food supply

306
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,300
has resulted in human diseases in a pit

307
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,760
and periodically a pile.

308
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,400
In summary, someone has come up with human feces

309
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,540
that is not only inexpensive,

310
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,280
but also contaminates our water and food

311
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,180
and sends it on fire.

312
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,440
Usually, nothing more is needed.

313
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,940
Can you use your finger?

314
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,660
When I was a boy,

315
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,620
some people used different methods for the feces.

316
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,360
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

317
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,560
Not your step-in stone.

318
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,880
Well, it looks like they're not going to ask us any questions.

319
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,460
So, uh, how are you doing, Stang?

320
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,040
How's your war on God going?

321
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,220
Well, pitifully, as usual, as you might expect.

322
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,060
I mean, he knows our every move, it seems.

323
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,660
He's got spies everywhere.

324
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,380
They don't call him the Almighty for nothing.

325
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,040
There's fifth columnists we've got to deal with.

326
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,940
It's a...

327
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,300
It's a...

328
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
But, you know, somebody's...

329
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:49,900
Somebody's got to do it.

330
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,200
That's right, and Rome wasn't burned in a day.

331
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,020
Fight City Hall and Heavenly, the Heavenly Hall.

332
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,440
When they told us we were all going to go to hell,

333
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,020
what choice do we have, really?

334
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,460
If we're going to be true to ourselves?

335
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,020
Are we just going to roll over and take it?

336
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,500
Life's unfair.

337
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,580
Does it have to be that way?

338
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,620
No, God made it that way.

339
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,300
And you, the listener, as Dr. Howell has pointed out before,

340
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:18,800
are yourself...

341
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,820
are yourself the ultimate proof that, in fact, actually, there is no God.

342
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,900
There can never be a great creator being.

343
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,480
Because there is an obstacle.

344
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,260
An obstacle to the existence of God.

345
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,180
And that obstacle is you, the listener.

346
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:39,440
You are the lump lying in the road to the path of divine communication and understanding.

347
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,380
That self of yours must be hauled off the turnpike,

348
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,440
wheelbarrow load by wheelbarrow load,

349
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,960
until the glittering vehicles...

350
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,340
of comprehension and evolutionary advancement

351
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,340
may whiz by unimpeded.

352
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,180
Wow, look at him go!

353
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,660
Phew!

354
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:03,860
But what is the use of attempting to enlighten the obdurately dull and stupid?

355
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:12,140
I suppose there's only a short time left where we can provide some help

356
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,220
to those who thirst for peace in their souls.

357
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,320
Well, there's something to be said for being dull and stupid.

358
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,320


359
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,340
I mean, why do you think they call it sub-genius?

360
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,760
Oh, yeah, well, Dan Quay always said that mediocre folks deserve representation, too.

361
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,460
Ask him where we are.

362
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,000
Here's one.

363
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,280
Are there really only ten commandments?

364
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,600
Ha ha!

365
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,680
Oh, no, there are quite more.

366
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:39,300
A number that were even given to Moses at the same time, but just left off the slabs.

367
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,320
In fact, some of them actually directly contradict each other.

368
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,780
For example, there is a commandment that says,

369
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,620
Thou shalt kill.

370
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,560
Thou shalt make graven images and serve them.

371
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,660
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

372
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,380
I mean, pretty much everything.

373
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,280
Now, that means you kill him, right?

374
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,140
So then, thou shalt kill or thou shalt not kill.

375
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,800
You've got to make up your mind.

376
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,920
Do you have a complete list?

377
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,740
Well, is it really killing if it's a witch?

378
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,860
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's ass.

379
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,100
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife's ass? What is that?

380
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,040
No, no, you're already getting it slightly wrong.

381
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:25,760
It's like the game of telephone, where information is passed silently between ears of people huddled at a party.

382
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:34,500
And it's the same way as God's telephone line, which has been overwhelmed by static from Satan's electromagnetic pulses.

383
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:41,260
Now we can't hear the divine voice in its clarity and excellence of vision and wisdom.

384
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,020
Thou shalt not be any...

385
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,340
Thou shalt not wear checks with stripes.

386
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,000
Losers.

387
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,140
I think that same guy actually calls up 669 a lot.

388
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,160
Well, he's welcome to do so. We want to help him and all those other poor folks.

389
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:05,200
Now, you know, the Church of the Subgenius is actually a church. It does help people. It does good work in this world.

390
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,320
I don't know why we face such a bristling tide of opposition when all we're attempting to do is help people.

391
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,580
We'd love to help people.

392
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,420
No good deed goes unpunished.

393
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:32,520
Well, yes, but the question is, when a solution is as clear and obvious as the pipe-smoking face of an epoptid one, why do people not rush forward and seize upon it?

394
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,580
Why do they turn down something for nothing?

395
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,820
At least they're not throwing us to the lions.

396
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:47,920
Man, you... I hate to re-use your phrase ten times, but you got a mouth pretty... pretty here in the St. Louis... um...

397
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,000
I hate to re-use your phrase ten times, but you got a mouth pretty... pretty here in the St. Louis... um...

398
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,020
Well, here's a vocabulary word, uh, Dave, uh, GOOM.

399
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,080
Can I ask you guys a question?

400
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,680
G-H-O-O-M. It means to search in the dark.

401
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,360
Do you know if we're advancing those, uh, conchure hemorrhoids?

402
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,300
It's the negative one.

403
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,100
And what conchure hemorrhoids?

404
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,780
It's the guy who, like, appears and disappears and appears in the negative.

405
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,220
You see, we're all gooming, Dave. We're searching. We're searching in the dark with, uh, only hope.

406
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,660
Confused and ignorant.

407
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Um, uh, Harrison and...

408
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,660
That's the name of Dr. Legume.

409
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,240
Dr. Legume. Yes, exactly.

410
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,260
He's wonderful.

411
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,040
But I fear that, uh, lonesome cowboy Dave has degenerated to a case of demonic possession.

412
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,900
Nameless imps are making him spew now.

413
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,420
Hey, there's nothing wrong with my genitalia.

414
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,680
I told you these lesions had to do with worsh... worshipping, uh, the...

415
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,240
of my concentrations on Bob Dobbs and nothing more, nothing less.

416
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,680
That is appropriate, and your sentiments are elevated and correct.

417
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,360
You should concentrate on nothing but the face of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

418
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,220
That is the solution.

419
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,320
To all your problems, personal and private.

420
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,480
Now, do I dare make, uh, make one more Samyama on one part of his face than another?

421
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,480
Like, stare at his eyebrow and get some certain kind of relief or something like that, or...

422
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,520
You dare do all that does become a man.

423
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,360
Who dares do more is none.

424
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,400
Just keep looking at those dots.

425
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,680
Since dang never told me this stuff like that.

426
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,780
You sound like... you sound like a coach or something, man.

427
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,620
Those swirling dots are gonna be your salvation, and I wouldn't lie to you.

428
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,620
Uh...

429
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,060
Geez, I've waited for somebody so long to not lie to me.

430
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,200
Dang talks to me... he lies to me constantly.

431
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,120
He tells me he's lying.

432
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,940
He can't help it.

433
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:32,360
He is the father of all prevaricators, but, uh, that gives him the nimble ability to be a swiveling hipster

434
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,920
who can dodge one charge only to face the next.

435
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,200
But we are not all of necessity such warriors in this scheme.

436
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,820
Some of us, uh, are foot soldiers.

437
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,540
Grunts, as it were.

438
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,380
Some of us can put those concepts together. Feet and grunting.

439
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,260
Um...

440
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,200
Um, uh, never mind.

441
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,260
Well, uh, how's your health? You're feeling chipper? Tip-top?

442
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,960
I'm being...

443
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,460
A1 at Lewis?

444
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,000
...tipped away inch by inch.

445
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,520
You're being nibbled away inch by inch by what? By stinging, biting ants? Is that it?

446
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,220
No, it just gave kind of true meaning to saying, are you feeling chipper?

447
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,580
Because that's what I feel I'm ready for is the chipper.

448
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,740
I'm ready to be used as a lawnmower.

449
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,240
Oh, no, Dave, please. Don't say that.

450
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,900
No, I'm just saying...

451
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,700
That's not the way.

452
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,860
I'm just saying my bones are so smelly nowadays. I can...I can smell them as I evacuate.

453
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,460
Well, it takes some glucosamine.

454
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,020
When I get up, I can actually smell, like, the calcium formations in my body.

455
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,640
Yes, but the world needs its Carl Lewis.

456
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,380
You know, and Bob has not helped me with any of this.

457
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,160
He's never really helped me with anything.

458
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,640
Well, I...I think you're looking at the negative side, old son.

459
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,000
Yes, Dave, yes.

460
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,620
Uh, there's a lot of wonderful things. He brings you love and success and respect and moxie and...

461
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,700
No, he hasn't.

462
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,680
He hasn't? Well, he didn't.

463
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,240
Well, good to me. I...I don't know why you've got to keep at it, though.

464
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:54,820
See, the slap, lust, or lack, happy arrangement of the universe once again goes to what?

465
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,900
The...of the eye in the...in the middle of the third night?

466
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,380
No slap is necessary when a subgenius is born.

467
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,580
The lusty whale is amazingly imminent from the first moment of consciousness,

468
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,580
and it continues all through life in one form or another...

469
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,140
...as a shriek that runs throughout the universe.

470
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,040
Oh.

471
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,540
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that part.

472
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,900
You see, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, when you were born, there were signs and wonders in the heavens.

473
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:27,060
Uh, new comets, uh, were seen, and, uh, strange retrograde motions of the planets and stars.

474
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,060
Really?

475
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,420
Yes, uh, it showed that there was a special subgenius about to be decanted upon the earth below,

476
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:41,680
and angels in heavenly choirs sang to bewildered shepherds in the Middle East who fired back with automatic weapons.

477
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,420
Shams.

478
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:50,640
So, uh, there's, uh, a reason to have a spring in your step, a smile on your lips, and a song in your heart.

479
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:55,540
And that reason is the palindromic awesomeness of Bob.

480
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,040
So, I was favored, I was picked, I was...I was anointed somehow?

481
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,920
You were anointed, uh, and the Epoch, let us remember, is an anointed one.

482
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,140
We anointest your skull with oil, your cups runneth over.

483
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,020
He has asked me to sign his boots and do his bidding for so long,

484
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,840
and I've never taken a nickel or a square bunion in return.

485
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:23,320
At least you didn't have to perform the os in fondue, which Satan requires of his followers.

486
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,620
You dancing buck naked in fondue?

487
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,680
Oh, uh, buck naked left the church a long time ago.

488
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:38,060
But, uh, we will be bidding a beef fondue to all our listeners in the area fairly soon as we go oars in the air.

489
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,560
You mean you're taking people's members, either real or psychic, and putting them in hot cheese?

490
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:51,500
Well, the cheese is, uh, just an epiphenomenon, a side phenomenon, depending on how you look at it.

491
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,140
Frontward or backward.

492
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,960
Phew. Where can I get enough?

493
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,640
Some call it smegma.

494
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,960
Alien smegma pie.

495
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,480
It comes from deep within the earth, from volcanic vents.

496
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,980
The earth itself is a genital being, I suppose.

497
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,200
Well, more of a pimple seeking to burst in different places.

498
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,260
Through the pores.

499
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,520
It spreads a biological contamination, an infestation.

500
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:27,560
But those words are so negative, it doesn't really describe the joy of infecting whole new universes with subgenius philosophies.

501
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:37,320
Many of these would-be subgeniuses, before they become subgeniuses, are very much similar to a boil or a frost,

502
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,100
to waiting to be bursted as they wait to be, um, um...

503
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,940
Activated.

504
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,500
You know, as they wait to be bursted.

505
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,420
They need to be activated. They're sleepers. They're walking in a sleep now.

506
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,040
They need to be waked up by subgenius doctrines.

507
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,200
As the red-eyed one said...

508
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,840
They need to be wakened into their new life. And you, for all your problems,

509
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:05,660
are well aware of that, since you have passed over that line and are in the new life now.

510
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,400
I'm not wearing diapers anymore.

511
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,620
Oops. Well, we had to cut that part off. But, uh...

512
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:19,880
The heart-aching conversion of a thirsting subgenius soul is always worth cluttering the airwaves.

513
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,060
Eh, Captain Stang?

514
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,840
Huh? What? What happened?

515
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,400
Well, I believe we made a new convert tonight.

516
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,480
Someone in a small, run-down, flea-bitten hotel room is weeping tears of pure joy.

517
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,040
I see that person! I see that person!

518
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,080
But in the room next to him, there's a sad, lonely...

519
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,780
Wake up!

520
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,020
...couple. A lonesome man. I see a cowboy.

521
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,140
It was the most beautiful movie I'd ever seen.

522
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,240
Of course, Leni had everything to do with everything.

523
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,940
She mixed this and mixed that. She wasn't doing the editing. She was always there.

524
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,920
She listened to the music. No, she was not one of those directors who let others do the music.

525
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:04,920
Yeah, the craft services people made the cake like the labs at Pennymoondah.

526
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,400
With the little rocket ships on top.

527
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:13,740
So, it was beautiful. Everyone was marching in...

528
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:22,340
And kind of wasted on the Fuhrer, since he usually did not eat such sugary confections.

529
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,120
No, he was a very strict, strict vegetarian. And you could not...

530
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,460
And it was awful. You couldn't open the windows, and the Fuhrer really stank up the room.

531
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,380
Yes, he did not believe in painting, you see. In the old order, the society he belonged to, painting was...

532
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:37,380


533
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,520
...totally forbidden.

534
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,680
I was referring to the Fuhrer's flatulence problem, you see.

535
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,380
As a bean-eating vegetarian, the Fuhrer often made the Reich's chancellery air almost unbreathable.

536
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,880
Oh, he needed many, many people to work in that area.

537
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:02,760
And Kurt Goering and Goebbels and Gottin Himmler, how they would joke about it, out of the Fuhrer's earshot.

538
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,800
Yes, out of the Fuhrer's inner self, if you know what I'm saying.

539
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,300
And his comments were not much more enlightening.

540
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,060
Everything he said when he was in that booth was ruffled and tough, like a fart.

541
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,240
But they took it all down for posterity.

542
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:28,940
Here in these 27 volumes of the Wit und Wisdom of Adolf Schicklgruber, now yours for a nominal payment.

543
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:36,520
You would expect to spend a whole heck of a lot for a series of heirloom volumes like this.

544
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:43,800
But these only cost about the price of a college education or a really fine set of designer luggage.

545
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,200
So what are you waiting for?

546
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,760
Get on the ball.

547
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,060
Get the Wit und Wisdom of Adolf Schicklgruber by riding this station.

548
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,040
Also brought to you by brand new Hitler's hand soap made from real hands.

549
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,880
And Hitler's face soap made from real faces.

550
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,060
And of course, as always, by new Hitler's skin soap.

551
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,500
For skin so rough and rare, you'd dare let down your guard.

552
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,860
We'll return to the bleary hour movie, They Saved Hitler's Mustache in a Moment.

553
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:18,260
But first, a message from the maker of Hitler Youth Cookies and Eva's Delights.

554
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,820
Hi, I'm Jane Woodward for Eva's Delight Hitler Youth Cookies.

555
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,160
Sometime this week, a young man or woman in a pair of shorts and a brown shirt will be knocking on your door.

556
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,260
And they'll be carrying these fine, fine cookies.

557
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,800
And you will buy them.

558
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,860
And you...

559
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,420
Look for the fine, fine, fine...

560
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:46,040
Here, Liebchen, bite down on this.

561
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,480
I'm sorry, Adolf, bite down on... what?

562
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,280
I'm sorry, Adolf, bite down on... what?

563
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,220
I'm sorry, Adolf, bite down on... what?

564
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,000
Good drama.

565
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,400
Great look, good drama, yeah.

566
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:17,920
Good drama.

567
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,120
What do you call this?

568
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:19,720
Bob.

569
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,060
He died.

570
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,620
He died in a bizarre gardening accident.

571
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,900
A little bit there by Reverend Jartow.

572
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,280
Friends, you know, this show, it's not just you.

573
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,220
This show makes me feel weird, too.

574
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,000
In fact, I'm feeling kind of sick.

575
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,240
I'm feeling kind of sick.

576
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,580
It's train Istquierdh.

577
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,560
Do you ever feel angry?

578
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,340
Are you paralyzed by your anger?

579
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,100
Do you feel yourself with butterflies in your stomach a lot?

580
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,480
Do you get headaches?

581
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,140
Are you really frustrated?

582
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,220
Do you ever get to the point where you're gonna blow up and you're afraid that if you

583
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:57,220
blow up, you're gonna blow away all your friends and all your co-workers?

584
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,160
Chances are, that all of this behavior is a symptom of the fact that you're not expressing

585
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,220
your anger, your anger because you're not letting your self combination lead you anywhere.

586
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,220


587
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,220


588
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,960
We can assertively express our anger if we handle our anger assertively.

589
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,600
We complain and complain and complain.

590
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,620
I'm angry.

591
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,320
So what do we do?

592
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,520
I want a raise.

593
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,380
I want to go home.

594
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,800
I want sex.

595
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,580
I want a cookie.

596
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,380
I want a raise.

597
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,280
I want to go home.

598
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,720
I want sex.

599
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,460
I want a cookie.

600
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:57,840
I want a raise.

601
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,680
Did I really do something bad?

602
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,740
Why am I apologizing?

603
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,380
I don't think I'm always wrong.

604
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,020
Do you?

605
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,280
Do people push your buttons?

606
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:22,940
Are they telling you that you're too fat, too aggressive, not nice enough, or just hard to get along with?

607
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,920
Are they telling you that people who grew up in Connecticut are stupid?

608
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,300
Do they tell you that you're weak?

609
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,600
Are you simply the person who gets the sand kicked in their face?

610
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,200
Negative, negative, negative.

611
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,400
Now you're angry, and now you have something to say.

612
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,520
I want a raise.

613
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,400
I want to go home.

614
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,820
I want sex.

615
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,580
I want a cookie.

616
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,420
I want a raise.

617
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,300
I want to go home.

618
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,720
I want sex.

619
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,460
I want a cookie.

620
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:29,280
I want a raise.

621
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,700
I want to use my shit.

622
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,020
Oh, boy.

623
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,580
It's impossible to pick anything out of this turbulence of tongues, ladies and gentlemen.

624
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,880
We're going to take each person on his own, one at a time.

625
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,260
We're going to hammer it out for you.

626
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,780
Plain and simple.

627
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,820
Easy to understand.

628
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,680
No tricky double talk.

629
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,560
No intellectual obfuscations.

630
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,600
Just the pure, simple answers to everything.

631
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,540
And believe me.

632
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,480
We've got answers to every question you could possibly ask.

633
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,800
But, Cowboy Bob, they're not calling in.

634
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,540
We've been here ready to answer their questions.

635
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,360
Tell them where the gold is buried behind the barn and all that sort of thing.

636
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,880
Is that behind the barn?

637
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,580
Well, I...

638
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,380
That's a euphemism, or what you call it.

639
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,100
It's one of them, you know, analogs.

640
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,800
I never met a four I didn't like.

641
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,080
Yeah.

642
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,540
I'm telling you, they haven't been calling in the way they ought to have been.

643
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:28,640
Well, perhaps some great hand of destiny is holding them away from the phone.

644
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,300
Maybe they're...

645
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,480
Maybe the great usurper is somewhere afoot in the land,

646
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,800
darkening them to the sight of God.

647
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,140
Of Dob, not Dobbs.

648
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,140
Dobbs.

649
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,720
I mean, you know, making them...

650
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,780
And we saw the Anakim, and we were grasshoppers in their sight.

651
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,560
Oh, but you said they were finicky or something.

652
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,080
Oh, they're Finnish, Dutch, all different nationalities.

653
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,340
But the problem is they can't triangulate on their...

654
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,740
their true citizenship, which is a member of the world-spanning church of the subgenius.

655
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,620
See, somebody's doing that to them.

656
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,140
Somebody out there, an unseen hand is holding them down.

657
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,140
It's the conspiracy, jamming the wavelengths.

658
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,640
So the waves become small, impotent slaps.

659
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,220
They have no curiosity.

660
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:16,400
Let's see if this one actually will take advantage of this wonderful opportunity to get the real answers.

661
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,220
Yes, come one, come all.

662
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,380
How long are we on the air?

663
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,940
I think it's after one o'clock.

664
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,720
It's too late to buy my can of weenies.

665
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,420
Too late to buy your can of weenies, I'm sorry.

666
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,620
Those cocktail franks aren't going to get you over the sticks.

667
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,580
You're going to need two obols for the ferryman.

668
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,520
Yes.

669
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,640
So make sure you've got those pennies under your tongue when you go into the great beyond,

670
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,000
and you can pay the piper, literally.

671
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,900
Well said again.

672
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:49,140
Then take a big cake of honey and poppy seeds to throw into the slavering, saliva-soaked jaws

673
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,420
of the three-headed doggie that guards the entrance.

674
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,940
To distract the brute.

675
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:03,140
So you can hobnob with the virtuous intellectuals and the defunct pagans in the vestibule, or front hallway.

676
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,200
That's why they're hiding them in the vestibule,

677
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,800
and the one with the long ears and big snout is called Cersei, the dog of hell.

678
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,320
You know her.

679
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,200
Rough, rough.

680
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,020
Yes, but her bark is worse than her bite, as you'll find out.

681
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,400
How many are we satisfied with your curiosity?

682
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,940
Then there's that other river that makes you forget.

683
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,240
The river of tears and sorrow.

684
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,320


685
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,860
You're on the air.

686
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,440
I think of us as the shrimp.

687
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,260
What was I going to say?

688
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,800
And the other's just the upper crust.

689
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,000
Don't think of us as the shrimp out of the river, Luffy.

690
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,020
We're tired of listening to you all.

691
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,880
If you're tired of us, perhaps you'd like to hear some polka music.

692
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,840
Start your own freaking radio show.

693
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:44,320
You know, it only costs, you know, whatever to get a broadcast license these days.

694
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:44,900
You can do that.

695
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,640
Yeah, get your own transmitter.

696
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,640
Look, I've got a helmet that can keep out most evil designs of, like, you know, the people with the third brain and stuff.

697
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,960
It can stop the voices in my head.

698
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,860
And I can actually transmit radio waves.

699
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,400
They don't get very far, but they have been picked up.

700
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,120
And so, you know, you can do it yourself.

701
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,580
A small but persistent signal.

702
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,280
And, you know, your body is a radio receiver.

703
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,720
You can pick up radio beamed by certain precocious individuals.

704
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,420
Lonesome cowboy Dave is one of these.

705
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,220
Was once, anyway, before the big meltdown.

706
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,740
Oh, you're hiding your light under the bushel again.

707
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,040
Well, what better?

708
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,560
Place to keep it, you know, nowadays, since everything's fried down there.

709
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,720
Yes, that's true.

710
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,480
They've even introduced the metric system.

711
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,680
Well, we all have our cuss words to bear.

712
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:39,540
And we've done our best to bring the listeners of this area, one of our patented radio shows at this time,

713
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,980
despite enormous psychic and physical obstruction.

714
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:43,720
Really?

715
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,660
Like I said, I could smell your pineal glands 50 miles away.

716
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,880
I knew you fellows were working very hard to bring the truth or at least a vague rumor to the...

717
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,180
That new forest green pineal odor.

718
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:58,000
To the whatever they are, people, some call them out there.

719
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,320
Yeah, we call it the people sphere.

720
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,760
Das Volk.

721
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,640
Peace be upon you.

722
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,440
Peace be upon you.

723
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,260
I got more half a tube of anal lube.

724
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,040
Keep eating those prunes.

725
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,760
So, see, these are the people that we...

726
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,100
Well, once again, people, is that a word we can use?

727
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:21,300
These are the individuals that we want to beat with bowling pins.

728
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,120
No, we want to bring them.

729
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,460
Under the flabby, flabby, flabby, flabby wing?

730
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,480
Or no, no?

731
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,640
So they can concentrate on the finer things in life.

732
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,140
Yeah, that's what they need to do.

733
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:39,180
Their life is one, you know, helter-skelter, scary bump from one thing to another.

734
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,840
They're gobbling convenience store hot dogs off plastic plates

735
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:48,140
when they could be eating with the finest silverware and tasting pâté de foie gras.

736
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,820
They don't know what their mission.

737
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,720
No, they don't.

738
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,840
In fact, my girlfriend made eclairs.

739
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,220
She made eclairs to bring to everybody tonight.

740
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,060
She made eclairs?

741
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:55,800
And yeah.

742
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,740
Oh, and she couldn't be here tonight?

743
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,220
Oh.

744
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,180
I ate two because...

745
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,100
I can taste the cream now in a psychic sense.

746
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,180
Oh, that is terrible.

747
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,820
Well, another missed opportunity.

748
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:08,780
Chocolate poop.

749
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,940
Chips that pass in the night.

750
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:11,480
Yes.

751
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,480
So have any souls been saved by you fellas tonight?

752
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,020
We've been doing our best to try to save as many souls as we can salt down for the winter,

753
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,660
but it's been...

754
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,440
It's been a hard, rough road to hoe.

755
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,320
We've packed two whole souls into the canisters in Indianapolis.

756
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,060
We put them in the steel canisters and vacuum packed them,

757
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,860
but we could have done it tomorrow, frankly.

758
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,360
How can we save your soul tonight?

759
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,880
Strangers in the night.

760
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,180
Exchanging rubbers.

761
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,020
This one's way too tight.

762
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,120
You think you're fine, my brother?

763
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,600
Huh.

764
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:45,980
Oh, that one.

765
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,240
I know the one, there were two junkies in Needle Park,

766
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,880
and the one junkie hands the needle to the other one,

767
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,820
and the other one...

768
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,320
And the other junkie says,

769
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,560
No, no, man, don't do that, we'll get AIDS.

770
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,840
And the other junkie says,

771
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,580
Oh, relax, man, I'm wearing the rubber.

772
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,360
That's the only variation of that song I knew.

773
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,700
I know how we can save our own souls.

774
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,000
And how is that?

775
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,100
By... by playing this real quick?

776
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,020
I'm drowning.

777
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,720
We interrupt to bring you an important announcement.

778
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,920
The world will end at 12 o'clock tonight.

779
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,620
I'll just repeat that.

780
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,240
The world will end at 12 o'clock tonight.

781
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,280
This is not a hoax.

782
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,820
World leaders have been meeting...

783
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,460
in Washington over the past week...

784
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,400
to consider the ever-worsening problems...

785
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,420
of inflation, overpopulation, racism, pollution...

786
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,080
you name it, they've considered it.

787
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,960
They have come to the conclusion...

788
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,600
there is no point in going on.

789
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,800
It is their unanimous decision...

790
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,120
that at 12 o'clock tonight...

791
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,840
in a final act of unprecedented...

792
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,740
international military cooperation...

793
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,340
the world will be blown up.

794
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,400
What's your game, Bob?

795
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,780
You know, there was an article in the newspaper...

796
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,880
we had it by the...

797
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,520
in the nanoheliograph...

798
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,340
that capuchin monkeys go on strike...

799
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,800
when they perceive that labor is unfair to them.

800
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,180
That was in today's paper.

801
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,080
Yes, sir.

802
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,520
It seems to be a trait in all human beings...

803
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,800
much in the same way if you sound a low B flat...

804
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,060
a 57 octave below middle B flat...

805
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,700
it'll make them damn capuchins all work...

806
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,800
for much less than they wanted in the first place.

807
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,880
Well, you don't want to screw the capuchin...

808
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,440
but you've got a C sharp...

809
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:21,780
No, you...

810
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,100
C natural.

811
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,520
I've got a much bigger member than that...

812
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,380
I've got an A flat.

813
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,780
Oh, well, I'll throw a towel over it, as they say.

814
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,700
Bob thinks I should be in jail.

815
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,300
Why does Bob want this woman in jail?

816
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,600
I'm beginning to smell a big fat conny rat.

817
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,140
Why would you do that to me, Bob?

818
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,440
They try to make you comfortable...

819
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,440
they try to put you in a quite nice situation...

820
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,860
with food that look like...

821
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,880
look more like a dog food...

822
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,200
food for wild animals.

823
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,240
All right?

824
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,980
Now the nation rises one...

825
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,000
to send their own song...

826
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
up to the White House...

827
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,220
Yeah, the nation's only White House...

828
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,860
to voice their discontent...

829
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,940
unto the president...

830
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,080
upon the burning question...

831
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,580
what has swept this continent?

832
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,140
Who put the bomb in the bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb...

833
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,820
Who put the ram in the ram...

834
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:22,900
and the dandy down...

835
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,720
Who put the bomb in the bomb, she-bomb, she-bomb...

836
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,340
Who put the dandy in the dandy, dandy, dandy...

837
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,720
Pooka Kucinich...

838
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,580
Blondes...

839
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,640
Brunettes...

840
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,560
Cool within truth of blam...

841
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,040
Peace out.

842
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,120
All right!

843
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,700
Kucinich...

844
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,580
Dean Clark...

845
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,480
Righteous...

846
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,080
Jackson...

847
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,880
Gary Coleman...

848
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,440
Gesundheit...

849
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,220
Galactus...

850
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,940
He knows all the names of all the many California politicians...

851
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,680
vying for that number one spot...

852
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,480
Mr. Grumpkin...

853
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,240
And Grumpkin...

854
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,480
Oh, yes, he's on the list...

855
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,820
as long as Mary Carey is also...

856
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,820
And then there's Dan Feinstein...

857
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,780
Not Diane Feinstein, mind you...

858
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,260
but Dan Feinstein...

859
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,480
Big ol' puffer...

860
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,620
You know, Robert Anton Wilson is running for governor of California now...

861
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,840
in the Guns and Dope Party...

862
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,820
Now, that's a great platform...

863
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,700
Of course, Peter Camejo, the Green Party candidate...

864
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,820
has also recommended legalizing marijuana...

865
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,800
and using it to boost...

866
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,800
California's sagging income belt...

867
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,480
And that man's whole body is full of chlorophyll...

868
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,360
We've had him registered here in Washington...

869
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,620
in the area...

870
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,760
But, you know, nobody lets him get out of the beltway...

871
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,580
and he loves it...

872
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,260
They'll take away my medicine...

873
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,700
when they pry it out of my cold, dead fingers...

874
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,300
You need to take your mental home now, my friend...

875
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,780
Nothing is real...

876
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,500
Not real...

877
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,780
, and nothing to get hung about...

878
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,360
Is he talking to me?

879
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,600
Say you're talking?

880
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,280
You're talking to me?

881
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,640
You talking to me?

882
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,620
You watching?

883
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,640
You talking to me?

884
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,700
Say you're talking?

885
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,360
You're talking to me?

886
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,480
Am I here?

887
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,720
I'm the only one loving you.

888
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,100
Who do you think you're talking to?

889
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,660
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, hmm?

890
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,080
K.

891
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:33,580
K.

892
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,200
K.

893
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,460
Actually, right now we're in what's called safe harbor.

894
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,480
We can say certain things, um, so long as we...

895
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,320
I don't know, somehow there's some kind of weird, uh, distinction between indecency and obscenity.

896
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,000
Where we... we can air indecency, but not obscenity.

897
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,760
Dodd-blangit-blag-stabbering-flag-baggin-snag-drag-or-baggin-snaggle.

898
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,440
Sha-cund-da-la-day-ba-soya.

899
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,540
Pick-da-min-dick-a-honda-sock-da-boom-da-lay-da-you-hoo.

900
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,580
I wonder if that...

901
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,580
And that applies to each and every one of you out there.

902
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,840
I wonder if that covers all languages.

903
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,140
And your grandma.

904
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,600
Yeah, she wears, uh, combat boots and swims out to meet troop ships.

905
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,160
Uh, cut your belly open and make you look at the black stuff you got in there.

906
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,980
Better to throw the food in the street than give the kiddies too much food.

907
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,400
Much to eat, but better belly burst and split than good meat spilled.

908
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,180
Well, since nobody seems to be, uh, taking the bait except that same guy over and over again, that...

909
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,160
Once again, that speaks volumes about the character of that caller.

910
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,080
The fact that he keeps taking the same bait over and over again.

911
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,060
Well, they don't wanna do anything. They don't wanna think about anything.

912
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:41,800
They just want to hear some tune pour like water through their, uh, wearied brains.

913
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,900
I got a tune we need to play, actually.

914
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,760
A tune?

915
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,380
This is, uh...

916
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,000
This is the world premiere of...

917
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,360
Of, um...

918
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,420
A song called Slackman.

919
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:01,020
Let me tell you how it will be.

920
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,620
Pleasure sauces.

921
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,500
Prop for free.

922
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,560
Cause he's the Slackman.

923
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:15,320
Yeah.

924
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,060
He's the Slackman.

925
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,380
Bobby Snow, the Yeti past.

926
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,640
Pig boys, they are all a guest.

927
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,600
Cause he's the Slackman.

928
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,800
Yeah.

929
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,700
He's the Slackman.

930
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,040
And if you hate your job...

931
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:46,900
Then quit.

932
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:51,100
Hey, it's Slack, if you got no friends, he's got your back.

933
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,620
If you're feeling down, you don't need Slack.

934
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,260
When you're down, you're down, on your mind on track.

935
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,560
Oh, there's a fact, Slack fact.

936
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:20,040
Slackman, oh yeah, he's the Slackman.

937
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,600
The tables, they will turn around.

938
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,540
Planet Earth, oh yeah, he's the Slackman.

939
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:31,540


940
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,020
The FedEx will soon be found.

941
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,880
Because he's the Slackman.

942
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,000
Oh yeah, he's the Slackman.

943
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,800
If you must die, here's what to do.

944
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:57,060
Jump in his pipe, let him smoke you.

945
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,540
Because he's the Slackman.

946
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:06,160
Oh yeah, he's the Slackman.

947
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:15,020
But his friends, they know his name is Bob Dobbs.

948
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:19,020
Bob Dobbs.

949
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,440
Bob Dobbs.

950
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,640
Bob Dobbs.

951
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:26,600
Bob Dobbs.

952
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,120


953
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,940
Bob Dobbs.

954
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:31,620
Bob Dobbs.

955
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:31,700
Bob Dobbs.

956
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,980
Bob Dobbs.

957
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,620
Bob Dobbs.

958
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,800
Bob Dobbs.

959
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,180
Bob Dobbs.

960
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:45,920
Bob Dobbs.

961
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,640
Bob Dobbs.

962
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:47,980
Bob Dobbs.

963
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,000
Bob Dobbs.

964
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,240
Bob Dobbs.

965
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:48,240


966
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:48,300
Bob Dobbs.

967
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:48,300


968
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:48,300


969
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:48,460
Bob Dobbs.

970
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,200
Anyway, what's important is it's not a bunch of intellectuals

971
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,940
and people who read too much Book of the Subgenius

972
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,220
or watch too much Star Trek or whatever.

973
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,060
It's not the extrapolation.

974
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,840
of what the future might hold, according to some college professor,

975
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,480
or predictions about things to come in society

976
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,520
by someone who thinks they know.

977
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:12,600
Friends, what is important in this life is dinner.

978
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:14,720
Dinner.

979
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,640
Now, in my case, that represents slack.

980
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:24,700
The core reality is the stuff that you tend to take for granted.

981
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:31,500
We are, this is Fox News coverage of Bob in New York.

982
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,560
This is his picture, the man in the brown suit there.

983
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:39,280
Reports are that Bob was bombed, very, very badly bombed,

984
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,220
just about an hour ago.

985
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,660
And you can see there Bob just lying on the ground

986
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:48,300
next to Ambassador Paul Bremer and trapped in New York.

987
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,760
And the more and more sounds we've been hearing

988
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,680
were from this sickish house.

989
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,060
For the Nellie Murr.

990
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,100
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

991
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,640
We created a race of robots.

992
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:03,900
Bob.

993
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:09,500
Their function is to patrol the planets in spaceships like this one

994
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,060
and preserve the peace.

995
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:15,560
And you can reach Bob and the Church of the Subgenius

996
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,700
at, got that pencil ready, friends?

997
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,440
Just write to

Ah, yes.

1018
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:21,400
Last year, every man, woman, and child recently wrote

1019
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,360
Dear Cleveland, week moving to Iowa,

1020
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,380
if you succeed,

1021
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:29,140
I agree with thousands of Iowans who are too high.

1022
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,420
To see the light of day, you must eliminate obnoxious Cleveland.

1023
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,520
It's a wonder anyone stays there at all.

1024
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,260
Paid for by Cleveland.

1025
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,100

00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,260

00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:21,780
Bob?

1053
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:56,400
Well, in the development of your, of the thrust of your rockets for the investigation of outer space.

1054
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,700
There may be some instances, for example, color television, where we're ahead of you.

1055
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:09,600
But in order for both of us, for both of us to benefit, for both of us to benefit, you never concede anything.

1056
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,700
In what are they ahead of us?

1057
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:12,920
Wrong, wrong.

1058
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:17,460
We are ahead of you in rockets as well as in this technique.

1059
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,540
I do not capitulate.

1060
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:25,920
I think it would be interesting for you to know that this program is now being recorded on Ampex ColorTaste.

1061
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:31,600
And it can be played back immediately and you can't tell that it is a live program.

1062
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:39,280
And the Soviet engineers came and saw it.

1063
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,020
No, don't you see?

1064
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:48,240
I share the enthusiasm of Soviet engineers about the cleverness of the American people.

1065
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,120
We always...

1066
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:49,520
We always...

1067
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:55,080
always knew they were clever. Foolish people could never raise the economy to

1068
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:01,700
such a level of achievement. But we too, as you know, don't kill flies with our

1069
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:11,600
nostrils. For 42 years we have gone ahead and we're worthy partners now. So let's

1070
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:17,060
compete. The system that will give the people more goods will be the better

1071
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,540
system and victorious.
