1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,060
Now, would you get your nose out of my amoeba?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:09,620
Before we begin today's lessons, I think there's one thing we should straighten out in regard to our relations with each other.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,300
Uh-oh.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:10,520
Oh!

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,700
Some of you seem to think there's something shameful about a little boy and a little girl liking one another.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,600
Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,600
Now, let's think about it for a minute.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,860
I want the reason.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,620
All of us are rather like one big family.

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,980
Oh, that's not good enough.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,460
And I think our family could be a lot happier...

12
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,380
None of your business.

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,940
...if we were kind, considerate, and friendly toward one another.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,180
I am not.

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,460
Well, you don't have to be.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
I wanted to hit somebody.

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,180
But I do think you should have mutual respect and learn to get along together.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,820
You're a smelly old ape.

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,560
You really told him.

20
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,600
You know, if you do that...

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,180
For two days.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,800
You'll be taking a big step toward...

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,320
The Self-Genius.

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,120
Power of...

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,380
The kind of men and women we want.

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,480
Yeah, because you're dirty.

27
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,740
All right, fellas, let's get going.

28
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,720
The following is copyright 1981 by the Subgenius Foundation.

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,620
Should you have comments, criticisms, or suggestions regarding the cassette book program,

30
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,300
please forward them directly to...

31
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,240
The Technical Staff.

32
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,360
Division for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.

33
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,860
Library.

34
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,580
Secretary of Congress.

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,860
Washington, D.C.

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,540
2-0-5-4-2.

37
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,040
Over 21 years...

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,980
This concludes the instruction.

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,040
Perhaps this is as good a time as any to take a few minutes to repeat a message

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,420
that seems frequently lost in the hustle and bustle of our daily activity.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,440
This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to.

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,940
It's intended to strengthen the lips.

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,820
Bring your lips far forward now with woo.

44
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,840
Woo.

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,400
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,520
For variation, emphasize every third or fourth woo.

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,180
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,520
And I have so much I would like to say, but I don't know how to say it.

49
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,540
So please bear with me if sometimes this doesn't make much sense.

50
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,880
It's realistic.

51
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,920
The second question is what?

52
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,520
What's happening?

53
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,820
Uh, before this...

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,100
Before this show, the Hour of Slack began in 1985,

55
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,040
we produced 13 90-minute albums on cassette tape,

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,040
which we called media barrages.

57
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,320
Some of those later became CDs, but not the one we're playing tonight.

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,660
Tonight we're exerting Media Barrage No. 1,

59
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,340
edited by me in 1981,

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,960
when there were only a few dozen subgeniuses,

61
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,760
and only about eight of them are on this tape.

62
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,360
Me, that is Reverend Ivan Stang,

63
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,620
Dr. Philo Drummond, Puzzling Evidence,

64
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,100
Lies, Glass Madness,

65
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,780
Pope Sternodocs,

66
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,660
Snavely Eklund,

67
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,320
Jane or Hypercletes,

68
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,340
and the late Dr. X.

69
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:21,060
In other words, what you're about to hear was our very first official subgenius album

70
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,740
made 35 years ago.

71
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,560
Praise Bob.

72
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,580
Is this a miracle?

73
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,360
What kind of a miracle?

74
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,220
Is this a parable?

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,340
What's the point?

76
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,220
Is this a letter?

77
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,580
What's the big idea?

78
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,160
What's he trying to communicate?

79
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,560
Because people like you are helping us stay on the radio.

80
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,740
You can't buy a miracle.

81
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,440
But you can certainly stand behind a miracle ministry.

82
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,480
Like a bunch of...

83
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,720
Uh, I'd like to go to the lake.

84
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,680
I'd like to go to the stage.

85
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,440
Go walking around.

86
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:55,820
I'd like to go to the beach.

87
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:55,820


88
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:55,820


89
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:55,820


90
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:55,820


91
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,300
Uh, yeah.

92
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,300


93
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,620
I'm honestly a bit down.

94
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,280
As the weather keeps around me...

95
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,280
Um...

96
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,220
I will see you soon.

97
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,900
Um, so nice to meet you.

98
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,340
Have a some fun.

99
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,700
We got to get going.

100
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay, awesome.

101
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:25,360
So nice seeing you.

102
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,640
Chaotic times.

103
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,080
Praise the Lord.

104
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,140
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.

105
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,460
Amen.

106
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,900
They're going to get worse and worse.

107
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:46,320
Opium is still the primary plan that the United States has for dealing with its people in the event of a nuclear attack.

108
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,660
There has been six cases of breast cancer, one bladder cancer, and one throat cancer.

109
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,880
There is a God who is a God of love, and there is a God who is a God of judgment.

110
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,240
Two sides.

111
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,600
Mockery of everything that's decent and wholesome.

112
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:14,260
I challenge you to point out national talk shows that do not belittle sexual fidelity, purity.

113
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,540
That they do not belittle the marriage union and the family lifestyle.

114
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,540
That they don't literally flaunt illicit lifestyles.

115
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,080
I mean, I challenge you to show me.

116
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,300
A talk show that doesn't make light of God.

117
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,220
The Subgenius Foundation.

118
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,080
The Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond.

119
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,900
And they are, as we mentioned before, the dual heads of the Subgenius Foundation.

120
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,740
You don't know about the school book suppositories.

121
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,260
Watch out for all the leads.

122
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,960
Because I'm number 6742 to witness it.

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,260
And they're coming.

124
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,240
Coming after me.

125
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,500
So call their derby.

126
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,740
Hello there, Palo Du.

127
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,020
We're picking up all your trash.

128
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,260
With us, the leader and the idea are one.

129
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,140
And every party leader must do what the leader orders.

130
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,660
Subgenius culture.

131
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,860
Subgenius.

132
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,460
Mr. Chairman.

133
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,500
Gentlemen.

134
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,640
I must admit.

135
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,160
I know.

136
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,240
I'm very little at this time.

137
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,740
It doesn't make fun of godly laws.

138
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,160
Agreed.

139
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,260
They laugh at us.

140
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:29,460
I agree.

141
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,820
They make a mockery of us.

142
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,100
Now, we don't have to watch it.

143
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,800
We can turn it off.

144
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,560
Who will pay to clean up the contaminated land?

145
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,800
And because of the equal time provision in the law, we can't show you the taped interviews.

146
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,560
Follow issue.

147
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,400
787-1270 is the number.

148
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,980
Call us and talk about what you'd wish.

149
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,360
Go ahead.

150
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,040
I'm going to point out that a lot of people worry about the one world government that the conspiracy is trying to get across on us.

151
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,820
And we suspect that the only thing that can fight a one world government is going to be a one world religion.

152
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,660
And of course, that's what the subgenius, the church of the subgenius is here for.

153
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:10,880
I'm telling you, all other gods besides Jehovah and his son Jesus Christ are strange gods.

154
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,640
Question number two.

155
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:23,020
Do you believe in the virgin birth of Jesus Christ and the death and the resurrection of Jesus?

156
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,020


157
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,020


158
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,020


159
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,880
And the resurrection, barrel and a resurrection.

160
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,900
Sir, we absolutely believe in everything.

161
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,540
We believe in it wholeheartedly.

162
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:32,460


163
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:32,460


164
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,400
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,680
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,700
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,400
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:41,900


169
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,500
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:00,480
The voice analyzer was designed by our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

172
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,580
We have to make clear from the beginning that we are not really the founders.

173
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,700
We were just hired to promote the word of Bob.

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,540
Okay, that then brings me to this.

175
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:16,200
It is the Subgenius Foundation is the publishing and PR firm of the Church of the Subgenius.

176
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,000
So would you tell me then what is the Church of the Subgenius?

177
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,940
It was founded by Bob.

178
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,400
Bob founded the church mainly to help unmask the conspiracy.

179
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,040
And we're talking about the conspiracy, the one behind the other conspiracy.

180
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,500
Oh, that's the one.

181
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,560
To unmask the conspiracy and to get us all a little bit of slack.

182
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,600
Slack through any means we can make do with.

183
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,260
Time control is one of the most spectacular and hard to achieve ones.

184
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,200
We're going to go into some depth before the evening is over,

185
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,700
defining, and as I say deeply,

186
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,380
the terms, uh, slack, and what was the other?

187
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,160
Time control.

188
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,800
Time control.

189
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,220
Right.

190
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,820
Absolutely.

191
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,860
Those are things that I, of course, think we need to deal with.

192
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,920
The use of genius and my subgenius and my subpenius.

193
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,760
The use of penis and my subpenius and my subpenius.

194
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,140
I must love to know!

195
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,020
I must love to know!

196
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,020


197
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,740
I must love to know!

198
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:20,920
I must love to know!

199
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,960
Now we must vote to know.

200
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,640
Grandfather, all the whites aren't crazy.

201
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,840
I'm glad to hear that, my son.

202
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,800
I thought they were.

203
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,080
Oh, no.

204
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,480
I know of one who is as brave as any human being.

205
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,140
I'd like to meet this man and smoke with him.

206
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,060
Bob started the church about 20 or 30 years ago.

207
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,120
We've got a picture of him here.

208
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,040
We'll hold it up so everybody on the radio can see him.

209
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
Hold it up to the left part of the radio there.

210
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,240
Can you see that?

211
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,120
You can see that he's a really handsome guy.

212
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,800
He looks a lot like George Noll.

213
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,700
He has a pie and smiling.

214
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,180
He's got what some people call a sinister grin.

215
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,140
Jack Armstrong, all-American boy.

216
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,660
He looks better.

217
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,980
He lives.

218
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,780
He lives.

219
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,060
I can face.

220
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,700
But it's just a sin.

221
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,460
And you just can't call it anything else.

222
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,080
Many of you in this stadium have been deceived.

223
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,880
Perhaps you've been deceived by evangelists masquerading as angels of light.

224
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,120
Hanuman Likova, the ninth seed.

225
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,860
The only cult they want to talk about.

226
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,180
Is the subgenius foundation.

227
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,080
The church of the subgenius.

228
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,120
And the only reason they talk about it is for the money.

229
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,000
We're going to go to the phones right now.

230
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,100
Good evening.

231
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,040
You're on KFJZ with Mr. Opinion and Dr. Philo Drummond and the Reverend Arnold Stang.

232
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,720
Ivan Stang.

233
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,800
I have a question for Mr. Drummond.

234
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,760
Yes.

235
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,300
Go ahead.

236
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,820
Are you Mr. Drummond?

237
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,400
That's right.

238
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,620
I'm calling from Dallas.

239
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,560
What's your question?

240
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,620
Well, do you work on spiritual problems?

241
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:15,960
Are you spiritual?

242
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,960
Or do you just work on wallets?

243
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,660
We will help you out spiritually.

244
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,100
Of course, it helps if we can have some financial assistance.

245
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,120
We sell $10 memberships.

246
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,720
And once you start getting our newsletter, you start receiving lessons on how to conduct

247
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,540
your life in the most beneficial way for both you and us.

248
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,580
And regardless of what you're looking for.

249
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,500
Doug Smith says we're different.

250
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,180
Doug's right, Virgil.

251
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,860
We are different.

252
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,660
Thanks to Jesus, the genetic engineering corporation of American states.

253
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,680
Mommy too?

254
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,200
Yep, the whole family.

255
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,120
Is everybody like us?

256
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,600
No, son, but we're working on it, round the clock.

257
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,240
Soon everyone will be a superior biospecies.

258
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,500
Wowee.

259
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,560
I want to be a genetic engineer just like you, Pop.

260
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,880
You will, Virg, if you don't baggy.

261
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,040
It can lead to photon confusion.

262
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,160
Don't baggy.

263
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


264
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


265
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


266
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


267
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


268
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


269
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


270
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


271
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


272
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


273
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


274
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


275
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


276
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,160


277
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,440
.

278
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,180
for a healthier, happier, bio-superior.

279
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,240
Hi!

280
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,100
You say you're looking for excitement, adventure, business opportunities,

281
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,300
and a real nice place to raise the kids?

282
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,340
Well, explore no more.

283
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,140
We're there already.

284
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,700
Let's visit the world of the future.

285
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,980
World of the future.

286
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,220
Yes, this bustling world of a thousand moods

287
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,380
reflects the dreams of its ambitious inhabitants,

288
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,580
dreams already realized of man's triumph over nature,

289
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,080
where humans no longer suffer self-inflicted pains,

290
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,020
where one is made to enjoy life.

291
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:05,980
Hallelujah!

292
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,700
All the signs point to serious health damage.

293
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,020
There are no winners in a nuclear war.

294
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,000
The minute you have another war,

295
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,420
there's not going to be any world left, I don't think,

296
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,480
because we're going to blow one another to pieces.

297
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,320
Because in this day and time,

298
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,720
we don't know what we're going to come to.

299
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,120
There's not going to be anything left for the kids.

300
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,680
I mean, there's not going to be a world left.

301
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,860
And we're all going to end up digging our own holes.

302
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,260
As soon as we dig them, they're going to fall in on us.

303
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,140
I don't think anybody would know what to do,

304
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,060
even possibly the president.

305
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,300
The only true religion is guns.

306
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,420
The guns create your own reality.

307
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,260
If I had a gun,

308
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,380
I'd create my own reality.

309
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,480
Crude to the loon.

310
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,000
Simple.

311
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,980
You have a gun,

312
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,000
you point it at their head,

313
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,620
and you're in control.

314
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,480
I would listen to television and watch it.

315
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,780
Tune us in on the radio dive.

316
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,400
We got charisma, we got style.

317
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,200
Well, people,

318
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,000
we'll make you feel better for a while.

319
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,700
Put your hands,

320
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,740
put your hands on the radio.

321
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,020
Put your hands,

322
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,060
put your hands on the radio.

323
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,180
Put your hands,

324
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,520
put your hands on the radio.

325
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,700
Put your hands,

326
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,660
put your hands on the radio.

327
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,100
Put your hands,

328
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,100


329
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,440
Those are the Pink Boys from right here in Dallas.

330
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,380
And put your hand on the radio.

331
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,300
Before that, the B-52s in private Idaho.

332
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,280
And of course, Devo.

333
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,560
And one of the earlier more primitive versions of Mongo-ite.

334
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,920
This is the Rock and Roll Alternative.

335
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,640
My name is George.

336
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,100
And tonight,

337
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,680
on the subject of the Pink Boys and all that,

338
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,360
we have in the studio with us

339
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,660
Ivan Stang and Philo Drummond from the Church of the Subgenius.

340
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,740
Hi, guys.

341
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,500
How you doing, George?

342
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,700
Oh, just fine.

343
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,520
Say, a lot of people have been wondering,

344
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,240
just what is the Church of the Subgenius?

345
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,360
Well, George, if we could describe the Church of the Subgenius in one sentence,

346
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,620
we'd be rich by now.

347
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,320
As it is, we're explaining it in long-winded sentences,

348
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,420
and we're getting rich kind of half.

349
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,840
Half fast.

350
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,780
It's kind of a scam, religious cult company, whatever you want to get into.

351
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,740
It's the first industrial church.

352
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,200
That's right.

353
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,460
We're hoping to make a lot of money real fast.

354
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:32,240
And if we can wake up ten more people out there in the listening audience tonight,

355
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,080
we will have achieved our goal for the evening.

356
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,500
What is the church's priorities?

357
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,640
What's important to you guys?

358
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,460
Mainly the quest for slack.

359
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,380
The casting out of false prophets.

360
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,320
And controlling time.

361
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,580
Those are our three main goals, I guess.

362
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,140
Slack.

363
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,360
Slack.

364
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,000
It's something we all need.

365
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,700
And I know that lots of people out there listening right now are feeling a terrible shortage of slack.

366
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,940
Slack is something you can't get enough of.

367
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,420
That's right.

368
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,020
That's right.

369
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,900
And we can help them to get slack, George.

370
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:08,320
Man, the world is filled with a bunch of kooky ideas and concepts about the Bible.

371
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:14,580
And I can't believe the weird things that people get in their heads

372
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,780
and the weird things that people are teaching.

373
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,640
Why do you think that these people, aside from that rather vague reference in the Bible,

374
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,120
why do you think these fallen angels have stayed around to do us in, so to speak?

375
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,440
Well, they figure that this planet is theirs to loot

376
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,780
and that the people of Earth, we Earth people, are their slaves.

377
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:43,700
And I think the past history of all the records of the wars and famines and things that were created deliberately by them,

378
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,300
I think, bears it out.

379
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:52,720
Not only that, Joe, besides the Bible, there's also other ancient works.

380
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,960
That's what I like about the Word of God.

381
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,900
There's nothing fakey about this thing, man.

382
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,080
You talk about telling it like it is.

383
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,660
See, it hangs the dirty wash right out the front bay window for everybody to see.

384
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,580
And ladies and gentlemen, this is a transmission that we picked up, obviously, from space beings.

385
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,640
That's right.

386
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,440
And we want, when 1998 comes, we want subgeniuses to be in positions of power

387
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,040
so that this alien technology is not abused.

388
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,040
And Bob tells us what we need to know to get into that position.

389
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,280
One year ago, we were obscure nobodies, and now we're secretly famous.

390
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,960
That's right. And we've got hundreds of dollars at our disposal.

391
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,300
And close to thousands upon dozens of members as well.

392
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,520
That's exactly right. We are international now.

393
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,380
Every state in the Union is represented on our mailing list in 12 foreign countries.

394
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,000
That is strictly incredible.

395
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,680
And what are the various ranks in the Church?

396
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,360
Well, of course, Bob is our high-E poppin' guru.

397
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,240
He's the saint of sales.

398
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,480
That's right. The ultimate businessman.

399
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,540
Very few people are able to meet Bob.

400
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,680
He is pretty hard to get a hold of.

401
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,720
He's like most cult leaders.

402
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,620
Dr. Drummond here is the...

403
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,600
He communicates with me via telepathic transmissions beamed into my skull.

404
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,260
And so what we get from him is usually second-hand information.

405
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,360
He in turn is like a shortwave radio picking up signals from famous dead holy men,

406
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,840
living holy men, creatures from outer space,

407
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,800
advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures from within the hollow earth.

408
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,680
Waiting for the UFO.

409
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,720
Waiting for the UFOs.

410
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:43,680
Waiting for the UFOs.

411
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,160
And they use the latest components.

412
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,480
I feel like a new machine.

413
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,900
Go now, quickly.

414
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,100
The survival of our galaxy is in your hands.

415
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,600
Thanks, and I'll try to live up to that.

416
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,020
Jeez.

417
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,140
Well, the Church is going pretty good.

418
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,160
How has your life changed since dogs came into your life?

419
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,100
Crowds?

420
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,380
I've realized that the exes are a reality,

421
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,700
and that my life is geared towards their arrival.

422
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,360
I redefined my own space and was able to center my being.

423
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:32,360
I was really able to integrate all my anti-societal...

424
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,960
I'm gonna kill everybody here!

425
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,620
When I first heard Bob on the radio,

426
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,260
he said that he could heal,

427
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,040
and told me to put my hand on the radio

428
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,700
so that the Bob energy could come out through the airwaves.

429
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,920
Death to the fascist earthworms!

430
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,000
Many of you in this stadium have been deceived.

431
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,420
Put your hands on the radio!

432
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,840
Well, let me ask you, sir, are you having some type of problem in your life now?

433
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,940
If I have a triple-steer,

434
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,140
I'm having a spiritual problem right now.

435
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,640
Okay, give us some idea of the nature of the problem.

436
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,060
Well, I'm afraid of God.

437
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,020
Oh, you are?

438
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,600
Yeah.

439
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,040
Well, there's a lot of people out there just like you.

440
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,040
I tell you what, if you would, put your hands on the radio right now.

441
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,620
We can help you out.

442
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,460
I think we're being sold a bill, a big bill of goods.

443
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,620
We can help you out.

444
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,580
We can help you out.

445
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:36,920
We can help you out.

446
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:36,920


447
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:36,920


448
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:36,920


449
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,740
Really now, are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks or do you have...

450
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,060
Mr. Wilsey, isn't it a fact really that you've invented this whole thing,

451
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,680
that you've thought up all these little gimmicks,

452
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,360
and you're taking advantage of a lot of ignorant people by getting money out of them,

453
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,940
people who believe in you and your silly preachings?

454
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,460
No, it isn't, Joe.

455
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:04,340
The Illuminati will be unmasked, and the subgenius cult will have a lot to do with that.

456
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,640
Bob is going to see that the whole conspiracy, the Illuminati, the trilaterals, you name it,

457
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,820
the guys that drive up and down the street selling ice cream, all of that will be exposed.

458
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,360
That's what America needs, to have their brains washed,

459
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,180
clean out all that filth and all that garbage and all that fear

460
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,320
and all that sickness and perversion and all that junk that comes from the pit of hell.

461
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,140
I'm completely organized.

462
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,180
I can perform marriages.

463
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,340
I can legally perform marriages, and I can also ordain people.

464
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,060
And that's what we've been doing.

465
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,400
When you become a $10 member, we send you a little card that says you're a minister.

466
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,540
That loosely explains that.

467
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,980
Then, Dr. Drummond, could you explain your doctorate?

468
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm not really a medical doctor, but more a PhD-type doctor.

469
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:59,920
I obtained my PhD at Dobbstown Community College, and my PhD was in journalism.

470
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,880
We sell doctorates, too.

471
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,960
What's a good doctorate going for now? $6?

472
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,420
Yeah, $6. We sell about the cheapest doctorates on the market.

473
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,740
Most of them are $20 to $30.

474
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,960
But the Diploma Gilda Edged or plain?

475
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,600
It's plain, but it's got more Bob pin on it than you can imagine.

476
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,680
It takes about three hours to read, and it tells you in great detail what sort of a subgenius you are.

477
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,080
Praise doctors for Bob!

478
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,820
In the Doctors for Bob album, what is subgenius?

479
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,380
It's Doctors for Bob!

480
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,580
Here's the Doctors for Bob one of those words.

481
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,840
You think you can know a subgenius without knowing Doctors for Bob?

482
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,060
Well, you're wrong!

483
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,400
What is Doctors for Bob?

484
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,300
Doctors for Bob!

485
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,020
What is Doctors for Bob?

486
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,580
Doctors for Bob!

487
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,620
Only we know what we don't know.

488
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:01,000
And when we do know it, we shall find out later just exactly what it was that we didn't know.

489
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:15,320
But in the meantime, we shall experiment further and delve into the deeper recesses of the human mind to find out exactly what causes this device not to function properly.

490
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,720
Could it be a malfunction of the foot gland or the nose gland?

491
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:29,300
Yes, possibly you did not know that the nose and the feet are true glands of the human body.

492
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:40,500
And only after permanent foot and nose glandscaping can you know how to make your feet smell and your nose run.

493
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,440
Which would mean possibly that you were backwards or built upside down.

494
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:56,720
But we'll delve further into that at the end of the broadcast when you and I cannot hear each other.

495
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,620
Doctors for Bob!

496
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:15,520
And we can get into this too, this psychoneurotic mastosurgery, the techniques of which has been developed by the many great doctors who have come over to Dobbs and from many of the other religious cults around the world.

497
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,380
I ain't been the same since I had my frontal lobotomy.

498
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:26,100
And we've got Europeans and Lithuanians and little Mexican doctors and we've got rock and roll star doctors.

499
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,520
And...

500
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:33,720
And ice doctors and the big doctors and the doctors of the trees and the tree walking brain socket doctors.

501
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,880
And we've got a song about doctors.

502
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,460
And here, hyperclites, here it is.

503
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,960
Doctors for Bob.

504
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,780
Doctors for Bob and everything real in my life.

505
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,380
Doctors for Bob.

506
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,320
Doctors for Bob and everything real in my life.

507
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,700
Oh, real in my life.

508
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,300
Damn pickup truck come out blue done run over my wife.

509
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,100
He's got the blues cause they run over his wife.

510
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,160
Some of you are going to get mad at me.

511
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,120
Jesus ain't in the church.

512
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,940
Don't turn the radio off.

513
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,700
Keep it on.

514
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,520
And I wouldn't infer that our secondary state is antichrist.

515
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,040
But I'm telling you that preparations are being made.

516
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:42,380
And that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand.

517
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,360
And that if you plan to get saved, you had better do it now.

518
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,920
There will be a day not in the too far distance.

519
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,100
There will be a day not in the too far distance.

520
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,460
And a future in which antichrist will be revealed.

521
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,600
And the mark of the beast will be introduced.

522
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,160
And people will have a number in their hands and in their foreheads.

523
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,580
They'll be given a considerized number if you please.

524
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,940
That will entitle them to do business in this world.

525
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,100
And without it, you can starve.

526
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,600
We have a lot to do in a very short time.

527
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,120
Boy, you are kidding.

528
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,480
And that's the way I felt for quite a while.

529
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,520
Get ready to ease out of orbit.

530
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,280
Ah, you bet, honey.

531
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,120
That's what we're going to try to do.

532
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,000
I have never flown a city before.

533
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,580
Many of you in this stadium have been deceived.

534
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,000
I think they'll pass the $10 bridge.

535
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,040
The original concept was that...

536
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,100
Throughout history, all great geniuses...

537
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,400
had somebody at their side that was kind of steering them.

538
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,220
You know what I mean?

539
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,440
So you say that person is...

540
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,300
That was the subgenius. He was the guy that was really...

541
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,740
He was making sure the genius was used to his proper potential.

542
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,340
Right.

543
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,380
And for the right reason.

544
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,420
That's why my name is misleading, you know.

545
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:15,880
Now, I want you to hear a little of the service where the Holy Spirit was using me.

546
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,480
With the gift of discernment.

547
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,600
I was ministering in the Spirit.

548
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,840
God was showing me things about people I didn't know.

549
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,380
I'd never seen before, but the Lord was talking to me.

550
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,280
God was talking and I was walking.

551
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,200
Listen to a little of this right now.

552
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,720
My sister, I don't know anything about you.

553
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,500
I haven't talked with you.

554
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,080
As far as I know, you haven't told him...

555
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,940
Have you told him, my staff, anything about yourself?

556
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,060
You haven't.

557
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,280
Then if I know anything about you, it would be because the Spirit of the Lord has led me to you today.

558
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,380
Am I right?

559
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,340
You're in dire financial...

560
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,700
She wasn't supposed to say anything.

561
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,280
I'm in dire financial need, baby.

562
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,800
...things that you possess if you don't cope with some money pretty soon.

563
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,400
And you have come to the end of your rope.

564
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,700
You don't know which way to turn.

565
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,700
Give me money.

566
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,900
It's starting to affect your nerves.

567
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,420
It's affecting my mind.

568
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,280
And sleepless nights.

569
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,820
It's affecting my mind.

570
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,560
I want to kill my husband.

571
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,140
Today we're going to put this in the hand of God.

572
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,940
I'll kill my husband.

573
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:26,400
In the Bible, in two different places, a handful of meal brought a miracle.

574
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,820
I want you to hold that envelope open.

575
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,260
That's right.

576
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,120
Please save my life.

577
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,760
I'm going to give you a handful of meal.

578
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,520
Save my life!

579
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,880
I'm going to pour it in this envelope.

580
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,440
Now.

581
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,420
Amen.

582
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,260
Tell him the truth.

583
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,580
I know you're telling the truth.

584
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
That's what's bad.

585
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,440
That's what's bad.

586
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:52,060
From now on, every new addition to our demand for energy will be met from our own production

587
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,460
and our own conservation.

588
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,300
There's the fact that the trial agents and some of the other people that you've named

589
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,520
are actually being controlled by aliens from outer space.

590
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
By UFO agents.

591
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,040
There's nothing to be afraid of.

592
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,080
We're not going to hurt you.

593
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,360
But once you understand, you'll be grateful.

594
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,600
Let us go!

595
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,580
We'll leave town.

596
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,320
We won't come back.

597
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,640
We can't let you go.

598
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,920
You're dangerous to us.

599
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,820
Don't fight it Miles, it's no use

600
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,480
Sooner or later you'll have to go to sleep

601
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,880
Subgeniuses strike out on their own too

602
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,160
There's rogue subgeniuses

603
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,220
In fact they've gone

604
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,400
They were originally subgeniuses

605
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,840
That went off the deep end

606
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,200
Like Howard Hughes

607
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,780
Jack the Ripper

608
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,680
Adolf Hitler

609
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,120
Richard Nixon

610
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,900
For sure would be one

611
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,260
And not just crazy people

612
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,360
Muhammad Ali

613
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah, renegades, Muhammad Ali

614
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,720
He's a renegade subgenius

615
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,780
But these people don't know they're subgeniuses

616
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,140
No, they don't

617
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,940
They may know

618
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,140
They may know, and for all we know

619
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,640
They're out there reading stuff

620
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,160
The 5th Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius

621
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,800
Of Little Rock

622
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,600
And before we begin this sacred spouting

623
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,800
I think that we should all

624
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,320
Bow our heads

625
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,360
And let's all have a minute of noise

626
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,240
Ah!

627
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,120
First we have a schisming member of the church here

628
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,740
This is uh

629
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,700
Did you introduce yourself?

630
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:31,920
No

631
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,000
Holy Master

632
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,740
Do not listen to this man

633
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,940
This man is a retrogrant

634
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,340
This is an anti-democracy

635
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,420
This is anti-Dobbs speaking to you

636
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,520
Here we've got stereo here

637
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,700
This is the anti-Dobbs

638
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,880
Take this note

639
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,660
This one here

640
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:49,840
No

641
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,540
This one

642
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:52,420
Okay

643
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,180
The true Dobbs is in the right channel now

644
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,060
True Dobbs

645
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,060
All Dobbs followers to the right

646
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,460
Uh, hello, hello Reverend Doug

647
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,160
This is Edwin

648
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,240
Better known as Savage Pencil

649
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,140
Speaking to you from you in a little room in

650
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,980
Belsize Park, London

651
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,560
Where I live

652
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,340
Anyway, I'd just like to thank you very much for speaking to me today

653
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,800
And for sending me all those really great subgenius things

654
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,880
Including the absolutely work of art stock fist brochure

655
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,300
And all the other things

656
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,060
I've got them all plastered up everywhere

657
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,080
I've been telling everybody about them

658
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,420
I've been mumbling about subgenius and everything to many people

659
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,220
With your permission, the Reverend Bob and your good selves

660
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,820
May be popping up in a future rock and roll zoo

661
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,960
This man has something to say

662
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,600
When I came up here this morning

663
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,260
I knew that Bob was straight

664
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,100
But you know something

665
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,460
I serve a miracle working God

666
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,120
High as a star, high as a star

667
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,760
You can never get higher than a star

668
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,220
God bless you

669
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,800
And I love you children

670
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,140
That's a hell of a testimonial I see, Fred

671
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,100
Enterprise has explored the depths of the 23rd century for the Federation

672
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,860
Of the first last work ofina

673
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,800
Where there once you found You were never too far from home

674
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:18,920
I was only a little far from home

675
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,260
But I pull you over to thank you

676
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,940
And I hope that our world has a friend like you

677
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:43,320
To say hi to for the first time in my life

678
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,140
All right, that's the youngest member.

679
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,880
Channel 7's still the one.

680
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,900
I'm Snabley and Eklund.

681
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,300
I'm over-read Snabley and Eklund.

682
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,440
And we were at the Hall High School library today,

683
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,480
and we put lots of subgenius literature in all of the books.

684
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,680
All around, we have miniature Dobbs heads floating everywhere.

685
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,420
Miniature Dobbs heads everywhere you go, there's a miniature Dobbs head.

686
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,740
Begin by settling back comfortably.

687
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,740
Get as comfortable as you can.

688
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,740
Well, we're getting comfortable now.

689
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,060
Hey, I feel better already, Paul.

690
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,140
You know that we're here on Telegraph Avenue and the music's cool.

691
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,560
Oh, wow, I can feel it coming on.

692
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,340
Must be a whole trip here.

693
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,740
It's like being on acid ice.

694
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,720
Yeah.

695
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,160
Doing all right, brother.

696
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,140
This is the post office.

697
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,680
It's all yours, Terry.

698
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,000
We're going to park here very carefully and very quickly

699
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,380
so we can run across the street

700
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:52,540
and plaster Bob's little face all over the billboard.

701
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,200
We're back here at the studio

702
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,380
trying to clean up the mess after the explosion,

703
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,460
but we did get Bob all over two billboards

704
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,760
right by Tower Records,

705
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,680
and we did take an authenticating photograph,

706
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,640
which, if it comes out, I will send to you.

707
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,140
And you can see Bob spread out all over Berkeley.

708
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,400
And I was relating to you on the tape.

709
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,520
It may come up later anyway

710
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,720
that I've been putting Bob all over California.

711
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,160
You can see those stars so clearly.

712
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,860
It's not at all like on Earth.

713
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,600
Look at that cloudy planet go by.

714
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,020
Gee, this is really inspiring,

715
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,700
and I'm glad to be talking to you here from Star Deck One.

716
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,200
My lord.

717
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,020
Yes?

718
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,540
Yes, Elric?

719
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,280
A floating ship is about to crash into us.

720
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,160
Oh, pay no attention to it.

721
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,540
So done!

722
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,060
Yes, my lord.

723
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,380
These droids get so upset

724
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,620
when the least little thing goes wrong.

725
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,840
But anyway, it's a...

726
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,800
Wow, that is pretty awesome.

727
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,220
Look, it's...

728
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,240
Goddamn!

729
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,620
All systems prepare for full power.

730
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,340
Okay.

731
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,280
Okay.

732
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,860
Give me Mach 1, 2.

733
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,180
3.

734
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,880
Charlie Baker, 749.

735
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:15,540
I think we maintained a hit there on starboard.

736
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,600
Put up full force phasers.

737
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,920
Call Bob!

738
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,900
Call Bob!

739
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,460
Let's lock in these controls.

740
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,760
Move it out.

741
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,780
Okay, Bob.

742
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,920
Okay.

743
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,620
Let's go.

744
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,720
Bob.

745
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,220
Bob flies us.

746
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,300
Bob flies standing up.

747
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,800
That's incredible.

748
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,400
Look at this.

749
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,880
I'm not worried because I know...

750
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,220
Oh, the force field wasn't on.

751
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,040
There.

752
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,820
Now it's on.

753
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,160
It's okay.

754
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,220
Come back, you fools!

755
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,000
You cowards!

756
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,160
Come back, my lord!

757
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:51,920
Listen to him.

758
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,240
Come on, you'll be destroyed!

759
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,260
Let's go!

760
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,000
Well, Doug, we found Bob.

761
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,520
Do you want to say anything to Doug?

762
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,720
He's really appreciated, I think,

763
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,400
because he's really good.

764
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,720
Hi there, Doug.

765
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,500
I'm Bob.

766
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,720
I'm better than you've ever heard of.

767
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,140
Believe me, I am.

768
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,180
I'm a native.

769
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,440
Thank you.

770
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,580
I'm...

771
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,760
He isn't here.

772
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,680
Yes, he is.

773
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,940
Probably not for a few days.

774
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,460
No, right now.

775
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,320
Try Madison, Wisconsin...

776
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,580
No.

777
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,300
Try Dallas, Texas.

778
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,420
Victor Street.

779
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:43,020
Oh, Bob will kick their asses

780
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,580
and take their money.

781
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,440
Yeah.

782
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,920
Yeah.

783
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,220
Yeah.

784
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,880
Yeah.

785
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,680
Yeah.

786
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,200
Yeah.

787
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,760
Yeah.

788
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:05,940
Yeah.

789
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


790
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


791
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


792
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


793
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


794
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


795
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


796
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


797
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


798
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


799
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


800
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


801
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


802
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000


803
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,320
you know I'm...

804
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,620
Yeah.

805
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,260
I think I found the bank.

806
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:17,260


807
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:35,980
And, uh, we bring the cardboard plating back along with us.

808
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,220
And I

809
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,340
Since he came

810
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,560
Through my life

811
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,860
I've quit

812
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,260
Selling wrenches

813
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,640
And I've got

814
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,880
The micro-encapsulated

815
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,540
Feeling

816
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,080
About things

817
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,320
Now to you

818
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,800
I'm trying to tell you

819
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,780
About dogs

820
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,240
Dogs

821
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,520
Dogs

822
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,580
Who know

823
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,720
What's going on

824
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,960
This time

825
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,380
You know

826
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,700
Hmm

827
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,680
Hmm

828
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,500
Hmm

829
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,040
Hmm

830
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,680
Hmm

831
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,120
Hmm

832
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,280
Hmm

833
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


834
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


835
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


836
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


837
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300

00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


840
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


841
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


842
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


843
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


844
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


845
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


846
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


847
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


848
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


849
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


850
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


851
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,300


852
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,600
Hmm

853
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:34,720
Hmm

854
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,680
Hmm

855
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680


856
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680


857
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680


858
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680


859
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680


860
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680


861
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680


862
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680


863
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680


864
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680

00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680


869
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680


870
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680


871
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680

00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:36,680

00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,540
I've

883
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,640
Got to

884
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,380
Get some

885
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,360
Slack

886
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,680
In case

887
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,180
You couldn't tell

888
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,760
That's what

889
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,840
I lack

890
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,980
You know

891
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,860
Maybe

892
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,680
This subgenious

893
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,100
Stuff

894
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,100
That we've been

895
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,740
Getting involved

896
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,200
In

Maybe

908
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,960
This isn't Bob

909
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,880
Bob are you in here?

910
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,400
No

911
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,420
Bob

912
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,540
Where's Bob?

913
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,420
Are you here Bob?

914
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,960
No I don't think

915
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,400
Bob's here

916
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,800
I can't find Bob

917
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,360
Anywhere

918
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,300
Can you hear me?

919
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:25,940
Oh Bob

920
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,120
Dr. Drummond

921
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,840
Can you hear me?

922
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,560
Dr. Drummond

923
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,580
Is that a special room?

924
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,360
Oh the great

925
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,280
Stinky

926
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:33,880
Bob-o

00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,880
Oh Bob

Oh Bob

929
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,560
I need some money

930
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,300
I need some slack

931
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:38,840
Oh Bob

932
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,980
Bob I need some money

933
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,320
Give me food

934
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,920
Give me some money

935
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,280
Bob

936
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,100
Oh

937
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,220
Bob

938
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,440
Bob

939
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,960
Bob

940
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,180
Bob

941
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:00,460
Bob

942
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,960
Bob

943
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,300
Bob

944
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,300


945
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,300


946
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,300


947
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,820
Bob

948
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,020
Bob's my friend

949
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,640
Bob's my friend

950
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,480
Oh Bob

951
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,100
Thanks for being my friend Bob

952
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,680
Bob's my friend

953
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,060
And he's leading me somewhere

954
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,820
Where are we going Bob?

955
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,080
Is he waiting there for me?

956
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,920
He's not waiting anymore

957
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,000
Did he go up and go home?

958
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:30,500
Bob's my friend

959
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,420
And he's leading me somewhere

960
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:32,800
Bob went to vote

961
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,140
Bob went to vote

962
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:33,280
Bob went to vote

963
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,280


964
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,500
And he went

965
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,060
He'll be back shortly

966
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,460
Oh okay

967
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,180
In the white form

968
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,020
Bob left you a doughnut Bob

969
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,720
Bob went to vote

970
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,880
Bob can stop the aliens From killing me

971
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,920
Bob can save me

972
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,600
Bob can s Save Me

973
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,600


974
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,600


975
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,600


976
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,900

Bobby Bobby Bobby Bobby Bobby Bobby Bobby Bobby Bobby Bobby Bobby Bobby τον

982
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,460
Let's all go riding in the Bobmobile.

983
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,440
You don't need gas in the Bobmobile.

984
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,060
Oh, the wonderful, wonderful Bobmobile.

985
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,340
You don't need no gas.

986
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,360
You don't need no wind.

987
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,040
You don't need no money when you're in the Bobmobile.

988
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,280
When you're in the Bobmobile.

989
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,140
Hey.

990
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,340
Look.

991
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,680
Up over the car.

992
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,320
The back again.

993
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,040
Ah!

994
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:51,660
Ah!

995
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,840
Oh, Bob.

996
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:56,900
Hey, Bob.

997
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,500
Re-Bob.

998
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,780
Oh, Bob.

999
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,420
Hey, Bob.

1000
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,160
Re-Bob.

1001
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,480
Bob-Bob.

1002
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,260
Bob-Bob.

1003
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:02,620
Ray.

1004
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,940
Oh.

1005
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,920
Oh, I'm starting to get slack in my feet.

1006
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,220
Oh, they're shuffling out from underneath me.

1007
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,680
Oh, Bob-Bob.

1008
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,320
Bob-Bob.

1009
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,180
Bob-Bob.

1010
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,920
Bob-Bob.

1011
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,440
Bob-Bob.

1012
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:28,860
Bob-Bob.

1013
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,060
Bob-Bob, don't run.

1014
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,180
Don't run away.

1015
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:30,180


1016
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,760
Bob, don't run away.

1017
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,960
Here's my dollar.

1018
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,780
Come on back.

1019
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:39,440
I want you to stay and stay.

1020
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,700
Oh, Bob.

1021
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,180
Bob-Bob.

1022
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,200
What's wrong?

1023
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,400
What did I do?

1024
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,460
You want 2 more dollars?

1025
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,500
Okay, Bob, here's two more dollars.

1026
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,780
Oh, wow.

1027
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,500
Wow, I suddenly feel, I feel great.

1028
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,000
I feel like I can see through all the women's clothing.

1029
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,460
I can.

1030
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,860
Look out the window.

1031
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,260
Them girls are all naked.

1032
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,800
It's Bob.

1033
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,120
Right?

1034
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,200
We can sit here and talk about, you know, it's here.

1035
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,660
He's Bob.

1036
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,340
That's why you need to send us money here at the Subgenius Church.

1037
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,680
Because Bob, he can work miracles in your life.

1038
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,400
He can bring you money, send us money.

1039
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,380
He can bring you love.

1040
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,960
And of course the molecular dispensation,

1041
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,320
which comes from the...

1042
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:44,780
Subgenius Church.

1043
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,660
...the spewing diodes embalmed in our brain cells

1044
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,540
through the Bob surgery and Dobbs tan,

1045
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,220
which we've all gone through.

1046
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:54,740
Kill Bob.

1047
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,420
Braise the lard.

1048
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,100
Braise the lard.

1049
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,800
Shoot Bob.

1050
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,400
I don't believe there is a Bob.

1051
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,940
Sometimes we don't.

1052
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,400
If there was, he wouldn't be so cool.

1053
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,080
No way.

1054
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,280
Dobbs, Dobbs atheists.

1055
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,060
If there's not a Bob, then...

1056
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:13,920
then...

1057
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,380
Why are you here?

1058
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,440
Why do you spread life if there's no Bob?

1059
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,820
Pick a symbol, any symbol.

1060
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:24,980
Bob.

1061
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,920
I started.

1062
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,100
Bobby.

1063
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,340
Bobby Dodds?

1064
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,840
I remember Bobby Dodds.

1065
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,600
Bobbs.

1066
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,080
Dobbs.

1067
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,140
Bobby Dobbs when he was a boy.

1068
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,200
Bobby Dodds.

1069
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,880
Bobby Dodds.

1070
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,260
Bobby Dobbs.

1071
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,240
Little Bobby Dodds.

1072
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,300
Little Bobby Dodds.

1073
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,320
Where did he grow up?

1074
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:45,480
Bobby Dodds.

1075
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,440
Right here on the main street.

1076
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,160
Why, I knew Bobby Dodds when he used to cut the grass

1077
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,240
out in front of the drugstore,

1078
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,780
and he had a part-time job in Vietnam

1079
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,380
long before any of us even knew how to say the word.

1080
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,140
Bobby Dodds.

1081
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:57,580
Oh well.

1082
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,960
That's just the way Bobby Dodds grew up.

1083
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,000
Of course he grew up in a small town

1084
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,580
in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia.

1085
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,260
Nobody knows that actually,

1086
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,420
but it was Stanton, Virginia that Bobby Dodds grew up in,

1087
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,140
Bobby Dodds.

1088
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:19,000
father owned an antique store and sold half-burned uniforms and ancient rusty farm implements

1089
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,500
as tourist attractions.

1090
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,520
Hi, Daddy.

1091
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,660
Here's Bobby now.

1092
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,820
What's happening today?

1093
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,400
There's Bobby Dog.

1094
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,980
How'd he get so hit?

1095
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:37,540
We have these ancient holograms of Bobby Dobbs, the way he was, asking how the things are

1096
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,240
the way they is now.

1097
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,620
What did you do in the war, Daddy?

1098
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,560
Bobby Dobbs.

1099
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:52,000
There was no answer, so he thought for himself.

1100
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,280
Bobby Dobbs.

1101
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:04,280
Bobby Dobbs was looking for a droid, some kind of transformation.

1102
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,600
I think I understand.

1103
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,600
Yeah, sure.

1104
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,840
Well, now maybe...

1105
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,580
Bobby Dobbs figured it out for himself.

1106
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,520
Bobby Dobbs.

1107
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,140
Bobby Dobbs.

1108
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,160
Bobby Dobbs.

1109
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,740
Yeah, that's it.

1110
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:17,460
No.

1111
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,360
Well, well.

1112
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,620
Bobby Dobbs.

1113
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:20,840
Bobby Dobbs.

1114
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,780
Yeah, I sort of like that.

1115
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,620
Bobby Dobbs.

1116
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,020
Bobby Dobbs.

1117
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,640
He didn't say I got it.

1118
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,140
Hey, I know.

1119
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:28,880
I got it.

1120
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:29,660
No.

1121
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,520
He got it.

1122
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,560
No, he didn't get it.

1123
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,140
He got it.

1124
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:33,980
No, he didn't get it.

1125
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,140
He got it.

1126
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:34,160
No, he didn't get it.

1127
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:34,840
That's it.

1128
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:35,720
Yeah.

1129
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,020
Bobby Dobbs is sitting around thinking.

1130
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,100
Hmm.

1131
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,220
Oh, but it's not bad.

1132
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,300
Then they...

1133
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,040
It must be...

1134
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:43,120
It's not bad.

1135
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:43,120


1136
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:43,760
It's not bad.

1137
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,040


1138
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,040


1139
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,040


1140
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,040


1141
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,040


1142
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,040


1143
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,040


1144
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,440
He decided his name was too long, he wanted to have some dignity to his character and

1145
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,420
personality, so he named himself Bob.

1146
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,300
He said...

1147
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,160
He said...

1148
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,480
We understand.

1149
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,260
We know what's going on.

1150
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,100
And he convinced people that he did.

1151
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,840
And then a voice came to Bobby Dobbs one day.

1152
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,120
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

1153
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,120


1154
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,120


1155
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,120


1156
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,120


1157
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,120


1158
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,120


1159
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,120


1160
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,120


1161
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,560
He said, you really think you know what's going on?

1162
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,260
Hey, Art, Art.

1163
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,520
Oh, oh, oh.

1164
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,560
He said.

1165
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,860
Who is that?

1166
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:23,400
What?

1167
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:23,980
Hello?

1168
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:24,980
Oh, oh.

1169
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,900
Bobby Doll, what do you know?

1170
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,400
Hey, it's dark in here.

1171
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,860
I don't see anything.

1172
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,060
I don't hear anything.

1173
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:35,320
Oh.

1174
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,020
Bobby Doll.

1175
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,260
But I think.

1176
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:39,800
Bobby Doll.

1177
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,300
I understand.

1178
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,080
Bobby Doll.

1179
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,300
He's getting enlightened right now.

1180
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,460
I know what it's all about.

1181
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,460
This is what his voice sounded like when he was really getting enlightened.

1182
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,980
Here it's happening now.

1183
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,760
It's the universe out there.

1184
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,640
That's what it is.

1185
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,580
Bobby Doll.

1186
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,220
And here I am, sitting in the middle of it.

1187
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,440
To you.

1188
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,300
To you.

1189
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,500
Yes, yes, folks.

1190
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,040
He's really.

1191
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,400
Bobby Doll.

1192
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,860
To you.

1193
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:12,980
Bobby Doll.

1194
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:17,320
Today, once again.

1195
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:18,500
Bobby Doll.

1196
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,520
Bobby Dark Skipper.

1197
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,940
Bobby!

1198
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,320
Oh, Bobby.

1199
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:24,780
Bobby.

1200
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:24,780


1201
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,620
Bobby Dorian.

1202
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:25,640
Oh.

1203
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,280
Bobby.

1204
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,820
Oh.

1205
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,140
Where were you during the war, Daddy?

1206
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,640
It's time to wake up, Bob.

1207
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,280
It's time to get up.

1208
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,400
Bobby Dog, this is your wake-up service.

1209
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:20,820
That's right.

1210
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:21,700
Bobby Dog.

1211
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,740
Are you asleep under there?

1212
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,580
Hey, your hair's on fire.

1213
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:25,940
Hey.

1214
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,720
Hey, police are coming.

1215
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,020
You better get up right now.

1216
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,520
The cops are coming, man.

1217
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,340
They're going to beat you up with brass knuckles and baseball bats.

1218
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,440
Hey, your hair's on fire.

1219
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:47,380
Friends, I want to talk to you today about something that I'm sure is close in everyone's hearts and minds

1220
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:55,140
that you might not be living up to or be the man or lady, woman you should be.

1221
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,420
And that subject, you might have guessed it by now, but that subject is Bob.

1222
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,160
I want...

1223
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,680
A man came to me.

1224
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,140
He said,

1225
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,760
My life is empty.

1226
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:09,500
I said, why?

1227
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,140
Why is...

1228
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,260
Is it because...

1229
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,820
It's not because my wife left me.

1230
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,760
No, it's not because my car broke down.

1231
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,480
It's not because I'm fixing to be evicted and fired from my job.

1232
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,580
It's because I don't have Bob in my life.

1233
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,340
And I talked to that man.

1234
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,680
And I...

1235
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,980
I saved that man that night.

1236
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,520
I showed him the way of Bob.

1237
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,440
Oh, Mr. Bob Dog.

1238
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,080
Where are you in this dark?

1239
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:36,320
Oh.

1240
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,080
This dark world of humanity.

1241
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,100
Oh, Bob.

1242
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:47,080
Somewhere back here lies the answer to the secrets of the universe.

1243
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:54,100
Somewhere in this slimy, sleazy hole that we call

1244
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:04,640
the dark of the subgenius conclave meeting hall.

1245
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,420
Oh.

1246
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,500
This is the pink boys.

1247
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,120
This is a battleground.

1248
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,520
Oh, Bob.

1249
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,060
Oh, who are you?

1250
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,380
Oh, who are you on your organ, Bob?

1251
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,800
And what a big organ you got.

1252
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:34,300
But friends, I get up in the morning and there's just like this electricity that just shoots through me.

1253
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,680
And I say, praise Bob.

1254
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,280
And you can feel it, man.

1255
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:37,880
You can feel that.

1256
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,480
Was that him running around over there?

1257
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,480
Did anyone want to see Bob?

1258
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,760
I just want to say, praise Bob.

1259
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,140
Don't you think he's the greatest?

1260
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:45,840
Sturno.

1261
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:46,780
Bob.

1262
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:49,740
Praise Bob.

1263
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,440
Sturno said, praise Bob.

1264
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,180
I don't know if you hear.

1265
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,960
But everything comes from Bob.

1266
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,380
And it's just so beautiful.

1267
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,180
I just want to turn everyone in the world on to Bob.

1268
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,160
And I'm not sure, ma'am.

1269
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,780
I don't know, ma'am.

1270
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,660
I said...

1271
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,940
I've seen your pretty pictures one time.

1272
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:13,360
But you think Bob might give me those pretty pictures if I vaporize Smith and Jones?

1273
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,140
I don't know, ma'am.

1274
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,020
You write me by writing Pastor F.

1275
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,380
Cheatness is a true vein of the subgenius?

1276
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,900
Cheatness is, I'd say, what caused us to get started in this in the first place.

1277
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,120
Well, I heard you talking about time control earlier.

1278
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,040
How can I control time?

1279
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,860
Are you going to...

1280
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,320
Cheatness.

1281
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,520
Listen to this, sir.

1282
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,060
The lady sitting right there with your hand raised praising God.

1283
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,420
Sister, stand up.

1284
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,260
No, it's not here.

1285
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,000
Look at me.

1286
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,140
Do you live on a farm?

1287
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:48,720
Come here.

1288
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,480
Something wrong.

1289
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,380
Seem like I see you on a farm.

1290
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,340
Now, don't worry.

1291
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,380
I mean, I always...

1292
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,160
I feel my way through sometimes.

1293
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,180
When God starts...

1294
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,040
When it's a holy ghost, you don't have to worry about it.

1295
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:01,820
Just relax, huh?

1296
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,940
I'm not going to get tied up.

1297
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:04,520
I'm not going to get...

1298
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:04,560
Huh?

1299
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:04,860
Huh?

1300
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,280
I know what I'm doing.

1301
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,380
Praise God.

1302
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:08,640
Praise God.

1303
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,460
I may stumble around and feel around, but I'll come out all right.

1304
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:12,660
Praise God.

1305
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,940
I kept worrying a long time ago about the gift of the Spirit.

1306
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,480
He just...

1307
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,760
But I think...

1308
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,540
Come a little closer, Doc.

1309
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,320
Just a little closer.

1310
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,420
I see something about a farm, Woody.

1311
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,320
I'm on a farm.

1312
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,040
You was what?

1313
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,100
Raised on a farm.

1314
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,240
Raised on a farm.

1315
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,680
But you don't live on one now?

1316
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,380
Still something about a farm.

1317
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,040
What's a farm?

1318
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:35,880
Huh?

1319
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,800
Because you look like a farmer to me.

1320
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,200
Huh?

1321
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,080
What?

1322
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,500
The name what?

1323
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,460
What does it mean?

1324
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,540
Farmer is your name.

1325
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,460
What is your...

1326
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,000
Wait a minute.

1327
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,780
What is your name?

1328
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:58,660
May Farmer.

1329
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,560
May Farmer.

1330
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,020
Farmer.

1331
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,500
Oh, hallelujah.

1332
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,640
Oh, my God.

1333
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,020
Hallelujah.

1334
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:03,600
Hallelujah.

1335
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,320
You're a knight.

1336
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,060
Come on.

1337
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:08,580
Hey, Farmer.

1338
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,260
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

1339
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,680
Jesus stole it.

1340
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,180
You're a knight.

1341
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:13,760
You know it.

1342
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,780
I love you.

1343
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:15,860
I love you.

1344
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,880
You know Jesus.

1345
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,580
You know he knows you're a knight.

1346
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,960
Like I say, I'll talk to Bob on the phone about your problems.

1347
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,780
If you have any special needs, we can always supply you with anointing oils.

1348
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,300
Yes, we have special anointing oils.

1349
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:31,800
And we can...

1350
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,480
You can...

1351
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,500
Just for a few dollars more, friends.

1352
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,580
Only a few dollars more.

1353
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,460
Just a few dollars more to that miracle box number.

1354
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:46,860
We can let you come to visit us at the special retreats at Dobbs Town and where you can get

1355
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:47,680
glandscapes.

1356
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:53,100
And Dr. Drummond and all his little friends from the special places will open up your

1357
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:59,660
third nostril and make it where you can pick up on the strange liquid vibrations that are

1358
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,460
all around us in the air.

1359
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,700
I think I can get a whiff of them now, friends.

1360
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,140
Yes.

1361
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,200
I can tell.

1362
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,440
Yeah, there's Pastor Naked.

1363
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,720
No one knows what happened to him.

1364
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,540
He just disappeared in a burst of smoke a little while ago.

1365
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,280
But people didn't even get excited.

1366
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,860
They didn't even jump up and down because they're so used to seeing it happen in front

1367
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,940
of the tape recorders and all the microphones that we have here at the foundation.

1368
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,140
Hallelujah for him.

1369
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:23,540
Sanctify.

1370
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,660
Oh, can you say anything about what Bob has done for you, my dear sister?

1371
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,480
That's Bob.

1372
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,220
Bob.

1373
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:32,960
I can say...

1374
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,980
I can say...

1375
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:34,920
Baby.

1376
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,060
Oh, Bob's working miracles.

1377
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,440
I can say...

1378
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,400
Baby.

1379
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,920
They call him Bob.

1380
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,940
And I think I can try to...

1381
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,580
I can pick up what your name is.

1382
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:48,780
Yes.

1383
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,520
You've never met me before, right?

1384
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,380
And you've never been into this temple, right?

1385
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,420
That's right.

1386
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,600
And this is true, friends.

1387
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,960
This woman has never met me, and she doesn't know any of my employees or any of the other

1388
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,860
people at the foundation.

1389
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,200
And I think I'm getting a picture.

1390
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,300
I'm getting an image in my head.

1391
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:03,660
I see it.

1392
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,560
I see a farm.

1393
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:05,400
Yes.

1394
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,720
I see a farm.

1395
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,880
A little rooster on top of a house.

1396
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,000
And what is it?

1397
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:10,540
Wait.

1398
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,220
The farm.

1399
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,000
Are you a farmer?

1400
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,200
Close.

1401
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:13,960
Close?

1402
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,480
What is your name?

1403
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,740
Is your name Farm?

1404
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,480
She said yes.

1405
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,540
What is your name?

1406
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:24,300
Farm.

1407
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,280
What is your name?

1408
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,400
Farm.

1409
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,920
You know what I mean, right?

1410
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,740
What is your name?

1411
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:29,660
Farm.

1412
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:30,480
Farm.

1413
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,320
Farm.

1414
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:32,780


1415
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:32,960
Farm.

1416
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,060
Farm.

1417
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:33,640
Farm.

1418
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:33,640


1419
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:33,640


1420
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:33,640


1421
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:33,640


1422
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:33,640


1423
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:33,640


1424
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:33,640


1425
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:33,640


1426
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:33,640


1427
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:33,640


1428
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,120
Farm.

1429
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:37,420
Farm.

1430
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:38,140
Farm.

1431
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:38,400
Farm.

1432
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:38,400


1433
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:38,420
Farm.

1434
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,420


1435
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,420


1436
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,420


1437
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,420


1438
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,420


1439
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,420


1440
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,420


1441
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,420


1442
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,420


1443
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,420


1444
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:38,420


1445
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,660
That's Becky Botts.

1446
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,440
We can't steal that.

1447
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,520
I think so.

1448
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,980
But you know what I think we ought to do is just rent.

1449
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,380
We ought to have our open.

1450
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:52,940
We ought to open a damn lab, a subgenius analysis shop back here and do counseling.

1451
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:57,220
You know, we can get a license to counsel in a subgenius fashion.

1452
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,340
Can you do that?

1453
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,360
Uh, I don't know.

1454
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,180
Well, we can do hell, they do palm reading.

1455
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,140
Here.

1456
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,180
They do, you know, astrology readings.

1457
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,920
We can come back here and do mental life trance readings.

1458
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:16,280
Do them really spectacularly so it's worth people's ten dollars that we charge.

1459
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,240
Yeah, even if they don't...

1460
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:21,040
I mean, we flop around on the floor, we speak in tongues, the voice of their dead relatives

1461
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,760
comes through.

1462
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,900
This is Granny, I hope you did well.

1463
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,000
It's beautiful here.

1464
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,520
There's music and soft clothing and tight shoes and...

1465
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,580
This is a place where all of us live together happy and freely.

1466
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:43,500
I just spoke to Sigmund Freud about your problem and he says you can quit if you'll just try.

1467
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:07,620
Oh, we got this, but only got this chance.

1468
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:10,960
Checking you out, I'm gonna take a break.

1469
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,840
Put me in a box, put a didn't in it for you.

1470
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,740
Pink boy, never gonna grow up.

1471
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:24,760
Pink boy, think I'm gonna throw up.

1472
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,740
Pink boy, you can get the better back.

1473
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,500
You can play the sound like the sound of the wind.

1474
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:30,500


1475
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,240
You can play the sound like the sound of the wind.

1476
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:38,780
Oh boy, you are the man.

1477
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,260
You're the man who knows all the answers.

1478
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:51,280
So it seems at least that's what Doug and Follow keep telling us.

1479
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,800
Well, maybe I could be...

1480
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:58,640
