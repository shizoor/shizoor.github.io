1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Yes, big, big, big, big.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,320
You get size, if nothing else, you get plenty of size with this radio station.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,420
As soon as we are able to transcend the time problems inherent in life on Earth

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,380
and gain control of the situation,

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,800
we will return you to your previously scheduled conversation.

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,060
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave yourself suggested.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,820
We are having operating difficulties, which has necessitated a delay.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,420
Nothing is more part of unregistered in your subconscious mind.

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,220
We are controlling transmission.

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:56,980
Yes?

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,160
Mr. Warren, I've got a precious bundle here.

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:00:59,500
Yes.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
The subgenius hour of smack.

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,840
Christian teaching and talk for Dallas-Fort Worth.

15
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,040
Chicken in the pot, chicken in the pot, chicken up, down.

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,700
Yes, yes, dear friends.

17
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,200
We are back in the arms of Bob.

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,260
Wow.

19
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,340
You mean that's why my brain has been coming off with all that stuff?

20
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,020
That's right.

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:50,180
So, kids, I said I am the spaceship.

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,960
Okay, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, switch it on.

23
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,160
Roy on.

24
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,900
Okay, okay.

25
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:00,980
There.

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,280
We're back.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,080
And everything is fine.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,800
It has been a bit hectic, dear friends.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,480
We've been traveling a lot down in Austin.

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,240
It seems like every other weekend ministering to the techno ignorant.

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,380
We were at the South by Southwest multimedia show

32
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,560
and the big music festival down there.

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,500
And hanging out with all our best buddies, Joe Newman,

34
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:36,180
and Sphinx Drummond, and G. Gordon, and even Mark Hosler from Negative Land.

35
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,580
And we are so cool.

36
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,420
This week, I've got to whip this show out quick.

37
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,520
Got to head back to Austin again for the Survival Research Laboratories show

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,040
where we will meet up with puzzling evidence,

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,720
bringing Jesus to the Survival Research Laboratories show,

40
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,060
which happens to be on Good Friday.

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,480
So who knows?

42
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,420
We may end up with the lad nailed to one of those giant robots,

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,260
flamethrowers licking at him.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,480
But listen to this.

45
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,540
Let's just stop for a minute.

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,120
This is really rather lovely.

47
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,420
It is Jimi Hendrix, of course.

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,300
Here, I just mean get to the good part.

49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,580
He's very patriotic, restaurant about next day.

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,400
There he is.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,480
It looks like a big old guy with a big big little stick on the head.

52
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,480


53
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,480


54
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,480


55
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,480


56
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,480


57
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,480


58
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,480

award winner. The man who found out moments before making a 300 mile per hour dent in an Arizona

83
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:43,100
cliff that the jet assist takeoff unit he had strapped to his car could not be turned off once

84
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:52,500
it was turned on. Darwin awards are by definition granted posthumously. This citation is bestowed

85
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,980
upon the remains of that individual who through single-minded self-sacrifice has done the most to

86
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:07,700
remove undesirable elements from the human gene pool. Oh I've got a perfect song to follow this

87
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:16,840
up with. The 1996 nominees are from the San Jose Mercury News. An unidentified man using a shotgun

88
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,980
like a club to break a former girlfriend's windshield accidentally shot himself to death

89
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,780
when the gun discharged blowing a hole in his gut.

90
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,360
Uh

91
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,880
uh

92
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:28,960
uh

93
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:36,340
PICRI DAILY RECORD uh from 1992 oh my gosh uh Ken Charles Barger 47 accidentally shot himself

94
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,040
to death in December in Newton North Carolina when awakening to the sound of a telephone

95
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,160
telephone ringing beside his bed he reached for the phone but instead grabbed a Smith & Wesson

96
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:58,540
38 special which discharged when he drew it to his ear. A terrible diet and room with no ventilation

97
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:58,960
are the reasons why I'm writing this story. The actual reasons behind that are very, very important

98
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,460
are being blamed for the death of a man who was killed by his own gas.

99
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,440
There was no mark on his body, but autopsy showed large amounts of methane gas in his system.

100
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,760
His diet had consisted primarily of beans and cabbage and a couple of other things.

101
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,460
It was just the right combination of foods.

102
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:24,340
It appears that the man died in his sleep from breathing from the poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed.

103
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,000
Had he been outside or had his windows been open, it wouldn't have been fatal.

104
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,280
But the man was shut up in his near airtight bedroom.

105
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:38,920
He was, quote, a big man with a huge capacity for creating this deadly gas.

106
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,760
Three of the rescuers got sick and one was hospitalized.

107
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,700
Reuters, Ontario.

A man slips falls 23 stories to his death.

109
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:57,200
A man cleaning a bird feeder on his balcony of his condominium apartment in this Toronto suburb slipped and fell 23.

110
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,600
Police said Monday.

111
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,820
Stefan Mako, 55, was standing on a wheeled chair when the accident occurred.

112
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,240
It appears the chair moved and he went over the balcony.

113
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,200
It was one of those freak accidents.

114
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,080
No foul play is suspected.

115
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,240
But of course, you know, they don't know about the conspiracy now, do they?

116
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,480
Toronto.

117
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:26,800
Police said a lawyer demonstrating the safety of a, this is another plunge, 24 floors to his death also in Toronto.

118
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,980
A lawyer demonstrating the safety of a, this is another plunge, 24 floors to his death also in Toronto.

119
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:27,980


120
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,680
A lawyer demonstrating the safety of windows in a skyscraper crashed through a pane and plunged 24 floors to his death.

121
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:46,600
Gary Hoy, 39, fell into the courtyard of the, blah, blah, blah, early Friday evening as he was explaining the strength of the building's windows to visiting law students.

122
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,300
Hoy previously had conducted demonstrations of window strength, according to police reports.

123
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Hoy was one of the best and brightest members of the Lawyer Association.

124
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,460
Yeah, right.

125
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,520
I think he's in for a splash.

126
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:07,440
Now, Eddie, six people drowned Monday while trying to rescue a chicken that had fallen into a well in southern Egypt.

127
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,360
Now, get this.

128
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,320
An 18-year-old farmer was the first to descend into the 60-foot well to rescue the chicken.

129
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,780
He drowned, apparently, after an undercurrent in the water pulled him down.

130
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,440
His sister and two brothers, none of whom could swim well, went in one by one to help him but also drowned.

131
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,420
Two elderly farmers then came to help.

132
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,440
But they apparently were pulled by the same undercurrent.

133
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,040
The bodies of the six people were later pulled out of the well.

134
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,880
The children was also, the chicken was also pulled out.

135
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,660
It survived.

136
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:48,960
A thief who sneaked into a hospital was scarred for life when he tried to get a suntan.

137
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:55,620
After evading security staff at a hospital in Salisbury, Wiltshire and helping himself to doctors' paging devices,

138
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,180
the thief spotted a vertical sunbed.

139
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,460
He walked into the unit and removed his clothes for a 45-minute tan.

140
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:09,820
However, the high-voltage UV machine at the hospital, renowned for its treatment of burn victims, had a maximum dosage of 10 seconds.

141
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:16,100
After lying on the bed for almost 300 times the recommended maximum time, the man was covered in blisters.

142
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,500
Hours later, when the bane of the burns became unbearable, he went to another hospital, uh, in Hampshire.

143
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,600
Staff became suspicious because he was wearing a doctor's uniform.

144
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,140
The doctor's coat, um, this man broke into odd stock and decided he fancied a quick suntan.

145
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,880
Doctors say he's going to be scarred for life.

146
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,820
And here's some more intelligence-challenged people.

147
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:44,160
Uh, Gregory Rosa, 25, with a string of vending machine robberies in January,

148
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:51,320
uh, one, fled from police inexplicably when they spotted him loitering around a vending machine,

149
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,600
and two, later tried to pay, post his $400.

150
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,180
bail in coins.

151
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:05,420
Karen Lee Giacchini, 20, was arrested in Lake City, Florida, for robbery of a Howard Johnson's hotel.

152
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,740
She was armed only with an electric chainsaw, which was not plugged in.

153
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:20,360
And friends, I told you that I had a piece of music that would go just perfectly with, uh, that sort of news,

154
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,760
and, uh, it's, and this'll be good news for many of you friends.

155
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,580
We got a new John Bartle song.

156
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:30,500
It's called, uh, John Bartle's Tape, in the great and offensive John Bartle's,

157
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:36,060
here, played on Hour of Slack, for your entertainment and edification.

158
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,520
This one's called Super Predator Safari.

159
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,000
Well, I thought it was.

160
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,960
Here's what Elvis did before he killed Ice-T.

161
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,200
He was a pretty game hunter

162
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,560
In search of something to eat.

163
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,380
Something special.

164
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:33,540
He had heard the rumors floating around at the local gun show.

165
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,860
He sniffed around for hours because he hadn't heard a story.

166
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes, he heard the rumors floating around about the super predator Safari.

167
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,020
He was a super predator Safari.

168
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,800
For those who really like to fight.

169
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,540
For those who really like to fight.

170
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:25,540


171
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:25,540


172
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:33,320
He had searched the world over for the ultimate glory.

173
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,760
And this one was the ultimate.

174
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,300
The super predator Safari.

175
00:19:53,420 --> 00:20:00,120
He ran into a dealer with a large SMG collection.

176
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,820
He hung around for hours just to make the right connection.

177
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,320
He browsed the SMGs.

178
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,780
And asked a lot of questions.

179
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,160
He wanted to make sure that he made the right selection.

180
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,140
He mentioned he was tired of hunting standard games.

181
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,860
He said he was tired of playing the game.

182
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,740
After a while he said, it all begins to look the same.

183
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,840
He was fondling the Goozies and the Walters and the Frankies.

184
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:02,940
When the dealer looked at him and asked, my friend, do you ever try a super predator Safari?

185
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:19,560
Oh yeah, it's a super predator Safari.

186
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,380
You got to try it Parker.

187
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,560
I swear you won't be sorry.

188
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,880
If you really, really, really, really, really like to party.

189
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,500
You ought to join us on our super predator Safari.

190
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,720
The premise was quite simple.

191
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,860
On their predatory nature, they were cannibalized.

192
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,760
For faith.

193
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,980
A phony three-way breakdown was utilized.

194
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:13,300
They tucked it on the shoulder at the edge of the hood in question.

195
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,580
With a wide killing zone of asphalt and concrete, it was an ingenious selection.

196
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,720
The only thing that was left was the

197
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:47,140
The action started to begin.

198
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,000
Three or four that were heavily armed climbed over the concrete wall.

199
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,680
But before they got ten feet, with one click, he smoked them all.

200
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,740
That way, the road was finished.

201
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:16,740


202
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:16,780
Ahod is one of yourogens assisted by what is known as the beleza costume.

203
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:16,780


204
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,860
Estamos trabajando para buscar algo gigantesco-ful?!?!

205
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:26,200
You gotta connect with the Super Predator Safari

206
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,360
It isn't for everybody

207
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,300
But if you really like to party

208
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:41,180
See the man and sign up for the Super Predator Safari

209
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,840
guitar solo

210
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,400
guitar solo

211
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,380
Hide in here burning in the sun

212
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,820
Makes me feel like drinking

213
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,060
Cookies, grub burning in the pot

214
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,480
Makes me feel like drinking

215
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,840
When I go to bed at night

216
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,480
I get right back up

217
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,980
Cause when they turn out the light

218
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,140
It makes me feel like drinking

219
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,460
When I build up a powerful thirst

220
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,420
I quit drinking and I get drunk first

221
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,080
It makes me feel like having one

222
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,400
When I feel like drinking

223
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,320
It makes me feel like having one

224
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,260
When I'm throwing cactus out of my chest

225
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,240
And when I'm throwing cactus out of my lips

226
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,980
And when I'm throwing cactus out of my lips

227
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:29,980


228
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,900
And when I'm throwing cactus out of my ass

229
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,000
It makes me feel like drinking

230
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,940
When a cowboy's work is done

231
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,300
It makes me feel like drinking

232
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,700
When I feel like havin' fun

233
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,040
It makes me feel like drinking

234
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,840
When I'm upset when I'll have degraded

235
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:49,840


236
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,540
Swearing my ass off.

237
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,200
The prairie dust, it makes me cough.

238
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,180
And the twisting trail makes me all up.

239
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,500
It makes me feel like drinking.

240
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,620
That was John Bartles, dear friends,

241
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,780
from his new album or tape, Snot.

242
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,260
I'd like to give you an address,

243
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,880
where you can reach John Bartles.

244
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,940
His tapes are not available in any stores.

245
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,280
Just write to John Bartles at

246
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,080
That's P.O. Box 106.

247
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,940
Livonia Center.

248
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,780
L-I-V-O-N-I-A.

249
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,060
Livonia Center, New York.

250
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,960
144-88.

251
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,480
Some Melodys.

252
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,480
The melodic content is of traditional character.

253
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,280
All characters are fictitious, it says here.

254
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,280
So, yes, dear friends, it is...

255
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:08,960
Yes.

256
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,560
So refined.

257
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,680
So synchronistic.

258
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,260
So recursive.

259
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,100
Oh, I know what else I wanted to mention.

260
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,880
For you Yankees up in the Massachusetts sort of area,

261
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,980
Paul Mavridis is having an art show

262
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,380
from...

263
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,680
From April 10th to June the 1st

264
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,320
in Northampton, Mass.

265
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,460
At the Words and Pictures Gallery

266
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,660
at 140 Main Street.

267
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,980
That's the big art gallery started by Kevin Eastman,

268
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,340
who was one of the co-creators

269
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,400
of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

270
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,720
The fortune that he made

271
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,980
off the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

272
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,500
and his taste in original art

273
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,360
allowed Revelation to be a great place to be.

274
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,360


275
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,360


276
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,360


277
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,360


278
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,360


279
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,360


280
00:27:59,380 --> 00:27:59,880
To be like Foundation X

281
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,000
to get finished at all.

282
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,440
Yeah.

283
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,540
The progressed you.

284
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,120
The Fintu.

285
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,200
The Supreme being con figured.

286
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:24,220
I'm kind of working on cucum for my computer.

287
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,680
It's not.

288
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:26,820


289
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,600
It's a mir stehen hmm This is probably my argument.

290
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,660
I don't think you're aware of something lost nowadays invietner and going.

291
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:28,660


292
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:28,660


293
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:28,720
I don't know why,

294
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:28,720


295
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:28,720


296
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,360
I don't know what that says. it's not a security place.. It's a對吧 multimedia business service. So, I'matt enable.

297
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,280
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to put a pin in that collar.

298
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,480
When it comes to covering the United States,

299
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,060
subgenius tradition calls for propagandistic hack work.

300
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,300
Is that our job, or is that...

301
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,900
Yes, we've taken over this station in hopes of subverting your mind.

302
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,140
We're marching into your head now.

303
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,220
Isn't it cute? They have those little powdered wigs on and three-cornered hats.

304
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,480
They're almost harmless as they march up your spinal cord.

305
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,040
But when they reach your brain, a deadly conflict ensues.

306
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,220
Really? Well, that's very interesting, Dr. Howell.

307
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,920
Now, back to breakfast hour here on the show.

308
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,280
Well, I guess it'll work for the show anyway.

309
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,680
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Dr. Gavofram and his surgical mind-proof.

310
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,000
Look at him go, that flashing steel.

311
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,840
Only one pair of hands in the country could possibly perform with such consummate skill.

312
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,640
It is a ludicrous sight.

313
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,180
Is he daring?

314
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,620
He has not only his hands but his feet to cut the cadaver on the table into an unrecognizable part.

315
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,140
He must be from the Little Hill tribe.

316
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:42,960
This country must move forward to a new frontier of subgenius radio programming.

317
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,060
Here.

318
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,640
But this promise was to be shattered when on November 22, 1983,

319
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,460
Bob was shattered in both recaps by a terrorist attack.

320
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,420
Bob was thrown into a forest-thrown bomb.

321
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,680
He could never play golf again. It was very sad.

322
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,500
Look at him go on his little cart. Look at him split.

323
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,780
I know. He kept trying to play golf for years after that.

324
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,300
It was embarrassing to be out there on the course.

325
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,820
This little torso would go by in the automated...

326
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,280
Yeah.

327
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,960
And we're back.

328
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,440
Boy, that's a killer.

329
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,500
That's a killer.

330
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,820
But he was young once.

331
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,980
He had a mommy who tucked him in at night.

332
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,000
And an adorable little puppy.

333
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,260
It's called Puddle.

334
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,940
The perplexed Puddle.

335
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,300
Possers probably were a Nazi secret weapon, but that was back in the 40s when...

336
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,140
Too many UFOs piloted by Nazis like Errol Flynn from the center of the Earth

337
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,520
were the reason that the government withdrew its plan...

338
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,500
Maybe I'll duck in. Let's go.

339
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,180
...by his life in a disco.

340
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,500
Look at that little dog go through those doors.

341
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,340
Not as good as a human, though.

342
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,200
Everybody laughs at him, but it just goes...

343
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,300
That's the same way.

344
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,780
You're still laughing?

345
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,260
Oh, Bob, let me smoke.

346
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,560
That's box 140306.

347
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,680
That's box 140306.

348
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,520
That was J.R. Bob.

349
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:25,760
That was J.R. Bob.

350
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,020
That was J.R. Bob.

351
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,240
Dear friends.

352
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,960
Yeah, it was Bob.

353
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,220
Bigfoot.

354
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,500
No, not Bigfoot.

355
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:35,940
It was Bob.

356
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,900
Not Bigfoot.

357
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,100
Oh, well, friends.

358
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,840
It's kind of painful to listen to some of that.

359
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,380
That was...

360
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,360
There was some KPFA with puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell.

361
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,760
And some old stuff from Hour of Slack number 113.

362
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,680
That's kind of strange to listen to for me.

363
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,520
That was the...

364
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:01,080
A previous time when I quit smoking but was not so successful.

365
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,260
It's going to be just fine, but...

366
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,340
Yeah, the impotent sea snakes.

367
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:22,320
We had established a sales presence at the South by Southwest music trade show in Austin.

368
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,200
Had a big sales booth.

369
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,920
We're selling stuff.

370
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,500
Met lots of people.

371
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,820
Met lots of nice folks and lots of idiots.

372
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,660
And had one old biddy tell me that I needed Jesus.

373
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,780
I was going, Lady Jesus is my business manager.

374
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,900
Christ.

375
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,100
And we were handed dozens of CDs.

376
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,820
And I haven't even listened to most of it.

377
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,900
But there was one band that was handing stuff out that caught my eye.

378
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,860
Because they seemed like a bunch of good old preverts.

379
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,740
It's called the Impotent Sea Snakes.

380
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,600
And they're from Atlanta.

381
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,400
And they're queens or something.

382
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,660
They're guys that dress like girls.

383
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,040
Or they're chicks with something.

384
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:12,120
And the titles of their songs are things like Porn Star, Felching, Daisy Chain, etc.

385
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:18,480
They apparently do an elaborate stage show involving dummies and dildos.

386
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,800
And all that kind of Alice Cooper-y, GWAR kind of church of the subgenius-y sort of stuff.

387
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,180
And they're...

388
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,040
They're just...

389
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,980
They just...

390
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,320
I kind of like what they...

391
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,940
What they represent.

392
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,520
I like what they stand for.

393
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,880
Can't play most of the songs on this CD, which is called God Save the Queens.

394
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,320
But they do an interesting cover version of this old disco classic.

395
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,980
And I thought that we all might enjoy it.

396
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,620
Let's listen to it.

397
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:10,620


398
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,140
What they do?

399
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,760
¶¶

400
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,840

¶¶

406
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:29,360
All you feel is you want someone that you can't get

407
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,480
And if all you feel is you better beware

408
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,180
Somebody's out to get your lady

409
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,800
A few of your buddies, they shout, oh, shady

410
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,240
They don't know what's right in their face

411
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,940
And it's great that you're back

412
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,060
And I don't think they'll miss

413
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,220
What they do

414
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:57,760
Smile like a man, oh, how you'll get away so fast

415
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,140
That, that's how I keep getting

416
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,840
Oh, it's the truth, I'm from my roots, yeah

417
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,820
Oh, what they do, they do

418
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:13,020
They come to my house again and again and again and again, yeah

419
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Too hard they did to see my woman

420
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,540
Don't even be wholesome, but they shout, they won't call me

421
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,040
What can I do?

422
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,700
I'm too old to get over that chat

423
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,540
I wish they'd take some of these mouths out of my back

424
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,620
What they do

425
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:33,080
Smile like a man, oh, how you'll get away so fast

426
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,460
That, that's how I get away so fast

427
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

428
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,040
Oh, don't you

429
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,900
What they do

430
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,040
Smile like a man, oh, how you'll get away so fast

431
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,380
That, that's how I keep getting over that side of that blindside

432
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,380


433
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,380


434
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,380


435
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:02,060
Smile like a man, oh, how you'll get away so fast

436
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,360
That, that's how I get away so fast

437
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,160
You are lunatic, you don't let me bat an eye

438
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,160


439
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,300
You teach me a lesson

440
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,920
Because I can allow him

441
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,960
Yeah, so now I'm honest

442
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,440
Yeah, I'm honest

443
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,020
So settle down

444
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,700
What'd I do?

445
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,860
What?

446
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,240
What?

447
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:32,980
Yeah, coffee.

448
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,360
Just kidding.

449
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,100
Just kidding.

450
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,500
You're wrong.

451
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,980
It's coffee.

452
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,440
It was March 7th, 1945.

453
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,500
It's coffee.

454
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,040
A gray, chilly day.

455
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,100
The G.I.s were drinking coffee.

456
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,700
That tastes awful.

457
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,000
It's not bad.

458
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,480
What?

459
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,500
It's just coffee.

460
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,400
While some of them

461
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,120
Tastes like the filter.

462
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,460
Good-naturedly groused

463
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,800
About the taste of the coffee.

464
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,740
It wakes America up every morning.

465
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,180
Sure does.

466
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,980
Get up, everybody.

467
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,560
I'm sorry.

468
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,100
I'm sorry.

469
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,700
It tastes awful.

470
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,560
A lot of people feel that way.

471
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:00,940
Yeah.

472
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,660
Somebody else make it, right?

473
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,760
The 27th Armored Infantry Regiment

474
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,740
They're drinking coffee.

475
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,180
Was drinking coffee

476
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,960
And heavy casualties

477
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,080
Intude among the higher-ranking officers

478
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,300
From the burns of this hot broth.

479
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,300
We're getting some action in there?

480
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,120
Yeah, some coffee.

481
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:17,360
Yeah, thank you.

482
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,900
The 9th Armored Division

483
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,620
Has been fighting against determined resistance

484
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,520
Since it had crossed the border

485
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,960
Five or more for two weeks ago.

486
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,060
Let me know how you like the coffee

487
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,080
The new brand.

488
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,740
The war seems to be slowly grinding

489
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,020
To a victorious conclusion

490
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,220
As the

491
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,480
Celebrating G.I. Joe's

492
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,140
No more medication.

493
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,860
Chug-a-lug the cup of Joe.

494
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,540
Fifty minutes.

495
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,100
A wonderful camp coffee

496
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,720
At Camp Coffee

497
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,500
Where's the coffee?

498
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:41,940
Germany.

499
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,820
You know I am

500
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,680
Camp Coffee, Germany.

501
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,480
Lieutenant Paul F. Coffee, Jr.

502
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,680
It's carnivorous.

503
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,440
It is human.

504
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,880
General General McMillan.

505
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:49,880


506
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:49,880


507
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:49,880


508
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:49,880


509
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:49,880


510
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:49,880


511
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:49,880


512
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,620
And part of Hodger's Army Group.

513
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,160
Move forward to take control

514
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,740
Of the area from here.

515
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,820
I'm here to complete the airborne tour.

516
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,100
Yes, good one.

517
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,900
But why go on there?

518
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,100
Why go on there?

519
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,400
But the coffee.

520
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,200
Poor Hal is fighting the sound effects.

521
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,920
Oh, that old show.

522
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,660
You know, that subgenius show

523
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,720
Predates this one.

524
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
It's been going on forever

525
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,420
And ever and ever.

526
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,760
Let's see what they're doing now.

527
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,800
Prior work in this field.

528
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,180
In the field of tumbling toast.

529
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,180
What?

530
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,200
The toast.

531
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,860
Because if you have the coffee

532
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,300
You know, of course, that

533
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,600
The toast you have

534
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,060
Will fall butter side down

535
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,360
On the carpet.

536
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,580
That is a distressing message

537
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,600
To give our listeners

538
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,560
So early in the morning.

539
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:32,880
It's true though.

540
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,140
We like to bring the truth

541
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,040
To our little callers.

542
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,880
Well, sometimes the truth hurts.

543
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,740
You know, sometimes the doctor

544
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,060
Has to give you a little twinge

545
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,780
In order to cure you.

546
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,060
And sometimes you have to consider

547
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,660
What might be considered

548
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,180
Well, once upon a time

549
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,700
Oh, there he goes again.

550
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:49,800
There was a girl named

551
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,320
Wendy

552
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,400
Who was very beautiful

553
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,040
And very happy

554
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,500
And had lots of friends

555
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,060
You want coffee?

556
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,080
But then one day

557
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,520
She, she

558
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,100
What?

559
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,800
Uh, she did some heroin

560
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,040
And got addicted

561
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,300
Oh.

562
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,220
And lost everything

563
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:04,680
And then she died.

564
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,540
And her arms got really long

565
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,420
And she got blurry

566
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,760
And anyway, now let's talk about

567
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:07,900
The fun stuff.

568
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,480
Let's talk about the toast again.

569
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,600
Once upon a time

570
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,240
It really bothers me.

571
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,580
There was a girl named Wendy

572
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,000
Who was very beautiful

573
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,920
And very happy

574
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,720
She just doesn't have a butt.

575
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,120
But listen.

576
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,080
Paul Jennings in 1950

577
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,780
Had beautiful friends.

578
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,240
She had a beautiful home.

579
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,740
And his report on

580
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,920
Resist essentialism.

581
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,480
Everybody admired her in love.

582
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,660
This seminal work was able

583
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,620
To determine scientifically

584
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,720
The nature of the spread

585
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,760
And the quality of the carpet

586
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,340
Upon which she stumbled.

587
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,860
It's like two radio shows at once.

588
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,980
It's amazing.

589
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,280
It is really amazing.

590
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,580
And, uh, you know, I wonder if, together,

591
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,640
We shouldn't, uh, folks,

592
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,700
Listen to some Firesign Theatre.

593
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,020
When was the last time

594
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,620
You listened to a great big ol'

595
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,520
Steamin' hot bowl of Firesign Theatre?

596
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,980
Well, that's too long.

597
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,460
Um, actually,

598
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,560
Many of, uh, of us, uh,

599
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,280
Improvisational radio loudmouths,

600
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,540
Of course, were, one might say,

601
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,400
Weaned upon that great comedy group,

602
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,320
The Firesign Theatre.

603
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,240
And, um, I've got a,

604
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,180
I was recently given a copy

605
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,180
Of one of their albums

606
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,580
That I had never heard.

607
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,060
And still have not really

608
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,560
Listened to very closely.

609
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,140
Uh, called Eat or Be Eaten.

610
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,000
Um, I, and, uh,

611
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,300
Most old, bizarre weirdos

612
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,120
My age, uh, uh,

613
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,340
Memorized the first four or five albums

614
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,420
By four or five crazy guys,

615
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,380
The Firesign Theatre.

616
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,340
This particular album was done after

617
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,900
They lost David Osman.

618
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,900
Um, and he, uh,

619
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,820
And I haven't heard it.

620
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,560
G. Gordon Gordon gave me a copy of it.

621
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,860
Let's just, and this particular album

622
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,980
Takes the protagonist into, uh,

623
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,800
A video game.

624
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,500
Or a computer, or something.

625
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,420
It's kind of a combination.

626
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,840
This, this album, I think,

627
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,480
Is like almost ten years old.

628
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,160
But it is, of course,

629
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,480
Very prescient in, in that.

630
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,960
Um, we can't go through the entire album.

631
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,060
I think what we'll do is listen to side one.

632
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,200
There's, it's a short one.

633
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,580
I think it's only sixteen minutes per side.

634
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,720
So we'll listen to side one this week.

635
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,120
And, in which the hero goes into the game.

636
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,180
And, uh, next week we'll play side two.

637
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,960
When, in which he, uh,

638
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,480
Escapes from the game.

639
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,540
And, uh, uh, uh,

640
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,000
And, and, and, uh, uh, uh, uh,

641
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,920
Yes.

642
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,760
You're low on oil.

643
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:33,940
Who isn't?

644
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,000
Oh my god, the game's on.

645
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,340
I got twenty bucks on it.

646
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,380
Radio on.

647
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,860
Yes, I know that.

648
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,980
Hello and welcome to kickoff of the Kutuzoo County Harvest Bowl High School Classic

649
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,700
At Conti Inches Objectors Stadium in Cuddyville.

650
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,940
Sit on a pinhead.

651
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,340
And with me is color man Roy Poland.

652
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,700
Now, beans on you, compadre.

653
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,960
Oyster Panther Band is putting on down there.

654
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,060
They fell out from sideline to sideline.

655
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,320
So long, Ed.

656
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,820
We've got your head.

657
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,240
Well, it's quite a tribute to Mayor, I should say,

658
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,100
Ex-Mayor Ed King-Menos.

659
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,460
Took a real beating in the election yesterday, right, Ubu?

660
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,100
Right, Roy, that was some beating.

661
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,620
But the mayor's still smiling.

662
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,540
And he's still smiling as the oyster black and pink hooks him in the hair.

663
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,020
Kick off.

664
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,980
End over end.

665
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:18,980


666
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,060
Mayor Ed always had great hang time.

667
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:25,000
Finally gathered in by the wolves dangerous for men since an ass like Africa.

668
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,560
Come on.

669
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:25,920
Go, NC.

670
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,600
That boy better hold on tight.

671
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,240
It's still got a lot of oil in his hair.

672
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,560
Whoa, he sags, he sags.

673
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,760
He's digging, he's sagging.

674
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,500
He's sagging.

675
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:32,620
What?

676
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,100
Oh, taking to midfield.

677
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,140
Just over midfield.

678
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,380
No, no.

679
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,920
Now, depending on the school, which way they turn, the mayor's knows.

680
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,620
Whoa, this is sure exciting, but we gotta go away right now.

681
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,700
I lost my last twenty bucks to mook.

682
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,700
Radio off.

683
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,860
Your door is open.

684
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,220
I know that.

685
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,360
Come on in.

686
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,140
You are here.

687
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,020
Come on in.

688
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,000
You are here.

689
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,900
If it's soft and hard to find, it's Wimpy.

690
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,880
Wimpy software.

691
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,740
We've got the hard ones.

692
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,340
Gagglebacks from InfoNerd.

693
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,080
Wormhole.

694
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,100
Troll Trass.

695
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,520
Fly Duster from ComiCom.

696
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,100
Hugo's mystical head.

697
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,680
Beat off the bats in Drack Attack from HackerCore.

698
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,880
Tired of flipping the mouse?

699
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,580
Jump on our giant joystick.

700
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,360
Clean it every five days.

701
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,960
Ultra boring adventure two?

702
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,680
We've done it.

703
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:16,680


704
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:16,680


705
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:16,680


706
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:16,680


707
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:16,680


708
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:16,680


709
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:16,680


710
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,000
Got it.

711
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,480
Play with the big boys.

712
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,560
Come on in.

713
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,220
You are here.

714
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:20,860
Come on in.

715
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,720
GaggleMax is impossible to solve.

716
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,320
Wimpy, look, the stock number's the wrong place on all these invoices.

717
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:25,340
Who cares?

718
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:25,800
We're close.

719
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,700
Didn't you close that door?

720
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,300
He's coming in here.

721
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:27,960
Yo, Wimpy.

722
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:28,520
Yo, player.

723
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,760
Yo, mook.

724
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,600
Hey, you owe me twenty.

725
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,880
Hey, listen, give me a break.

726
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,760
I need another game.

727
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,140
I just beat GaggleMax.

728
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:34,420
What?

729
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:34,940
Beat GaggleMax?

730
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,640
Oh, liar, liar.

731
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,280
Pants on fire.

732
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,760
Hey, can I have that one there behind the cash register?

733
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,620
What's it called?

734
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,260
Eat or be eaten?

735
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:40,840
We're closed.

736
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,840
You can't have it dangerous.

737
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,380
It's being recalled.

738
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,060
Big bug.

739
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,380
Yeah, bugging it.

740
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,720
I'm not afraid of bugs, guys.

741
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,640
Hey, I tell you what, I got an idea.

742
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,320
I'll bet you twenty against that game, Wimp, that I got a riddle you can't solve.

743
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:49,800
That's my twenty.

744
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,120
Riddle?

745
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,700
I'm good at riddles.

746
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,020
Go ahead.

747
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:51,260
Go ahead.

748
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,260
I got twenty-five cigar butts.

749
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,900
It takes five cigar butts to make a new cigar.

750
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,800
How many do I smoke?

751
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,300
Five.

752
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:56,340
Five.

753
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,020
Six.

754
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,020
I smoke all five.

755
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,780
I got five butts left.

756
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,780
I got another cigar.

757
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:00,920
Give me the game.

758
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:01,820
Come on.

759
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,460
Give me the game.

760
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,360
That's nice.

761
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,320
Now, listen, not responsible.

762
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,260
You don't know where you got it.

763
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,700
Okay, we're not responsible for this.

764
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,960
Your door is closed.

765
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,180
Okay, what do we got here now?

766
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,780
I hate shrink wrap.

767
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,440
All right, let's see.

768
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,200
Got a booklet.

769
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,440
That's nice.

770
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,140
Oh, got some cards.

771
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,880
Got a map.

772
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,100
Oh, nice map.

773
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,340
What does it say here?

774
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,900
We got four levels, ninety-nine chambers.

775
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,280
Insert the disc at your own risk.

776
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,120
That's cute.

777
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,480
Well, here we go.

778
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,760
Hello, I'm Jackie Stupid.

779
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,820
Today, I'm being taken for a ride, just like you were when you bought me a new car.

780
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:41,820


781
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:41,820


782
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:41,820


783
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:41,820


784
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:41,820


785
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:41,820


786
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:41,820


787
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:41,820


788
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:41,820


789
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,760
I bought this new recall.

790
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,260
It's the new recall, the substandard compact from Kamikaze Motors.

791
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,340
And this is no ordinary drive.

792
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,860
We're heading for the edge of the Grand Canyon to test the new plastic brake system with

793
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,980
a look of real metal that's raised so many eyebrows among surviving American consumers.

794
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,700
This is the Kamikaze recall, voted the most advertised car by Road & Hearst magazine.

795
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,060
Here comes the edge.

796
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,480
Time to hit the brakes.

797
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,120
Oh, I already have.

798
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,260
Then it's time for me to get out.

799
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,800
Get out and get going to your Kamikaze.

800
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:11,800


801
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:11,800


802
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:11,800


803
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:11,800


804
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:11,800


805
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:11,800


806
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:11,800


807
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:11,800


808
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,260
And now, let's have a look at the new Kamikaze dealer.

809
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,340
Three to four, the door is hopelessly jammed.

810
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,800
But this seatbelt is broken, so I can use it and smash through the window that never

811
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,180
opens.

812
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,200
So long, laddie.

813
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,940
The Kamikaze recall is a proud sponsor of this game.

814
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,660
Entering Labyrinth, home of the Kudzu Harvest Festival.

815
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,620
One mower.

816
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,260
Moose meat every Tuesday.

817
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,160
Lions eat moose meat Wednesday.

818
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,680
Optimists welcome.

819
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,460
Pessimists say, that's the Labyrinth.

820
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,780
Big red balls, red balls, red balls, red balls.

821
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:41,780


822
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:41,780


823
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:41,780


824
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:41,780


825
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:41,780


826
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:41,780

849
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,640
shake it and hear the coins of the kids stay away from it and the money just at the top of the coin

850
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,880
accumulates until the bottom drops out.

851
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,400
Just like the market, Donnie.

852
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,440
I once saved about $89 in one.

853
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,880
Don't you wish you knew me then more quickly?

854
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,140
$89?

855
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,440
You know me now.

856
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:17,760
That's my number.

857
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,980
In the center lies the door that leads to hell.

858
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:26,380
Then, seek through smoke the clamor of the ghastly bell.

859
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,700
The door that leads to hell?

860
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,180
That's a card clue.

861
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't know if the card's in the car.

862
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,200
Oh, that is.

863
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,060
Ghastly bell.

864
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,200
I beg your pardon?

865
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,260
This is playing a game.

866
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,840
I want to buy a little beer.

867
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,080
I'm as dry as the Nile in winter.

868
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:45,840
You want a beer?

869
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,840
Okay, answer me this.

870
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,380
Two dudes are playing checkers.

871
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,020
They play five games, and they each win the same number of games.

872
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:51,300
How?

873
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,280
Oh, that's easy.

874
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,720
They weren't playing each other.

875
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,680
Yeah, that's right.

876
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,400
Here you go.

877
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,100
Two airheads.

878
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,160
Thanks, Lutie.

879
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:58,700
You're good.

880
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,680
What's your name?

881
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:00,680
Hawkmoth.

882
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,040
Hawkmoth?

883
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,020
It's Egyptian.

884
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:03,780
Call me.

885
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,260
Laura.

886
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,400
You know, your voice is really familiar.

887
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,620
Oh, I'm a DJ in Labyrinth.

888
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,220
Oh, yeah?

889
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,980
When can I catch a show?

890
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,680
Four in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three at night.

891
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,040
Four, three, two.

892
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,740
That adds up to eight.

893
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,260
Let's try it.

894
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,020
I'm feeling lucky.

895
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,120
Did you know that Johnny Carson ate Cab Calloway's baby to stay slim?

896
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,200
Where did you hear that?

897
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,260
I read it in the toilet.

898
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,380
Curious people want to know.

899
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,820
Did you know there's a place just six feet under the earth where you go when you die?

900
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,080
Where did you pick that up?

901
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:33,860
I picked it up.

902
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,440
In the toilet.

903
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,340
Here's what you'll find in the toilet this week.

904
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,980
Princess Di gave birth to a 65-pound show horse.

905
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,860
John Kennedy's come back in a spaceship with a super new diet.

906
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,520
Bert is dating John Hinckley to make Warren jealous.

907
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,500
I'm sleeping with Joan Collins, and I don't even know it.

908
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,280
Where did you read that?

909
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,200
In the toilet.

910
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,820
The National Toilet.

911
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,540
Put a quarter in the slot, and we'll wipe the world for you.

912
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,520
A quarter.

913
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,260
Now, that's 25.

914
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,860
There was a 65 and a 6.

915
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,460
Hey, Laura, what do you think?

916
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,360
Hey, where'd the Egyptian DJ go?

917
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,520
She's gone to the airport.

918
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,860
How do I get out there?

919
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:08,700
Trust me, player.

920
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,500
Try 33.

921
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,140
Okay.

922
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,420
I could be lying.

923
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,100
Hell, but that could be a lie.

924
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,300
I felt very wrong.

925
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,040
Sheep glands?

926
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,360
Because of those champagne glasses, it'd be a flight.

927
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,740
Well, sir, you did insist on ordering in the language of barbarian.

928
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,720
The word for sheep glands is indistinguishable from the word for champagne.

929
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,240
Well, I should have ordered the Diet Coke.

930
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,040
Well, sir, no, then you probably would have been executed.

931
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,960
You see, the word for Diet Cola is indistinguishable from the word for...

932
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,300
Welcome to Barberia, infidel friends.

933
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,220
May I be opening your luggage, please?

934
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,400
Well, this is the American ambassador.

935
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,420
Oh, the ambassador.

936
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,060
Hooray, hooray.

937
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,560
Let's open all his luggage.

938
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,480
Let's open this.

939
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,660
Oh, look at this nice underwear, Mr. Ambassador.

940
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,460
Doesn't it make a fine hat on my head, huh?

941
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,860
It is a gift to you from the American people.

942
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,360
Oh, a gift?

943
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,280
Well, let's party.

944
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,140
Do you have any whiskey, Mr. Ambassador?

945
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:55,520
No.

946
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:56,760
Oh, what a shame.

947
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,720
Here, have some of mine.

948
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,500
Oh, I accept this on behalf of the American people.

949
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,160
I squeezed it from my own sheep?

950
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,280
On the other hand...

951
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,560
I could challenge you to a Diet Cola.

952
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,700
No, no, no.

953
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,320
How do you say no?

954
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:08,920
Just no.

955
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,160
Oh, what's this peeking out from under your underwear?

956
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,160
It's a bottle of whiskey on my head.

957
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,480
Oh, the whiskey head tax here in Barberia is 1,060 caroums.

958
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,080
But you put that bottle of glands on your head.

959
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,000
Diet Cola?

960
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,280
Just pay it, sir.

961
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,000
We're in over our head.

962
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,020
What is the exchange rate?

963
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,200
20 to the dollar.

964
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,880
Well, now, what is the purpose of your visit to Spires?

965
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,400
My good man, this is the new ambassador.

966
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,560
I am here to take over the American embassy.

967
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,280
Oh, that's right.

968
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:33,840
Lots of fun.

969
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,660
My club and I do it every week.

970
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,160
But you need lots of men with underwear on their head and guns.

971
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,120
Well, player, please come to the game courtesy telephone.

972
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:41,960
That's Laura.

973
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,380
Hello.

974
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:43,960
Hello, Laura.

975
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,520
It's player.

976
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,620
Say, look, I'm sorry that we...

977
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,620
Your call is ready, player.

978
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,120
Laura?

979
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,020
Don't leave.

980
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,180
Who's leaving?

981
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:49,480
Huh?

982
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,540
It's me, Mook.

983
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,960
How you doing with the game?

984
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,320
Oh, I'm in Barberia.

985
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,000
Already?

986
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,700
Did you run into the bunk yet?

987
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,420
No, but I met this DJ.

988
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,060
Yeah, Wimpy told me.

989
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,300
You're gonna get eaten.

990
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,740
You still got my 20?

991
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,360
20?

992
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,580
Thanks for the clue, Mook.

993
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,460
Hey, it's not a clue.

994
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,400
I want my money.

995
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,100
Shoplifters, you're getting away with value.

996
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:15,280
Listen to what Mrs. G86-T91 of Honor Farm, Missouri, says about value at Shoplifters.

997
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,940
I walked away with over $130 worth of hams in my pants, and it only cost me 50 bucks in 60 days.

998
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,060
Shoplifters, you're getting away with more food.

999
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,240
This week's special, squirrel squares from Road Ready Flat Snacks.

1000
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,740
Velcro macaroni sticks to the outside of your ribs.

1001
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,340
And stupid Belgium waffles.

1002
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:32,500
And school hats.

1003
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,940
Shoplifters, we give you a bigger head start.

1004
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:41,800
Remember, there's no long lines at our checkout counter, because there are no checkout counters.

1005
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,860
We just follow you to your car and read you your rights.

1006
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:49,080
Shoplifters, a market that puts you away.

1007
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,600
Visit our seven convenience stores in King's Nose.

1008
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,780
King's Nose?

1009
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,020
I thought I was in Puttyville.

1010
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,260
All right, all right, King's Nose.

1011
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,240
Here I am.

1012
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,980
I go down past the snot rocks here to Puerto Dork.

1013
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,340
And to get up around a labyrinth, I take a little walk.

1014
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:02,340


1015
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:02,340


1016
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:02,340


1017
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:02,620
101.

1018
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,360
Oh, tricky, tricky.

1019
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,760
I use 57.

1020
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,400
Hello, hello, I'm Ed Stiffner, the crazy commando.

1021
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,540
Ordinance officer at the neighborhood survival gun store.

1022
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,360
Want to build up your small arms, Mr. and Mrs. Scaredy Cat Survivor Night?

1023
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,400
Has your neighborhood become dangerous to live in because people with different names have moved next door?

1024
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,060
Well, you don't have to take it lying down.

1025
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,720
But if you are lying down, try our recoilless recliner designer rifle.

1026
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,320
You don't have to leave the cozy comfort of your bed to wait.

1027
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:32,320


1028
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:36,600
You can chase that rude intruder or strafe the friggin' rock and roll party across the street.

1029
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,220
Tell them how to find us, Fred.

1030
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,800
I don't know, man.

1031
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,300
Read the paper.

1032
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:40,940
Oh, the paper.

1033
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,600
Concrete off the road tire.

1034
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,760
Read, I'm adding the paper.

1035
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,660
Neighborhood survival gun store is easy to find.

1036
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:47,580
Yeah, I'm here.

1037
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,760
We're four flights below the ruins of the beautiful bunker building.

1038
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,600
Left face, 14 goose steps, and you're there.

1039
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,620
This week, try our survival as special.

1040
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:01,840
Yeah, that's the simple little kit we sell under the counter that converts your harmless .22 caliber starter pistol

1041
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,200
into a selective fire 50 millimeter armor piercing weapon system.

1042
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:05,900
It's a bitch.

1043
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,840
So shoot first and make friends later.

1044
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,120
Yeah.

1045
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,960
Set your sights on your neighborhood survival gun store.

1046
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,740
Ask for Ed or Fred Stiffner.

1047
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,900
That's us, the crazy commandos.

1048
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:19,760
And you'll get free a life-size replica of the alabaster arrow of improbability.

1049
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:23,840
Uh, the weapon that saved or, uh, did it destroy the ancient world, Fred.

1050
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,500
Well, I don't know, Ed. I wasn't there, you know.

1051
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,700
14 goose steps and...

1052
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,780
Hey, I'm off the map.

1053
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,400
Hello?

1054
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,280
Yo, player.

1055
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,320
Yo, Wimpy.

1056
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,680
Listen, I'm gonna get in big trouble for giving you that game.

1057
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,060
Now, are you off the map yet?

1058
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:38,500
Yeah.

1059
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:41,080
Well, that's one of the bugs. You better turn yourself in.

1060
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,900
No way, man. I got a date with a beautiful girl in Labyrinth.

1061
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,300
Labyrinth? You can't even get there from there.

1062
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,960
Hey, Wimp, look at the map. I'll take, uh, Route 101.

1063
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,940
No, no, no. There's only 99 bands on the disk.

1064
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:56,280
I'll take the chance. She's worth it. 101, here I come.

1065
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,140
But that's another bug.

1066
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:08,800
No!

1067
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,220
Hello, Faber. And welcome to the game.

1068
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,260
The game. The game. The game. The game.

1069
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,440
The game.

1070
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,020
Seven, sir.

1071
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,000
Huh? Huh?

1072
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,780
Where am I?

1073
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,520
This is the pit.

1074
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,080
This is the pit.

1075
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,220
We've got your head.

1076
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,580
Oh, baloney!

1077
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:39,280
Oh, that laser beam nearly made optical weenies out of me.

1078
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,040
I gotta get moving.

1079
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,320
Hey, I am moving.

1080
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,540
It's, it's cold here.

1081
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,060
Hey, hey, come on over by the fire, stranger.

1082
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:52,680
You talking to me?

1083
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,300
You look cold and lost.

1084
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,140
I am.

1085
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,720
Just sit on the spit.

1086
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,620
Thanks a lot.

1087
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,880
Make yourself at home.

1088
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,840
And this here's the end of the road.

1089
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:01,500
Sure is.

1090
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,620
This here is Donna's past.

1091
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,140
Oh, yeah?

1092
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,340
Yeah, too bad Donna passed on.

1093
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,600
We just had her.

1094
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,760
Oh, he just passed her.

1095
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:10,980
Wait a minute.

1096
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,100
And eating sure works up an appetite.

1097
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,360
Nice to have you for dinner, cuz.

1098
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:15,640
What?

1099
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:16,500
You're a...

1100
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,560
Hey, hey, hey!

1101
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,220
Get your teeth out of my britches!

1102
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,460
Hey, let me out of here!

1103
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,260
Help me! Help me!

1104
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:36,080
And dear friends, that is the end of side one of Eat or Be Eaten, the, uh, Firesign Theatre album.

1105
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:50,860
As we come to the close of side two of this subgenius hour of slack radio ministry, and the post office box that you need to write to for information is this one.

1106
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,600
Bob.

1107
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,940
P.O. Box.

1108
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:01,440
140306.

1109
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,400
Dallas, Texas.

1110
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,040
75214.

1111
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,480
That's the way people leave their phone numbers on my machine.

1112
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:13,940
75214.

1113
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:23,580
And, uh, you can easily email slack at metronet.com or on most of the other social media platforms.

1114
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:23,580


1115
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:23,580


1116
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,840
And, uh, you can also use the web browsers.

1117
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:36,900
You can just type in the word subgenius, tell it to go there, and it will go straight to www.subgenius.com.

1118
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:43,760
Where you can hear, among other things, this show again.

1119
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,980
It actually sounds quite good now.

1120
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,060
It's, it is amazing.

1121
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,400
Once again, we must take our hats off and our, or perhaps even our pants off.

1122
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,620
To the great Reverend Wanderer, or Wanderer.

1123
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:02,300
Um, also known as Rev, I rend.

1124
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,220
I have trouble with pronunciations.

1125
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:09,840
He, he's, uh, he's a whiz kid.

1126
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:19,280
And, and we're whizzing the show over the internet so that you can be listening in Japan like you are right now.

1127
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,580
Thank y'all.

1128
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:22,400
.

1129
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,380
.

1130
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,220
.

1131
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,680
.

1132
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:39,560
.

1133
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:39,980
.

1134
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,260
.

1135
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:41,280
.

1136
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:41,560
.

1137
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:41,620
.

1138
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:10,400
We're all to proclaim the word of God.

1139
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,180
I'm thrilled that there are training programs like ours and many other fine ones.

1140
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,560
We're on and off game.

1141
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:22,760
Our right is to say, no, I don't want you to search my car.

1142
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:28,840
However, at that time, an officer can, under the law, bring a dog to sniff your car as long as they don't have to hold you too long.

1143
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,820
But if it's where it is, where it is.

1144
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:40,080
Turn your radio down, and that way you'll not hear two of us coming at you.

1145
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,540
You and an echo.

1146
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,080
You and me and a movie star.

1147
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,920
The number to call is 800.

1148
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:53,800
If you had a word gay in the Constitution, and you read the Constitution today, would they be talking about homosexuals?

1149
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,980
No. The word gay in the law doesn't ever change.

1150
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,440
I don't need a, I don't need a weapon, I'm not one.

1151
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,180
Dancing on the floor, I can't help but want.

1152
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:09,340
It's a refusal to hope, or it's a refusal to continue to mourn.

1153
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,560
And therefore ask God to comfort us.
