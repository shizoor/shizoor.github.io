1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
From PR news in Washington, I'm banging on a pipe inserted into a Boston native today, but so far, no response.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,380
Anti-government protesters in the Central Asian country of West Virginia stand.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,100
They're considerably higher than just a few weeks ago.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,960
PR's calling for the current government to step down.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,420
And injure his shoulder.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,420
Kevin Federal Safedration says North Korea and the Washington Teachers Union

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,160
have reached a tentative agreement after a report showing U.S. gasoline supplies lower than expected.

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,540
There are reports that this is PR news in Washington.

9
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,540
The subgenius power of sweat.

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,480
I'm bored.

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,280
What plaything can you offer me today?

12
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,960
An obscure body in the SK system, Your Majesty.

13
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,280
The inhabitants refer to it as

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,280
The subgenius power of sweat.

15
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,160
Ha ha ha ha ha.

16
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,680
Ha ha ha ha ha.

17
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,960
Most effective, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,160
Will you destroy this, uh...

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,040
Subgenius power of sweat.

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,360
Later.

21
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,240
I like to play with things a while.

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,840
Before annihilation.

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,860
From PR news in Washington, I'm the Coast Guard.

25
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,080
Control the oil.

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,700
Mexico.

27
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,020
A letter the Guard has sent to BP

28
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,860
sets an end-of-the-weekend deadline

29
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,920
for the BP to speed up efforts to pick up the pace.

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,440
BP Chief Operating Officer says he understands BP.

31
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,820
BP says it will respond to BBC today.

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,580
The subgenius power of sweat.

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,020
The subgenius power of sweat.

34
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,860
The subgenius power of sweat.

35
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,680
Support for PR comes from Progressive Insurance,

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,160
sponsor of A Race to Develop Cars.

37
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,400
Now that's progressive.

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,600
From PR News in Washington,

39
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,220
I'm taking a first step in easing global protests

40
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,380
over its deadly confrontation with snack foods and drinks.

41
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,860
But authorities say they still need a steady flow of PR hours.

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,160
So, let's get started.

43
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,240
Let's get started.

44
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,480
Let's get started.

45
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,680
Let's get started.

46
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,100
Let's get started.

47
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,400
Let's get started.

48
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,380
Let's get started.

49
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,400
Let's get started.

50
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:25,400
Let's get started.

51
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,700
Yeah!

52
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,420
Come and get it!

53
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:32,900
Woo!

54
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,480
The redneck cookout was going full swing

55
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,060
Almost everyone in town had just arrived

56
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,660
Folks were throwing on the grill

57
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,400
Everything that they could kill

58
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,960
And a couple critters that were still alive

59
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,500
While the meat was running down

60
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,220
When army folks from out of town

61
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,860
Showed up and started bossing us around

62
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,500
They said everyone should leave

63
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,140
And now this you won't believe

64
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,840
The dead were up and crawling from the ground

65
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,180
Say, hang on right here

66
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,540
I just had a great idea

67
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,240
We'll have a zombie apocalypse barbecue

68
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,400
I'll save a couple ribs for you

69
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,100
Even though y'all were elated

70
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,060
You'll be thankful that you hated this

71
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,200
Zombie apocalypse barbecue

72
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,740
Make some for me!

73
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,820
The zombies started gathering

74
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,460
His bill began to slather

75
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,080
In the sauce on which he built his family name

76
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,700
But one of the zombies got him

77
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,100
So my sister up and shot him in the head

78
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,900
And then she dumped him in the flame

79
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,720
By the time we started packing up

80
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,440
The zombies were attacking us

81
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,700
They bit me and it caused a bunch of pain

82
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,200
But I heard the zombies say

83
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,900
Is my life just slipped away?

84
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
Could we try some of that sauce out on your brain?

85
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,100
I thought why not just let her?

86
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,420
The sauce makes everything better

87
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,080
At the zombie apocalypse barbecue

88
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,200
Well even if you don't survive

89
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,740
Be it brains or chicken wings

90
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,540
Barbecue's one of those things

91
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,060
That makes you smile just to be alive

92
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,860
Zombie apocalypse barbecue

93
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,000
We'll save some ribs for you

94
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,840
Whether or not you deserve it

95
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
Everybody will get served out at the

96
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,900
Zombie apocalypse barbecue

97
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,300
We'll save some ribs for you

98
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,180
Whether or not you deserve it

99
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,180


100
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,180


101
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,680
That there's some good eatin'

102
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,400
Alright, step right up

103
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,660
What kind of sauce would you like?

104
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,560
Spicy or mild?

105
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,780
Good God, son, what happened to you?

106
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,460
You look terrible

107
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,380
Here, take this

108
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,840
Hey, let go of the arms! What are you doing?

109
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:51,840


110
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,520
You're supposed to eat the ribs, son! Not me!

111
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,400
No! Let go! No! No!

112
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,000
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH

113
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,800
Come with me if you want to live

114
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:33,240
Her but sheぁ Su или

115
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,320
Yo!

116
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
��

117
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,740
І

118
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,640
А

119
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,860
Ё

120
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,860
Cross mind

121
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,860
Anyway, not wearing two-bladed turn-lock is gonna be a real bad day, get it?

122
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Anyway, not wearing two-bladed turn-lock is gonna be a real bad day, get it?

123
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,820
Come with me if you want to live.

124
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,660
This is Cactus Dangerous.

125
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,920
Brain fog.

126
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,340
This is Cactus Dangerous.

127
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,540
Brain fog.

128
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,040
This is Cactus Dangerous.

129
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,260
Brain fog.

130
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,700
This is Cactus Dangerous.

131
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,840
Come with me if you want to live.

132
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:46,960
Toto?

133
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,840
I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

134
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,720
Roger that.

135
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,500
This absolutely will not stop.

136
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,600
Ever.

137
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,920
Until you are dead.

138
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,160
Come with me if you want to live.

139
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,740
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.

140
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,000
Come with me if you want to live.

141
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,120
Yooooo!

142
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,020
And that was St. Anne.

143
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,380
And is Dave here?

144
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,560
I'm here.

145
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,680
Dave is here.

146
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,180
There's that old Dave.

147
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,940
Dave came.

148
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,800
All over his shoes.

149
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,040
That's not funny.

150
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,580
It certainly isn't.

151
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,160
In the middle of...

152
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, I have to give the credits, as always.

153
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,160
Your call is, of course, the cue for the credits of what's been done.

154
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,200
Credits.

155
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:33,860
So far.

156
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,540
That was St. Anne doing X Day.

157
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,660
And then there was all a series of End of the World songs.

158
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,420
Before that, the one called Zombie Apocalypse Barbecue.

159
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,320
It's by our friends at Consortium of Genius.

160
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,760
Or C-O-G.

161
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,520
COG.

162
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,800
Consortiumofgenius.com.

163
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:03,980
They're like a musical comedy variety show group that does skits.

164
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,020
And that one, Zombie Apocalypse Barbecue, that kind of relates to our upcoming X Day holiday.

165
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,940
As did Jonathan Colton's song, Always the Moon.

166
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:22,160
And the very weird electronic with the little voice going...

167
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,100
That voice was Janer.

168
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,100
And the music was done by Reverend Sodi.

169
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,440
Sodi.

170
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:39,200
The subgenius in hell, the plaintive subgenius in hell, was Reverend Eric,

171
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,700
who also helped with one of the intro tracks, as did The Large.

172
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,800
And?

173
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,180
Preuberant.

174
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:56,660
Preuberant lemur, the cousin of Fernandanende lemur, the Madagascarian subgenius.

175
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,880
So was he the preuberant preponderant?

176
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,960
He's the actual cousin?

177
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,780
Right.

178
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,900
Cousin lemur.

179
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,620
Preuberant lemur, cousin of Fernandanende.

180
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,160
So one is thin and smelt, and the other one is smelt regularly?

181
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,760
Yes.

182
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:14,920
And what is the reason?

183
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:14,920


184
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:14,920


185
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:14,920


186
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,800
You know, I can take a hint, man.

187
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,980
I know I need a shower.

188
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,640
I'm painfully aware that I could use a shower.

189
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,480
Yeah, but you're not 200 pounds overweight and need a shower.

190
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
That's a different smell.

191
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,060
I'm working on it, though.

192
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,640
Oh, yeah?

193
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,240
Yeah.

194
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:30,900
I didn't know that.

195
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:38,840
Well, as my friend Mr. Sistar loses weight, having had the operation, I'm gaining it all.

196
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,620
It's like a karmic balance.

197
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:49,520
So I'm hoping that by X day I'll be too heavy to be lifted up by the Space Brothers into their escape vessels.

198
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,180
No, no, no, no, no, no.

199
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,240
You probably need one of those grocery store wheelchairs for the large ladies with a little flag and says,

200
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,580
Support our troops on it.

201
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,960
Oh, I hadn't thought of that.

202
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,020
Huh?

203
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,100
I hadn't.

204
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:11,600
I read on the Internet that back in 2003 when the balloon went up,

205
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:19,200
when the shooting started in Iraq, I didn't like what Emperor Bush's war,

206
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,020
but I have sympathy for men at arms.

207
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,840
And on our website, it was all red, white, and blue bobs, and it said,

208
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,500
We support our troops.

209
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,940
And I read today that because of that, I'm not a communist.

210
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,940
And they thought that was the person writing thought that was bad

211
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,380
because they were the chaos.

212
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,080
They're a mass Marxism group.

213
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,780
They're discordians of some kind of...

214
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:51,580
They're the kind of people who think that the one political path is the right one,

215
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:58,720
whereas we all know that the only one that's right is our individual political path.

216
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,160
As determined by the large platypus J.R. Bob Dobbs.

217
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,540
We have to add that because he's the mastermind behind every tuba.

218
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,260
Yep.

219
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,420
He's the one blowing the bass parts.

220
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,000
He's the one singing in the background here, I think.

221
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,500
Oh, no.

222
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,080
What is that noise in the background?

223
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,680
Afro-Celtic.

224
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,600
Oh, that's right.

225
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,080
Yeah, the background music is the Afro-Celtic.

226
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,760
Is that the name of the band?

227
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,860
Afro-Celt or something?

228
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,440
No, it's not that.

229
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,200
It's Afro-Celtic Orchestra or something.

230
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:27,380
Oh, that's right.

231
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,480
Yeah, Afro-Celt.

232
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,060
I'll listen to that.

233
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,240
Afro-Celtic.

234
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,540
That's it.

235
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,140
Well, that's how exciting it sounds like every other music.

236
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,460
Because that is what is great about music.

237
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,600
It is the unifying...

238
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,180
It's the unifying factor.

239
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,800
It's the hands and the feet and the third nostril of those who care to dance to the pooper.

240
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,360
You know, if they can get that far.

241
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,280
Oh, you should have seen Princess We rocking out in the studio here a little while ago

242
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,220
when that Janeer voice song was on.

243
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,580
Hey, it was lively.

244
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,680
Oh, and the extra St. Anne song.

245
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,800
It's lively, too.

246
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,020
Oh, yeah.

247
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,020
And the zombie apocalypse barbecue.

248
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,620
That one made my mouth water.

249
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,600
So she pantomimed to all of those songs.

250
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,640
She, like, walked around.

251
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,980
And the zombie one.

252
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,480
She held her hands out and went...

253
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,180
Yeah, I did interpretive dancing to all of it.

254
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,880
That is so artistic.

255
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,840
I kind of wish I had your succinct flavor.

256
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,600
You probably wish you had her body.

257
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,280
No, I wish I had some sort of human body.

258
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,460
Well, Dave, you'll get to...

259
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,840
Well, not necessarily a subgenius body, perhaps.

260
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:40,900
We all get to leave our bodies on that glorious time.

261
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,260
Which is coming up.

262
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:50,960
The time that we have looked forward to ever since it was first predicted 12 years ago in 1998.

263
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,760
Yes, this year might be it.

264
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,000
Next day, July 5th.

265
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,520
And I can advertise it on this public radio station

266
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,300
because it's pretty certain that I won't be making any money off of that.

267
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,060
Also...

268
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,920
No, seriously.

269
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,820
Also, Starwood.

270
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,800
Is coming up immediately after X-Day.

271
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,740
New date.

272
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,360
At a new date.

273
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,460
We are literally going to have to leave our escape vessels at 7.15 on July 5th

274
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,000
and go to the Starwood escape vessel,

275
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,440
which will be temporarily landed in Pomeroy, Ohio,

276
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,840
at a campground called Wisteria.

277
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,540
Almost on the Ohio River.

278
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,520
And it will be different and new because it won't be the same.

279
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,440
It's a new place.

280
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,600
And a new date.

281
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,140
Are there fabrications in the earth?

282
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
Indian mounds and different things like that?

283
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,860
Yes, there are, in fact.

284
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,160
Yes, there are Indian mounds there.

285
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,120
And they have made their own mounds there.

286
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,640
There's Turtle Mound and Ancestor Mound that they have made.

287
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,300
And Popular Candy Mound and Blue Light Special Mound.

288
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,700
And Unpopular Lonesome Cowboy Dave Mound.

289
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,760
No, I won't be at Wisteria because it's so far.

290
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:10,920
It's so hard.

291
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,540
It reminds me of trying to walk to the planet Xeron backwards with no feet.

292
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,720
In the snow.

293
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,940
In the snow.

294
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,780
In the burning hot sun and snow.

295
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,220
And pouring rain.

296
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,600
Without a drop to drink.

297
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,340
No.

298
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,560
With too much spaghetti.

299
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,640
Slugging our way through this horrible life

300
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,340
with only the dangling carrot of Bob's Promise

301
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,780
hanging in front of our blinkered faces.

302
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,920
Danny on.

303
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,720
Of course.

304
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,240
Get your chop.

305
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,700
He's leading us past an entire road lined with free carrot stands.

306
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,600
But you know how people are.

307
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,500
They have narrow focus.

308
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,860
Especially when you put blinkers on them like we did.

309
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,340
And you have someone as eye-catching as Bob.

310
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,380
I mean, come on.

311
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,160
Bob is more than eye-catching.

312
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,460
He's like nose-grabbing.

313
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,780
He's brain-smashing.

314
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,680
One of those people that goes up to your face and pulls your nose.

315
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,380
Yes.

316
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,800
He pulls your nose and he yanks your ear.

317
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,480
And then he comes...

318
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,680
He gives you a whoop-whoop sound, unfortunately,

319
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,320
which you can't do very well.

320
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,560
He tries to sound like Curly.

321
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,740
Instead, he sounds like a baboon.

322
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,980
He gives you a wedgie.

323
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,000
And he pantses you.

324
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,420
De-pantses you.

325
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,700
While he pants.

326
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,520
Yes.

327
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,660
Like a baboon.

328
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,640
If we had better leaders.

329
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,300
Think how much better things would be

330
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,500
if we didn't have leaders like Bob.

331
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,520
Oh, I don't know about that.

332
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,140
I mean...

333
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,520
And Bob's the perfect leader.

334
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,060
He's never around.

335
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,480
And he...

336
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,660
His commandments don't make a lick of sense.

337
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,760
Not a lick.

338
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,160
To speak of.

339
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,600
I guess that's my kind of leader, then.

340
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,440
Right.

341
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,600
He doesn't know what the hell he's saying.

342
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,560
He's not there anyway.

343
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,020
You can be alone with Bob.

344
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,740
You know?

345
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,820
You can have your cake and eat it.

346
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,300
And still have cake.

347
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,760
And you can do the cake walk afterwards,

348
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,580
with Bob, down a long, nuptial driveway.

349
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,020
That old Bob.

350
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,820
And you can have a short-duration marriage,

351
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,440
even with Bob in your mind.

352
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,040
Bob was the reason...

353
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,180
Yeah.

354
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:20,680
What?

355
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,280
That's true.

356
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,640
He said you could have a short-duration marriage

357
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,440
with Bob in your mind.

358
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,340
Oh.

359
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,000
That makes me feel better about what I did today.

360
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,920
Oh.

361
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,860
We were...

362
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,780
Bob and I were married, after all,

363
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,020
in a certain way.

364
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,700
It was legal.

365
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,480
And it was...

366
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,220
It was right in the eyes of someone,

367
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,500
of God, or...

368
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,680
some...

369
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,160
perhaps Dobbs himself.

370
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,320
Gosh, glad I was away at a meeting.

371
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,100
I don't think I would have liked to have seen that.

372
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,520
It was all right in the eyes of Gosh.

373
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,020
God's second-in-command.

374
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,340
His right-hand man, Gosh.

375
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,260
It's okay to say Gosh, damn it,

376
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,540
because it's not so vain when you do that.

377
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,000
How about Golly, damn it?

378
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,680
Well, Golly, gosh, darn,

379
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,260
is like the nephew.

380
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,140
God's nephew.

381
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,160
Oh!

382
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,360
Well, you know, Golly G's is, um,

383
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,840
is a subtractive art

384
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,700
that they use in the Orient,

385
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,560
sometimes like an abacus.

386
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,940
No, it means, um, Golly G,

387
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,580
and, you know, you fill in the remaining parts,

388
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,940
but you don't want to blast humor.

389
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,800
I believe in Golly G.

390
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,560
I believe in Golly G.

391
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,920
I believe in cripes.

392
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,060
I believe in cripes.

393
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,220
I believe in tuna salsan,

394
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,520
chicken salsan.

395
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,580
I believe in cramps.

396
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,080
And criminy.

397
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,400
St. Criminy.

398
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,560
The, Jesus' third nephew,

399
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,000
step-neighbor-in-law.

400
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,740
Oh, yes.

401
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,200
And criminies.

402
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,600
Oh, yes, we will, but soon.

403
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,920
You know, it's only two weeks

404
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,440
before we start packing the I-van

405
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,860
for X-Day at Brushwood.

406
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,460
Because that actually starts June 30th,

407
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,400
and we'll be hauling Dr. Howell out there,

408
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,080
Dr. Philodrummond and his girls,

409
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,660
will be there.

410
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,300
Um, the amino acids will be at X-Day.

411
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,500
Fat Man D will be at X-Day.

412
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,820
Oh, you and Fat Man D have a special concert planned,

413
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,860
don't you, Princess Wee?

414
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,400
Yes.

415
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,740
We have a rehearsal coming up,

416
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,020
just to practice for it.

417
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,420
And what will it be?

418
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,600
Well, I'm going to accompany her

419
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,620
in some torch songs,

420
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,120
the kind of torch songs that she sings,

421
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,960
but add some,

422
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,560
some harmony.

423
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,140
Who will be the accompanists?

424
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,500
The torturers.

425
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,540
That's why it's called Torch Song.

426
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,500
Ah.

427
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,260
We'll have the,

428
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,900
they'll play the torturers.

429
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,340
They'll be holding their feet in fire.

430
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,020
Baron Munchausen,

431
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,100
the torturer's apprentice,

432
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,560
or something like that.

433
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,800
Baron von Munchausen will be there?

434
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,900
Yeah, and the sultan.

435
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,520
And the Turks will be at X-Day.

436
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,620
A eunuch's, that was it,

437
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,880
the name of the song was

438
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,480
A Eunuch's Life is Hard.

439
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,980
Yes.

440
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,540
But that is all,

441
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,600
I think was the way that song went.

442
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,360
Well, one is reminded of the,

443
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,880
of the Chinese eunuch admirals

444
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,640
who were sent around the world

445
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,980
in the 1400s,

446
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,900
in the early 1400s and late 1300s

447
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,300
to navigate the entire planet

448
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,060
and bring back a large map.

449
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,540
That's right.

450
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,380
I didn't know that those were

451
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,300
eunuch captains of those ships.

452
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,700
Yes, although there were

453
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,680
many hot concubines

454
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,640
which were used as a form of trade.

455
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,120
The guys on top were left alone,

456
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,920
so to speak.

457
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:48,540
The pitchers.

458
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,660
Yeah.

459
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,920
I read that there is a wreck

460
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,420
of an ancient, really ancient,

461
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,380
but pretty large ship

462
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,640
at the bottom of a river

463
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,920
near San Francisco

464
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,340
that nobody can really prove this either way,

465
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
but they think it might possibly be

466
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,380
one of those Chinese expeditions

467
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,820
that found the New World

468
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,960
before Columbus did.

469
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,480
Well, why do you think the Haida

470
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,700
and the other people of the Northwest

471
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,040
were trading with the Japanese?

472
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,640
The Japanese got the maps

473
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,900
of the cool places to go

474
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,040
to get whatever they wanted,

475
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,020
be it large beetles and bugs and stuff

476
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,980
or reeds or chicken spit.

477
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,360
I didn't know that the Japanese

478
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,860
got to the New World.

479
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,000
Oh, they,

480
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,760
it was more than rumored

481
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,420
that they traded,

482
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,920
and intermarried with the Haida

483
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,480
and the people of Northern California

484
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,640
all the way up to Oregon

485
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,260
or Washington,

486
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,340
whichever is the farthest.

487
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,500
I did not know that.

488
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,460
I never heard that.

489
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,520
I heard about the Chinese

490
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,420
and, of course,

491
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,240
the Vikings for sure.

492
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,020
There's no question about that.

493
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,140
Yes.

494
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,700
That's a known falsehood,

495
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,780
but no, a known fact.

496
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,640
Right.

497
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,460
So.

498
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,840
I can't say it on the air.

499
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,420
I can't.

500
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:08,540
No one can know.

501
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,720
I can't say it on the air,

502
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,600
but I'll explain later.

503
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,300
I had to laugh.

504
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,240
It's a bit,

505
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,120
it's a subgenius thing.

506
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,880
It's a slack thing.

507
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,580
You wouldn't understand.

508
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,640
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

509
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,080
Aha, aha, aha.

510
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,740
And I thought my jokes were bad.

511
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,480
They are.

512
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,160
They're horrible sometimes.

513
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,000
Sometimes you take three weeks

514
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,940
to get to the punchline.

515
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,020
Yes, I know.

516
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,420
I need a shower, Dave.

517
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,700
You don't need to rub it in.

518
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,260
And if you want to say it

519
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,420
as Reverend Stanger,

520
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:38,820
and says it,

521
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,900
say horrible.

522
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,100
He says horrible.

523
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,980
Give me an orange.

524
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,880
I feel horrible.

525
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,640
My mom was from Connecticut,

526
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,560
and her mom was from New York.

527
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,020
So every now and then,

528
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,680
that New York stuff

529
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,220
pops up in my otherwise

530
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,380
South Carolinian-influenced speech.

531
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,120
Go figure.

532
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,180
Go figure.

533
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,780
Who else shall be at X Day?

534
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,100
Priestess Pisces shall be

535
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,460
the sub-manager,

536
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,420
and Rambam,

537
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,280
Reverend Modemac.

538
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,380
But Pisces is much more bossy,

539
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,560
and also the guys are much more

540
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,920
willing to hump

541
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,500
when she tells them to.

542
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,280
She has an ample bosom

543
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,620
and parts therein.

544
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,720
And so any man with any kind

545
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,860
of true manhood

546
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,860
sees her and wants to take orders

547
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,080
from her, not from Modemac.

548
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,840
Or the big boss of this area

549
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,620
will be there

550
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,360
with her consort, Sifu.

551
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,800
And people take orders

552
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,400
from her as well.

553
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,100
Doc.

554
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,200
Frop himself

555
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,800
and Sister Decadence

556
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,720
will be at X Day.

557
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,120
And these people aren't,

558
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,680
they don't get these names,

559
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,600
they don't just make up these names.

560
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,360
These are like,

561
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,720
they're like American Indian names.

562
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,100
They earned them.

563
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,020
And these were difficult names

564
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,840
to earn, too.

565
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,200
Decadence and Frop.

566
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,120
It was great Frop indeed.

567
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,980
That one time.

568
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,400
Whatever, whatever that,

569
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,280
whatever Frop,

570
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:08,620
I don't know what it is.

571
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,540
I really don't know.

572
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,220
I don't either,

573
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,240
but it is decadent.

574
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,960
I know that.

575
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,760
Well, I think it's,

576
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,620
in some countries,

577
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,780
it's a form of cheese

578
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,520
that's been lubricated

579
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,940
over a long period of time

580
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,180
and then allowed to commit itself

581
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,760
to a spermatic adventure

582
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,080
somewhere in, I don't know.

583
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,400
The spermatic adventures

584
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,980
will be at Hex Day.

585
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,260
I think Fat Free,

586
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,600
they're always there.

587
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,340
Oh, Monkey Hive.

588
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,740
That's a new band.

589
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,280
Monkey Hive?

590
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,460
That's an interesting name.

591
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,500
Reverend Sud's band, Monkey Hive.

592
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,900
Well, it's spelled funny

593
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,060
with a U in the monkey

594
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,560
and a Y in the hive.

595
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,340
So instead of like a beehive,

596
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,120
it's a monkey hive

597
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,140
or is it the kind of hives

598
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,480
you get after in contact

599
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,100
with monkeys?

600
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,740
Well, and then there's

601
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,780
Reverend H.V. Monkey,

602
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,860
our man in the Devo world.

603
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,400
And, oh yes, anyway, yeah.

604
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,420
All the babes will be there.

605
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,060
I hope Dr. Legume will be there.

606
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,840
Oh, by the way,

607
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,660
our friend Dr. Legume

608
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,940
has found himself

609
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,780
healing up from his

610
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,940
five bypass operations

611
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,880
on his heart

612
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,160
and he's kind of weakly

613
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,020
and he can't do the kind of

614
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,600
tough work he used to do

615
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,880
and he's looking for a job

616
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,900
and a place to stay.

617
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,020
So if there's a brave enough

618
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,340
subgenius out there,

619
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,920
one who, like Igor,

620
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,140
who would love

621
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,280
to have a shambling,

622
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,640
hulking monster

623
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,340
at his beck and call.

624
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,440
Actually, it would be

625
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,200
the other way around.

626
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,660
The monster would end up

627
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,940
ordering the Igor around.

628
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,420
It'd be kicking ball or something.

629
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,140
Igor, would you go bring me

630
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,040
another one of them

631
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,440
frog sticks?

632
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,400
Igor, would you go bring me

633
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,060
another brain?

634
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,880
Make it a criminal brain this time.

635
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,080
I don't need another one

636
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,140
of them egghead,

637
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,120
bighead brains.

638
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,880
I don't need another one

639
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:09,880


640
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,540
Don't use that

641
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,840
back it on up brain.

642
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,360
It won't fit in my skull.

643
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,020
Even though I have the...

644
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,280
Actually, we had a skull

645
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,200
measurement contest

646
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,740
in the Church of the Subgenius

647
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,520
and Dr. Legume, I must say,

648
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,920
was like, if he didn't have

649
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,880
the biggest skull,

650
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,300
it was the second biggest.

651
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,520
Dr. Cranium.

652
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,280
Now, has anyone verified that

653
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,500
or is it just a claim he made?

654
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,040
It could be.

655
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,200
Well, you know, Legume.

656
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,900
But he's pretty big.

657
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,620
He's pretty big.

658
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,140
He's pretty big.

659
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,260
He's pretty big.

660
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,900
He does have a big head.

661
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,520
He kind of looks like

662
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,300
the Gerber baby bottle baby

663
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,160
blown up to about six feet tall.

664
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,640
With a three-day shadow.

665
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,360
And with tattoos covering

666
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,860
his entire upper body,

667
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,280
except for where they put

668
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,320
the zipper in for his

669
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,060
repeated heart operations.

670
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,280
So, anyway,

671
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,320
actually, there are quite

672
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,580
a few subgeniuses

673
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,820
that I could list off

674
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,520
a name of poverty-stricken.

675
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,940
The worst one is

676
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,420
one of the greatest

677
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,320
subgenius artists.

678
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,620
I don't want to embarrass him.

679
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,620
It's not Lee Murr

680
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,320
and it's not Imgur

681
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,900
because they suck anyway.

682
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,860
But one of the really good

683
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,000
subgenius artists

684
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,700
has, he's agoraphobic.

685
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,420
But he's homeless.

686
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,320
So he's living in a car

687
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,500
in a campground

688
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,880
with his girlfriend

689
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,080
and his cat.

690
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,580
So Legume can't move in with him.

691
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,540
And I just know

692
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,100
a whole lot of subgeniuses.

693
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,880
And I bet you know

694
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,640
one or two

695
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:37,840
Dave,

696
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,440
just can't,

697
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
he cannot seem to find a job.

698
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,320
He can't find

699
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,360
a reasonable place to work.

700
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:45,460
Why would you ask me

701
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,000
where you could find a job?

702
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,200
That's what I'm saying.

703
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,660
I'm saying that

704
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,880
if there are subgeniuses

705
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,180
out there

706
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,820
that want to put

707
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,560
another subgenius to work,

708
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,200
the Stang Doe

709
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,820
Employment Agency

710
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,940
is now open.

711
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,240
And we'll only take

712
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,960
40% of your first

713
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,580
20 paychecks.

714
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,200
Yes, sirree Bob.

715
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,120
That's all we ask.

716
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,480
If we can find,

717
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,900
if we can locate you a job.

718
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,520
I would say you'd be better off

719
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,680
looking for the trust fund subgenius

720
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,040
rather than the rank and file

721
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,340
who have to work two jobs.

722
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,320
Well, you know,

723
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,340
that's the problem with this cult.

724
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,760
We never had a crazy millionaire.

725
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Or if we did,

726
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
he wasn't crazy enough

727
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,360
to tell us he was a millionaire.

728
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,220
We did have a crazy millionaire,

729
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,840
but he was too crazy.

730
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,480
Princess,

731
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,760
we and I went and met

732
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,500
a rich subgenius.

733
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,120
Actually,

734
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,300
I can't say he was

735
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,240
a subgenius.

736
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,500
But you could tell he was rich.

737
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,040
Oh, yes.

738
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

739
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,300
He flew a private jet

740
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,980
into the little Cleveland

741
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,480
special rich guy airport

742
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,380
to meet up with me.

743
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,100
But he really wanted

744
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,940
to meet J.R. Bob Dobbs.

745
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,520
And he was really disappointed

746
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,060
when he learned

747
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,980
that he wasn't going

748
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,940
to be meeting Bob

749
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,820
on that trip.

750
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,840
Now I remember

751
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,720
this sad story.

752
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,540
Yeah, yeah.

753
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,960
He had his dad,

754
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,700
his family owned

755
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,220
a giant seed company.

756
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,900
And as he explained it to me,

757
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,040
he goes,

758
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,940
my siblings run the business,

759
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,700
but I'm above

760
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,700
that sort of thing.

761
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,500
I'm a philosopher.

762
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,260
Oh, I see.

763
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,160
That's why he couldn't see Bob

764
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,240
in the helicopter

765
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,560
landing right next to him

766
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,480
fighting with Bob,

767
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:20,760
you know?

768
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,320
Right.

769
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,300
He's busy philosophizing

770
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,000
rather than looking around.

771
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,580
Well, exactly.

772
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,880
In fact,

773
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,820
this guy,

774
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,340
I'm probably digging

775
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,200
my own grave here

776
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,700
because,

777
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,440
although I doubt if he

778
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,620
knows what the Internet is.

779
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,480
I doubt it, too.

780
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,280
This guy was the richest

781
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
person I've ever met.

782
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,420
And I swear,

783
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,600
I think he was

784
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,580
the dumbest

785
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,400
person I've ever met

786
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,060
outside of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

787
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,120
It wasn't this kind of dumbness

788
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,060
Bob has, though.

789
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,000
Bob has the holy dumbness.

790
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,980
It's slack and luck.

791
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,180
This guy was just

792
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,460
a dumb pink.

793
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,960
Rich people can afford

794
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,240
to be stupid

795
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,400
and ignorant.

796
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,060
And they can afford

797
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,080
to believe anything.

798
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,880
But he did not want

799
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,380
to believe

800
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,260
some of the things

801
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,020
and some of the hard facts

802
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,140
that I had to tell him.

803
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,240
And he never came back

804
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,400
and he never gave us

805
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,640
another $5,000.

806
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,860
Maybe he expected you

807
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,260
to say,

808
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,800
you are Dobbs.

809
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,000
And he would have smiled

810
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
and he would have

811
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,640
walked away.

812
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,840
Maybe he was Dobbs.

813
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,420
But think how many people,

814
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,780
think how many people

815
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,140
would have done,

816
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,100
have done that.

817
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:28,540
I mean,

818
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,520
there have been people

819
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,300
who have come to my house

820
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:30,560
and said,

821
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,260
I'm Dobbs.

822
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:31,580
And I go,

823
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,680
well, no.

824
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,700
And they go,

825
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,980
thank you for telling me

826
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,680
I'm Dobbs.

827
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,260
This has been a great day.

828
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,260


829
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,040
This has been a great conversation.

830
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,660
I'll be Bob from now on.

831
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,040
Goodbye.

832
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,960
Oh, by the way,

833
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,140
I'm also an astronaut

834
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,280
and a ballet dancer

835
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,020
and I can fly.

836
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,620
Unfortunately,

837
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,620
all those are true, though.

838
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,860
Well, they're true

839
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,260
of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

840
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,840
But I hadn't,

841
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,880
the last time I saw him

842
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,520
was on the stage

843
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,440
of the Victoria Theater

844
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,180
in San Francisco,

845
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,660
January 24th, 1984,

846
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,800
when he was shot

847
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,440
and killed

848
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,580
right in front of me

849
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,740
by puzzling evidence himself,

850
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,160
that worm.

851
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,800
Puzzling evidence

852
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,260
gets rid of you.

853
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,260


854
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,260


855
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,260


856
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,260


857
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,260


858
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,560
He's real upset

859
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,620
when I call him a worm.

860
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,520
I don't know what he has

861
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,200
against worms.

862
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,000
I spend half my days

863
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
looking at worms

864
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,420
lately.

865
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,060
But to some,

866
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,200
it's the ultimate disrespect

867
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,680
to call a person a worm.

868
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,300
Well, he shot Bob.

869
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,060
What are we going to do?

870
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,800
Give him a medal?

871
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,480
Oh, that's right.

872
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,100
Bob would have given him a medal.

873
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,740
Yes, he would.

874
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,920
I think Bob did give him a medal

875
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,320
right after he was shot dead

876
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,100
by the guy.

877
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,900
Bob got up

878
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,700
and gave him a medal.

879
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,780
That's how you know

880
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,480
it's really Bob.

881
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,140
You blow him up,

882
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,800
you shoot him,

883
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,280
and he bounces back

884
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,200
with a little smudge

885
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,980
of charcoal on

886
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,780
and a Band-Aid.

887
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,720
He's just like

888
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,600
one of those brand new

889
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,720
dangerous neighborhood

890
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,680
love dolls

891
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,320
that they have

892
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,700
that just come right back.

893
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,260
That's why our policy is

894
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,780
when some nerd comes up

895
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,140
and says,

896
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,580
I'm real high-e popped.

897
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,700
I'm J.R. Bob Dobbs.

898
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,180
You kill him,

899
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,940
and if they come back to life,

900
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,160
then by golly,

901
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,760
praise Bob.

902
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,200
Or you bite his foot.

903
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,280
And if they don't,

904
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,680
well, good riddance.

905
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,160
You got what you were asking for,

906
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,880
Mr. Amabob.

907
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,540
Mr. Amaheepopped.

908
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,200
I can tell your hatred

909
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,280
of these folks is strong.

910
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,600
Mr. Lame Bobby.

911
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,360
But you rely on these people

912
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,320
for soup or...

913
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,640
No, I rely on them

914
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,120
for $30 checks.

915
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,940
I rely on them

916
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,760
for credit card orders.

917
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,220
This is not a commercial station.

918
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:33,880
That's right.

919
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,000
Unlike the...

920
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,480
CMZY is beautiful

921
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,040
down, down,

922
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,420
wherever the last place

923
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,220
you just were.

924
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,020
Now, see,

925
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,040
if I was Rush Limbaugh,

926
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,300
I could advertise stuff.

927
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,560
Yeah, you could...

928
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,660
Rush Limbaugh could

929
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,920
even advertise

930
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,900
that toilet paper

931
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,260
that says

932
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,400
Flush Rush on it.

933
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,680
And...

934
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:51,620
Oh.

935
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,180
Oh, speaking of which,

936
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,060
I've got to run

937
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,860
to the bathroom right now.

938
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,420
Don't come back.

939
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,280
We'll be waiting in the...

940
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,440
Where are we?

941
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,320
Oh, I feel so much better now.

942
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:02,920
Oh, no.

943
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:03,740
Unfortunately,

944
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,860
I know where we are now.

945
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,820
Can we...

946
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,360
Please, um,

947
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,560
change the set?

948
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,500
Open the window.

949
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,780
Turn on those fans.

950
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,040
Light some incense.

951
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,720
Burn a match.

952
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,920
No, make it three matches.

953
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,500
Spank the air conditioner.

954
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,100
Breed more.

955
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,900
Breed more.

956
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,980
No, I...

957
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,560
Breed more.

958
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,720
Breed less.

959
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,520
Breed with anything available.

960
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,460
Remember,

961
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,600
your seed is important.

962
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,820
Oh, who will be at Starwood

963
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,080
who's famous and great?

964
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,420
Why, Reverend Ivan,

965
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,440
Evan Stang will be doing

966
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,040
a great, humongous

967
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,960
revival there.

968
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,720
And, uh,

969
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,380
Rocky and the Cavemen.

970
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,720
That's a good band.

971
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,340
Who's Rocky and the Cavemen?

972
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,460
Sounds meanderball.

973
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,780
A nice-looking young lady

974
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,560
who does Middle Eastern

975
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,820
jazzy music.

976
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,000
It's really quite good.

977
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,420
Sounds good.

978
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,240
Well, we hope

979
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,300
Rocky and the Cavemen

980
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,880
will be there.

981
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,600
Everything is in flux right now.

982
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,600
We really don't know.

983
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,740
Everything's been flushed.

984
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,440
It's all fluxy-wuxy.

985
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,860
I'll turn on the

986
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,460
Starwood-y type music there.

987
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,240
Okay, yeah,

988
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,060
because that's more like,

989
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,840
you know, beginnings

990
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,500
and cool stuff and everything

991
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,860
rather than the, you know...

992
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,760
Oh, Fat Man D

993
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,340
will be not only at X-Day,

994
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,600
but Starwood, just like us.

995
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,660
Hey, how about these

996
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,840
electric junkyard gamelan guys

997
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,160
from New York City?

998
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,080
Original music

999
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,380
on invented instruments.

1000
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,160
Ron Slabe's Pyrosonic.

1001
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,400
I love invented instruments.

1002
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,460
It's wonderful.

1003
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,340
Pyrosonic, Ron Slabe's band,

1004
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,740
which also, it's...

1005
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,700
Well, his band is also composed,

1006
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,220
of explosives, fireworks,

1007
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,960
and dozens and dozens

1008
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,860
of topless young ladies

1009
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,460
juggling fireballs.

1010
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,640
And...

1011
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,200
I'm sorry.

1012
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,920
Is Stephen Kent,

1013
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,200
the didgeridoo expert,

1014
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,900
going to be there?

1015
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,500
Well, as I say,

1016
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,860
things are sort of changing.

1017
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,740
How about my rifle...

1018
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,180
I hope he'll be there.

1019
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,140
How about my rifle cult leaders?

1020
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,460
Yeah, I thought there were supposed

1021
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,920
to be some rival cults there.

1022
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,520
Yeah, the Church of All Worlds,

1023
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,980
O'Bron, Zell,

1024
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,840
will be there.

1025
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,740
O'Bron will be there.

1026
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,060
Louis Martinet

1027
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,000
from the New Orleans Voodoo Temple.

1028
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,080
Waking Dream.

1029
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,200
Oh, they're...

1030
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,460
Actually, they're one of the best things

1031
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,100
about Starwood,

1032
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,660
Waking Dream.

1033
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,600
They're a puppet...

1034
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,220
They're puppet makers,

1035
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,780
but they make puppets

1036
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,640
that are about 20 feet tall.

1037
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,740
Oh, I've seen those before.

1038
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:23,960
They look great

1039
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,260
walking around the bonfire.

1040
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,680
Yeah, they make...

1041
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,000
And they show you

1042
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,400
how to become a puppet, too.

1043
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,440
And they're also making...

1044
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,140
And they catch fire so easily.

1045
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,640
They're making a completely

1046
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,840
amazing psychedelic show.

1047
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,020
They're making a show

1048
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,200
in our Puffer Dome,

1049
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,600
which is our very own

1050
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,660
nightclub sort of space

1051
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,300
that's a...

1052
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:40,600
That's...

1053
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,160
An inflatable dome.

1054
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,160
Like Gaius...

1055
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,140
You've been in there, Dave.

1056
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,160
It has very weird acoustics.

1057
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,440
They have very weird acoustics.

1058
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,720
You can stand in one...

1059
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,440
But unfortunately,

1060
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,440
sometimes they go back

1061
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,040
on themselves,

1062
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,280
the acoustics do.

1063
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,400
Right, if somebody...

1064
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,860
And then you can't hear

1065
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,860
anything real close,

1066
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,460
but usually,

1067
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,780
you can hear everything.

1068
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,740
Like in an old

1069
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,760
Greek theater

1070
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,600
from miles away,

1071
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,140
the acoustics are perfect.

1072
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,740
And the smell-o-stics,

1073
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:04,840
they're perfect.

1074
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,960
It's like if somebody's

1075
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,700
standing all the way

1076
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,620
across the Puffer Dome

1077
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,600
from you and they cut one,

1078
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,040
you'll smell it instantly.

1079
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,220
Unfortunately,

1080
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,300
that is really true.

1081
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,920
There's the ever-lingering

1082
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,520
stench of hydronics

1083
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,580
or whatever the hell

1084
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,020
it's called,

1085
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,260
made of hydrogen

1086
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,820
or diesel fuel,

1087
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,200
whatever,

1088
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,800
propels the Puffer Dome,

1089
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,160
which is also a bad name

1090
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,620
for a place

1091
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,500
where you can't smoke.

1092
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,640
Dave, have you ever

1093
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,720
read any history books

1094
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,960
by Harvey Wasserman?

1095
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,560
Harvey Wasserman...

1096
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,740
He specializes in telling

1097
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,200
the unpleasant histories

1098
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,980
of the United States.

1099
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,180
I've heard of Howard Zinn.

1100
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,440
He's like Howard Zinn.

1101
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,140
Okay.

1102
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,360
We've also had him

1103
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,340
at Starwood, I think,

1104
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:46,960
at some point.

1105
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,060
Anyway, Harvey Wasserman

1106
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,980
is one of those guys.

1107
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,060
Oh, and my...

1108
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,200
Steve and Ina May Gaskin,

1109
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,780
the founders of The Farm,

1110
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,180
the actual,

1111
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,640
the last and only

1112
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,480
forever-working hippie commune.

1113
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,300
It's still working.

1114
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,580
It was the commune

1115
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,720
that didn't fall apart.

1116
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,900
That is beautiful.

1117
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,540
As far as I know,

1118
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,720
damn near every one

1119
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,220
of the other big communes

1120
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,560
finally tanked.

1121
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,720
But they managed to...

1122
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,900
I think you're right about that.

1123
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,160
Zendik Farm was one

1124
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,940
of the last ones.

1125
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,760
I remember them.

1126
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,060
We used to get mail from them.

1127
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,880
And the name started with Z,

1128
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,960
so you thought it was

1129
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,700
the last one,

1130
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,740
but it wasn't.

1131
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,280
No.

1132
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:26,860
No.

1133
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:27,820
Nope.

1134
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,200
Nope.

1135
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,720
So if you like your hippie,

1136
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,540
dippy stuff,

1137
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,220
then you go to your Starwood,

1138
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,640
and if you like,

1139
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,100
your subgenius-y,

1140
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,380
wubgenius-y stuff,

1141
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,680
then you go to X-Day.

1142
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,740
Or both.

1143
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,200
Both is good.

1144
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,680
Both is great.

1145
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,700
Yeah.

1146
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,500
It would be...

1147
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,860
We could all use

1148
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,540
a job.

1149
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,500
And that X-Day

1150
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,000
kind of turns into

1151
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,120
a job at times.

1152
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,120
It's hard to keep...

1153
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,860
The kind of job

1154
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,420
I can't say on the radio,

1155
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,080
actually.

1156
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,460
A bob.

1157
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,380
Okay, I'll say it.

1158
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:04,720
A bob.

1159
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,080
A bob job.

1160
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,120
A bob job.

1161
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,680
That knobby fellow.

1162
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,440
Oh, no.

1163
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,820
I don't like the way

1164
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,500
you phrased that.

1165
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,000
Or I did actually like

1166
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,860
the way you phrased it,

1167
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,300
but the...

1168
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,580
What was being phrased

1169
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,640
kind of caused me to recoil.

1170
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,400
Um...

1171
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,460
I like the way

1172
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,340
he flays that.

1173
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,300
Alive.

1174
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,580
You know, if anybody

1175
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,000
is interested about

1176
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,460
this Starwood Festival,

1177
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,040
you can go to

1178
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,700
starwoodfestival.com.

1179
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,900
And read all about it.

1180
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,620
This will be the 30th one.

1181
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,180
They've been doing it

1182
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,500
longer than Burning Man.

1183
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,200
They've been burning people up.

1184
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,720
They put a man inside

1185
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,820
of a big wicker man.

1186
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,020
They set it on fire.

1187
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,040
And that gives them

1188
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,960
the power of Satan.

1189
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,740
I've had a lot of...

1190
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,260
You know, there's people

1191
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,060
who really do believe that.

1192
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,500
The problem is

1193
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,140
that a lot of...

1194
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,560
Not everybody at Starwood

1195
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,080
is a pagan.

1196
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,620
Believe me, for instance.

1197
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,200
But,

1198
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,440
pagans don't actually

1199
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,660
have a devil

1200
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,660
in their

1201
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,120
rather loose

1202
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,340
belief system.

1203
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,940
Well, there have been books

1204
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,560
that were bestsellers

1205
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,460
and people still

1206
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,160
didn't get it

1207
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,320
about this

1208
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,600
same thing here.

1209
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,120
I think

1210
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,480
Robert Heinlein

1211
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,640
or perhaps it was

1212
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,080
Moose Coinkoiler.

1213
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,300
Pagans don't kill people

1214
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,420
just for Satan.

1215
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,580
They do it for fun.

1216
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,540
For fuzz.

1217
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,160
Fun.

1218
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:34,500
Yeah.

1219
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,040
For the goddess.

1220
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,680
That's different.

1221
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,700
That's not the same as Satan.

1222
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,700
Satan's a man.

1223
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,960
Satan's got a tail and horns.

1224
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,640
Goddess has bosom.

1225
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,000
Great big bosom.

1226
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,100
I've seen pictures of her.

1227
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,080
Ample bosom.

1228
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,640
She has huge blonde hair.

1229
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,300
It looks kind of like

1230
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:48,980
Princess Wee.

1231
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,080
When people dream of the goddess,

1232
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,620
they usually see Princess Wee.

1233
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,100
Oh, I've got a letter from...

1234
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,240
I have bragging...

1235
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:55,480
Blushing.

1236
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,380
Wonderful letters from listeners.

1237
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,360
I'm just...

1238
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,360
Here's one from a prisoner.

1239
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,820
These are not real people.

1240
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,060
No, these are real.

1241
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,940
This is from James Anderson

1242
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,980
in Portage, Wisconsin,

1243
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,500
but he's in the big house.

1244
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,840
And he says,

1245
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,740
I am a huge fan of your show every time

1246
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,020
I listen to your radio program.

1247
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,220
I'm cracking up for the whole hour.

1248
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,040
I think he means having a mental breakdown.

1249
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,880
In addition to the humor,

1250
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,280
you guys make a lot of good points.

1251
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,080
You offer thought-provoking satire

1252
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,920
at its best.

1253
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,260
Oh, this guy thinks it's a joke?

1254
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,840
That's one of the best...

1255
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,780
That's one of the best...

1256
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,760
That's one of the best blurbs ever, man.

1257
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,300
Most people are too afraid to think for themselves

1258
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,480
and through the medium of great humor,

1259
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,820
you get people thinking about things

1260
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,920
that warrant the application of thought.

1261
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,200
Man, that is one of the best reviews I've ever...

1262
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,020
Well-written and well-spoken.

1263
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,680
He wanted us to send him some mail

1264
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,220
because he's in prison,

1265
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,620
but they took his radio away

1266
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,900
and his cellmate is too heavily medicated

1267
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,660
to even stay up that late.

1268
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,200
So, uh...

1269
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,140
Well, now he just can't hear it anymore.

1270
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,700
But get this, down at the bottom,

1271
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,380
he said,

1272
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,960
P.S., that woman on your show

1273
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,920
has the voice of a goddess.

1274
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,920
But don't worry, I'm not a stalker.

1275
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,760
In fact, the only reason I brought it up now

1276
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,960
is because of the fact that I'll never see her.

1277
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,240
It has me somewhat emboldened.

1278
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,660
Please tell her she's amazing.

1279
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,020
Well, buddy...

1280
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,980
I am so blushing.

1281
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:29,980
Oh.

1282
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,560
I try to tell her that every three hours.

1283
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:34,900
Let's see.

1284
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,540
No, here's a...

1285
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,360
When I was in high school,

1286
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,180
I used to wonder if women were affected by cell fantasies.

1287
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,520
Or, you know, just perverted dormitory fantasies

1288
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,840
from a long distance.

1289
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,700
You know, you're dreaming about some woman in Washington

1290
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,380
you never met,

1291
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,160
and you're actually fondling your shoes

1292
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,600
at the same time.

1293
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,740
I mean, you know, that you're...

1294
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,620
Oh, she can tell.

1295
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,140
She'll get an itch.

1296
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,680
A special itch.

1297
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,580
Or an irritation.

1298
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,040
Depending on who it is that's thinking of her.

1299
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,760
I don't know.

1300
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:03,760


1301
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:03,760


1302
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,600
I thought one of the little horns wiggled or something

1303
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,060
and made a ha-ha sound.

1304
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,020
I don't know.

1305
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,540
You don't know.

1306
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,360
It's hard to tell nowadays.

1307
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,140
Now, here's another letter.

1308
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,100
This one came from Odd Brian.

1309
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,100
Care of Odd Brian's Church of Amateur Traumatics.

1310
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,560
Service is held tomorrow every day.

1311
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
And his letter says...

1312
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,020
Oh, this is about a weird coincidence,

1313
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,720
and it's also a good promo.

1314
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,680
To Brother Stang.

1315
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,680
Today, I...

1316
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,820
Quit my job.

1317
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,980
It was cheap labor ruining my shoulder

1318
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,420
filled with spiteful pinks

1319
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,180
and had the crappiest coffee in the world.

1320
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,420
This afternoon,

1321
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,240
so after he quit his job,

1322
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,200
I see your magnificence on my TV screen

1323
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,860
discussing the comic book,

1324
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,780
or the comic creator,

1325
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,900
Jack T. Chick

1326
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,440
in God's Cartoonist

1327
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,000
on the documentary channel.

1328
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,000
After stroking the wand of significance

1329
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,180
in my excrementation chamber,

1330
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,960
I feel I've become illuminated.

1331
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,340
And sore.

1332
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,920
But I must say that such a thing is so improbable

1333
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,740
as to be beyond mere coincidence.

1334
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,980
I think it's truly a synchronized chronological burp

1335
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,700
in the digestive tract of time-space.

1336
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,280
I just needed to share that with you.

1337
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,720
I can't hang out with y'all on X-Day,

1338
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,780
as I'll be trying to snare a passing asteroid

1339
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,660
the night before.

1340
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,240
Could you ask the X's to pick me up

1341
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,320
between Rigel and Beetlejuice after lunchtime?

1342
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,640
Thanks and praise Bob.

1343
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:33,980
Wow.

1344
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,780
What a passage of an air

1345
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,920
from a person with no colon.

1346
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,320
Yeah, that's from Gons O'Lager,

1347
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,380
or Odd Brian,

1348
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,640
and he's at bourbonasylum.com.

1349
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,920
You sure it wasn't Odd Brain

1350
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,540
that he inverted the A and the I?

1351
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,280
Could be.

1352
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,580
Could be.

1353
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,180
So, but yeah,

1354
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,380
apparently on the documentary channel,

1355
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,180
which I take as one of these

1356
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,860
cable television channels you people get,

1357
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,360
this month they've been showing the movie

1358
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,980
God's Cartoonist, which is indeed a documentary

1359
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,540
about the great Jack T. Chick

1360
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:17,920
and his insane, fundy, Christian, Catholic,

1361
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:23,620
bashing, devil-beaten little comics.

1362
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,940
You know, those little tiny ones that they give you.

1363
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,260
That movie, God's Cartoonist,

1364
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,640
was assembled by the great father,

1365
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,880
Papa Joe Mama,

1366
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,320
one of the great subgenius preachers.

1367
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,700
He's been heard on the last several hours of Slack.

1368
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,740
He's busy running his spook house business

1369
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,060
and trading cards and stuff

1370
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,880
and making documentaries.

1371
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,040
But it is hilarious,

1372
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,720
and it has record-breaking dry humor

1373
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,900
by me and Dr. Howell

1374
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,080
because at no point did any of us

1375
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,300
want to come out and say,

1376
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,620
this stuff is so...

1377
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,800
So kooky and nutty.

1378
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,280
It's hilarious.

1379
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,040
We'd say things like,

1380
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,240
yes, I was very influenced

1381
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,440
by these comics over my...

1382
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,560
You know, that kind of thing.

1383
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,980
I believe those little books are called tracks, dear.

1384
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,440
Yes, tracks.

1385
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,080
Chicks, chick tracks.

1386
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:18,560
Chick tracks.

1387
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,940
Chicks dig chicks.

1388
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,040
And Papa Joe wrote a whole book

1389
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,340
about Jack T. Chick.

1390
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:25,980
He sure did.

1391
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,460
Yeah, if you go to monsterwax.com,

1392
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,840
I don't know why he's called

1393
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,620
Monster Wax.

1394
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,480
Monsterwax.com.

1395
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,560
But it's easy to remember,

1396
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,540
and you'll find all of his book

1397
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,540
and his video and so forth

1398
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,340
and excerpts.

1399
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,860
And people have even turned

1400
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,120
those little chick tracks

1401
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,740
into cartoons,

1402
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,100
into flash animations

1403
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,640
with voice characterizations

1404
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:52,840
and everything.

1405
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,980
Does his name appear

1406
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,040
in the book of life?

1407
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:56,800
Nay, Lord.

1408
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,340
Then cast him into the lake of fire.

1409
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,080
Man, those drawings

1410
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,320
had such huge wings.

1411
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,340
Such tiny, perfectly shaped bodies.

1412
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,760
Like, I think he looked at those books

1413
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,620
by, what's his name?

1414
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,960
You know, Blake?

1415
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,720
William Blake?

1416
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,960
Jack T. Blake?

1417
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,580
No, William Blake.

1418
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,700
Dory's illustrations.

1419
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,540
Trevor Blake.

1420
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,760
For man is not slack as men...

1421
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,180
No, no.

1422
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,400
For the Lord is not slack

1423
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,560
as men count slackness.

1424
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,580
That was at the back

1425
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,120
of many of the chick tracks.

1426
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:31,980
It was a great line.

1427
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,840
For the Lord is not slack

1428
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,180
as men count slackness.

1429
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,720
But is something, something

1430
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,860
thereunto, ass-kicking thereunto,

1431
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,620
something like that.

1432
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,700
I forgot how it goes.

1433
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,640
Snappy like a rubber tomato

1434
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,200
or something.

1435
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:44,560
Yeah.

1436
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,720
They've saved a lot of people.

1437
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,320
And you know, he's truly one of the...

1438
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,780
He's like an underground cartoonist.

1439
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,220
Like Robert Crumb

1440
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,720
or S. Clay Wilson.

1441
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,680
He published that stuff himself.

1442
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,880
He's not approved

1443
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,360
by any of the mainstream churches

1444
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,140
especially because I think he's insane.

1445
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,080
Well, they're right about that.

1446
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,220
Well, anyway,

1447
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,620
it's an interesting story.

1448
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,320
I suppose there's some listeners

1449
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,900
who don't read,

1450
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,960
not even little tiny Christian comic books

1451
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,800
that they hand you at the state fair.

1452
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,500
But you should.

1453
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,000
Because you can save.

1454
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,040
And there's a little thing in the back

1455
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,380
where you can sign your name

1456
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,980
and sign up with Jesus.

1457
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,160
And it tells you how to give your life

1458
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:32,680
to Christ.

1459
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,160
You know, I realize I'm a sinner

1460
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,180
and that a way to eternal life

1461
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,300
is only through forgiveness

1462
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,000
of Lord Jesus

1463
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,600
and John 3.16.

1464
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,660
I'm the way, the truth, and the pipe.

1465
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,600
And none may get into my lungs

1466
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,840
save they who throw themselves

1467
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,060
into my bowl

1468
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,600
and are enlightened

1469
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,240
by my special lighter

1470
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,500
with the striptease bikini girl on it

1471
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,720
when you tip it upside down.

1472
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:01,900
Yeah.

1473
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:02,720
Bikini disappears.

1474
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,880
So that's the religion we're talking about, friends.

1475
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,720
The church of the subgenius.

1476
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,480
Of the disappearing bikini.

1477
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,360
And while I managed to read the letters

1478
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,580
from the listeners,

1479
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,280
we usually get audio from listeners

1480
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,620
rather than letters.

1481
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,880
Oh, man, have I got...

1482
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,380
No, I don't even want to go...

1483
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,460
I've had somebody leaving messages again

1484
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,740
who makes Bernard

1485
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,320
seem like Dr. Howell by comparison.

1486
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,940
But that's for another show.

1487
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,180
We probably...

1488
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,620
That's quite mad, a lot of them.

1489
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,960
We probably should sign out

1490
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,680
somewhere in here are my instructions.

1491
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,480
Because if, yeah, if I go now...

1492
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,140
It's in your instruction manual.

1493
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:49,060
Yeah, there's a really good cut

1494
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,600
by Reverend Godrex

1495
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,040
of the long discussion about Bob.

1496
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,480
And they talk about X-Day.

1497
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,540
And we should play that.

1498
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,240
And we might even get to hear

1499
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,720
a Rudy Schwartz project

1500
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,580
doing snot-mouthed Tweedle.

1501
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:01,920
Tweedle.

1502
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,020
That song's been stuck in my head all day.

1503
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,040
And the only way to get it out

1504
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,700
is to get it onto everybody else's head.

1505
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:07,400
Yep.

1506
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,320
So I'm going to sign us all out.

1507
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,900
You, me, and Princess We.

1508
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,960
So that we can hear

1509
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,460
what Bob really had to say.

1510
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,380
With one deft swell-foop.

1511
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,100
About us.

1512
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,500
Yes.

1513
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,420
We're over.

1514
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,180
Yes, so here...

1515
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,780
Dave, thank you for calling.

1516
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,500
You're quite welcome.

1517
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,600
I'm glad I had a chance

1518
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,500
to participate in this wonderful...

1519
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,220
Oh, enough of that.

1520
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,100
We need to cut away.

1521
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:31,180
We are, too.

1522
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:31,640
Okay.

1523
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:32,520
Everybody up.

1524
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:32,640
Bye.

1525
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,020
So Bob was getting the interview.

1526
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,340
And so Bob was in New Jersey.

1527
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,840
Unfortunately, Bob died within a week.

1528
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:45,980
So...

1529
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,400
And such.

1530
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,200
I was very impressed

1531
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,920
with the way Bob would treat these people

1532
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,280
whom he must have regarded

1533
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,460
as deluded fanatics.

1534
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,880
And that was the thing about Bob

1535
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,100
is that he could...

1536
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,360
He could see...

1537
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,140
Once I read an essay in a book

1538
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:09,420
about so-called cults and new religions.

1539
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,720
Groups of people that live in worlds

1540
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,080
we wouldn't recognize

1541
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,420
going to another world.

1542
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,100
And I thought, yeah.

1543
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:18,700
It is.

1544
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,340
Yeah, maybe...

1545
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,240
Yeah, that might explain

1546
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,480
how Bob felt about it, too.

1547
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,500
Yeah.

1548
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:30,560
If God himself were to approach him

1549
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,320
and say, take your pick.

1550
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,580
I've got the truth.

1551
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,360
Yeah.

1552
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:34,920
Yikes.

1553
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:35,460
Yeah.

1554
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,420
Didn't he deny that the moon landing ever happened?

1555
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,460
That it was a fake of some way?

1556
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,500
Well, he did.

1557
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,180
Yeah.

1558
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:44,920
Yeah.

1559
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,500
Yeah, he thought it was all just a big fake.

1560
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,040
He thought that the governments of the world

1561
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,060
all knew that the Earth is flat,

1562
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,280
but that they were suppressing it.

1563
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,540
Once everyone knew that the world was flat,

1564
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:00,540


1565
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,220
that there'd be sort of like worldwide peace

1566
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,320
and all of this.

1567
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,140
Yeah, that's right.

1568
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:10,900
So...

1569
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,000
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

1570
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,400
That's interesting acting.

1571
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,000
Yeah.

1572
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,540
So what...

1573
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,360
Oh, boy.

1574
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,660
And it never really thought about it.

1575
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,700
I thought, oh, no, this can't be true.

1576
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,900
I'm having a nightmare.

1577
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,440
I know.

1578
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,540
Oh, boy.

1579
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,360
Oh, yeah.

1580
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,560
I know Bob would have loved that, too.

1581
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,680
Oh, boy.

1582
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:29,900
Yeah.

1583
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,560
That really is frightening.

1584
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,320
It's like a cockroach.

1585
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,400
If you see one, there must be a whole lot more.

1586
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,620
Once there was a boy down south

1587
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:00,520
Oh, yeah

1588
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,280
Had snot running across his mouth

1589
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,700
What's that mess

1590
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,860
Boy the neighbors would say

1591
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,420
Why's that snot on your face that way

1592
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,740
Snot mouth riddle

1593
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,920
Snot mouth riddle

1594
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,060
Snot mouth riddle

1595
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,840
Snot mouth riddle all day

1596
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,680
Mama sent him to the grocery store

1597
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,800
Let's go pro-berry

1598
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,280
Asked him to buy three eggs times four

1599
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,900
Run back home for the grocery man say

1600
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,620
Why's that snot on your face that way

1601
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,860
Snot mouth riddle

1602
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,080
Snot mouth riddle

1603
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,300
Snot mouth riddle

1604
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,300
Snot mouth riddle all day

1605
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,460
Mama sent him to the grocery store

1606
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,480
What's that mess

1607
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:52,980
Boy the neighbors would say

1608
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,480
Why's that snot on your face that way

1609
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,580
Mama sent him to the grocery store

1610
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,420
Soon this boy became a man

1611
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,700
Wanted to know the master plan

1612
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,060
So to the Lord he did say

1613
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,840
Hey guys

1614
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,540

Is this snot on my face this way

00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,120

Oui

00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,120
Why is this snot on my face this way guys

1629
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:48,720
Ah

00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,360
Eh

1631
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:50,620
God

1632
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,040
Which oh

1633
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:51,480
Really

1634
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,620
Who can know

1635
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,300
Wholde

1636
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,920
Who can know

1637
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,460
Who can know

1638
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,460
Many Americans are fortunate and have weapons, including landmines,

1639
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,140
and are a daily menace to life and limb.

1640
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:25,080
This story is typical, is not typical, and your entire life is permanently changed.

1641
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:51,940
And around me, and what happened, and freeze, and yet they do, and somehow, and ever, and also, and depression, and then, and not, and children that can last a lifetime, and medical, and refugee, and forms, and minds, and injury, and health, and weapons, and public, and citizens, and have nodes, and farms, and are buried, and are deployed, and we won't, and this is an assistance.

1642
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,700
And become disabled, and other unexploded.

1643
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,920
Cut off the rest of your leg, and hopefully, and you hope.

1644
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:05,420
And in addition, and part of, and they step on, and then they, and as they're, and one of the saddest, and they want to play with them, and they explode.

1645
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:10,020
And that, and that's, of course, who, who, who, who, who's, and many others.

1646
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,300
Well, that's it.
