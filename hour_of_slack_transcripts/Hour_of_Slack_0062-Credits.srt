1
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,300
I don't know what to do with my life.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,720
I'm just gonna die.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:09,720


4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,900
In order for you to feel, you'll need more than just knowledge.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,180
But we're going to add real experiences to your database.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:16,820
Stop!

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,140
Rework!

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:18,600
Stop!

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:19,960
Rework!

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,360
Stop!

11
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:20,800
Stop!

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:21,780

00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,320
Stop!

15
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,700
Stop!

16
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:22,700


17
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:22,700


18
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,980
No, no, no.

19
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:25,620
No, no, no.

20
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,160
Stop!

21
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,320
Stop!

22
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:27,620
Stop!

23
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,060
Stop!

24
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,440
Stop!

25
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,120
Stop!

26
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,560
Stop!

27
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:34,540
Stop!

28
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,080
Stop!

29
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,380
Stop!

30
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:35,540
Stop!

31
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,760
Stop!

32
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:36,760


33
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:36,760


34
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:36,760


35
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:36,760


36
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:36,760


37
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:36,760


38
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:36,760


39
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:36,760


40
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:36,760


41
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:36,760


42
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,120
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sub-suggested.

43
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,380
We're having operating difficulties, which has necessitated a delay in the beginning

44
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,040
of our Sunday movie, It's a Wonderful Life.

45
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,880
No trouble.

46
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Just get set and get going.

47
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,180
Game on.

48
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,540
Recording.

49
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,780
Everything's going fine.

50
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,220
Okay.

51
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,360
We're out of here.

52
00:00:59,360 --> 00:00:59,420
No problem.

53
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,420


54
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,420


55
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,600
Hello, Bob.

56
00:00:59,600 --> 00:00:59,980
Hi.

57
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,680
Hello, Bob.

58
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,860
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

59
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,880
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

60
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,640
Bob.

61
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,820
Bob?

62
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,380
Ray.

63
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,200
Bob.

64
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,680
You can read along with me in your book.

65
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,280
You will notice time to turn the page when you hear R2-D2 beep like this.

66
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,480
Let's begin now.

67
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,260
It was a dark time for the rebellion.

68
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,880
Prepare yourself.

69
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,100
You are about to be remade into a new being

70
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,300
through forbidden knowledge

71
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,400
previously kept secret for centuries

72
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,900
by the jealous priesthoods of many religions.

73
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:48,900
Caution.

74
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,360
Improper viewing techniques may lead in some persons

75
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,980
to dependency, seizures, cranial fits,

76
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,500
priapic conditions, micturition, sternutation,

77
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,340
subtle glandular mutations,

78
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,320
and in some territories, legal arrest.

79
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,020
Although only a small percentage of playback systems

80
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,640
or their owners have suffered permanent damage

81
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,560
from this signal,

82
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,920
the subgenius foundation incorporated

83
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,420
is not responsible for injuries or damages

84
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,340
inflicted by paranormal events

85
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,280
during tape play mode.

86
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,980
That's your key phrase.

87
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,040
It will trigger the entire message

88
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,200
without your being aware of it.

89
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,760
We are controlling transmission.

90
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,280
However, this brainwave-enfolding signal

91
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
is generally harmless

92
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,480
and should actually enhance your learning abilities

93
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,120
during the program.

94
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,300
Special interactive holothonic stereo effects

95
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,480
produced on the internet.

96
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,480


97
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,740
The Ultimate Cerebral Sync Lock Interocitor

98
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,860
are designed to trigger stem cleavage,

99
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,920
or brain division,

100
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,300
between the forebrain and hindbrain.

101
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,540
Using newly discovered break-thinking principles,

102
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,920
the viewer's brainwaves are locked into synchronization

103
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,740
with the tape's underlying suggestions

104
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,280
by means of neuroelectric pulses.

105
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,560
The demons you may see

106
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,800
during the initial hallucination sequence

107
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,140
are not real.

108
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,460
If you do not panic,

109
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,440
this phase will end after a few minutes.

110
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,340
The demons will be revealed.

111
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,160
And what exactly does this do for them?

112
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,520
It will help them forget everything they've learned

113
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,620
and prepares their mind for the slate-like impression,

114
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,640
the imprinting of the true subgenius.

115
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,940
For the next hour, sit quietly

116
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,660
and we will control all that you see and hear.

117
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,060
There is absolutely no other possibility.

Good morning, Laz.

163
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,080
Hello.

164
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,900
Dr. Hugo.

165
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,660
I'm removing the protective

166
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,700
syncyl membrane

167
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,260
from your prenatal unit.

168
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,380
Okay.

169
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,520
Yeah.

170
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,600
Now, for just

171
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,480
a few adjustments.

172
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,500
And...

173
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,420
Now you're ready.

174
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,820
Ready.

175
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,800
Yes, Laz, now that you're fully activated

176
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,220
and operated,

177
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,120
and operational, you'll be leaving the factory

178
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,100
for the first time.

179
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,820
You're unique, Laz.

180
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,840
You're the first robot programmed

181
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,260
with the capacity for free will and emotion.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
However, in order for you to feel,

183
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,500
you'll need more than just knowledge.

184
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,820
So we're going to add real experiences

185
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,680
to your database.

186
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,340
Experience.

187
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,720
That's right, Laz.

188
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,800
Human experience.

189
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,080
Choose the ones you'd like to have.

190
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,520
Search your database.

191
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:12,060
And download in a folder.

192
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,620
When you look for

193
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:14,620

ito

201
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,120
I am all that he's gone

202
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,720
A martyr for the cause

203
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,040
Of his own

204
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,240
And he's coming again

205
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,480
Who knew that the first shot

206
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,320
Was gonna be the last shot

207
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,240
But he's got a heart that's white

208
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,580
That can't smoke all through the night

209
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,200
And I know he made me hurt

210
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,800
But you know that

211
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,140
People are squinting

212
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,480
But I know

213
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,320
And he's coming again

214
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:21,340
Yes, dear friends,

215
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,920
this is Reverend Ivan Stanger

216
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,940
listening to the

217
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,720
Subgenius Radio Ministry

218
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,560
Hour of the Week.

219
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,420
And tonight,

220
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,000
you're listening to

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,420
the new record

222
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,080
from Reverend Cleve Duncan

223
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,380
and Slackmaster Cleve

224
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,380
and the Spirit of God,

225
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,940
Bob Ismalo.

226
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,220
He's coming again.

227
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,560
He can save us

228
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,960
from the many and bad

229
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,000
With just a shot

230
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,420
from his mighty side

231
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,160
If only he could make it back

232
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,020
From the land of the dead

233
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,560
By the hand of God

234
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,380
Until that happy day

235
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,060
We can only drink and say

236
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,200
Bob Ismalo

237
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,960
And he's coming again

238
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,980
I know he can make it

239
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,060
Without him we can't take it

240
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,420
We'll lose the pieces of our minds

241
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,600
To the pink boys and the wimps

242
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,560
Until the day we're all alone

243
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:26,560


244
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:26,940
We'll see

245
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,700
When he comes back

246
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
It'll be a world

247
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,180
We'll go back

248
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,460
Bob Ismalo

249
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,060
And he's coming again

250
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,740
Bob Ismalo

251
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,620
Bob Ismalo

252
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,700
Bob Ismalo

253
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,680
Bob Ismalo

254
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,900
And he's coming again

255
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,540
We don't want the old

256
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:56,540


257
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,320
The answers upon us

258
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,500
We live with it

259
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,760
Bob to be honest

260
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,460
Bob Ismalo

261
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,980
Bob Ismalo

262
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,860
Bob Ismalo

263
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,120
And he's coming again

264
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,420
He's coming home

265
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,440
He's coming right now

266
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,620
Again

267
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,380
Oh yeah dear friends

268
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,160
Slackmaster Cleave

269
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,560
And the Spurious Jive

270
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,740
Brand new one

271
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,040
A brand new one

272
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,540
I'm going to try to give credits

273
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,520
For the things we're playing

274
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,160
This is still

275
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,700
Well this is Cleave Jr. samples

276
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,920
Doing Harlem Nocturne

277
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,540
In the background

278
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,700
Oh that mighty preacher

279
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,120
Brother Cleave from Boston, Massachusetts

280
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,040
So we've got a gospel opening now

281
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,620
For the show

282
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
How about that

283
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:54,920
Hoo!

284
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,440
That's a mighty

285
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,580
Mighty

286
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,020
Mighty song

287
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,200
Oh yeah

288
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,800
Bob Dobbs was in Las Vegas

289
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,260
He'd been lucky

290
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,660
Again

291
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,940
It's funny

292
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,820
It seemed like he was

293
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,720
Always lucky on the slot machine

294
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,800
But Connie wasn't with him tonight

295
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,660
And he was a

296
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,060
I'm afraid friends

297
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,460
Bob was a little bit drunk

298
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,380
And he was walking along

299
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,840
With his hands in his pockets

300
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,480
Deep in his pockets

301
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,180
And he was thinking to himself

302
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,380
Huh

303
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,500
What do I do now?

304
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,140
Hmm

305
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,660
And right about then

306
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,540
Bob Dobbs was in Las Vegas

307
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,660
In the last minute

308
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,240
Oh yes dear friends

309
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,560
You know what Bob did there

310
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,400
You know I could just play this whole tape all night

311
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,460
You all would be perfectly satisfied

312
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,780
But this is the credits show

313
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,780
The credits for the Subgenius Radio Ministry

314
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,680
Is what it is

315
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,320
For many many shows

316
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,540
I've been meaning to play the credits tape

317
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,620
And we're going to be doing just that

318
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,000
Coming up here in a second

319
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,480
Oh, this is a laid back one.

320
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,340
It won't be for long.

321
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,320
Don't worry about that.

322
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,200
Last Thursday, believe it or not,

323
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,080
I heard the following people say praise Bob on the phone to me personally.

324
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,820
I'm bragging now.

325
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,360
This was Ken Kesey, David Osman of the Fireside Theater,

326
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,380
Robert Crum, R. Crum, the America's greatest cartoonist.

327
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,980
Ooh, Connie Dobbs.

328
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,720
And, oh gosh, who else?

329
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,560
Mark Mothersbaugh.

330
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,340
We had to recruit famous folks.

331
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,500
Oh, and Robert Anton Wilson, who talks with a Brooklyn accent.

332
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,520
I couldn't believe it.

333
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,860
We were recruiting famous weirdos to do blurbs

334
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,260
for the back cover of the new Subgenius book.

335
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,620
But you know what?

336
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,120
You know what's a lot more important than talking to those famous cool guys?

337
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,540
I also had chats with Brother Cleve

338
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,920
and Sterno Dox Kekever of Doctors for Bob

339
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,860
and D.K. Jones.

340
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,240
Who's music, who actually, who turned in those Elvis outtakes

341
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,980
and has a lot more coming up here.

342
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,420
He has a new album out tonight.

343
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,820
And Ahmed Fishmonger and Puzzling Evidence and Lies

344
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,940
and Popes Cecilia.

345
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,260
And see, that's what I mean.

346
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,180
Now, that's what this show's all about.

347
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,220
Finally, I'm going to play that credits tape for the hour of slack.

348
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,640
Ah!

349
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,120
Ah!

350
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,080
, that's not what this is, though.

351
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,380
I don't even need to give credits for this.

352
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,200
Actually, this is the soundtrack from, what is it?

353
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,240
Big Trouble in Little China.

354
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,300
Yeah, not a bad, not a bad, kind of a funny movie.

355
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,780
Anyway, you know, normally you play the credits tape at the end of a show,

356
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,680
but tonight it's going to be at the beginning of a show

357
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,300
because it's pretty much as weird as the rest of the show anyway.

358
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,020
It's ten minutes long and, you know, I could play the credits

359
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,080
or I could play this one extra piece of content.

360
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,900
But no, I'm going to play the credits tape.

361
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,000
So tonight the subject is the makers of the content,

362
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,600
which will be, indeed, the content itself.

363
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,900
And people always ask,

364
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,700
Reverend Stang, do you spend all week on this show?

365
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,500
No, I don't.

366
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,820
I usually spend about four hours on the average.

367
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,140
It was only two hours tonight.

368
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,000
Because I don't make all these tapes.

369
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,400
I just edit these tapes.

370
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,660
I don't even do all the editing.

371
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,060
You talk to Puzzling Evidence and Byron Werner

372
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,380
and some of these other guys.

373
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,900
I make some of them,

374
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,020
but let's just whip this incomprehensible cassette boy

375
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,080
into this lovely,

376
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,000
lovely, smelly slot here

377
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,260
and see what happens.

378
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,220
The voices, tapes, music, and editing

379
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,900
you've been listening to

380
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,780
come from

381
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,720
Lepo Abernathy.

382
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,100
It's Lepo Abernathy.

383
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,840
The Buck, Naked, and the Jaybirds.

384
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,540
Dr. Odan Canobite.

385
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,380

D. Atman Willman.

401
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,260
Well, well.

402
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,700
This is Dr. Ahmed Fishmark.

403
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,900
This is Glass Madness.

404
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,460
This is Hair Doctor Chris Gross.

Islami Satellite Weavers.

406
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,460
This is compatible with all religions.

407
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,760
And this is

408
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,680

These are those fantastic swinging love corpses.

410
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,280
These are Doctors for Dinosaurs.

411
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,320
These are Doctors for Wotan.

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,960
This is Gary Gibrote's Band.

413
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,060
This is the Stink Damn Shotgun of Nose.

414
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,300
Trigger me.

415
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:52,660
I am...

416
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,120
Unmistakable.

417
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,160
This is Arch Pope's Sternodox Enchantment.

418
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,680
Tell all mob dogs to sell their heads.

419

This is DK Jones.

This is Palmer Reedy's The Live Foundation.

421
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,120
Hi Palmer.

422
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,020
And our service is getting worse.

423
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,460
And this is...

424
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:23,960
And this is...

425
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:23,960


426
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,540
The Pope of all New York, David N. Meyer II.

427
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,900
This is Mark Mothersball.

428
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,080
This is the band that dare not speak its name.

429
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,860
The band that dare not speak its name?

430
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,840
This is...

431
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,600
But Naked and the Jaybirds?

432
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,680
The Lightning Preacher.

433
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,560
Watch it.

434
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,220
Bow-wow.

435
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,260
This is Dr. Hal Robbins.

436
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:14,220
Who has the biggest network of any of the

437
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,940
Italian music bands in the world.

438
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,400
And this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

439
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,160
And this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

440
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,460
Ah, yes.

441
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,140
Thank you and Praise Bob.

442
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,040
Oh and this is KNON 90.9 FM, Dallas, Texas.

443
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,480
The voice of the people.

444
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,580
And other things.

445
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,220
Praise Bob.

446
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,420
And now, ladies and gentlemen, we will proceed.

447
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:44,200
I'm going to open the rectum impropter, say-say, cataract.

448
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


449
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


450
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


451
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


452
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


453
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


454
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


455
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


456
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


457
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


458
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


459
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


460
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,200


461
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:55,400
cavity. I see the ViboVetzer is on. We have firm, steady respiration. We have respiration.

462
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:05,600
Look at those life signs. All right, give him room, give him room. Yes, that's the,

463
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:14,200
it's the, it's chain stokes breathing and Darth Vader respiration. Ah, you seem to have

464
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:25,600
severed the manubrium there. It'll heal, we'll just clip it in with a bone staple. All right,

465
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,860
we're getting the serum moved into place. We need six more units of blood here, doctor.

466
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,340
Six more units and we could use six more units.

467
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:35,500
Doctor.

468
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:35,580
Doctor.

469
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,560
Nurses, who are.

470
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,560
Nurses, too.

471
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes, and six more units.

472
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,000
Six more units, sir.

473
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:47,760
All right, have me get around here on the other side of the table. Oh, watch out, will

474
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,380
you drop those cylinders? Nearly hit my feet.

475
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,360
How can you do this?

476
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,880
Excessive evasion.

477
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:01,360
What do you see here, doctor? There seems to be a white surface studded with, it's studded

478
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,400
with, what would you, they almost look like little seeds.

479
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,120
They almost look like there's something.

480
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,340
Something growing inside of them.

481
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,040
Yes, and this whole chamber is hollow. There's nothing in here.

482
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,420
That's his cranial cavity, doctor. You've gone in the wrong way again.

483
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,560
Indeed, I should have began at the distal instead of the proximal end. Well, we'll just

484
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,160
show him up again.

485
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,500
If this operation doesn't work, what are we going to do with the body?

486
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:30,600
Well, I've got a little dog who's getting on in years. He wouldn't be anyone's dog

487
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,900
show winner, but he's a fine little doggy and we're going to.

488
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,100
We're going to experiment on him and make him yelp.

489
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:46,580
Yes, callers, we are putting Wellman back into shape. We are creating the perfect masterpiece

490
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,000
here.

491
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,420
Positively, evidence will be as good as new.

492
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:56,540
The rebuilt Dini. Once upon a time, in an operating room so deep and dark, there lived

493
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,000
a doctor who tried to put back together you.

494
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,760
All right, I'm doing the best I can. Just keep the comments to a minimum, please. This

495
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,940
is hard enough. I don't want to, you know, I don't want to make this guy look so he wouldn't

496
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,560
want to go out on the beach and take off his bathing suit. You know, I did that. You owe

497
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
something to your patient.

498
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,780
Now what happened to the ashes from that cigar?

499
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,700
Here's six units of blood you ordered.

500
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,840
Oh, thanks. Put them in the microwave.

501
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,780
Insulator.

502
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:31,300
Okay. Now we're going to break the small bones of the right shoulder.

503
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,280
Bablomantic hygiene.

504
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,840
Yeah, messy job. But what we're going to replace with a steel substitute.

505
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,160
Yeah, we're going to make this guy bionic.

506
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:49,780
Yeah, sure, Hal. This is Dr. Hal Robbins and Gary Gbrogfran. That's Gary in the background.

507
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,740
Far better than he ever were before, might I say.

508
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,920
He'll walk this earth once more.

509
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,300
And you'll hear it right here, right here on the subgenius shows.

510
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,800
Yes, the subgenius show in California.

511
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,060
See, we're going to run into the subgenius shows all over the place here.

512
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,640
In fact, there was even one taped off the air here by Reverend Ann. I don't know.

513
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,160
The next few years were the years of Big John and Sparky.

514
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:31,380
And they were also years in which I gave more and more attention to the occult as well as to the growing flood of reports of

515
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,940
unidentified flying objects.

516
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,120
There's a tremendous body of literature in these general areas and much of it tends to overlap.

517
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,760
For example, go into it and you'll find links between the legends about Atlantis and the lost continent of Mu on the one hand

518
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,240
and diagnosis and cure of disease through spiritism on the other.

519
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:59,880
And then, first thing you know, you have Eastern religions and UFOs added to your mixed bag of curiosities.

520
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:07,580
Well, when Big John and Sparky became famous enough and I became famous enough,

521
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,280
I left Cincinnati and I moved to the New York area.

522
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:17,660
I leased a big 15-room house on 16 acres of wooded grounds for myself and my family.

523
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,600
And by then I was broadcasting only one hour a week.

524
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,420
I had plenty of time and I had plenty of money to read and to just study everything.

525
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,540
Everything I wanted for a couple of years.

526
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,080
And I began constructing my own religion.

527
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,440
But there was a problem.

528
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,740
And it was...

529
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,680
There always is.

530
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,140
Billy Graham came to New York for a giant crusade.

531
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:53,860
I talked about the crusade with one of my best drinking buddies, a gal who was the program director of a local radio station.

532
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,780
What radio station might that be?

533
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
What do you think about a new batch of talent, John?

534
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,900
It may well actually have been...

535
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,240
A new batch of talent?

536
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,120
Yeah, that's what keeps this subgenius church going, is the new batches of talent,

537
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:14,480
such as Sister Chris, who does a half-hour slack show on WFMU in New Jersey.

538
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,120
And she said...

539
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:24,060
And I say to myself now, every day, in every way, I am getting more slack.

540
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,440
Or as they say, I am slackable.

541
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,680
I am fallible.

542
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,660
And I am incorrigible.

543
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,500
I did meet with a vision of Bob in the bookstore in my travels down in the southern part of the USA.

544
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,840
I was in New Orleans.

545
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:51,000
And in a voodoo store, this card was written by Bartles' dangerous Bob Juju.

546
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,440
The card began to glow and dance about.

547
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,580
Then I saw a vision of the real Bob smiling at me.

548
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,660
And without moving.

549
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,820
And without moving his mouth, he said to me, stop the presses of the mayonnaise.

550
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,380
We need your soul before the...

551
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,580
Before life.

552
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,960
Limited time author, not available in any record store.

553
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,680
I wept.

554
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,340
And began to see right through the pink shell of the conspiracy poops.

555
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:23,160
Straight through to their gears and manifolds and exhaust systems.

556
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,300
I blew my nose into the clerk's sleeve and left.

557
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,380
Shutting Hosanna to the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

558
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,780
Eeyay, eeyay, eeyay.

559
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,420
All right.

560
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,820

563
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,180
We owe you.

564
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,740
Take it.

565
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,560
Take it.

566
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,960
Take it.

567
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,120
Take it.

568
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,840
Take it.

569
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,560
Take it.

570
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,600
прин têm a cent.

571
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,340
Had enough.

572
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,440
Huh ha.

573
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,880
Ha ya got it.

574
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,060
Uh huh.

575

I'm gonna get a Comic Book of...

576
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,140
Oh.

577
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,540
It's so good.

578
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:26,540

Yeah, baby.

You ain't nothing but a hound dog.

You're just a smelly old thing.

625
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:47,940
Woo!

00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,220
Yeah.

641
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,360
Yeah.

642
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,200
Yeah.

643
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,200


644
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,200


645
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,880
Woo!

646
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:53,900
Yeah.

647
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,480
Yeah.

648
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,980
Yeah.

649
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,580
Yeah.

650
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,360
Yeah.

651
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,280
Yeah.

652
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:01,680
Yeah.

653
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,260
Yeah.

654
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,260
Yeah.

655
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,320
Yes, friends.

656
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,780
Well, that was D.K. Jones.

657
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,260
I just got a call from somebody

658
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,860
that used to be at the station here going,

659
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,560
what is that you're playing?

660
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,340
And that's D.K. Jones.

661
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,060
He's going, well, where can I get a tape of that?

662
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,720
Friends, I'm afraid that the stuff

663
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,460
that I play on this subgenius hour of slack

664
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,440
is material that comes,

665
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,220
this is done by fellow reverends.

666
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,340
You know, what can I say?

667
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,820
This is part of the church doctrine.

668
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,340
You can't buy a record of that.

669
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,680
Maybe someday you can.

670
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,580
If the conspiracy didn't exist,

671
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,060
if people would give Bob a little bit more credit,

672
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,160
sure, you'd be able to buy all this stuff in the stores.

673
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,300
But, sorry, you just have to write for information.

674
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,620
From Bob at,

675
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,920
get that pencil ready, dear friends,

676
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,240
Bob, P.O. Box,

677
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,040
140306.

678
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,960
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

679
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,520
And all the subgenius hours of slack

680
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,900
all over the country are different,

681
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,880
although this is the one hour of slack

682
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,740
that benefits from all the other hour of slacks.

683
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,160
Praise Bob, praise Bob.

684
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,120
And this is one of them,

685
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,420
from St. Bleepo Abernathy

686
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,600
and St. Seth Deitch in Boston

687
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,320
with their,

688
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,840
actually it's called

689
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,840
the Asylum of Anti-Pinkness show.

690
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,880
This is show number two by them.

691
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,060
I like the graffiti on the wall here, though.

692
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,020
It's true.

693
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:52,380
Yeah.

694
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:52,940
Mm-hmm.

695
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,560
That's something like graffiti goes back 172 years.

696
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,520
This bathroom was in fact first constructed,

697
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,760
it was part of Grand Central Station,

698
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,880
and it was a supplementary bathroom

699
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,220
that was supposed to go into the main part.

700
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,360
But when they took out the third level,

701
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,380
if any of you read about the third level of Grand Central Station.

702
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:15,520
Oh, of course, the third level, yes.

703
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,060
It was like...

704
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,740
Andrew Carnegie then donated it to MIT College.

705
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,740
Of course, you gotta remember,

706
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,720
this is only a metaphysical bathroom.

707
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,060
This is actually one of the rooms in subgenius purgatory,

708
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,240
this bathroom,

709
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,140
and which we all live in,

710
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,780
though most of us are not aware,

711
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,380
most of us have not had our third nostrils opened to the degree

712
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,480
that we can actually see the porcelain walls

713
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,200
and the booths of this bathroom

714
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,740
that we actually all inhabit.

715
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,080
But we're here at the subgenius asylum of anti-pinkness.

716
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,860
Most people walk through this bathroom all the time.

717
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:51,360
They have peeled away those shrouds over your eyes

718
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,640
that allow you to understand.

719
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,580
And revel in the penis of it all.

720
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,760
And we are here in the pee room of the gods.

721
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,700
This is the biggest pee room ever.

722
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,700
It stretches off for miles into fog.

723
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,320
I mean, I can see the distance, that line of booths.

724
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,160
How long does that go?

725
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,600
They stopped counting back in 1943

726
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,680
when they lost the last expedition

727
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,860
that went all the way down to the end of it there.

728
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,260
There is, we understand, an attendant

729
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,280
that some people claim to have seen.

730
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,160
The little man with the towel over his arm.

731
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,520
You know what his name is too, don't you?

732
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,080
Ernesto.

733
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,400
Ernesto, he's been here for,

734
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,220
well, he inherited the job from his father and his grandfather.

735
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,380
Yeah, in fact, that David Mamet play,

736
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,680
they made fun of this bathroom, like a steam bath.

737
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,120
Yeah, but it wasn't, see, they, they, they, they,

738
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,640
They thought they were in it, but they weren't.

739
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,680
Yeah, well, see, they made it a steam bath, though,

740
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,400
and we actually know it's a men's room.

741
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,540
And so here it is in the sub-basement of the Walker Memorial.

742
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,320
Hey, Lepo, can we maybe get out of this place for a while?

743
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,140
Can we pull the shrouds back down and make the reality more normal?

744
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,200
Okay, let's see, we have the,

745
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,000
Wait, wait, wait, just make it,

746
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,120
wait, how is it when I press this button here, I don't,

747
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,760
This right here, the,

748
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,360
Ah!

749
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,520
Oh, okay.

750
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,420
Well, we're back, we're back in the studio here, WNBR.

751
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,420
Oh, wow.

752
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,040
I'm sorry, folks, that was a little sudden.

753
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,280
What do you mean WNBR?

754
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,140
Yeah, well,

755
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,660
A bunch of baloney.

756
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,760
Yeah, well, it can be tough.

757
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:20,120
I think before the show's over, I think we have to return to that room.

758
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,960
But in the meantime, why don't we, like, listen to this?

759
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,220
Not me.

760
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,040
Hello, this is Betty.

761
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,820
And Veronica.

762
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,960
As your Consumer Affairs staff,

763
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,380
we're here to pass on some household factoids to help make your day a little easier.

764
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,980
Factoid number one.

765
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:39,400
If a light bulb burns out, just hold it under cold running water for two to three minutes.

766
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,360
This often restores them.

767
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,820
Factoid number two.

768
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,440
Used tea bags are great for removing stains from walls or upholstery.

769
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,920
Tape tea bags over stained area.

770
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,880
Remove after one hour.

771
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,240
Wipe with damp sponge.

772
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,120
Factoid number three.

773
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,660
For last-minute clothing tears, try painting along the area with rubber cement.

774
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,460
Avoids a rigid look one always gets from cellophane tape.

775
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,100
And another handy tip.

776
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,500
Melted cheese is best for drawing coffee stains from clothes.

777
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,340
Potatoes soaked over a day.

778
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,920
Aluminumite and ketchup make a fine substitute for tomatoes and recipes.

779
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,440
And fluoride toothpaste can be substituted for roll-on deodorant.

780
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,560
Discontinue use if rash develops.

781
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,680
Stay tuned for other factoids you don't need.

782
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,200
But first, let's see what's happening with the song of the week.

783
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,860
And here's the song of the week.

784
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,560
Thank you, Bob.

785
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,060
Thank you, Bob.

786
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,640
This is Buck Nickit and the Jaybirds.

787
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,840
For cleansing my memory.

788
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,660
Thank you, Bob.

789
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,100
For helping me see.

790
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,960
And Bob, I'll follow you always.

791
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,940
That's right, Bob.

792
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,220
Until that next day.

793
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,880
Thank you, Bob.

794
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,040
Thank you, Bob.

795
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,880
For sending them pills.

796
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,180
Thank you, Bob.

797
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,080
For finding me willing.

798
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,640
Teenage girls.

799
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,600
And Bob, I'll follow you always.

800
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,560
That's right, Bob.

801
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,760
Until that next day.

802
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,200
Ah, yes, dear friend.

803
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,560
See?

804
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,160
All the famous subgeniuses aren't in other states.

805
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:47,200
This is our beloved, Dallas' own and very beloved Buck Nickit,

806
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,680
Pastor Buck Nickit of the Naked Church of the Subgenius,

807
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,320
with KY Boys singing there in the background.

808
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,120
Horrible, isn't it?

809
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,600
With the Jaybirds.

810
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,400
Oh, what a lovely tune.

811
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,320
But we go to Tennessee.

812
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,780
I like flowers, too.

813
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,760
But not as much as dreams.

814
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,240
I like territories.

815
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,520
Eager to beat type.

816
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,440
I like trees.

817
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,420
I like sensation.

818
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,260
I like me too.

819
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,180
Not as much as trees.

820
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,040
These are the great guys.

821
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,060
I like trees.

822
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,600
I like flowers, too.

823
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,120
It's just about me.

824
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,800
Trees and life and dreams.

825
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,820
I like flowers, too.

826
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,800
And not as much as trees.

827
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,280
Playing .

828
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,840
Trees.

829
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,340
And not as much as trees.

830
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:35,500
What a blessing.

831
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,480
Trees and life surprise me now.

832
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:39,480


833
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:39,740
I like trees, cloning them.

834
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:39,740


835
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:39,740


836
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:39,740


837
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:39,740


838
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:39,740


839
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:46,560
I like flowers too, but not as much as trees.

840
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,040
Here they go.

841
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,320
Trees, I like trees.

842
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,880
I like flowers too, but not as much as trees.

843
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,720
Trees, I like trees.

844
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:08,560
I like flowers too, but not as much as trees.

845
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,000
Trees, I like trees.

846
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,540
There they go.

847
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,740
I like trees.

848
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,280
I like trees.

849
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:29,980
I have a message for Robert Tucker.

850
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,400
Wake up!

851
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,240
Dear friends, this is Reverend O.N.A. Cannonby.

852
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,540
We'd like to ask you to please stand up.

853
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:38,540


854
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:45,220
He does the little B-O-B song that you hear often in the background on some of these shows,

855
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,040
these ugly, ugly shows.

856
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,460
Where am I?

857
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,000
Where am I?

858
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:49,620
Where's...

859
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,440
What?

860
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,140
What?

861
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:52,300
What?

862
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,960
This face!

863
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,060
I've given my life for this face!

864
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,840
You like pain?

865
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,420
No, I like pain.

866
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,700
He likes pain.

867
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,740
The pain comes strictly from my nose.

868
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,220
He likes it.

869
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:08,680
He likes it.

870
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:08,680


871
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,640
And Bob likes to scream.

872
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,000
Bob's many teaching techniques.

873
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,720
It's misriding.

874
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,360
He's misriding.

875
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:12,900
No.

876
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,720
No.

877
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:19,780
Bob and the word Bob teaches you to re-capture the slack that the conspiracy took away from

878
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,460
you the minute that doctor hit your butt when you were born.

879
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,960
Can you guys give the listeners a definition or some definitions of slack?

880
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,000
Slack by definition is indefinable.

881
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,560
It's an essence that if you have to ask what it is,

882
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,200
you've probably never had it.

883
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,460
Unless you think about it.

884
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,120
Those who say don't know and know.

885
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,840
The difference between slack and no slack was the time you were 14 and finally called that girl up.

886
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,600
And when she knew who you were,

887
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,080
when you identified yourself on the phone,

888
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,540
that was the beginning of slack.

889
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,400
But then again,

890
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,740
getting the date or anything like that was not slack.

891
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:04,640
It was that moment when suddenly something went the way you wanted it to go without you thinking about it.

892
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,080
It was something that was totally not involved when your feet were involved.

893
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,000
Rather than your head.

894
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:14,340
Slack is getting things to run smooth without trying.

895
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:14,840
That's it.

896
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,500
Without trying.

897
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,380
But you give up and you get everything.

898
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:24,060
It's like a submission of the self to the white overlighting in Buddhism.

899
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,900
The Atman surrenders to the holy oneness without thinking about it.

900
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,460
It's not give to get.

901
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,480
It's give up and get anyway.

902
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,840
It's repent, quit your job and get rich.

903
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,620
That's right.

904
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,360
Or get bad.

905
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:37,920
Or slack.

906
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,180
Or get even.

907
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,260
Or slack off.

908
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,000
Or get even.

909
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:40,440
Or get even.

910
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,060
Or get even.

911
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:41,100
Or get even.

912
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:41,120
Or get even.

913
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,240
And Bob and Bob will give you slack.

914
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,300
Bob watches over the drunkards, idiots, froth heads and all so do you.

915
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:52,040
Now once the yuccatism has been evocated.

916
00:44:52,400 --> 00:45:01,580
And that's, and that's G. Gordon Gordon who was talking there along with Poonflang Dammerung and myself in some obscure Austin radio interview.

917
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,880
But, but shucks, you know.

918
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,200
That's what I say.

919
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,000
This is negative land.

920
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,040
They provide a lot of backgrounds.

921
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:18,600
I ought to mention Byron Werner who sends the found footage type tapes.

922
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,320
A lot of really great old preacher stuff.

923
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,320
Oddball sound effects.

924
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,240
Sort of like this.

925
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,100
Ah, I love it.

926
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,040
Boom.

927
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,620
Put those headphones on you fools if you don't have them on.

928
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,580
Okay kids, the car is packed.

929
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,540
Now go and get your father and we'll look at some more.

930
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,160
New houses.

931
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,380
One thing even more powerful than the beloved pills and froth of Bob.

932
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:58,980
For he has entrusted his chosen disciples, the doctors for Bob with the safe keeping and the cataclysmic launching of a power object.

933
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:07,520
A secret weapon compared to which thermonuclear weapons and even the arc of the covenant are but mere objects.

934
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:14,780
This ancient talisman is every subgenius' guarantee that triumph shall be ours.

935
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:21,760
For it is nothing less than the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

937
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,480
Arnold Palmer is a clone, children.

938
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,440
A fake reproduction of this head.

939
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,860
This head which should be seen from below.

940
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,820
Stand back, children.

941
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,360
Behold the head!

942
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:46,740
This head, in fact, existed before the real Arnold Palmer.

943
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,060
This is no satire of Arnold Palmer.

944
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,260
Arnold Palmer is the satanic imitation of this.

945
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,320
Heelhead back!

946
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,720
Bleeding head!

947
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,160
Heelhead back!

948
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,320
Bleeding head!

949
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,320
Standing next to me on the breakfast tea is Arnold Palmer.

950
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,800
The winner of every meal.

951
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,500
major Open title in golf, including the United States Open, the British Open, and the Masters

952
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:17,200
Tournament. Arnold is going to teach you how to play golf in a new and easy and enjoyable

953
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:23,040
manner in the comfort of your own living room. Are the feet, Arnie, the only part of the

954
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,240
stance that need to be in position for that good swing we're talking about? Well, no,

955
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:37,320
Chris. I would say that the head position is also very important. The head is probably

956
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:44,280
as important as the feet in the stance, and keeping the head in a good, comfortable position

957
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,100
over the ball is very important. Now, you don't want to move the head up or down or

958
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,220
to either side during the swing.

959
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,960
We stand at a crossroad.

960
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,160
The tenuous

961
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,560
slack that a subgenius may occasionally enjoy could be rent to shreds at any moment, for

962
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:09,960
the human puppets of the elder gods continue their senseless plunge into madness and anti-slack,

963
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:16,780
dragging us and our whole beloved planet ever closer to the brink of destruction, be it

964
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:26,040
by the nuclear twist of Jehovah One, ecological disaster, or invasion by hostile aliens. Which

965
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,580
will it be?

966
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,920
Pry and burn actress Sina

967
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,240
Kirk

968
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,480
と思わない

969
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,900
Too much

970
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:44,920
resistance

971
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,180
Sirius

972
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:53,240
Now, again, 협상

973
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,960
I can't swallow your throat

974
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,220
Steger

975
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:56,380

Al04

977
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,140
I'll take you far away from here soon, but I'm always 난

978
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:03,160
Because if you use your own throat to swallow it with, what are you going to swallow?

979
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,440
If you swallow your own throat, what are you going to use to swallow it with?

980
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,120
You can't swallow your own throat.

981
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,640
You can't run from your own legs.

982
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,340
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupid.

983
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,580
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.

984
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,900
He's bigger than all infinity.

985
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:19,920
Help me, somebody.

986
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,860
She ain't got no legs.

987
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,520
Pull the lever and down you go.

988
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,360
Preacher, my legs are on fire.

989
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:25,900
I need some help.

990
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:26,300
I need some help.

991
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,000
Praise Dobbs.

992
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,380
You can't digest your own stomach.

993
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,600
How are you going to digest your own stomach?

994
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,240
Not a man or a woman in this auditorium tonight who can digest their own stomach.

995
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,660
You can't digest your own stomach.

996
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,320
You can't swallow your own throat.

997
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,560
You can't run from your own legs.

998
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,800
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupider than you.

999
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,640
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.

1000
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,880
He's bigger than all reality.

1001
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,140
Help me, somebody.

1002
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,340
Pull the lever and down you go.

1003
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,620
Preacher, my legs are on fire.

1004
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,360
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.

1005
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,680
Praise Dobbs.

1006
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,160
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.

1007
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,460
Give me a card though, I'm 필ith.

1008
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,060
Give me a card .

1009
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,480
Give me a card.

1010
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,360
Give me a card.

1011
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,380
Give me a card.

1012
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,040
Give me a card .

1013
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,440
Give me a card.

1014
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,420
Give me a card .

1015
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,280
Give me a card.

1016
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,120
Give me a card .

1017
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,820
It's Bob.

1018
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:34,740
Bob!

1019
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:36,900
Bob!

1020
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,460
Bob!

1021
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,060
Bob!

1022
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,640
Bob!

1023
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:41,760
Bob!

1024
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,420
Today, we ain't got enough slack.

1025
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,840
We ain't got enough slack.

1026
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,740
Slack is what gives us breaks.

1027
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:53,920
Breaks on the car.

1028
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:54,980
Breaks on the train.

1029
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,900
Breaks to make you go insane.

1030
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,180
And slack is what brings you life.

1031
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,860
Life takes away your slack.

1032
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:06,140
Pussy waitresses take away your slack.

1033
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,100
Arrogant cashiers take away your slack.

1034
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,580
Insensitive employers take away your slack.

1035
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,840
Withholding tax takes away your slack.

1036
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,480
What gives you back your slack?

1037
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,980
What gives you back your slack?

1038
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:23,500
Bob!

1039
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,020
Bob!

1040
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,620
That's what gives you back your slack.

1041
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,100
That's what gives you back your slack.

1042
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,940
After I found Bob, I knew that everything was going to be all right from now on.

1043
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,700
You see, the aliens had been tampering with my brain

1044
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:42,740
and been making me think that Needy was the only way back.

1045
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,100
Oh, but dear friends, you know, once the slack was getting...

1046
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,000
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1047
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,440
Now, that's Dr. Philo Drummond, and I'm going to cut him off

1048
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,800
because just before him, while you were hearing the Pope of all New York,

1049
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,040
Mr. M.D., David N. Meyer,

1050
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,380
at that same time,

1051
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,760
the Pope of all New York called.

1052
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,880
I've got him on hold here, I believe on line one,

1053
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,180
and it's been a long time since I've done phones,

1054
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,220
but let's just see what happens here.

1055
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,080
If I push in this...

1056
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,140
Pope Meyer.

1057
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,120
Pope Smith.

1058
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,360
Oh, thank you.

1059
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,860
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1060
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,800
Finally, boy, you don't know what I... what...

1061
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:24,960
Finally, boy, you don't know what I... what...

1062
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,960
What an embarrassment I just went through over the air,

1063
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,780
but praise Bob, it's worth it!

1064
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,340
It is worth it.

1065
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,400
Dear friends, this is David N. Meyer,

1066
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,420
the second Pope of all New York, all Seattle, and all of Idaho.

1067
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,560
Uh, Pacific Northwest.

1068
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,840
Pope of the Pacific Northwest.

1069
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,120
Well, you know, there's some contention as to who is Pope of New York now,

1070
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,940
and I told them they were going to have to battle you on a tight wire,

1071
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,740
strung between the World Trade Center buildings,

1072
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,200
and I'm waiting to see it.

1073
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,080
Well, Reverend...

1074
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,080
I'm waiting.

1075
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,920
I called because, in fact, your letter, as it should be,

1076
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:02,520
was an inspiration to me in my lonely office here in Rain City,

1077
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:09,080
and you said to me in that letter that you felt I should remain the undefeated Pope of all New York,

1078
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,400
and indeed, I have heeded your word, and that I shall be.

1079
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:19,080
Well, Pope Meyer, would you say a few words to our audience as to what it takes to be a Pope,

1080
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,280
the fallibility of the Pope?

1081
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,580
Well, fundamentally, what it takes to be a Pope is a...

1082
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,460
interest in oneself. I think that's the most fundamental thing that renders a pope.

1083
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,100
Praise Bob.

1084
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:37,940
A pope has to see that his own slack derives from the attention he can accrue to himself.

1085
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,880
Praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.

1086
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:47,380
Just as he will accrue the ire of the conspiracy via precisely the same path.

1087
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:52,760
If you don't have slack for yourself, how are you going to give slack to others?

1088
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:59,220
Praise Bob. Now, further, what a pope must have is the ability to fail.

1089
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:07,080
To fail often and openly and freely and cleanly, and most importantly, he must be able to fail at being a pope.

1090
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:14,140
He has to, friends. He doesn't, he doesn't, he can't just, it's not a matter of choice.

1091
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,360
Bob said he has to fail.

1092
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:22,320
Now, you know, Reverend Stang, you know, there's been a lot of your pointy-headed gimme-bob's that have,

1093
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,560
talked a lot about this West Coast tour and would have you believe that the church was falling to pieces

1094
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:32,700
after that West Coast tour, that there was a lot of bad blood between the popes.

1095
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:38,320
But I've given this a great deal of thought, and if ego is what makes a pope,

1096
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,780
yea, as mayonnaise makes a tuna sandwich, let me ask you a question.

1097
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,900
Let me ask you a question.

1098
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,560
Ask it. Fire away.

1099
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:50,640
If you should make a tuna salad and one day, perhaps, you put a bit too much mayonnaise in that tuna salad,

1100
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,740
does that, does that...

1101
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:57,180
Does that, Reverend Stang, destroy tuna salad forever?

1102
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,780
Does that defile all the tuna salad you may ever eat for the rest of your life?

1103
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:05,560
Nay, nay. In fact, it may well teach an important lesson about tuna salad.

1104
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,780
Precisely. Well said. Yea, verily.

1105
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,860
Just so, too much ego on a tour does not destroy the church.

1106
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:12,540
Nay, nay.

1107
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,160
It just teaches a lesson.

1108
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:20,500
It may cause for a bad time, but, you know, I mean, like Bob teaches,

1109
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,740
it, it, the lessons of Bob are not...

1110
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,260
Not easily taught. Not indeed.

1111
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,980
Bob is a wise old dog.

1112
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,780
And you can't, you can't fool him.

1113
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,260
That's right.

1114
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,280
You cannot fool Bob.

1115
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,320
Now, I also wanted to let you know that I know your pledge drive is over,

1116
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,900
but I'm calling tonight to pledge one million, yes, one million dollars.

1117
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,640
One million, friends...

1118
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,540
One million dollars.

1119
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,940
Now, one, now, if you don't mind, may I ask, I mean, God,

1120
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:49,420
it sounds like the Seattle, uh, popestry is going real well, then.

1121
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,720
Well, of course, I won't be able to pay this million in...

1122
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,040
in, you know, one lump.

1123
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,940
I'll have to, like, you know, fulfill my pledge in, in installments over a period of time.

1124
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,360
It can be scraped off your soul, but it seems to me,

1125
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,200
why the church has already scraped so many barnacles off of your soul,

1126
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,200
barnacles of love and hate and...

1127
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,680
Well, I wanted... I also wanted to let the, uh, the, the listenership of the Hour of Slack know that the...

1128
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,720
tonight, yes, a great miracle has passed.

1129
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,980
The Pope of all New York and the Pacific Northwest

1130
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,660
has finished...

1131
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:22,740
his...

1132
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,880
his first fantasy novel.

1133
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,280
Praise Bob!

1134
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:29,200
And this fantasy novel will be published by New American Library next October

1135
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,640
called Halberd, Dream Warrior.

1136
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,380
Uh, let me, let me remind you before we go too much further

1137
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,160
that this is a non-profit station.

1138
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:38,460
Well, I...

1139
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,060
And, and we therefore can't tell you where to buy that book.

1140
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:44,400
Well, I, I do not mention this for, for crass monetary gain...

1141
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,040
And, and shall they be looking for the name, for the, for the name by the author, Pope David N. Meyer?

1142
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:50,780
No, I...

1143
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,420
I, at this point, uh, the name of the author is unclear.

1144
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,380
Mr. Jay Frank Unclear.

1145
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:57,360
I haven't chosen a name, but the point I wanted to make is...

1146
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,600
is I'm not just calling to promote this book.

1147
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:04,480
And you better do it quick because we've got two minutes of show left and a DJ waiting outside.

1148
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:12,760
Well, the point I'm making is this book is chock full of Bob metaphor, Bob simile, Bob analogy, Bob character, and Bob teaching.

1149
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:19,740
And any true student of Bob should buy this book only after he has purchased the book of the subgenius,

1150
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,720
published by McGraw-Hill, and he will learn much...

1151
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,680
Simon and Schuster now.

1152
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,900
Excuse me, Simon and Schuster.

1153
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,840
Praise Bob.

1154
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:34,880
Well, do you, do you know that there are two unsold copies of the book of the subgenius in the humor section of the Tower Book here in Seattle?

1155
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,940
That is a disgusting thought.

1156
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:45,780
That there's, and there's probably two saveable, but as yet unsaved bums sleeping in cardboard boxes outside that very building...

1157
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:46,140
I think...

1158
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,080
...unable to purchase those books...

1159
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:48,480
I think...

1160
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,060
...or steal them.

1161
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:59,000
...I think worse than that there are probably 200 self-satisfied, smug, upwardly mobile, yuppie college student pink boys and girls

1162
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:08,040
basking in their own self-satisfaction when in fact if but two of them bought those books, yea, the former 198 could be saved.

1163
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:16,260
Oh, friends, and someday that 144,000 of the chosen shall be lifted up in glory.

1164
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:25,900
On the day of rupture, yes, X-Day 1998, which closes in upon us just as the end of this hour is closing in.

1165
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,640
Frightening thought.

1166
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,700
Actually, Pope...

1167
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,080
Yes?

1168
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,100
You know, this is a difficult moment.

1169
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:45,660
It's 12 o'clock midnight here on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas, and my, Ron Lindsey, the host of Soul Oldies, Soul Oldies, praise...

1170
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,300
...you know, it's a show you could have had in the olden days.

1171
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:59,620
Well, you know, I listened to Mr. Lindsey for a moment or two following you on one of the tapes that you sent me, and truly Mr. Lindsey has a golden throat from the brief amount that I heard.

1172
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,500
He sure does, and he likes Bob, too, although he didn't like Bob enough to send that 20 bucks, which is...

1173
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,860
Has he tied to Bob that which is Bob?

1174
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,280
He does indeed in his own way.

1175
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,440
Well, then praise him.

1176
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,220
Well, I hear him honking outside.

1177
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:18,380
So I'm going to hop off of this microphone, and so are you.

1178
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:19,220
Praise Bob.

1179
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,520
I've been doing the credit show, Pope Meyer.

1180
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,900
This has been the credit show of the Church of the Subgenius, giving credit where credit is due.

1181
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:31,440
And here is one man, friends, who certainly is a credit to Bob.

1182
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:38,020
And don't forget, you, listening audience, your credit with Bob is only good if you pay the bill.

1183
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:38,940
Praise Bob.

1184
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:39,600
Praise Bob.

1185
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,120
We're going to head downstairs now.

1186
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:41,840
Thank you.

1187
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,360
Thank you.

1188
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:42,840
Hooah!

1189
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:53,100
I'm going to rip my brain asunder and twist the air from my throat.

1190
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:58,340
Yes, dear friends, you found nothing like it till you find Bob.

1191
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:07,700
Because the peace that Bob has told me one day that unless I free myself from meagre, they said,

1192
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,240
Doctor, they said, Physician, heal the soul!

1193
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,960
We are trying.

1194
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:37,880
Oh, yeah.

1195
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,660
Well, it's tough here.

1196
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,400
There are too many sound effects.

1197
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,760
Look out, look out!

1198
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:44,780
Look out!

1199
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,180
Ron is here. Ron Lindsay is here, friends.

1200
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:49,240
Don't go away.

1201
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,160
Who are those?

1202
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,200
Perhaps this is as good a time as any

1203
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,380
to take a few minutes to repeat a message

1204
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,400
that seems frequently lost

1205
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,960
in the hustle and bustle of our daily activity.

1206
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,440
We're hoping to make a lot of money real fast.

1207
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,460
And if we can wake up 10 more people out there

1208
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,200
in the listening audience,

1209
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,680
tonight we will have achieved our goal for the evening.

1210
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,180
What is the church's priorities?

1211
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,640
Slack. It's something we all need.

1212
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,560
And I know that lots of people out there

1213
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,520
listening right now are feeling

1214
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,720
a terrible shortage of slack.

1215
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,120
Slack is something you can't get enough of.

1216
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,280
That's right. That's right.

1217
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,300
And we can help them to get slack, George.

1218
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,760
Man, the world is filled with a bunch of

1219
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,140
kooky ideas and concepts about the Bible.

1220
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,020
I predict that flying saucers will officially,

1221
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,080
land on the lawn of the White House.

1222
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,320
That's what I like about the word of God.

1223
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,460
There's nothing fakey about this thing, man.

1224
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,740
You talk about telling it like it is.

1225
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,300
It hangs the dirty wash right out the front bay window

1226
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,680
for everybody to see.

1227
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,220
That's right.

1228
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:02,480
And we want, when 1998 comes,

1229
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,400
we want subgeniuses to be in positions of power

1230
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,120
so that this alien technology is not abused.

1231
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,260
Hi, girls.

1232
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:12,480
That position.

1233
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,420
Hey!

1234
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,020
Have fun!

1235
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:19,780
