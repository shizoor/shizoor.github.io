1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,700
Now you've turned your record over and you're all ready for some more Sing Time sing-along songs.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:21,060
Matthew 5, 16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

3
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,300
And welcome here to Polka, Polka, Polka.

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,980
Polka, Polka, Polka.

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,040
Very good. Well, it's delightful to have all of you with us here today. Beautiful family here. You should all be very proud.

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,460
As we all are. Let's go back up to the stage here and pick up another song here. Another Polka or what? What are we doing here this time around?

7
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,140
I think it's the Soul Genius Powerhouse.

8
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,180
What?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,140
Hello.

11
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,800
You gotta tell him. You gotta tell him.

12
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,480
I'll tell him.

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,840
You gotta tell him.

14
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,060
What?

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,080
Silent free this bomb.

16
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:16,960
Oh.

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,980
Oh, my.

18
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:21,600
Oh, dear.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,860
Eat, eat.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,500
My own pie.

21
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,780
Right, Bob?

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,520
Bob.

23
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,580
Bob?

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,260
Bob?

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,440
Bob?

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,120
Hi. My name is Rachel and my telephone number is 351-0527.

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,560
I wanted to tell you that you're evil, horrible people.

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,480
You're awful people. You represent horrible ideas.

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,980
God hates you and he wants to kill your children.

30
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,720
You should all burn in hell. Bye.

31
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,180
I'll sue you for this.

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,900
Oh, superstitious, eh?

33
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,600
Hey.

34
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,300
Hey.

35
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,720
Right, Mrs.

36
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:17,920
I Prem, ran around and took out my cellphone call.

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:17,920


38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:17,920


39
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:17,920


40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,140
Oh, too bad.

41
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,360
I'm sick and tired of yelling out that he's so stupid,orous little pass.

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,500


43
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,940
Just syrup the things that my religion was telling me I would.

44
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,500
Quite with you.

45
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:23,620
You didn't miss my first trip?

46
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:23,800
You just cut me off.

47
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,300
Steve, I beg your pardon.

48
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,300


49
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,560
Oh, God.

50
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,420
You broke it.

51
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,420
Are you sick?

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,500
Rose, dear friends, did that marvelous old angst mine, as they call it.

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:14,880
And this is the first show of the year 2005, conspiracy year 2005.

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,660
But mine is not angst, friends, but slack.

55
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:27,460
Because we brought all these great recordings back from our subgenius frop tour of Jura.

56
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,080
Heard in the background.

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:43,440
And the artists of alt.binaries.slack brought up all these cool mixes from their scary tours into their own minds.

58
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,520
Such as the new intros by Mr. Sister and Fernanda Nende-Lin-Mur.

59
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:58,420
And so, friends, without any further or future or dure, let us go back into that digital tape recording.

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,580
Of this live revival at The Bad Kite in Amsterdam, Holland.

61
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,040
Just as it really happened.

62
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,340
We should all join together.

63
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,260
I know some of you are new to our congregation here.

64
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,900
And perhaps curious to see what sort of a hideous freak show it is.

65
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,580
It's really a little worse than you expected, to tell the truth, I promise.

66
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,260
But if you could just join us briefly.

67
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,060
We could bow our heads for a solid...

68
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,520
Yeah.

69
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,020
Quiet moment of sacred damn NOPE!

70
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,960
Yeah!

71
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,300
It's so good to see the children of Bob.

72
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,160
And these particular children of Bob.

73
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,420
He's been very busy.

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,440
You know, he's a very horny messiah, you might say.

75
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,840
He's a cross-species lover.

76
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,460
But not...

77
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,060
And not just Earthlings.

78
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


79
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,440
He's a very earth animal.

80
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,000
He's like this mighty museum-quality prairie squid here.

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,220
But also non-Earth creatures.

82
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,980
Well, I don't know if he's real proud of that.

83
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,360
So let's not linger on it.

84
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:22,400
About 300 years ago, a bunch of really clever, highly developed European countries,

85
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,620
like this one, England, Germany, and so forth, decided,

86
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,280
Hey!

87
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,040
Let's get rid of our insane religious nuts by sending them to the New World!

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,320
Well, that was probably a good idea at the time.

89
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,120
But now we have come back to haunt you.

90
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,680
Actually, not the church of the subgenius I'm talking about.

91
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,020
Unfortunately, I mean George W. Bush.

92
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,800
And just to get this over with, believe me, I'm tired of this.

93
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,720
But on behalf of, really, most Americans,

94
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,060
almost all of the US subgeniuses, and even some Texans,

95
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,200
Please liberate us!

96
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,560
You must free us from the mad dictator!

97
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,520
We've been taken away!

98
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,780
We have no free elections!

99
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,500
Our women are forced to wear makeup all the time!

100
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,980
They teach creation science in our schools!

101
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,000
They judge us for our fitness, for work, by our pee!

102
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,420
They judge us by our pee, my friends!

103
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,600
So please, you must...

104
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,800
We were allies in the war, he was coming to liberate us!

105
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,980
We need freedom in America!

106
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,440
We must have slack!

107
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,000
Woo!

108
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,160
Slack!

109
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,840
And, my friends, slack is getting harder and harder to find.

110
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,060
And there's more false slack everywhere we go, it seems.

111
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,700
Woo!

112
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,420
We've been traveling through Europe this trip.

113
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,360
And it's been a lot of fun, but it's also frightening,

114
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,900
because we would go to these nice little traditional towns,

115
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,520
like LÃ¼neburg in Germany.

116
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,840
It's a nice little traditional town, these beautiful old houses,

117
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,300
and ancient churches, and you look down the street,

118
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,660
it's like a classic theme park of Germany land or something,

119
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,220
but there, at the end of the block,

120
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,540
McDonald's.

121
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,520
Starbucks.

122
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,540
And no Bob!

123
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,840
And no fucking Bob!

124
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,260
If you're going to take this stupid bullshit from the US,

125
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,460
make it Bob!

126
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,040
Not the conspiracy, but try a new conspiracy for a change.

127
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,300
Really, it was, it's so sad.

128
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,060
But we will continue seeking the perfect hamburger.

129
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,220
The hamburger of perfect slack, you might say.

130
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,100
That's what we're really looking for.

131
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,900
That and a little more money.

132
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,460
But we'll continue.

133
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,600
But once we get that burger, that perfect burger,

134
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,140
we will not just eat it like the normal humans do.

135
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,820
No, we will be subgeniuses!

136
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,180
We will eat the hell out of it!

137
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,520
Or in another way, to quote the great saint of Amsterdam,

138
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,780
Jeroen van Bram, who might, who knows,

139
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,220
maybe he'll be here later tonight,

140
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,440
as he told us, you have to shout and make a lot of noise,

141
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,440


142
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,340
or whatever, because when you die, you shut up like hell.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,340
Yes, and so, later on, even I will shut up like hell,

144
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,460
and I'm sure you'll be glad.

145
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,360
But friends, in the meantime, open your hearts,

146
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,980
unzip your lips and your trousers,

147
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,040
pull out your wallets and bend over,

148
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,000
because I am going to preach the word of Bob!

149
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,340
You know, they say that Moses,

150
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,300
Moses parted the Red Sea,

151
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,320
and that the great scientist Oppenheimer split the atom.

152
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,260
But Bob, Bob cuts the crap, my friends!

153
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,100
He cuts through the bullshit!

154
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,960
Actually, he uses powerful bullshit to cut through the bullshit, but...

155
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,140
We're here, that's right, we're here in Ludenburg, Germany,

156
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,480
in our subgenius crusade of slack,

157
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,440
trying to put a Dobbs head in every German's hand.

158
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,340
Praise Bob!

159
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,120
Putting a Dobbs head on every ancient painting hanging in the church.

160
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,980
Yup, yup, yup, yup!

161
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,700
Yeah, we covered all those crucifixion pictures with Dobbs heads, it was funny.

162
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,120
It's going to be hard to peel those off of those ancient canvases.

163
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,520
That unicorn over there...

164
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,980
Einhorn apothecary.

165
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,260
You know what is less sinister is that was a Lutheran church.

166
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:46,920
Oh.

167
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,900
That was, there's a Protestant church.

168
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,180
They break away from the Catholic...

169
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,520
It was built as a Catholic church, but it ended up breaking away when Martin Luther was...

170
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,040
And now it's a McDonald's.

171
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,160
Now it's a McDonald's, yeah.

172
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,040
Well, that's, I guess that's, there's a horrible or wonderful history lesson in that.

173
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,820
Depends on who wins, how the history will come out.

174
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,180
Now where to?

175
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,860
Follow me.

176
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,300
Follow me.

177
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,920
Martin Luther.

178
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,960
Martin Luther, the leader of the German Reformation, was born in Eiselben, Germany.

179
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,540
Life in the Luther home was simple and religious.

180
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,760
At the beginning of the dry season, they construct a sort of mud cocoon or burrow.

181
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,100
Martin Luther's father sent him to school to become a lawyer.

182
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:50,680
After going to Preparatory schools, he entered the University of Erfurt in 1501.

183
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,500
He had barely begun his study of law when he decided to enter the Erfurt cloister of the Augustinian Order,

184
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,660
in which they remain until the next wet season.

185
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,500
Since the life of a monk was considered a sure way into heaven, he entered the monastery to save his soul.

186
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,380
It usually weighs from 15 to 20 pounds and is covered with scales.

187
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:21,320
A bowl of excommunication was issued in January 1521, and Luther was called to appear at the Doctrine of the Church.

188
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,640
In April, Luther was ordered to retract all of his openings to admit air.

189
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,520
Luther replied that he could not in good conscience breathe air like a reptile.

190
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,360
In May, the Diet condemned him as a heretic.

191
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:43,060
On the way back to Wittenberg, he was kidnapped by friends who took him for safekeeping to the Wartburg Castle,

192
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,400
where they often make a cave-like mess for themselves.

193
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,000
There he made his translation of the New Testament into German.

194
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:04,900
When Luther was sapphiraå¸ipp, he was a friend of Paul as a Muslim

195
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,420
who decided to do seuph Utah, one of the authority powers here in Lutheran fabric,

196
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:16,380
where it is found that his family mÃ¼sste le pione and he did heresia di Trinit passhead d'Union,

197
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:16,380


198
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,620
who died just 15 time after Muslims had first convenient.

199
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,040
drugs, adultery, prostitution, prostituting ourselves like we're doing now.

200
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,000
Remember to call that number and make your pledge.

201
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,940
We're all whores, friends.

202
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,300
We're all whores for the man.

203
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,020
Come on, face it.

204
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,560
If it's going to be the man, which man do you want it to be?

205
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,240
Big Brother or Bob?

206
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,600
Bob's cool for the man as the man goes.

207
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,900
I guess that's not saying much.

208
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,480
But if you've got to have a man, let it be Bob.

209
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,640
He's the lesser of two evils as far as we know.

210
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,220
Bob sucks less?

211
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,580
Bob sucks less.

212
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,800
Bob sucks less.

213
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,660
Bob sucks less.

214
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
He blows more.

215
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,260
He blows far more.

216
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,340
Bob blows more.

217
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,940
Blow Bob before he blows you.

218
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,180
She said Bob blows more.

219
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,380
Again, we have to scabble our truth.

220
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,960
Brother of Roger Moore.

221
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,300
You want to have fun on me?

222
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,480
You exotic, narcissistic people.

223
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,820
It's time for a shift change.

224
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,080
I need to take a shift.

225
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,180
And I think that we need to hear more English voices on this show.

226
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,660
More English voices, huh?

227
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,340
Well, let's go to the Hamburg revival at the FundbÃ¼ro

228
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,780
to hear an Englishman preach to some Germans

229
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,880
while the German...

230
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,840
...trains run on time overhead.

231
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,900
I am proud to introduce to you

232
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,080
one of the greatest preachers

233
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,920
because he speaks for such a short time.

234
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh, Mickey Finn!

235
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,180
Yeah!

236
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:18,580
Oh, and he's not kidding.

237
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,840
When he's in a short time,

238
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,780
I mean a short time.

239
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,060
Well, I think there's nothing for us here to join together now.

240
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,420
Put your hands in the hand of the person next to you

241
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,900
and let's sing a spiritual one because...

242
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:30,760
Bob.

243
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,220
He's Bob.

244
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,260
Bob don't ever change.

245
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,560
Alistair Darman.

246
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,900
He's Bob.

247
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,860
Bob don't ever change.

248
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,880
No, brethren, sisters and Bob don't ever change.

249
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,520
Well, that's not strictly true.

250
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,000
Bob changes all the fart of getting time.

251
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,040
One day, Bob's your friend.

252
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,120
Bob's your daddy.

253
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,280
Bob's your buddy.

254
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,720
Bob's your uncle.

255
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,840
Next day, you're sponging up the blood from your tattered anus

256
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,120
and you're wondering where your credit card went.

257
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,360
But this is why Bob is by far the fightingest,

258
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,040
violentest, sexiest religious figurehead there is.

259
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,940
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

260
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:24,420
How many of you lost a girlfriend you only ever treated with respect

261
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,280
and consideration to some arsewipe with a personality disorder

262
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,080
and a hygiene deficit because he was more exciting than you?

263
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,860
Women, how many of you lost your chap to whom you were only ever faithful

264
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,420
and understanding to some skanky hoe with no knickers?

265
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,780
All of you, all of you.

266
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,060
And if you haven't, you will because that is the law.

267
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,820
So just accept that steady and reliable is a dead end spiritually.

268
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,360
Bob is nebulous.

269
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,720
Bob is fibulous.

270
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,180
Bob is fabulous.

271
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:11,840
No, sir, accept Bob into your life and you will not tire of him and his shit-eating idiot grin.

272
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,340
Bob is wider and tighter, wetter and more ribbed.

273
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,940
Harder and softer than any other saviour in today's crowded metaphysical marketplace.

274
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,740
Bob will turn your sins into sex.

275
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,440
Bob will wash your feet with somebody else's pubic hair.

276
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,020
Bob will cure your blindness but give you herpes.

277
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,580
You can get high off Bob tonight and then drink your own urine tomorrow

278
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,080
and get twice as high.

279
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,560
With so many things these days, you build up a tolerance.

280
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,000
On your seventh straight day of acid, you can pass your driving test.

281
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,540
The so-called law of diminishing returns.

282
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,300
Not with the outlaw, Bob.

283
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,140
With Bob you develop sacred intolerance.

284
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,260
Every trip with Bob is 99 times more intense than the one before.

285
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,800
The law of astonishing rug burns.

286
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,400
On your seventh straight trip with Bob, you can't even pass water.

287
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,660
Your brain, once wrinkled with knowledge,

288
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,720
is now smooth and shiny as if boiled.

289
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,320
And once you have created that blank mental canvas,

290
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,220
what wonders you can be reprogrammed with.

291
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,060
The very real machinations of the Church of the Subgenius

292
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,340
make the Manchurian candidate look like a magic eye picture.

293
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,220
Bob will program you to assassinate him.

294
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,320
He'll ring the doorbell of your soul and then he'll run away.

295
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,500
Bob is the ultimate absentee deputy.

296
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:43,960
He'll beat Dad.

297
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,060
You may hate him, but you can't help wondering if you look like him.

298
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,420
For make no mistake, we are all Bob's children.

299
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,580
And I'm not talking metaphorically here.

300
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,180
That was one busy fornicator.

301
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,040
You think screaming Jay Hawkins was busy?

302
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,380
Uh-uh.

303
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,840
Compared to Bob, he looked like a eunuch.

304
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,700
Show your mother a picture of Bob and see the anguish in her eyes.

305
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,700
Show your father the same thing,

306
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
and see the resignation.

307
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Bob begat you.

308
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,920
Bob will beget you.

309
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,660
The circle is complete.

310
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,740
Death taxes Bob.

311
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,240
Yeah!

312
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,780
Ladies and gentlemen, you've given me 40 minutes of your time.

313
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,500
Thank you very much indeed.

314
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,900
Yeah, every time you say those words, it means a month and a half of trouble for me, Bob.

315
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,320
It means hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars.

316
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,180
I know.

317
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,220
We gotta pay to keep the company quiet.

318
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,300
We gotta pay damages.

319
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,140
Erase memories.

320
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,380
Relocate your family.

321
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,900
Every time it gets harder.

322
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,300
Money, money, money, money, money.

323
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,740
We can't keep doing this, Bob.

324
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,460
We appreciate what you did in the old days, but those days are over.

325
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,300
From now on, you're on your own.

326
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,160
Uh, but you see, my friends, you can be alone with Bob.

327
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,900
And it's not like being alone with, say, a giant rubber inflatable octopus.

328
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,260
It's sexy, though that might well be.

329
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,280
And, friends, the pope of all spirits, Bob,

330
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,840
the great Rombo Bach, used just such a giant inflatable rubber octopus

331
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:26,320
to demonstrate his point during his sermon at the Amsterdam Frop Cup Divival of 2004.

332
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,760
I'm gonna explain the octopus to you.

333
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,540
Great Rombo!

334
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,260
Can you see the octopus?

335
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,500
It's big.

336
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,760
It's yellow.

337
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,140
It has eight arms.

338
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,260
And it's just big.

339
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,820
It's not like the conspiracy.

340
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,480
It's got this stupid grin.

341
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,280
It's got something like a pipe.

342
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,600
But he's not Bob!

343
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,280
He's trying to tip you.

344
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,120
He's trying to sell you something that is not for real.

345
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,640
He's trying to give you false slack.

346
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,500
He's a false prophet!

347
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,940
He came here.

348
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,620
See, they blame me.

349
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,560
I took care.

350
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:10,920
I didn't take care of other people.

351
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:10,920


352
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,920
I've stayed around here.

353
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,460
He's here.

354
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,440


355
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,440


356
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,180
He's a imbecile.

357
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,640
A real rebel weapon.

358
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,740
Moron!

359
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:17,800
Aeremos

360
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,200
H Ð¸ÑÑÐ¾ÑÐ¸Ð¸

361
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,660

362
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:20,660


363
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:20,660


364
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,180
Des

365
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,220
Des

366
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,240
No

367
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,460
Musik

368
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,480
That's what you have to do with the conspiracy!

369
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,220
Burn it over for your own needs!

370
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,300
They own you alive!

371
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,960
Get it back!

372
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,340
Get your fucking slack back!

373
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,840
Because if you don't, they will eat you up!

374
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,300
Now I want to explain another thing.

375
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,640
I want to explain more.

376
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,880
Look at that man!

377
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,860
What kind of man does have that face?

378
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,900
Or this face? Or this?

379
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,180
Or that face over there?

380
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,240
That's a happy man!

381
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,580
But he's not just a normal happy man.

382
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,620
He's a satisfied man!

383
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,820
And what kind of satisfaction gives you that face?

384
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,240
Rolling stone satisfaction?

385
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:31,920
No!

386
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,460
A slack satisfaction!

387
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,260
You get enough slack, you get that face for yourself!

388
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,540
So walk away!

389
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:40,540


390
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:40,860
Burn it!

391
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,140
Until you get that fucking face on you!

392
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,040
And now I want to explain one last thing.

393
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,240
I want to explain this.

394
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,680
Most of you can't see this.

395
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:06,880
This is one of the most stupid, ugly, ugly things I ever saw!

396
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,600
This is completely stupid!

397
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:18,340
But as Bob said, the more stupid it looks, the most important it is!

398
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,480
So right now, this is going to save our lives!

399
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,240
I don't know how.

400
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,380
Bob knows!

401
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,480
Ask him!

402
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,300
But this will save your life!

403
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,440
Thank you!

404
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,780
Praise God!

405
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:32,980
That's right!

406
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,800
God's power!

407
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:42,600
Once you've had Bob's microphone rammed up you from behind, you never, ever stop talking again!

408
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,320
It's like a continuous scream.

409
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,460
Once Bob has had you like that, you're never going to stop preaching!

410
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,020
Your scream, your preaching, is like a continuation of that initial

411
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,900
that you feel when Bob comes into your life.

412
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,920
Ah yes, yes, yes...

413
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,860
That's the spirit!

414
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,800
That's the down home spirit.

415
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,020
We're not making fun of those crazy old preachers.

416
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,020
We're trying to bring that back.

417
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,400
We're trying to preserve that.

418
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,560
Don't you see?

419
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,420
They're trying to rob away the passion.

420
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,560
But I'm not a number.

421
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,900
I'm a free man.

422
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,940
The loudspeakers spoke up and said,

423
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,080
colonialism is good.

424
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,840
Subgenius is stupid.

425
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,100
They were right.

426
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,680
Subgenius is stupid.

427
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:37,260
As long as, until the revolution comes, the subgenius will party and bullshit, party

428
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,160
and bullshit, and party and bullshit.

429
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,840
That's all there is to it.

430
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,860
That's bullshit.

431
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,220
We'll bullshit and bullshit.

432
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,680
Bullshit, bullshit and bullshit.

433
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,440
Enada, enada.

434
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,480
It's artistic.

435
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,920
Spew and spout.

436
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,800
Spew.

437
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,280
It must be just about out of battery, so.

438
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,280
It must be just about gone.

439
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,480
I'm going to do some serious chugging.

440
00:23:59,480 --> 00:23:59,800
Oh.

441
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,380
Mama's staying.

442
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,660
Oh, my God.

443
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:00,660


444
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:00,660


445
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:00,660


446
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:00,660


447
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:00,660


448
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:00,660


449
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:00,660


450
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,460
What is he doing?

451
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,820
He's outside.

452
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,340
It's awesome.

453
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,000
Now you said a lot.

454
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,320


455
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:09,560


456
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:09,560


457
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:09,560


458
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,080
Oh, God.

459
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,520
There are those who the fire of Bob is lit under them,

460
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,460
and they can't stop spouting.

461
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,080
And there are those who every now and then a tiny nugget will come up

462
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,260
and fall out and amaze the world.

463
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,760
That's true. It takes all kinds, Bob said.

464
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,440
That was one of his wisest.

465
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,320
It takes all kinds.

466
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,100
It takes all kinds, yes.

467
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,280
Bob was the first to realize that it indeed,

468
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,820
well, it's a silly platitude, actually, like most of what Bob said.

469
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,520
That it sounds good, though.

470
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,140
And that's what you want.

471
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,620
That's what you need in a religion, something that sounds good.

472
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,060
A platitude that you all want.

473
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,880
It doesn't need some work.

474
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,840
God forbid that it actually worked.

475
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,500
Then you'd be some kind of a religious nut.

476
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,080
But it nearly makes sense.

477
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,960
Yeah, it just makes you feel good long enough

478
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,700
to drag your ass through another long day at work.

479
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,320
Whatever gets you through the day, Bob said.

480
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,260
Bob said that.

481
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,160
Oh, that's one of his.

482
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,600
Yeah.

483
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,360
Many have ripped Bob off.

484
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,180
They steal from Bob because they're jealous of his slime.

485
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,100
And they think they've got away with it.

486
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,060
But when the huge corporate copyright case in the sky comes down,

487
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,280
shortly before 1998.

488
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,140
Oh, yeah.

489
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,320
Then they'll find out who's been golfing partners with old God.

490
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,780
John Lennon up against the wall.

491
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,120
Thank you for abusing my wife like that, Rambo.

492
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,800
Thank you.

493
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,760
I just wanted to come up here and announce,

494
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,580
one of the greatest sub-genius preachers

495
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,680
and one of the most holy men I know of.

496
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,880
He's been to both end-of-the-world celebrations.

497
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,800
The first one in Europe and the first one in America.

498
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,360
He is Al-Hajj, Al-Hajj, Haz-Kim, Haz-Matt.

499
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,400
Salak.

500
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:13,800
Haz-B.

501
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,580
The Kaiser, Carl X.

502
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,460
Salak.

503
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,040
Salak.

504
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,040


505
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,700
Salak.

506
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,020
Salak.

507
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,880
Salak.

508
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,320
Salak.

509
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,320


510
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,340
Salak.

511
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,340


512
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,340


513
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,340


514
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,340


515
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,340


516
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,960
Salak.

517
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,720
Salak.

518
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,480
Salak.

519
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:27,720


520
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,020
Salak.

521
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,620
Salak.

522
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


523
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


524
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


525
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


526
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


527
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


528
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


529
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


530
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


531
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


532
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


533
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


534
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


535
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


536
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


537
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


538
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


539
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


540
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,620


541
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,620
I am here to do the sub-genius quarter century report.

542
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:39,060
In 25 years, we are the second biggest UFO cult on the planet.

543
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,140
We are much cheaper than Scientology.

544
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,360
But we have better genes than the Raelians.

545
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,960
What happened to some of those others?

546
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,480
Woo!

547
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
What happened to?

548
00:26:52,600 --> 00:27:02,880
Heaven's Gate. Their saucers came and took them away. At least we think. Our saucers came and

549
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:18,320
screwed us. In 1998, in 1999, in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004. But not in 2000. Another saucer cult from Texas,

550
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:48,100
Tian Chao. They came and went so fast nobody's even heard of them. They were down the street from me. I didn't even go. In 25 years, Scientology bought three crapped out freighters, sailed around the world and called their Apollo project and mostly got their asses kicked. In 25 years, the Mormons wiped out a wagon train passing through Utah just to settle an old grudge. In 25

551
00:27:48,100 --> 00:28:16,360
years, we spiked the Olympics. The subgenius Olympic doping committee spiked the Olympics. It was in all the news. And we even said we were going to do it on the stage last year on the back of our shirts. So what will happen 25 years from now? What will we do in 25 years? We'll buy out Scientology. We'll buy that building and have it on the news side's forward call.

552
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:45,760
Next to the police station. We will clean out Al Ron Hubbard's desk that you see in the window when you walk by there every day. We will pry that head off that desk and we will launch it. And in 25 years, since the present government is dusting off the old blasphemy laws, it will be illegal to make fun of Bob. You won't get away from Bob. He'll be on TV. He'll be everywhere.

553
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,020
Yeah.

554
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,720
The Bob Channel.

555
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,840
I don't think that's about it.

556
00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:09,880
Now, friends, it just dawned on me that this subgenius, the Bible, is missing something.

557
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,340
Yeah, an audience.

558
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,900
Now, there's one of the most sacred.

559
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,360
There's one of the most sacred rituals we can perform tonight.

560
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,400
And I want to ask the Reverend Ivan Stang to come up here and perform this ritual.

561
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:36,400
Ladies and gentlemen, we here tonight are going to perform a subgenius divorce.

562
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,080
That's right, my friends. We're going to have a divorce.

563
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,720
Because when you join the church of the subgenius, you marry Bob.

564
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,920
But when you join the church.

565
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,820
You divorce the conspiracy.

566
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,280
Do I hear a praise Bob?

567
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,320
Praise Bob.

568
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:03,700
And I want Brother Stang to come up here and divorce me from this creature of Ivan's slap.

569
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,280
I've already slipped.

570
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,980
Pope Wyatt, now come back up here, Pope Wyatt.

571
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,980
The first thing I want you to do is give me your watch.

572
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,660
Give me that watch over here.

573
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,760
All right.

574
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,680
I took this man's watch.

575
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:25,820
Pope Wyatt, first, do you reject the conspiracy law that has done to you in your life?

576
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,140
I have rejected.

577
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,480
Rejected.

578
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,200
Pope Wyatt, is this your wrist watch?

579
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,400
Yes, it is.

580
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,100
Do you recognize the fact that this is a handcuff?

581
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,760
This is a leash that holds you, that binds you to that conspiracy.

582
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,340
Are you willing to give up this handcuff that you spent $150 on?

583
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,020
This fine gold?

584
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,080
This fine gold handcuff?

585
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:54,900
Are you really willing to sacrifice that much for your divorce from the conspiracy?

586
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,180
I divorce the conspiracy.

587
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,420
I give it up to the pawn shop.

588
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:08,700
Now take your foot off the microphone cord and watch closely as I symbolize your divorce

589
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,080
from the conspiracy.

590
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,420
Now get a close look, friends, because this is an expensive watch.

591
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,000
Yes!

592
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,680
Yes!

593
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,560
Yes!

594
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:17,560


595
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,920
Ah yes!

596
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,760
We have disemboweled the handcuff of anti-slap.

597
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,520
This was a- oh, it's still ticking.

598
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,780
No, actually, it's not.

599
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,320
It's dead, it's useless.

600
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,100
It's the visible watch.

601
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:40,680
You can see the intricate workings, just as intricate as the conspiracy that once controlled

602
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,120
you.

603
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,600
I'm healed!

604
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,600
Yay!

605
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,480
Woo!

606
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:45,920
Woo!

607
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,360
Woo!

608
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:46,660
Woo!

609
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,440
Woo!

610
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,380
This does mean that you'll still be able to pay me back the money you owe me, right?

611
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:52,780
No!

612
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,580
No, no.

613
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,400
Friend, because when you get divorced from the conspiracy, you're still not divorced

614
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,380
from J.R.

615
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,200
Bob Dog's.

616
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,900
Once Bob, once you've felt Bob's love come at you from behind, my friends, you'll never

617
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,740
get over it.

618
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,380
That opening will never shrink back down to its former size.

619
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,780
You will feel Bob every time you go to the bathroom.

620
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,940
Never turn your back on Bob.

621
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,660
Never turn your back on Bob.

622
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,860
You can't turn your back on Bob, friends, except when you bow down to him.

623
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,640
And that's the way you bow to Bob, is with your back to him.

624
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,980
And that conspiracy bitch can have her children, too!

625
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,660
Friends, the altar boy, Black, has been saved!

626
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,300
Saved! Saved! Saved!

627
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,520
Maybe we'll let him have his polka hat back one of these days.

628
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:58,560
Don't give it to Biggin' the Biggin'! Don't give it to Barry McGregor!

629
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:15,580
Mr. Trey!

630
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
Do you know me?

631
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,360
Have fun!

632
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,540
Praise Bob!

633
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,560
Praise Bob!

634
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,460
Praise Bob!

635
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,940
Oh yeah!

636
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,960
I'll destroy Bob afterwards!

637
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:40,380
Friends, that was Leeville.

638
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,860
And I'm going to spell that for you.

639
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
L-E-E-V-I-L

640
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,520
At the foundry.

641
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,400
In London.

642
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,500
The Second London Revival.

643
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,280
Oh, listen, you can hear the train going overhead.

644
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,220
We're sitting in the basement of the Fundbureau in Hamburg right now,

645
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,740
listening to the Avant Garde Orchestra.

646
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,280
Eh, friends, unfortunately, while the videos of Leeville are great,

647
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:13,320
because Leeville is great, the audio on those videos is not real good,

648
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,640
and so hopefully next week we will have some studio recordings of the great,

649
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,680
Leeville.

650
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:26,400
But now, let us hear this mix by Reverend Phineas Narco from the National Cynical Network.

651
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,340
I get like this funny feeling.

652
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,360
See?

653
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,840
I get like this funny feeling.

654
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,100
You think it's a blessing to know what God wants?

655
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,140
All I can think about is like...

656
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,580
He wants to push me over.

657
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,120
Trying to snuff it.

658
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,520
I'm a liar.

659
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,020
I just want to die peacefully.

660
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,740
A hypocrite.

661
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,500
Like with no pain.

662
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,220
A hypocrite.

663
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,180
I feel very miserable.

664
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,720
I'm afraid of everything.

665
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,360
Very much down in spirits.

666
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,940
I don't ever tell the truth. I don't have the courage.

667
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,600
I feel very low in myself.

668
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,740
And I'm afraid.

669
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,940
I can't see much in the future.

670
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,320
I don't steal, I don't fight, I don't kill.

671
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,680
And I feel that...

672
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,180
Not because I don't want to, but because I'm afraid.

673
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,920
And I feel that any second, something terrible is going to happen to me.

674
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,720
I'm afraid.

675
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,660
Something terrible is going to happen to me.

676
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Hi kids, I'm Casey Sausage-Casing.

677
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,700
Remember the 1990s when clinical depression and self-mutilation were all the rage?

678
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,360
Well now you can relive those self-deprecating golden years with K-Tel's new record offer entitled, I Suck.

679
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,380
That's the letter I and the word suck.

680
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,260
You'll get Bex, I'm a loser.

681
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,100
I'm a loser baby.

682
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,420
Radioheads, I'm a crook.

683
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,960
But I'm a freak.

684
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,540
Silver Shards, I'm a freak.

685
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,600
I'm a freak.

686
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:53,180
And you'll also get Living La Vida Loca and everything by the sales every week.

687
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,280
I'm a loser.

688
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,380
I'm a loser.

689
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,660
I'm a loser.

690
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,380
I'm a loser.

691
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:02,820
I'm a loser.

692
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,760
Kill me.

693
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,780
Kill me.

694
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,820
Kill me.

695
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,840
Kill me.

696
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,600
Kill me.

697
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:10,960
Kill me.

698
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:12,720
Kill me.

699
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:12,740
Kill me.

700
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,700

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,800
flattery

721
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Your

722
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,840
Myself

723
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,780
kill me

724
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,720
kill me

725
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,680
kill me

726
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,840
kill me

727
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,840
kill me

728
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,140
kill me

729
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,420
kill me

730
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,260
kill me

731
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,660
kill me

732
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,640
kill me

733
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,840
oh yes friends that was Phineas Narco

734
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,020
who mixed that part of

735
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,800
National Cynical Radio

736
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,000
you can get a lot more

737
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,740
at www.nationalcynical.com

738
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:11,820
at www.nationalcynical.com

739
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,400
Can you believe it?

740
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,880
This thing is still running.

741
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,260
The whole station is still running.

742
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,120
It's just amazing.

743
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,980
And look what we've done to it already.

744
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,120
We dragged it through the streets.

745
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,780
We drove it too fast.

746
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,020
We bumped it into things.

747
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,920
We got other shows all tangled up in it.

748
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,460
We hurt the show.

749
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,900
We embarrassed the show.

750
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,860
We shamed the show.

751
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,020
The show blushed.

752
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,560
The show blushed through the show.

753
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,460
We wrecked the show.

754
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,000
The show blushed and turned away.

755
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,040
And yet it is still here.

756
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,020
Oh, right.

757
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,660
That's the one thing you can say about it.

758
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,700
It may suck, but it's still here.

759
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,160
Enron?

760
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,220
No, they're gone.

761
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,220
Aren't they?

762
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,660
No, they live on in some other form.

763
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,920
There's another name.

764
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,820
There was some clever accounting there.

765
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,420
Enron will bubble up again.

766
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,660
It is like a...

767
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Well, anyway, the point is we're still here.

768
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,260
And we may suck, but by God,

769
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:10,980
you know, that's...

770
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,800
It's part of Bob's point.

771
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,260
We're still here.

772
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,580
Unfortunately, lots of other things

773
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,660
have sucked so much worse than us.

774
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,240
That's the most horrible part.

775
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,240
Think how bad we are.

776
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,520
Most of them are worse.

777
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:25,880
It's true.

778
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,920
It's true.

779
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,720
Face it.

780
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,840
As bad as this is,

781
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,220
it's worse on television.

782
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,620
Oh, you know?

783
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,620
Well, not for much longer.

784
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,540
I mean, after a while,

785
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,500
I'm sure you probably will be shaking the chair

786
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,480
when I'm setting it up.

787
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,460
But first,

788
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,660
but really,

789
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:44,780
but really,

790
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,400
you know,

791
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,260
you know,

792
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,540
deep down in your heart,

793
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,960
what I'm going to say next.

794
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,980
And that is praise Bob.

795
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,020
Praise Bob.

796
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,520
When in doubt, just praise Bob.

797
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,900
You don't even...

798
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,400
You just whip it out.

799
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,180
When you are faced with indecision in your life,

800
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,860
when you are at a turning point,

801
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,620
a crossroads in your life,

802
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,700
just unzip your pants,

803
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,380
pull it out,

804
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,280
and face Bob.

805
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
And say, praise Bob,

806
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,600
I'm going to go where Bob points me.

807
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,540
Spin around three times,

808
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,680
and head off in the direction you end up pointing.

809
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,760
And tuck it back in before you get to town.

810
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,240
And friends, if you are about to change the tunnel,

811
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,220
bear in mind...

812
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,520
Do it!

813
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,260
Bear in mind that you may have already heard too much,

814
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,960
and it may have got under your skin now.

815
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,420
And within the space of a couple of days,

816
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:34,940
you may still...

817
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,700
It's so subliminal.

818
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,500
Subliminal.

819
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:38,840
Subliminal.

820
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,380
Subliminal.

821
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,140
Subliminal.

822
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,700
It's not the words we're saying,

823
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,320
it's the silence between the words.

824
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,740
That's why we've made our music.

825
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,200
We have to really let it sink in.

826
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,220
That's right.

827
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:49,820
That's a message.

828
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,220
Those unheard frequencies.

829
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,440
You can't hear.

830
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,660
Yeah, you can't hear it.

831
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,580
But your dog is going wild right now.

832
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,700
He's doing backflips

833
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,660
because of some of the information we're imparting here.

834
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,000
Subliminal.

835
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,580
I want you to put your hands together for the Pope of all Northern England.

836
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,640
And if we're lucky, we'll get to see both the Popes of England jello wrestle later.

837
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,360
But I want you to put your hands together for the Pope of all Northern England,

838
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,460
the Pope Phil Monty.

839
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,380
Good evening, brothers and sisters, boys and girls, friends.

840
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,220
Hello, Uncle Monty!

841
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,280
Once again, I stand before you,

842
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,360
having said I will never stand before you on stage ever again.

843
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,560
Not to rant, but to testify.

844
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:54,780
I want to testify about something that Reverend Stang mentioned briefly.

845
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,940
One of Bob's tenets.

846
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,740
Repent! Quit your job!

847
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:00,800
Slack!

848
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,280
To put my testimony in context,

849
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,480
we have to go back about 12 years or so,

850
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,200
to two days before I left England to visit America

851
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,960
to attend my first ever subgenius revival,

852
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,980
which was in Chicago,

853
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,920
billed as the World Subgenius Convention.

854
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,880
Two days before I left,

855
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,880
my place of work,

856
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,500
which I hated,

857
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:30,980
which I hated,

858
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:30,980


859
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,400
which I hated intensely,

860
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,260
and I would have walked out at any moment for free,

861
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,100
gave me the opportunity to move to the other end of the country

862
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,480
for less money

863
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,280
or to leave with a large wad of cash in my hand.

864
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,200
Well, what did I do?

865
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,300
It was a no-brainer.

866
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,020
I put my faith in Bob,

867
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,540
and I quit my job.

868
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,520
Praise Bob!

869
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,580
Praise Bob!

870
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:54,640
Praise Bob!

871
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,400
About three years ago,

872
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,960
this is a three-step process,

873
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,580
by the way,

874
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,840
about three years ago,

875
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,840
not long after being made Pope of the North of England,

876
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,860
right here in this city,

877
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,220
I was doing all right in the job I had at the time.

878
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,580
I kind of enjoyed it.

879
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,700
I had plenty of money to buy all that false slack,

880
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,600
but I wasn't enjoying my hobby.

881
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,520
So I quit my hobby for Bob!

882
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,620
Praise Bob!

883
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,040
Praise Bob!

884
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,920
As a direct consequence of quitting,

885
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,060
quitting my hobby,

886
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,580
I was a little bit upset.

887
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,020
I thought, had I done the right thing?

888
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,920
A friend of mine organized a party to cheer me up.

889
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,820
At that party,

890
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,240
I met the lady who is now my fiancÃ©e.

891
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,300
Praise Bob!

892
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,380
Hail Connie!

893
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,060
Step three!

894
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,740
Three days ago,

895
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,940
I quit my job for Bob again

896
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,260
for a lot of money!

897
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,340
Praise Bob!

898
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,780
I quit my job twice for Bob and my hobby once!

899
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,160
Praise Bob!

900
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,440
Praise Bob!

901
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,860
Praise Bob!

902
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:09,520
Praise Bob!

903
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,940
And so I stand here before you,

904
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,280
funded by conspiracy money,

905
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,820
money obtained from the bowels of the conspiracy.

906
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,940
I worked for a bank, ladies and gentlemen.

907
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,460
Ooh!

908
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,020
Ooh!

909
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,880
They funded me to stand before you on stage,

910
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,440
drinking whiskey.

911
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,140
Ha ha ha!

912
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,860
Here in the holy city of Amsterdam,

913
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,880
which I'm disappointed to say

914
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,100
has been tidied up by the conspiracy.

915
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,620
They're wanting to close down those coffee shops out there.

916
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,640
Those coffee shops that we treat as holy shrines.

917
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,320
They're trying to ban space cake

918
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,620
and turn it into a hard drug

919
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,460
because there are too many idiots coming along

920
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,280
and eating five or six slices

921
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,620
thinking it's doing nothing to them.

922
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,260
And then,

923
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,180
and then they just end up face down in a canal somewhere.

924
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,160
They want,

925
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,540
they want to just tidy this place,

926
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,540
gentrify it.

927
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:03,960
Yeah!

928
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,380
They're tidying it up to get all the yuppies in.

929
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,660
They want to close down the squats.

930
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:09,960
Ooh!

931
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,100
I say,

932
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,220
one day there'll be no coffee shops here.

933
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,120
No places for these subgeniuses to come

934
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,500
and get a little bit of R&R.

935
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,100
They won't let us smoke our pipes.

936
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,560
But I tell you,

937
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,420
I give up my pipe

938
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,960
the day they tear it from my cold, dead hands!

939
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:31,920
Praise Bob!

940
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,640
Amen!

941
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,940
I'll see what else get on this stage

942
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,580
because I have nothing else to say.

943
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:37,200
Woo!

944
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,060
Praise the money!

945
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,260
Praise the money!

946
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,020
Do I hear a praise Bob?

947
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,120
Praise Bob!

948
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,020
Do I hear a praise Bob?

949
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,000
Praise Bob!

950
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,800
Do I hear a praise Bob?

951
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,360
Hallelujah!

952
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,000
Amen!

953
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,280
Praise Bob!

954
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:53,720
Hallelujah!

955
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:54,860
Amen!

956
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,740
Fuck Bob!

957
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,720
What the hell?

958
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,620
You know,

959
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,240
Fuck Bob!

960
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,520
Fuck Bob!

961
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,400
You think I'm just some sort of funny little altar boy or pope wearing this get up.

962
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,460
I came here to look funny tonight.

963
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,380
I came here to tell you some,

964
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,240
I came here to tell you some funny jokes

965
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,080
or to speak background noise in your own little pathetic lives.

966
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,620
But let me tell you something brothers and sisters,

967
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,840
I'm here to,

968
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,800
I came,

969
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,100
I've walked 10,000 miles

970
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,920
to come here to tell you about the man with the dots on his,

971
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,220
his face.

972
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,160
I've come here,

973
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:40,500
I've walked here 10,000 miles to tell you about Bob Dobbs and those of you who carry

974
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:48,280
on talking about your own pathetic lives and your own personal problems because that's

975
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,100
the most important thing in your lives.

976
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,940
I got news for you.

977
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,460
The conspiracy is about to issue you ID cards.

978
00:45:59,140 --> 00:45:59,900
I'm not going to lie to you.

979
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:06,780
The conspiracy is about to take away your individual freedoms.

980
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:15,500
The conspiracy has just made you the capital of cannabis in Europe,

981
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:19,740
taking away the trophy from even Amsterdam.

982
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,160
Do I hear a praise Bob?

983
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,740
Do I hear a praise capital of cannabis in Europe?

984
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,960
It is for us and nobody else.

985
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,800
It is for us and nobody else.

986
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,460
I don't give a shit about what anybody thinks about what kind of performance I escape,

987
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,500
what about people I talk to.

988
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,140
I just care about Bob.

989
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:53,320
I care about the slackness that I've given to my brothers and sisters.

990
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,540
I'm going to drip.

991
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,980
I drip with sweat.

992
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:02,580
But I don't give a shit because I care how Bob Dobbs and nobody else!

993
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:03,760
Hallelujah!

994
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,080
Do you hear a praise Bob?

995
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:05,960
Praise Bob!

996
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:06,420
Bob!

997
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:06,920
Bob!

998
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:07,300
Bob!

999
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:07,620
Bob!

1000
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:07,840
Bob!

1001
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,480
Bob!

1002
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,520
Bob!

1003
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:10,520


1004
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:10,520


1005
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:10,520


1006
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:10,520


1007
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,640
Bob, how are you?

1008
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:19,760
Bob.

1009
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,340
Bob!

1010
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:23,340


1011
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:23,340


1012
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:23,720
Help me.

1013
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,620
Help me some help probably come in at any.

1014
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:26,960
Bob, are you alright?

1015
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:26,960


1016
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:26,960


1017
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,480
Butthole Surfers are Chip Genius as well?

1018
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:40,620
Well, in the early 80s, we were doing a talk show in a station like this in Houston, Texas.

1019
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,580
I think Helpo Pugh was the host.

1020
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,320
And Gibby Haynes called up and said,

1021
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,260
Butthole Surfers says praise Bob, man.

1022
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,700
No one had heard of them then.

1023
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,020
They were just a garage band.

1024
00:47:53,020 --> 00:48:00,660
They had a little EP called Cowboy Bob, at which they sent us.

1025
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:09,940
I'm not very cool, so I never know whether these things are really supposed to be cool or not until much later.

1026
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:20,260
I don't even know this, but one of the record sleeves of the Butthole Surfers actually has art from Revelation X.

1027
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,000
That is...

1028
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:37,000
No, that is art by Paul Mavridis that was used in Revelation X and then resold to the Butthole Surfers for quite a bit more to use on their album cover.

1029
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,760
Yeah, the pencil in the ear.

1030
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:47,300
Yeah, that's a Paul Mavridis napkin design that we both ended up buying from him.

1031
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,020
But he gives it to the church very cheaply.

1032
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,180
We get Paul Mavridis art.

1033
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:53,580
Very, very cheap.

1034
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,520
About 25 cents an hour.

1035
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,860
It works out to him.

1036
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:58,860
That's what I got.

1037
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,800
Yep, that old Bob.

1038
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,440
Come to Bob.

1039
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,400
Abandon the conspiracy.

1040
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,940
You'll step up to big pain.

1041
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,580
Oh, yeah.

1042
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,740
That's what Bob said, anyway.

1043
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,680
Oh, we have a request here.

1044
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,100
You have to go ahead.

1045
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,600
Do I go to?

1046
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,820
Oh, sorry, a different record.

1047
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,440
Yeah, say something funny.

1048
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,000
I'll try and put on this other record.

1049
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:37,360
Bob did pay in Amsterdam for the first time ever.

1050
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:44,500
Yeah, the Amsterdam Revival actually made a profit after paying for the hall.

1051
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:48,960
We had a huge profit, 7,000 euro.

1052
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,000
So that each of the preachers got 10,000.

1053
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,000


1054
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,000


1055
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,000


1056
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:55,800
Yeah.

1057
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,700
No wait, no, not 10,000.

1058
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,140
1,000.

1059
00:49:59,160 --> 00:49:59,920
1,000.

1060
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,560
Yeah, 1 euro.

1061
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:06,280
And each of the 700,000 preachers was paid a euro.

1062
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,120
It's the first time in history we've made so much, each.

1063
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,600
So praise Bob, praise Bob.

1064
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,540
Souls to be unsaved.

1065
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,320
Souls to be unsaved.

1066
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,000
Yearning for Damn.

1067
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,100
Souls to be unsaved all over Holland, all over Newport, this whole big, beautiful world.

1068
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,000
Bob has been, allows to continue, stop like a little kid.

1069
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,000


1070
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,160

Praise Bob!

1091
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,040
There is two orders of business before we have to leave tonight.

1092
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,600
And the first order of business is we have to pass the bucket of love.

1093
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,880
Can everyone on the stage pass me the bucket of love please?

1094
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,500
What is the bucket of love?

1095
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,960
Where is the bucket of love?

1096
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:37,220
Here.

1097
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,980
What kind of love is that?

1098
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,100
Ladies and gentlemen, you got in here for free tonight.

1099
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:45,660
Yes!

1100
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,460
But you have to pay to get out.

1101
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:53,840
And that's why we have what we call the bucket of love.

1102
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,160
Now I want you to dig deep in your pockets.

1103
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:04,020
And I want, yeah, yeah, yeah, I want you to dig deep in your pockets.

1104
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,360
Pass around, pass around the bucket of love, brother.

1105
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:10,760
Pass around the bucket of love and give till it bleeds.

1106
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,180
Till it bleeds, friends, till it bleeds.

1107
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,700
And I think we got 24 pounds that night.

1108
