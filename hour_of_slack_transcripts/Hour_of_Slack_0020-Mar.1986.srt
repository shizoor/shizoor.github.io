1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Batman, wherever they go, will remember the Alamo.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,100
Remember the Alamo.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,020
You know, I think I saw one of those things once.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,680
The UFOs.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,040
I mean, it was really, it was kind of scary.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,320
It's all these fucking colored lights and sounds.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,720
I mean, sounds and lights like I ain't never heard before.

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,520
How did I, how did I, how did I?

9
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,240
He's a maniac.

10
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,240
He's a maniac.

11
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,960
He's a maniac.

12
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:16,620
Bob.

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,380
But let's leave things of this world behind

14
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,960
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,300
from the Church of the Sub-G.

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,700
Genius.

17
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,200
Release your hold on this tenuous practical joke they call reality.

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,420
Let your body be sucked out of your ears,

19
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,520
for we're going to take you deep, deep inside yourself

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,080
to the place of silence in the noise.

21
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,800
We're going deeper, deeper into your consciousness,

22
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,800
down past the membranes of the fabric of your very mind.

23
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,960
We bore down into the cranium,

24
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,620
drilling through the irrelevant memories of job and normality,

25
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,300
piercing the squamous epithelium,

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,960
the pesudas rolling around in the hollowed-out inside of the skull,

27
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,860
scraping along the edges of the birth canal

28
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,060
and stretching the imagination gland until it pops.

29
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,500
Now, let all your thoughts drain out through the brain pan,

30
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,340
tumble down through the sinuses,

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,620
slide down the esophagus,

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,320
and finally, let them plunge to the base of the soul itself,

33
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,220
located in the lowest organ of your body, the foot gland.

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,920
And finally, an idea.

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,680
A key.

36
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,740
An ultimate plan is born at the very bottom of your mind.

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,320
And it is Bob.

38
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,800
Wake up, puppet boy!

39
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,600
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,560
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,060
I have Bob's luggage!

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,420
No trouble.

43
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,960
Just get set and get going.

44
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,460
A-Him.

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,120
Recording.

46
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,440
Everything's going fine.

47
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,360
No trouble.

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,160
Welcome, potential initiates,

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,200
and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,320
Bob?

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,380
Bob?

52
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:13,740
Bob?

53
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,900
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

54
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,500
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

55
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,300
What is it?

56
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,300


57
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,300


58
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,300


59
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,300


60
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,300


61
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,920
What about sweat?

62
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,160
That's your key phrase.

63
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,400
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

64
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,080
Hear the watch in front of us blurs and distorts time.

65
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,840
Soon we will be deep in a hypnotic trance.

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,260
What wonders will we see?

67
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:53,080
Hey kids, get some money out of your pants' pockets and send it to Bob.

68
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,100
Here!

69
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,400
Pull it to level.

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,040
And you go.

71
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,620
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Hour of Slack.

72
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,620
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,740
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

74
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,580
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

75
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,420
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius,

76
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,800
with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

77
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,040
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

78
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,960
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

79
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,980
living avatar of Slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,560
You have to love Bob.

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:54,560


82
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,660
He loves you, but you love Bob.

83
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,020
You have to.

84
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,780
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

85
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,780
He'll kill you.

86
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,560
He'll bob you out.

87
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,060
He'll bob you out, folks.

88
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,900
You heard it here first.

89
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,220
If you don't love Bob, he'll bob you out, man.

90
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,400
All right.

91
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,700
Bob loves you.

92
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,140
Bob loves you.

93
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:20,700
Bob loves you.

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,540
This is KNON 94.1.

95
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:24,540


96
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,840
FM.

97
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,280
In Dallas, Texas.

98
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,640
See your first yelled, sir.

99
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,460
Like the morpher flies in a plane and hits the moon.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,980
The cosmic slug has sold the colors of birds and is seared by the restrained earth.

101
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,740
Truth revealed over the air by the doctors of precision.

102
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,580
Oh, yes, dear friends.

103
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,540
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

104
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,200
With Pastor Bucknack, it's expected any minute now.

105
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,960
And this one is our Slack number 20.

106
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,520
The life after death and quantum mechanics show.

107
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,400
And you can turn to page 17 in your subgenius church radio syllabus and we can begin the lesson.

108
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,000
Now, my friends, my old buddy God was a weird cat.

109
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,360
He really was.

110
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,240
He was into everything.

111
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,400
He used to make universes.

112
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,540
Um.

113
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,120
Cranked out quite a number of them years ago.

114
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,060
And supposedly he's still at it.

115
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,880
I don't know if it was really an infinite number of universes.

116
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,440
I mean, you got to stop somewhere.

117
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,420
But, oh, God, he had this deal where you go from one universe to another every time you died.

118
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:50,520
They start you off in the before life, which was sort of like eternal paradise to kind of get you off on the right foot.

119
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,740
And then all of a sudden you'd lose your memory and get born here on Earth.

120
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,040
And then when you got old and died, you'd pass on to the etheric universe next door.

121
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,320
And why, after you died there, you'd be born into the angelic universe.

122
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,940
So once there, friend, you'd find out there were dozens and dozens of them, each one better than the last.

123
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,620
In fact, each one incomprehensibly better than the last.

124
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,500
And as long as you didn't screw up too bad, you could keep on traveling up through the earth.

125
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,020
And the universe is getting ever closer to the bob head.

126
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:33,340
But right when you thought the next level would be the last and the ultimate peak experience of eternal slackness, friends,

127
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:42,040
why, instead, right then, you'd get reborn on Earth with your memory wiped out again just a few years after you died there the last time.

128
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,420
And you'd have to start all over again.

129
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,940
And that's how it all keeps going on infinitely.

130
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,200
Friends, you know.

131
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,760
Sooner or later, you run out of infinity.

132
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,240
Even infinity.

133
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,440
But see, here's the thing.

134
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,400
Usually these facts are never announced in this universe, friends.

135
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,760
And we do it on this show where we know it won't be believed.

136
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:17,780
But see, if you die bad, friend, or if you're a messed up person, you might leave behind a part of your soul, the lower soul, or what we call the nental eye.

137
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,480
And that becomes a poultry.

138
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:20,640
That becomes one of your traits.

139
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:20,640


140
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:20,640


141
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,020
And that becomes a whole other guy's friend.

142
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,520
Or a wandering shade.

143
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:34,040
An earth-bound spirit doomed to roam the earth, pathetically repeating its sad loop of behavior that made it split from the higher soul in the first place.

144
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,660
Can you imagine a ghost trying to buy a pack of cigarettes for eternity, friends?

145
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,960
Now, in light of that, Buck and I have an admission to make.

146
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:52,240
Uh, for many shows now, we've been blaming the station's equipment for our missed cues and wobbly stereo and so forth.

147
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,160
And, friend, the equipment in this station is perfectly good.

148
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:04,800
It's partly that we dare to be stupid, but it's also largely to blame, friends, on the show poltergeist, the station poltergeist.

149
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,320
For this is a haunted radio airspace we occupy, friends.

150
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,880
Yes, and we did a little research at City Hall, and it turns out that this frequency at this time on Sunday nights,

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,220
on an old station long before K and O-N, there was a crazy old preacher DJ that had this time slot,

152
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,900
and he died while on the air speaking, my friends, through this very microphone.

153
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,420
His name was Reverend Mathers Williams, and apparently he does not rest easy

154
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:39,300
because, friend, he jealously haunts this time slot trying to get his show back from us.

155
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,960
So when you hear that spooky static and all those rattles and squeaks,

156
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,940
and when we sound like we don't even know how to run the phones right, well, friends, you know what's behind it all now.

157
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,220
And maybe we can get it to materialize and say something creative on the show.

158
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:04,600
So it's going to be, if you're going to call in tonight, friends, call in about ghost sightings or UFOs, no jokes, real experiences only.

159
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,240
Pastor Necky, do you have anything to add as we go into the...

160
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,080
The show?

161
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,120
Hi, girls.

162
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,320
Oh, yes, dear friends.

163
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,160
It's time for the harvest.

164
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:32,360
And, friends, speaking of the harvest, ACORN, the community organization working for a just society,

165
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,700
is having a benefit concert at Tahiti's on Lower Greenville.

166
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,640
That's on Monday, March 3rd from 9 to 11.

167
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,500
Tickets are three bucks at the door.

168
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,960
Come on out and have a great time.

169
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,240
Listen to the music of No Parking.

170
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,320
And help ACORN work for a better society for everyone.

171
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,080
Oh, yes, friends.

172
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:01,920
And if we can watch out for that scary old haunted preacher, we'll be proceeding with our hideous show.

173
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,220
They're here.

174
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,040
Important to tell the folks out there that we're all actually...

175
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,760
We're actually here and operating now.

176
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,820
Those were just simulacra of us that were on before.

177
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,200
Etheric doubles made out of the black ether by green energy.

178
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,240
Created by the simrac...

179
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,540
I can't even say it.

180
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,560
Sim-lac-rim-al-van.

181
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,280
Gland.

182
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:23,780
Gland.

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,440
They brought us here in a van.

184
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,580
Yeah, you know, they're going to take us back in one, too.

185
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,220
Wasn't he that astronaut who disappeared a couple years ago?

186
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,560
Yeah, he was.

187
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,540
And, well, they found parts of his body across the entire galaxy.

188
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,020
In fact, last time...

189
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,120
Last time I was out there, I saw one of his fingers go by.

190
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,680
But they never proved that it was him.

191
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,260
Well, I know it.

192
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,000
I know it was him.

193
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,280
He was one of those split-universe theorists, wasn't he?

194
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,780
Well, he was well-split after he was cleft in two by a charging spar liner.

195
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,520
Whoa!

196
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:56,960
Whoa!

197
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,080
Whoa!

198
00:11:59,700 --> 00:11:59,740
Whoa!

199
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,300
Whoa!

200
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,560
What is fact, and what is apparition?

201
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,760
In an English garden, a ghostly maiden appears.

202
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,060
She's trying to recapture some lost time of her past life.

203
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,700
They're here.

204
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,540
The determination as to whether your home is haunted is not very easy.

205
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:30,540
What I meant to say was it might very well be a poltergeist intrusion instead of a classic haunting.

206
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,440
What's the difference?

207
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,200
Poltergeist.

208
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,780
Are usually associated...

209
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,680
with an individual.

210
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,380
Hauntings seem to be connected with an area.

211
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,060
A house, usually.

212
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,180
Poltergeist disturbances are a fairly short duration.

213
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,100
Perhaps a couple of months.

214
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,960
Hauntings can go on for years.

215
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,240
This is the ghost of a young man who has been starved to death in a cage.

216
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,400
Anne, what do you see out in the vast realm of the night?

217
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,220
What terror does the night hold for you?

218
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,020
What monstrous...

219
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,600
What monstrous vision might be awaiting for you?

220
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,060
Beyond life.

221
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,280
Beyond the grave.

222
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,680
Beyond the realm of death.

223
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,760
She went through my soul.

224
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,200
Well, I'm fascinated by death itself.

225
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,560
What happens as we die, when we die, what happens after we die.

226
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,200
You mean life after death?

227
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,180
Yes.

228
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,160
Is there?

229
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,320
Yes, I think there is.

230
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,020
If I'm correct, the life force is conserved always and in all things, even after death.

231
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,020


232
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,020


233
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,200
And you think that applies to what's happened here tonight?

234
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:42,940
Yes.

235
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,480
Yes, I do.

236
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:56,280
I think that girl, creature, drained energy, life force, partially from Bukowski and totally from the guard.

237
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,860
That girl was no girl.

238
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,300
She's totally alien to this planet and our life form.

239
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,860
And totally dangerous.

240
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,700
There is no such a thing called death.

241
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,580
It's just a transformation.

242
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,260
The boy George Ronald and Queen Elizabeth.

243
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,320
All go from station to station.

244
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,080
Disonner.

245
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,440
There is no end.

246
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:56,220
They are looking for them again.

247
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,880
And so they send this

248
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:58,940
And it's enough.

249
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:58,940


250
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,060
You see my land.

251
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,060


252
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,060


253
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,700
It's not an masochism.

254
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,380
You're a little chatty.

255
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:14,680
Don't be blue when we lay down

256
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,220
Receiving life's crown

257
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,660
Open your eyes right now

258
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,880
Oh, please be nice anyhow

259
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,980
It's gonna be no end for me

260
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,960
You fight with others just because you want them

261
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,500
Accumulating rubbish inside yourself

262
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,140
And you have to throw it out

263
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,300
Yes, you have to throw it out

264
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,260
Human relationships are just so-so today

265
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,220
It's not too deep and darkness stares in our way

266
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,040
How about the night?

267
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,180
I'm finished with the night

268
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,340
The night

269
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,760
The night

270
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,360
The night

271
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:08,360


272
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,420
The night

273
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:12,420


274
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,580
There is no end

275
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,160
Always goes on

276
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,860
Take my hand

277
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,620
And then we go the way

278
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,420
Decide if you need or if you're wasted

279
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,520
See what you said

280
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,080
Come on

281
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

282
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,880
Our religions love to fight with one another

283
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,120
But yet because we have the same father and mother

284
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,200
We should not act so strange

285
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,100
So we have to do the change

286
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,180
And our children live in danger and in sorrow

287
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,060
Who knows if they're not ready or asked to fight tomorrow

288
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,320
Which is the thing that's strange

289
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,180
So we have to do the change

290
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,060
Change

291
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,360
We have to do the change

292
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,100
We have to do the change

293
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,300
We have to do the change

294
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,280
The change

295
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,960
When we don't wake up now, who knows if we wake up at all?

296
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,740
We are so important and I wish we would not fall

297
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,580
In downward Babylon, where is everybody gone?

298
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:03,120
It's true, ho-la-la-la-dee, to be blue, ho-la-la-la-dee

299
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,520
When we lay down, receiving life's crown

300
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:18,920
And then we go the way, deciding if you leave or if you waste it

301
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,680
So what you say?

302
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,240
Come on!

303
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,920
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

304
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,380
They're here!

305
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,800
They're here, friends!

306
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,100
And we're gonna try to get them to come back

307
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,360
And get the good Cleve Duncan on the phone lines here

308
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,320
If he's still hanging in

309
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,960
Uh, let's see

310
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,000
Uh, and Cleve?

311
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:44,800
No!

312
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,900
I hear the mighty Cleve Duncan coming through all the way from Florida

313
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,800
I can barely hear you coming through there, River and Stang

314
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,000
But I know that it's powering its way right across

315
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,600
Right across that deep south line

316
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,480
And just...

317
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,080
And just...

318
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,400
Hammering it right away in here

319
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
Huh! Praise Bob!

320
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:05,880
Yeah!

321
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,100
Well...

322
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,340
It's a beautiful, beautiful thing, I tell you, yes indeed

323
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,740
Uh, friends, for those of you who don't instantly recognize the household name of Reverend Cleve Donut Duncan

324
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:22,780
This is... this is he, Reverend Cleve, who also, besides being a top subgenius, ranter, uh, and prancer

325
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,420
Is, uh, also the keyboardist for that great, mighty band, the Del Fuegos

326
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,160
As well as one of the founding members of the fabulous Billy Goons

327
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,480
Ah!

328
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,780
Indeed, ah!

329
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,380
So, Cleve, how is your role as roving emissionary for Bob Dobbs treating you?

330
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,160
Oh, it's coming along quite well, actually

331
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,300
It's, uh...

332
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,160
Well, it's coming like a well

333
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,320
It's the best, that's the best part

334
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,180
Oh, it...

335
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,740
Cleve has only one thing on his mind, and that's...

336
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:54,960
Cleve

337
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,220
The mighty preaching tool of the preacher

338
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,360
The tongue

339
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,100
Just being a roving emissionary, you know?

340
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,280
Well, uh...

341
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,960
Coming down, coming down...

342
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,060
Coming down, coming down...

343
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,720
Coming down, coming down...

344
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,000
Coming down, coming down...

345
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,240
Coming down, coming down...

346
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,300
Coming down, coming down...

347
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,300


348
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,300


349
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,300


350
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,740
Dr. Duncan, you have called it an unusual show

351
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,800
In that we've got a video crew here trying vainly to tape the show

352
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,560
So that our radio listeners can see it

353
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,620
But since most of them don't have picture tubes attached to their radios

354
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,580
Why, they're gonna be plumb out of luck

355
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,800
People think I'm kidding, but we really are being videotaped tonight

356
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,020
It's, uh, you know, nothing's more boring than to watch a radio show

357
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,840
Well, if they can just dream

358
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,060
Dream of the concerto

359
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,920
If they can sleep

360
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,180
When medal eyes look aturance

361
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,620
And memory knows 저 Pee

362
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,640
Well, that may look silly

363
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,500
But I hear a vehicle

364
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:56,740
It beats itself right

365
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,800
Oh, and so I have to get down

366
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:58,800


367
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:58,800


368
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:58,800


369
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:58,800


370
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:58,800


371
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,300
Well so, you just crossed just inside my house

372
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,340
that there just seems to be news all the time about Alex.

373
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,180
You mean you can't get Dr. Gene Scott?

374
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,220
You can't get the subgenius TV ministry hour of Slack?

375
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,320
No, it's not coming through here.

376
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,940
I hear that they showed that a little further south down around Daytona,

377
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,720
but right now it's more like the Wreck-A-Pum-Pum show that's on.

378
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,720
Well, I'm afraid it's a passive resistance.

379
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,460
It ain't going to be enough in Gainesville.

380
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,360
What are you doing in Gainesville, Florida, anyway?

381
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,140
Playing rock and roll.

382
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,860
And trying to convert the groupies for Bob.

383
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,000
Ah, yes, yes.

384
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,360
Actually, today is our first day off in about ten days,

385
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,380
and tomorrow night we play.

386
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,300
Tonight we've been just sort of roving around and worshiping.

387
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,940
Actually, you know, I have discovered a new delicacy through my tours

388
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,400
through the deep south here.

389
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,120
Uh-huh.

390
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,220
I have discovered aces high.

391
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,800
Wine.

392
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,020
Ace?

393
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,740
Well, Dr. Duncan, if you would just send your report on this new wine discovery in.

394
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,260
Aces high wine, huh?

395
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,040
Well, I tell you, you know, it reminds me of Cod's because once you drink a bottle,

396
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,780
you want to play poker in the rear and have liquor in the front.

397
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,240
Well, and on that note, dear friends, we'll have to close off with Cleve Duncan,

398
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,520
that terrible, nasty, mean man.

399
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,880
I'm sure none of you know what the heck he's talking about.

400
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,340
I don't know.

401
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:29,340


402
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:29,340


403
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:29,340


404
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:29,340


405
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,520
I certainly hope not because I do, and it's bad.

406
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,720
Well, praise Bob, Cleve.

407
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,600
You know, sometimes the spirit is willing.

408
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,260
But the.

409
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,020
That's about it.

410
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,100
Okay, well, praise Bob.

411
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:54,220
Well, Cleve, we're going to go now to Pastor Naked's amazing lecture on the before life

412
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,660
because we're doing a life after death show here,

413
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,360
and although you're.

414
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:58,760
Uh-huh.

415
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,320
Uh-huh.

416
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,320


417
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,320


418
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,320


419
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,320


420
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,320


421
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,320


422
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,320


423
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,320


424
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,320


425
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,320


426
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,780
Perfect example of the living dead.

427
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:08,360
I'm sure we better stick to the subject and head out and push you out the door of the airwaves.

428
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,260
Reverend saying the one final thing.

429
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:19,100
Anyone that wants to bring any donations, March 14th, I will be in the fine, fine city of Dallas, Texas.

430
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,760
Oh, March 14th, the Del Flegos.

431
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,300
All right.

432
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,000
Playing at, I don't know, someplace or other.

433
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,540
The Ritz.

434
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,440
Whatever that is.

435
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,700
They're tricking you, boy.

436
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,080
There ain't no Ritz around here.

437
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,260
That's where David Crosby got his Waterloo.

438
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,160
Oh, really?

439
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,780
Well, I guess.

440
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,020
That's right.

441
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,020
The historic site.

442
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:36,840
All right.

443
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,600
Well, in the meantime, let's have some slack, Cleve.

444
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,560
All right.

445
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,700
And praise Bob.

446
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,060
Help me, somebody.

447
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:51,820
Friends, this is Pastor Naked's to continue the life after death series because there is one,

448
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,040
but it ain't what you're expecting, folks.

449
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,240
This is Pastor Naked's facts about the before life.

450
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,580
Facts about the before life.

451
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,540
Facts about the before life.

452
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,500
Subgenius rebirth.

453
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,220
You were, will be there.

454
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:15,020
Intense anti-scrutiny of the Gnu Gnarnesis or the subgenius book of the living dead has

455
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,780
been underway for the past 12 years.

456
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,920
Church doctors in the Dobstown vaults have nearly completed their translation of this

457
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,140
most holy book in the Yeti Vita trilogy.

458
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,680
These self-same doctors, the Gnu Gnarnesis, have been under the subgenius book for the

459
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:28,680


460
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:28,680


461
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,360
last 12 years.

462
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,880
Inform us that many passages of this work are directly attributable to the brave and

463
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,760
enlightened Atlanteans.

464
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:43,020
Long time subscribers to the Stark Fist will recall our last report on this uber sacred

465
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,380
tomb tome about six years ago, number 22, volume 17.

466
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:54,420
We published Partying After Death by Dr. Siddhartha Niikatharsis.

467
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,280
As you knew, will know.

468
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,420
Subgenius souls, or nental essences, are volatile, brightly colored, and usually very

469
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,400
fast when they care to be.

470
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,940
They go where they want and are hard for others to control.

471
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,340
Souls of normals, however, are bland-looking pill-like beings.

472
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:24,540
Although in life, subs and norms are almost indistinguishable, after death this is a hard

473
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,360
mistake to make.

474
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,260
When it's a matter of time, you will know.

475
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:27,260


476
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:32,320
When a subgenius dies, the nental essence bursts from its meek prison.

477
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,320
Its massless seed careens in a pan-galactic journey, lasting but a moment of our time.

478
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,440
It usually returns once to make sure it's really dead before moving on to the before-life.

479
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:53,080
Due to a 10,000 year disinformation campaign by the Khan, a jaded stereotype of heaven

480
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,680
and hell is being pushed by the false churches.

481
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,160
In fact, there is little difference between the two.

482
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,220
Subgenii often commute between heaven and hell.

483
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,960
Interestingly, heaven is hotter than hell.

484
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,820
The seven suns which heat heaven make it many times hotter than the molten gaseous temperature

485
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,020
thresholds of brimstone.

486
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,060
When a subgenius decides to live again, he or she is not alone.

487
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,440
Each subgenius has a nental-life twin on the media plane.

488
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,240
Subgenius is a subgenius.

489
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,240


490
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,240


491
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,240


492
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,460
This is a revelation of the power of the subgenius.

493
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,980
Subgenius spiritual mastery is not maintained without struggle.

494
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,080
The subgenius must be vigilant and must hone his abnormality.

495
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,700
He must tithe the church.

496
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:53,880
Otherwise the nental essence loses its spark and the subgenius degenerates and dies normal.

497
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,240
This is a death worse than death.

498
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,240


499
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,240


500
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:06,180
When a normal dies, it exhausts all of its puny strength in a vain effort to hover near

501
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,380
the body it squandered.

502
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,580
A pale, shell-like entity soon is carried away by wind or other forces.

503
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,080
Being lighter than air, the pink, although they may be bland versions of other colors,

504
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,980
the pink soul drifts aimlessly.

505
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,240
Although pinkster souls are not as strong as the subgenius, they are as strong as the

506
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,240


507
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,240


508
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,760
nental souls, also known as plugs, due to tend to cluster.

509
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:38,840
The plugs are gathered up by cosmic agents, usually representing Jehovah One, who has

510
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,640
the largest franchise in this era.

511
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,480
The plugs are sprinkled into vats.

512
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,280
The vats have an energy source which melts the plug shells, making them bond together.

513
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,780
As new plugs continue to collect above, the normed souls' shapes and colors blend until

514
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,100
they resemble a lumpy stew.

515
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,820
Ultimately, the plugs form a clear slurry which drains from the vat.

516
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:09,600
This plasma can be used to form new souls, souls who have a chance to become new subgenia.

517
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:16,640
However, the plasma is also formed during sex, and the slurplugs is often sold as a

518
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,080
spaceship fuel additive.

519
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,280
These hedgemen are known to have been styled in such a vat by agents for their master.

520
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,080
The netherworld is a place where the netherworld is a place where the netherworld is a place

521
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,060
where the netherworld is a place where the netherworld is a place where the netherworld

522
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,060


523
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:33,700
The vats themselves are said to be relics left by the Elder Gods, forged for unguessed

524
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,220
motives.

525
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,980
Thus, normals cannot be said to have led past lives.

526
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,480
It was just...normal.

527
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:56,920
I'm Pastor Bucknaken, you can write to me at Post Office Box 140026 Dallas, Texas 75214.

528
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,060
I don't know you.

529
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,060


530
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,060


531
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,900
Send a dollar and I'll send you a package of wild stuff and my candy line.

532
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:57,060
I'll send you a package of wild stuff and my candy line.

533
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,520
Patterns unfamiliar, patterns leading through.

534
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,960
Two patterns of discovery, tracing out the clue.

535
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:16,320
Can you recognize the patterns that you find stuck in your mind?

536
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,900
In this land where stop and empty is hard.

537
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,420
Too far, you can rearrange the patterns so unkind.

538
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,140
Don't bother asking why, a pattern never dries.

539
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:48,580
The patterns never die, they just go on and on.

540
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:13,760
Patterns multiply, redirect our view.

541
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,040
Endless variations make it all seem new.

542
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,240
Can you recognize the patterns that you find?

543
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,540
Patterns unfamiliar, patterns leading through.

544
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:26,540


545
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:26,540


546
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,060
Can you recognize the patterns that you find stuck in your mind?

547
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,060


548
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,060


549
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:38,120
In this land where stop and empty is hard.

550
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:44,500
Too far, you can rearrange the patterns so unkind.

551
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:53,240
Don't bother asking why, a pattern never dries.

552
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,060
The patterns never die, they just go on and on.

553
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,760
The patterns never die, they just go on and on.

554
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:12,420
The patterns never die, they just go on and on.

555
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,420
Different advocacies.

556
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,480
People pass on them.

557
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:18,800
People accept each other.

558
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,260
People accept each other.

559
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,500
They are highly respected.

560
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:21,500


561
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,140
Elegant.

562
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,300
Perfect for the nation.

563
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,300


564
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,300


565
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,300


566
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,480
They're not masters.

567
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,480


568
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,480
This is for Subgeneuves Radio Ministry.

569
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,040
Your causes are what I told you before.

570
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,040


571
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,040


572
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,040


573
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,040


574
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,040


575
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,040


576
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,060
on KNON 9049 and the left excess.

577
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,280
Praise Bob.

578
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,440
They're here.

579
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,180
Some people believe that when people die,

580
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,440
there's a wonderful light,

581
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,200
as bright as the sun,

582
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,740
but it doesn't hurt to look into it.

583
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,020
All the answers to all the questions

584
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,800
that you ever want to know are inside that light.

585
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,580
And when you walk to it,

586
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,120
you become a part of it forever.

587
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,040
And then some people die,

588
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,500
but they don't know that they've gone.

589
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,240
They think they're still alive?

590
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,420
Yes.

591
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,500
Maybe they didn't want to die.

592
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,500
Maybe they weren't ready.

593
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,280
Maybe they hadn't lived fully yet,

594
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,360
or they'd lived a long, long time,

595
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:24,780
but they still...

596
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,040
they still wanted more life.

597
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,800
They resist going into that light,

598
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,740
however hard the light wants them.

599
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,060
They just...

600
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,240
they just hang around,

601
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,600
watch TV,

602
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,840
watch their friends grow up,

603
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,560
feeling unhappy and jealous,

604
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,940
and those feelings are bad.

605
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,160
They hurt.

606
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,960
And then...

607
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,780
and then...

608
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:54,780


609
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:54,780


610
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,020
some people...

611
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,140
just get lost on the way to the light.

612
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,780
And they need someone to guide them to it.

613
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,280
So, you know, I could talk about quantum mechanics.

614
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,880
I don't know if there's anybody in the audience

615
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,160
that's into quantum mechanics.

616
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,100
He was the best quantum mechanic in this old galaxy.

617
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,300
He could take a spaceship and strip it down

618
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,780
to its component parts within a few minutes.

619
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:24,780


620
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,840
in 27 milliseconds.

621
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,920
That's right, and you couldn't tell when he was doing it.

622
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,760
It was either there or it wasn't there.

623
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,560
And that's something I just don't understand.

624
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,280
How can it either be there or not there?

625
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,780
Why isn't there any in between?

626
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,600
Well, that's what we call escaping

627
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,100
from those Newtonian laws, Doctor.

628
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,040
Yes, escape velocity.

629
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,080
Is that what you're implying?

630
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,860
You can escape velocity, but not the need for veracity.

631
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,940
Look, if you're both a particle and a wave,

632
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,680
you're exhibiting a certain particle,

633
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,040
particulate-like behavior.

634
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,500
That behavior can be measured.

635
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,500
You're gonna collapse the wave function

636
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,760
into the wave implement.

637
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,440
Well, with that kind of wave front,

638
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,900
you suffer from the need to employ such a mechanism

639
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,740
in figuring things out in a two-dimensional type of scheme.

640
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,540
Maybe the listener knows about this.

641
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,060
Oh, those little glistening listeners

642
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,160
would never understand,

643
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,120
but what's that sound like, heavy breathing?

644
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,880
There's a lot of power.

645
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,940
It's a small room, but there's a...

646
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,860
There's something that sounds like a huge beast

647
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,340
drawing its scaly...

648
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,480
...coils along a stone floor in here.

649
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,900
Oh, I'm sure it's not Mimiko.

650
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,460
Oh, maybe it is Mimiko.

651
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,400
It's Mimiko's theme song.

652
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,340
Mimiko is the tiny monster,

653
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,080
not the giant dragon that causes such unseemly smells

654
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,120
and body sounds.

655
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,000
Her power equals the witness of others' times

656
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,460
their own number hundred.

657
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,180
Power, like any other dream, is both the act and the end.

658
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,360
Power like thousands of hydrogen bombs, eh, Doctor?

659
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,500
I'm the devil, Mr. Driscoll.

660
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,020
Yes, but no trigger.

661
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,460
No or no Roy Rogers, simply a stuffed effigy.

662
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,000
Lift that tail.

663
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,480
Bob.

664
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,200
But let's leave things of this world behind

665
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,900
and walk now down the path of Bob

666
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,980
for this brief minute of slack

667
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,720
from the Church of the Subgenius.

668
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,820
Bob is coming, friend, and you can take that literally,

669
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,920
because death for a subgenius hero

670
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,220
is merely a transfer over to the pleasure dimensions.

671
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,480
Now, unfortunately, many of us are not able to do that, but...

672
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,840
there's no water in Hell, friends.

673
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,940
There's fire!

674
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,360
And you can't get a drink, and you can't put out that fire.

675
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,480
And you have many, many lives in Hell.

676
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,980
It's reincarnation, just like here on Earth,

677
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,320
because Earth, you know, is just the top floor of Hell.

678
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,060
That's right!

679
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,800
You're in Hell right now!

680
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,040
You're in Hell now!

681
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,760
Of course, this is the part of Hell where you don't even know you're in Hell,

682
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,440
and when the demons mention it, you think they're kidding.

683
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,360
Oh, you'll find out.

684
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,460
Hell is the way of the universe, and you can find that out

685
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,460


686
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,460


687
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,460


688
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,460


689
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,460


690
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,460


691
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,460


692
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,460


693
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,460


694
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,160
because Hell is real!

695
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,760
And there's no water down there, friend.

696
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,780
They don't even have rock and roll in some parts of Hell.

697
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,020
And you can never win.

698
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,300
It's like a computer.

699
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,520
By definition, it cannot lose.

700
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,840
You can score real high, but sooner or later, it's gonna get you,

701
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,140
because they creep up on you, and that's the way it is here on Earth.

702
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,040
They creep up on you and try to get you all mixed up about Heaven and Hell.

703
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,940
Bob is coming, my friend, but when he's finished with that,

704
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,200
he's gonna be mad.

705
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,900
Let there be slack.

706
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,040
Lift that tail.

707
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:31,940
Perhaps it would be good to get a reading from Level 7, you know.

708
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,060
They need to know what's happening up here.

709
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,680
Down on Level 7, they think they've got the best type of facilities

710
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,040
and the best type of storage.

711
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,920
What is it really like down on that seventh level?

712
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,100
Well, in terms of the psychology, it's quite a simple case.

713
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,180
There's a neurotic aggression of childhood brought on by the stress of new conditions.

714
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,440
Yes, yes, yes.

715
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,380
That's all very interesting, but what's the gut feeling of being down there?

716
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,820
Well, I suppose it's just as well.

717
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,320
We all feel the same way that X-117 feels.

718
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,760
The storyteller.

719
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,380
Yes, he was the dark raven that courses in the blood,

720
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,620
the mysterious magnetic neon Indian who sometimes appears

721
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,820
above the milky cactus-studded landscape of the far west,

722
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,160
home of the grotesquely descended chukawalla, the piccolillo cactus,

723
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,500
and the starkly staring yuccapole.

724
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,220
Triceratops, magatherium.

725
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,460
I think I'll have a wiener right now.

726
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,460
Delicious, if you skin them first.

727
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,100
Tell us what the theme of tonight's show is.

728
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,500
Doctors still don't know.

729
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:43,100
The show that dare not even form out of a nebulous cloud of matter.

730
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,980
That's right. It's merely words now.

731
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,920
What was the resistance in freezing the taste?

732
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,320
Or we're talking or we're not talking.

733
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,180
Either you're listening or you're not listening.

734
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,500
There's no in-between.

735
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,320
There's no kind of...

736
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,420
Then after dark, the entire sky seemed alive with strange flying lights

737
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,840
that darted to and fro, performing impossible aerial maneuvers

738
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,380
with grace, speed, and ease.

739
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,100
What new challenge to credibility was to come with the dawn?

740
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,320
There's that creature again.

741
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,100
What happens to that star when its nuclear fuel is exhausted?

742
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,260
I don't know, but there's a big monster.

743
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,820
There's a monster in here with me and he's getting hungry.

744
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,620
I'm hungry.

745
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,760
Of 90% of its mass.

746
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,100
Take one of these pills.

747
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,640
Such an event. The catastrophic death.

748
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,200
Flying saucers are sleeping with your wife.

749
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,340
Flying saucers are your wife.

750
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,220
In just a few weeks they fade away from the UFOs.

751
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:38,740
There they go.

752
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:43,780
Flying saucers are flying with your industrials and the cattle are mutilated at the hands of a bear.

753
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,580
What made the noises like a teenager in heat?

754
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,400
Well, we don't know.

755
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,240
Those little UFOs, we just don't know what's going to be happening to these people.

756
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,580
They're going to be floating around in their lecherous little ocean pods.

757
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,380
Let's look at this. Chemical workers no longer needed.

758
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,820
No longer needed, friends.

759
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,900
Well, um...

760
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,520
ESA time from KON.

761
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,540
That's right.

762
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,620
KON 90.9 FM Community Radio.

763
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,720
Show your support for KON.

764
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,600
Get yourself or someone you love a KON tour jacket.

765
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:28,120
It's a lightweight jacket with KON in big bright letters on the back.

766
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,100
It's gray.

767
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,840
It'll look great in a variety of recreational situations.

768
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,360
To order, send check or money order for 35 bucks.

769
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,540
Indicate your size.

770
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,700
Small, medium, large, extra large.

771
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,360
And mail it to...

772
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,160
KON.

773
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,400
Tour jacket.

774
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,180
Department 139.

775
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,480
Post office box 141.199.

776
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:03,500
That was 141.199, Dallas, Texas 75214.

777
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,720
Okay, we heard a little while ago...

778
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:15,120
We heard, first of all, facts about the before life between the First Church of Mr. Science and the First Naked Church.

779
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,040
And then we heard of Devo.

780
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,400
And they did a little tune called...

781
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:19,960
Patterns.

782
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,340
Patterns.

783
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,060
Patterns off the fourth album.

784
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,800
One of those records.

785
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,020
Right.

786
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,400
The ones where they're posing with a bunch of potatoes.

787
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,240
Yeah.

788
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:37,020
And we're gonna read the phone numbers now and invite you to call 823-8883, 823-8801, or 823-7490.

789
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:43,960
Quickly, once again, 823-8883, 823-8801, or 823-7490.

790
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,620
That's right, friends, and we don't want to hear your funny Bob jokes.

791
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,220
I don't want to have to go into my rant about how this isn't a joke again.

792
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:58,460
We want to hear your true life experiences of inexplicable weirdness, friends.

793
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,640
And alien contact.

794
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,340
Yeah, praise Bob.

795
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,200
Yes, they can go backwards and forwards at the same time.

796
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,340
Yes, they're so loud.

797
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,460
That's the quantum world.

798
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:06,920
Yes.

799
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,400
Man from Earth.

800
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,500
Once you recognize that, you have to back up in time a long ways before you can actually see what it is.

801
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:13,840
It is true.

802
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,280
There's no such thing as time in this kind of a reaction.

803
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,980
It's either there or it's not there.

804
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,880
It's a state of positive, a state of non-positive.

805
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:21,980
Yes, Doctor.

806
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,160
We have achieved time control.

807
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,800
We've achieved time control in our little rocket.

808
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,400
You've got to understand that the Pauli Exclusion Principle precludes any of these.

809
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:31,900
Pauli Exclusion.

810
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,440
Yes, it precludes any of us from having the same quantum numbers.

811
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,640
Pauli Exclusion.

812
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,900
In our rocket, we've managed to...

813
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,940
That's why we have such a hot ring of electrons.

814
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,100
...electrons at the outer parts of a station.

815
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,740
And we achieved time control in this fashion.

816
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,380
But what about all our listeners who aren't able to achieve time control?

817
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,840
Yes, and what about the effects of jamming?

818
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,500
There are the lowest and less energetic levels, the valence bands of the listenership.

819
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:07,620
Now see, friends, what quantum mechanics tells us is that for every ironclad rule of physics, you'll always find an exception.

820
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:12,920
In my opinion, it's because our idea of physical laws has so far been limited to one.

821
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,860
It's because of what we, us poor pitiful human beings, can see and measure.

822
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:22,760
We wouldn't be able to measure the physical properties past our limited wavelength, so to speak.

823
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,920
There could be a whole secondary law of physics.

824
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:32,440
It mostly holds sway on a level that we don't normally perceive, but it bleeds over into our world occasionally.

825
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,420
More so for some than others, friends.

826
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:42,920
Now, I'm not at all psychic, but that's probably because, like most Americans, I'm closed off from latent vestigial laws.

827
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,840
I'm open tocome to тест my magic on anything that actually ever existed.

828
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,680
You'd be all kind of surprised but then you would have a sense of the darker end of the curve,

829
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,900
It would probably be a feeling that, like a flcome, could have

830
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,460
Because of that few laws, you come to a full assumption that your uncle can become higher and unable to have any investigation into your criminal experience using our sensors.

831
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,580
for granted, but it actually works!

832
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:04,380
I've met a couple of transmediums in my time, and people who sort of had one foot in the other world.

833
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:10,000
Friends, it's not always good for you, because if you do have to mess with the empire's God

834
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,360
you'd better plan not to get into the можем

835
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:12,860
gets in too deep.

836
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:19,380
The problem with we humans in dealing with the gods, so to speak, is that we don't

837
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,820
give ourselves enough credit.

838
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,940
Now without us, where would they be?

839
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,860
You know, I mean, they're a force of nature and we're a force of nature.

840
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,580
Which is more destructive, friends, all the poltergeists and tribal deities on Earth or

841
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,120
the Kerr-McGee company?

842
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:36,780
Huh?

843
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,120
I mean, which is killed off more mountain gorillas?

844
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,900
Which can poison the entire atmosphere by pushing a bunch of buttons?

845
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,140
So you know, friends, you can afford to believe in the gods and the lesser gods and the mediocre

846
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:56,740
gods and the just plain minor random-minded spirits, because you have to admit you're

847
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,480
on a team.

848
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,880
Us humans are a team that in some ways has the upper hand.

849
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,300
The gods don't possess nuclear weapons.

850
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:06,760
Huh?

851
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,900
The saucer people don't even possess nuclear weapons.

852
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,660
We're the only ones who can totally destroy us.

853
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,540
And doesn't that make you proud to be a human friend?

854
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:24,140
Part of the team that's able to unleash more destructive force than all combined demons,

855
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,780
Greek gods, ghosts, UFOs, etc. in history?

856
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,240
Doesn't that make you feel a lot better, friends?

857
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,440
Well, we're going to go to the phones.

858
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:42,160
And we've got supposedly a true Poltergeist report here.

859
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,780
Listener, can you hear us?

860
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,060
Hold it.

861
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,280
Listener?

862
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:49,640
Yeah?

863
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,440
Gary?

864
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:50,740
Please.

865
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,560
Is this Gary?

866
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,740
Please, relate to us your strange tale.

867
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:02,020
Well, it happened last year sometime, and I was coming back from work with a friend

868
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,280
of mine.

869
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,960
We were just going to sit and watch a movie for a little while because we were bored.

870
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,420
And this thing is a little more than that.

871
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:06,420


872
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:06,420


873
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:06,420


874
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,720
isn't anything super fantastic, but I was just sitting here watching this movie, and

875
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:16,060
I kept hearing this fan in my sister's room turn on and off.

876
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,680
And I was thinking, well, my sister's home, you know?

877
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,540
Yeah.

878
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,420
And after a while, I went back there, and I noticed she wasn't there, and I was thinking,

879
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,960
well, how can that fan turn on and off?

880
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,320
I mean, you know, those aren't supposed to happen, right?

881
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,200
Yeah.

882
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,660
And I just, you know, blown it off for a while, and went back out and watched it.

883
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,980
Elvira movie, or whatever it was.

884
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,000
Some thing about robots.

885
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,460
That shows you what kind of taste in movies those creatures have.

886
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,520
Yeah.

887
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:54,840
But it just kept turning on and off, and finally I just got frustrated, and went in there and

888
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,860
shut the thing off when it was on, and I went back out.

889
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,760
And it turned on again, and I unplugged it.

890
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,400
That's when it stopped, you know?

891
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:05,500
No.

892
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,220
It wasn't anything fancy.

893
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:07,520
Nothing.

894
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,660
After that, it didn't...

895
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,800
Well, did this ever repeat itself?

896
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:11,880
No.

897
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,540
No?

898
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:18,080
Was there anyone in the household at the time who was undergoing severe emotional trauma,

899
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,260
especially a young teenage girl?

900
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:21,760
No.

901
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,820
I have a reason for asking that.

902
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:24,940
Yeah, I know.

903
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,320
I've read a little on something like that.

904
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:27,860
Yeah.

905
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,160
Huh.

906
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,160
Well, that one sounds kind of fluky.

907
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,480
We had a great saint in the subgenius church.

908
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:42,140
A saint tentatively a convenience once had a really peculiar electrical phenomena experience

909
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,160
where he was in a tunnel underneath.

910
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,280
It was like a place where they partied, this tunnel underneath the Baltimore train systems.

911
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:56,660
And they had the problem of machines switching on and off inexplicably.

912
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,300
And one afternoon when they were down there, two people saw this.

913
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,540
It was like a blue string of light.

914
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,140
It was like a blue string of light.

915
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:05,380
It was almost like a blue string of light.

916
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:10,740
It was almost like a worm made of light that floated an exact one inch off of the wall

917
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,580
and just slowly traveled along this wall.

918
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:22,640
But as it came to things like pipes and ducts, it would move around those in this very precise manner

919
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,460
as if it was being controlled or something.

920
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:30,240
It's just another one of those things where there's absolutely no explanation

921
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,360
and all you can do is kind of scratch your head and hope maybe your grandkids know what it is.

922
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,120
And you can't do anything about it.

923
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:36,120


924
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,840
But anyway, thanks for sharing that hideous weirdness with us.

925
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,160
We got another call here.

926
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,660
I guess we ought to try that one.

927
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,200
Oh, okay.

928
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,620
And do you have any other comments?

929
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,560
Well, what freaked me out was it's like the rational mind couldn't accept it

930
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,940
and it wanted to withdraw into a womb-like state of rational thinking,

931
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:02,200
but it couldn't do that because what I was taught was those things weren't supposed to happen.

932
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,220
So it was like turning over on itself trying to figure it out.

933
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,560
Well, that's one reason why we're doing this show.

934
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,600
All right.

935
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,160
Well, friend, we're going to go to the other one.

936
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:17,960
Praise Bob.

937
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,620
Thank you.

938
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:19,780
Okay.

939
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:20,900
Praise Bob.

940
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,400
Dead listener?

941
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,260
Try that again.

942
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,880
Hello?

943
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,260
No, chickened out.

944
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:33,500
Well, friends, we're going to go back to the world of the beyond.

945
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:34,680
Noids.

946
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:34,880
Noids.

947
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:35,380


948
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:35,880
Which one?

949
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,380
That one.

950
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,400
It's like some kind of vision.

951
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,880
I've never seen before.

952
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,480
It was like wagon wheel coming out of the sky.

953
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,560
And I was sitting on the porch with Aunt May.

954
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,640
She said, what is it, boy?

955
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,600
What is it?

956
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,900
And I said, I don't know, man.

957
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,320
I swear to God, I don't know.

958
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,260
But I just said, praise Bob.

959
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,820
You know, if Bob says something,

960
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:01,960
then it's...

961
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,820
Wall climbing.

962
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:06,600
Walk.

963
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:07,460
Was it?

964
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,100
Wall climbing.

965
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:09,980
Was it?

966
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,500
Wall climbing.

967
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,460
Well, I was wall climbing.

968
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,880
I was wall climbing.

969
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,240
And that's what Bob said to do.

970
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,340
That's what Bob told me to.

971
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,980
I was wall climbing.

972
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,400
And, uh...

973
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,300
And, uh...

974
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,180
I...

975
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,520
I...

976
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:31,640
I get...

977
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:31,980
I get...

978
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,480
Real scared, Bob.

979
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,980
Because, uh...

980
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,000
I've seen them.

981
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,920
I've seen them before.

982
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,040
But there's more of them now.

983
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,640
And, uh...

984
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,360
Because there's lots more.

985
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,440
They're floating in the air.

986
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,560
And they're living in the wood.

987
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,900
And the rocks and everything.

988
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,560
And they're...

989
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,660
They're always kind of...

990
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,180
laughing and...

991
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,280
and, uh...

992
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,980
killing and laughing and...

993
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,220
all the time.

994
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,960
Duncan Lunan of the British Interplanetary Society

995
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,180
has interpreted the signals as a message from the space probe.

996
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,360
A message from a dying planet in Epsilon Bootes.

997
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,460
Now, many groups who claim to be in contact with Space Brothers

998
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,420
say that those selfsame aliens have the ability

999
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,500
to dampen or smother our nuclear arsenal

1000
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,200
before it can be exploded.

1001
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,740
But why would the UFOs save us, friends?

1002
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,880
Just so they can go on mutilating our prize heifers?

1003
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,440
Eh?

1004
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,060
Oh, no, friends.

1005
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,780
We Earth mortals have a much bigger say in our destiny

1006
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,340
than ever we did when we...

1007
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,640
believed in the nature spirits.

1008
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,320
But then, you know,

1009
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,420
if the weird forces ever did need to get after us,

1010
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,200
think what they could do.

1011
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,140
Oh, they're as high-tech as we are, if they want to be.

1012
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,360
Your average modern-day poltergeist or haint

1013
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,320
can turn on appliances,

1014
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,620
load video decks, and so on.

1015
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,620
Now, what if, friend,

1016
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,200
a distressed nuclear weapons engineer

1017
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,140
were to commit suicide in a missile silo,

1018
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,640
which would henceforth

1019
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,340
be...

1020
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,160
haunted by the etherical astral body

1021
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,860
of the leftover embittered lower soul,

1022
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,760
which was too confused to stick with its higher counterpart

1023
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,640
and go to heaven.

1024
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,000
So it stays around half in our reality,

1025
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,200
trying to make contact, but unable to,

1026
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,940
and finally driven mad while gaining experience

1027
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,320
in discharging electrical circuitry

1028
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,660
by sheer poltergeist hate force.

1029
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,060
So, see, or it could get into a radar,

1030
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,880
and it could be a radar view screen at NORAD

1031
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,860
and appear as blips on radar

1032
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,400
like incoming Russian missiles.

1033
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,000
Oh, friends, did you ever wonder

1034
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,840
what a nuclear blast would do to your soul?

1035
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,200
If ever there was something

1036
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,780
that could erase parts of more than one reality,

1037
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,420
it's that.

1038
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,660
So maybe the ghosts are worried about nuclear weapons, too.

1039
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,360
Maybe it would even destroy them.

1040
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,220
But we'll find out, come Omicron-Epsilon, friends,

1041
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,240
the time intersection,

1042
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,040
when this universe...

1043
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,800
intersects with the backwards time stream universe

1044
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,040
in the year 2178,

1045
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,300
and the images of the Akashic Records become flesh,

1046
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,920
and your weirdest dreams come to rampaging life.

1047
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,020
Ever see Forbidden Planet, friends?

1048
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,860
That's what happened to the super race of aliens

1049
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,720
in that movie.

1050
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,580
And it's what happened to the Elder Gods

1051
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,480
who forced us to build Atlantis

1052
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,400
in the days of the Yeti.

1053
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,780
Yes, friends, Omicron-Epsilon,

1054
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,040
the vision beholding Atlantis,

1055
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,120
is a subgenius prophecy.

1056
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,540
We'd better hope Bob's with us on that day, my friends,

1057
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,260
and you better hope he finds the twins

1058
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,320
with the scissors of sight, whatever that means.

1059
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,520
And if not, well, the negative universe leaks over.

1060
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,080
And, friend, when was the last...

1061
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,500
When was the last time you had you

1062
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:22,520
a big old steaming hot bowl of wolf brand antimatter?

1063
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,600
Well, that's too long.

1064
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,780
These are ghoulish thoughts,

1065
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,200
friends, morbid, morbid thoughts,

1066
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,100
and I dare not dwell upon these things any longer

1067
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,800
lest we give our spirit audience big ideas.

1068
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,180
You know, we subgenius doctors and shamans

1069
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,480
are always making crazy suggestions,

1070
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,160
and damn, if somebody doesn't always come along

1071
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,020
and carry them out.

1072
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,560
But that's religion for you, friends.

1073
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,240
It's like showbiz.

1074
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,360
It may be terrible, but the show must go on,

1075
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,440
and since this religion is largely composed

1076
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,240
of showbiz and sales, it's even more like that.

1077
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:58,940
Praise Bob!

1078
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,400
Told the judge.

1079
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:00,700
Huh!

1080
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,820
E-I-I-I-I!

1081
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,140
The only thing, if we can make the show sound bad enough...

1082
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,400
Oh, yes, dear friends, and...

1083
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,140
That's, um...

1084
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,660
That music, by the way, there, is by Mark Mothersbaugh.

1085
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,940
It's called Music for Insomniacs.

1086
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,620
And we're gonna try to go to the phone lines one more time here.

1087
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,600
Um, yeah, go ahead and give me a...

1088
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,420
Hit that one.

1089
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:32,640
Hey!

1090
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,020
Oh, hello.

1091
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:34,740
Hello!

1092
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:35,520
Jadine?

1093
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:35,980
Yeah.

1094
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,680
You're on.

1095
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,800
Give it to us.

1096
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,900
Okay, hello, this is Jadine.

1097
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,260
And, um, I just got on my call a little while ago

1098
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,380
and heard them talking on the radio about life after death.

1099
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,160
Praise Bob.

1100
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,340
And renewed life.

1101
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,600
Oh, yeah.

1102
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,560
And it was real appropriate,

1103
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,280
because I just got through helping these people

1104
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,960
pull a cat out of an engine of an automobile.

1105
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,560
And cats have nine lives now.

1106
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,480
But this cat's life on this plane is gone.

1107
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,720
How tragic.

1108
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,320
And it was real sad to me, um,

1109
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,220
you know, to have to do this.

1110
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,840
And so it was real appropriate,

1111
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,180
and, you know, it gave me the life, the heart,

1112
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,560
and to keep on.

1113
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,340
I mean, I know we all do, we miss dude.

1114
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,540
Well, thanks for sharing that with us,

1115
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,600
and I'm sure our radio audience...

1116
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,040
Huh?

1117
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:28,740
What?

1118
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,820
What did you do with the cat?

1119
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:34,760
Oh, he was in the fan belt and pulled him out.

1120
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,960
I just covered him until the people came to,

1121
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,460
you know, the animal shelter came to help him out.

1122
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,980
Well, why don't you bring him...

1123
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:44,800
There's hungry people in this world.

1124
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,200
Why don't you bring him by the Subgenius Free Kitchen?

1125
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,400
And we'll, uh...

1126
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:49,400


1127
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,220
We'll, uh...

1128
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,720
So thanks for sharing that with us.

1129
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,580
Uh-huh.

1130
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,800
Yeah, thank you.

1131
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,020
Thank you, dear listener.

1132
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,960
Well, see, friends,

1133
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:58,440
that's...

1134
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,600
There's people...

1135
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,760
Hungry people in this world,

1136
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,780
and that cat that got chewed up in that fan belt

1137
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,840
could have fed the whole family of subgeniuses.

1138
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,300
Uh...

1139
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,900
You can bring your old pets down to the Subgenius Free Kitchen.

1140
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,420
Oh, listen to the hum of those phone lines.

1141
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:15,720
Showtime.

1142
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,060
Bad enough.

1143
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,800
There is no death.

1144
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,480
It is only a transition

1145
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,740
to a different sphere of consciousness.

1146
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,840
It brings us once again to the urgent realization

1147
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,460
of just how much there is still left to own.

1148
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,780
Item six on the agenda,

1149
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,520
the meaning of life.

1150
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,840
Now, uh, Harry, you've had some thoughts on this.

1151
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:47,880
That's right.

1152
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,780
Yeah, I've had a team working on this over the past few weeks.

1153
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,580
And, uh, what we've come up with can be reduced to two fundamental concepts.

1154
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,920
One, people are not wearing enough hats.

1155
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,440
Two, matter is energy.

1156
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,680
In the universe, there are many energy fields

1157
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,540
which we cannot normally perceive.

1158
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,200
Some energies have a spiritual source

1159
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,520
which act upon a person's soul.

1160
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:18,540
However, this soul does not exist to ab initio,

1161
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,900
as Orthodox Christianity teaches.

1162
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,640
It has to be brought into existence

1163
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,160
by a process of guided self-observation.

1164
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,900
However,

1165
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,840
this is rarely achieved owing to man's unique ability

1166
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,480
to be distracted from spiritual matters

1167
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,360
by everyday trivia.

1168
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,140
What was that about hats again?

1169
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,060
Oh, uh, people aren't wearing enough.

1170
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,520
Is this true?

1171
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,380
Certainly. The hat sales have increased,

1172
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,700
but not peripersuers. Our research initially...

1173
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,280
But wouldn't they enough? Enough for what purpose?

1174
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,380
Can I just ask with reference to your second point?

1175
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:02,380
When you say souls don't develop because people become distracted,

1176
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,260
has anyone noticed that building there before?

1177
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,340
Oh, oh, friends, yes, that building is...

1178
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:16,940
That's the K-N-O-N building being dragged down your street.

1179
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,000
And that's gonna be the only way you'll hear K-N-O-N

1180
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,540
if you don't support this station, friends.

1181
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,580
As we won't be able to afford a transmitter,

1182
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,280
we'll have to have the volunteers dragging the building

1183
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:28,360
and the people who are going to be there.

1184
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:28,360


1185
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:28,360


1186
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:28,360


1187
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:28,360


1188
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:28,360


1189
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,480
And we're dealing with ropes and tractors

1190
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,200
up and down the streets of East Dallas

1191
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,720
broadcasting from loudspeakers on the roof.

1192
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,020
Uh, so,

1193
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,420
the pledge drive is gonna be coming up

1194
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,940
and we're, we're, we're...

1195
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,320
Oh, we're gonna be ready.

1196
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,240
And, um, and...

1197
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:44,740
The harvest.

1198
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,580
Uh, yes. The harvest.

1199
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,600
So, uh, we're coming close to

1200
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,700
wrapping up this hour of slack.

1201
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,020
And there's one last, uh, inspirational

1202
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:58,340
song here, also from the

1203
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,420
Monty Python movie, The Meaning of Life,

1204
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,340
which we just played a, uh, little

1205
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,260
clip from. See, they did actually have the

1206
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,980
Meaning of Life buried within that song.

1207
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,180
Is there a sperm to save her? Uh, no, no.

1208
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,260
No, this is the, the Cosmic Song.

1209
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,000
Oh, too bad, Buck.

1210
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,260
Listen to this.

1211
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,440
Whenever life gets you down,

1212
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,120
Mrs. Brown,

1213
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,260
and things seem hard or

1214
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,080
tough, and

1215
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,620
people are stupid,

1216
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,140
obnoxious or daft,

1217
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,460
and you feel

1218
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,460
that you've had

1219
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,220
quite enough!

1220
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:38,820
Just

1221
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,000
remember that you're

1222
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,380
standing on a planet that's evolving

1223
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,060
and revolving at

1224
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,720
900 miles an hour

1225
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,880
that's orbiting

1226
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,000
at 90 miles a second,

1227
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,040
so it's reckoned, a sun

1228
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,120
that is the source of all our power.

1229
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,240
Oh, the sun

1230
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,260
and you and me, and all the stars

1231
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,140
that we can see, are

1232
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,920
moving at a million miles

1233
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,580
a day.

1234
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,080
In an outer spiral arm at

1235
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,960
40,000 miles an hour,

1236
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,920
of the galaxy we call

1237
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,060
the Milky Way.

1238
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,800
Our galaxy

1239
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,260
itself contains a hundred billion

1240
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,120
stars. It's a hundred

1241
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,240
thousand light years side to side.

1242
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:31,920
It

1243
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,320
bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand

1244
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,080
light years thick, but out by

1245
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,280
us it's just three thousand light years

1246
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:38,660
wide.

1247
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,020
We're thirty thousand light years

1248
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,740
from galactic central point.

1249
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,980
We go round every two hundred

1250
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,980
million years.

1251
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,180
And our galaxy is only

1252
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,180
one of millions of billions

1253
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,400
in this amazing and expanding

1254
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,200
universe.

1255
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,880
The Universe

1256
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,880
itself keeps on expanding

1257
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,360
and expanding in all of the

1258
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,280
directions it can whiz.

1259
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,160
As fast

1260
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,200
as it can go, the speed

1261
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,200
of light you know, twelve

1262
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,120
million miles a minute, and that's

1263
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,080
the fastest speed there is. So

1264
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,200
remember when you're feeling very

1265
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,420
small and insecure,

1266
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,680
how amazingly unlikely

1267
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,060
is your birth.

1268
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:24,260
And play the dance, intelligent

1269
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,220
life, somewhere up in space

1270
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,660
cause there's bugger all.

1271
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,680
I'm here on Earth.

1272
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:30,380
.

1273
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:30,380


1274
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:35,680
.

1275
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,540
Oh yes friends, and so

1276
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,560
the hour of slack comes

1277
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,960
bubbling and boiling to its

1278
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,080
bitter end. But you're so

1279
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,760
insignificant, doesn't it? Yes.

1280
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,140
It is. Yeah. It certainly makes

1281
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,740
me feel insignificant sometimes.

1282
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,140
So um.

1283
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:51,720
.

1284
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,720
Oh, I'm so

1285
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,260
insignificant. Oh wait a minute, I've got a tape of

1286
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,120
you telling me to get out of here. Maybe I should

1287
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,820
play that, Norm. Sure. Can you?

1288
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:04,280
No, no, you go ahead. Why don't you

1289
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,040
let's see, what was the line? Will

1290
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,980
somebody please take Reverend Stang

1291
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,060
out of here, I believe.

1292
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,280
Well friends. No, no,

1293
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,120
the line is, get that

1294
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,220
guy out of here!

1295
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,280
.

1296
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,480
Oh yes, and so

1297
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,200
without the sign off music, the beautiful

1298
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,920
sign off music, friends, we're gonna say

1299
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,440
if you need to write to the Church of the Subgenius

1300
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,580
and I know that you do,

1301
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,140
please, please write to Bob

1302

Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

Where'd mine go?

1310
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,400
Listen to this friends,

1312

Pastor Naked's trying, we're fighting

1313
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,380
the phones all the way down the line.
