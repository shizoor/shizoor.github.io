1
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,860
Oh yeah.

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:20,440
My name is Chaz, and I'm broadcasting you tonight from my little holding cell here.

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,820
All quarantined, all strapped in my suit, pressure suits all pressured up.

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,960
Yeah, it's here.

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,180
The ship is waiting, hissing away, spewing out its little steam.

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,040
Waiting for the moment, the final countdown.

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,660
And that's where we're at.

8
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,460
Just hours away from the final hour.

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,880
The final minute.

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,560
The final second.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,160
The final...

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,220
X-Day.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,660
Thought it'd never get here.

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,720
It's kind of late now.

15
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,380
We're there.

16
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,360
There's nothing else to do.

17
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,740
Just sit, look out the window,

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,360
and wait for the lights.

19
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,000
Don't be scared.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:50,040
No, just sit.

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,040


22
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,160
Imagine a new point.

23
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,160


24
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,200
Or you can find an actual ==

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,200


26
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,320


27
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,420
So.

28
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,860
The time is yet to come.

29
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,500
somewhere

30
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,500
in Eurasia

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,500
blue.

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,460
My name's

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
We'll see you.

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,380
One, two.

35
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,420
Hey, Bleepo.

36
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:13,740
Yeah.

37
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,620
Chaz and I have been planning

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,880
which reruns we're going to run

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,980
since there's only another

40
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,840
week of broadcasting left on the planet.

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,580
Oh, God.

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,840
I've done 638 hours.

43
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,520
Down to a few hours now.

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,840
And we're going to start rerunning, number one.

45
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,980
Not that this is actually a rerun, friends,

46
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,520
although I am going to rerun some stuff

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,740
for a few more minutes here.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,740
The fact that some other civilizations

49
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,980
are more advanced than we are may be humbling.

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,900
You don't understand how we live here.

51
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,000
You're an alien.

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,900
That's the way I am.

53
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,040
You know what would happen if they found out

54
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,160
your visa had expired?

55
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,500
Uh, I...

56
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,020
Yeah.

57
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,100
It exists and is being kept secret

58
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,720
by the same vested interests who control our destiny.

59
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,320
The aim of the game is a world government

60
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,680
comprising members of the cabal

61
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,800
who are elected by no one

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,240
and accountable to no one.

63
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,160
And what are they up to?

64
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,800
I don't know.

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,460
Come on, Moneo.

66
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,660
I want you to start working on a completely new project.

67
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,320
What is the nature of this project?

68
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,560
Uh, I...

69
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,120
Yeah.

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,560
I'm going to be a scientist.

71
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,560


72
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,560


73
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,560


74
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,560


75
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,560


76
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,220
Who are these vested interests?

77
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,120
Who?

78
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,220
Are you?

79
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,620
Who?

80
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,100
Who?

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,160
Who?

82
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,320
Who?

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,300
Whatever, man.

84
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,120
The Santee Misses?

85
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,960
The Mob Guys?

86
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,280
Well, the cabal comprises...

87
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,660
Oh, no.

88
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,740
...the Council on Foreign Relations.

89
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
But as soon as we're gone, you folks who are here unsaved,

90
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,140
you folks listening by radio, you folks listening by record,

91
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,000
once the church is gone, there is going to be a cataclysmic judgment,

92
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,800
and millions will die in those next few years.

93
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,960
They'll be glued to their sets, watching rockets and jets,

94
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,560
blowing up schools and factories, putting an end to the birth of the world.

95
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:53,560


96
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:53,560


97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,880
Oh, George, what?

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,360
Well, thank ficar senor, I'll tell you what, the행 Viol matin?

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,360


100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,360


101
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,360


102
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,420
It is?

103
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,980
We're off service.

104
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:13,980


105
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:13,980


106
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,280
Turn out the credits.

107
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,280


108
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,280


109
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,160
Well, I'm training in upper-우�èka when we are falling back and worried that you're

110
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,840
going to hold back the tower cliff and the current

111
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,700
chaos that's in the way.

112
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,440
Let's go.

113
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,980
See them in the back.

114
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,540
What they want.

115
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,820
I don't know.

116
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,800
They're all ready to go.

117
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,440
Turn around.

118
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,820
Go back down.

119
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,200
Back the way you came.

120
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,040
Can't you see that flash of fire?

121
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,740
Ten times brighter than the day.

122
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,800
And behold.

123
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,160
A mighty city.

124
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,120
Broken in the dust again.

125
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,160
Oh God.

126
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,040
Private man.

127
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,700
Broken in the dust again.

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,200
It's gonna be me.

129
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,540
And it's gonna be you.

130
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,700
We're gonna do everything we want to.

131
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,400
It's gotta be now.

132
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,780
And I can't wait.

133
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,260
Think about the fear and all that pain at hand.

134
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,120
Oh.

135
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,160
Like a flaming baton.

136
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,380
That's burning the world.

137
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,280
Like George Bush on acid.

138
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,520
Singing in the duke of.

139
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,780
Gonna be a new world.

140
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,420
Gonna be a new world.

141
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,260


142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,180
Yeah.

143
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,680
Yeah.

144
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,440
Yeah.

145
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,340
Yeah.

146
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:49,580


147
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:49,780
Yeah.

148
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,140
Yeah.

149
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,760
Yeah.

150
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:50,820
Yeah.

151
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:51,520
Yeah.

152
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:51,760


153
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,700
To anyone's last words

154
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,920
There's nothing left for you to say

155
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,200
Soon you'll be dead anyway

156
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,580
Well, no one here is getting out alive

157
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,360
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care

158
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,380
So close your eyes and get yourself to fight

159
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,080
And think about the times we've been and what they've been

160
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,340
It's nothing, it's nothing

161
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,880
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance

162
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,020
That's why we might as well take our time

163
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,280
So stop the traffic, stop that song

164
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,060
Stop the traffic, stop that song

165
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,060


166
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,740
I wanna get off

167
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,640
I wanna get off with you

168
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,260
I wanna get off

169
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,200
I wanna get off with you

170
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,580
One more job in the supermarket

171
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,340
One more kick to get me started

172
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,380
Everyone get on board, this ship is sinking

173
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm looking for a way in

174
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,500
Searching for the way out

175
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,320
Angels ride free in your mind

176
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,860
But you're never gonna find it if you're never gonna try

177
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,240
Get your eyes on the road and suck the wild

178
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,420
Hey man, get hip

179
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,800
Climb aboard our pleasure ship

180
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,020
Speed boy, we know

181
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,400
You're king of the real, yeah, come and go

182
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,180
No, no, no

183
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,200
Go Apollo 69

184
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,820
Rock it baby, walk the line

185
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,320
We see the fire, now's the time

186
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,220
Fly Apollo 69, yeah, yeah

187
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,740
The beginning was the end

188
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,060
Of everything now

189
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,660
The ape regards his tail

190
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
He's stuck on it

191
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,680
Repeats until he fails

192
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,520
Half a goon and half a god

193
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,600
A man's not made of steel

194
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,420
See the fire sweeping

195
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,380
Our very streets today

196
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,160
Burn like a rock cold carpet

197
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,800
Mad bull

198
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,600
Has lost its way

199
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,980
Born a shielded

200
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,320
It's just a shot away

201
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,460
It's just a shot away

202
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,420
Born a shielded

203
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,580
It's just a shot away

204
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,580
Shot away, shot away

205
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,480
When we were born

206
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,980
In the early light

207
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,740
We were destined

208
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,480
To make it right

209
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,480
In pretty turnin'

210
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,960
And this is our fate

211
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,680
We're singin' this song

212
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,460
So you can read late

213
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,780
We are going to save the universe

214
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,460
We are going to save the universe

215
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,400
We are going to save the universe

216
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,780
This time

217
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,600
We are going to save the universe! This time!

218
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,680
We are going to save the universe! This time!

219
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,020
We are going to save the universe! This time!

220
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,740
We'll take the queen

221
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,700
We mean it man

222
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,480
There is no future

223
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,020
In England's dreaming

224
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,020
No future

225
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,200
No future

226
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,460
No future for you

227
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,840
I'll show you why

228
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,660
No future for you

229
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,700
I'll carry you in my arms

230
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,000
SIng100

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,040
Siennent

232
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,620
I'll text you a book

233
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:39,620


234
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,460
I'll get you installed

235
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,180
I'll buy your designed

236
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,180


237
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,520
Hence the answer

238
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,640
Jinya

239
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,140
The Linny Bruce is not afraid.

240
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:05,880
What of the limitless sex and violence in the wake of Ragnarok?

241
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,000
Welcome to the slaughter.

242
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,280
What are you going to do?

243
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,100
What will be your epitaph when we get done with you?

244
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,700
Are you going to cry for your mama?

245
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,100
Are you going to have a good time?

246
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,720
Are you going to be a bohub?

247
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,780
When it's your turn to die,

248
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,640
don't get crazy.

249
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,780
Let them all around.

250
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,440
Anarchy here.

251
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,280
Rural streets in the Ragnarok party town.

252
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,200
Ici et esos gohos lol.

253
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,320
Next episode is going to Eurovision funds the tough.

254
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:03,480
Alan McCallum talked about how many dollars he needs to keep worth the inclusion of

255
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:03,620
possible

256
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,480
Let's put some reached out in the sun.

257
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:43,400
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.

258
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:18,680
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.

259
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:47,980
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.

260
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,440
It really is.

261
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,760
And then we shall be caught up in the rupture,

262
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,620
the eternal, ineradicable, invincible promise of Bob.

263
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,680
And in the celestial chariots, vimanas,

264
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,020
saucers of the space goddesses,

265
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:13,620
we shall travel in transition to our newer and higher state of being.

266
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,580
I tried.

267
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,160
I tried what he said.

268
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,140
Oh, you can depend on it.

269
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,300
It's as inevitable as death, taxes, and Bob.

270
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,720
You know those things that you see out of the corner of your eye in the woods?

271
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,120
That they are from my deteriorating vision.

272
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,360
It looks like insects are creeping up on me, but it's actually damage.

273
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,140
It's all real.

274
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,360
X-Day's really going to happen?

275
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,940
Damage to my right eye, and of course in the left eye there's a cataract.

276
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,360
But on the right eye it's worse because...

277
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,200
Phantom objects.

278
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,720
That'll all be fixed.

279
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,780
Those things that move around in the dark spaces under the furniture,

280
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,380
it's not just your imagination.

281
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,540
It's sent by the conspiracy.

282
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,040
Sent.

283
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,460
Those are the agents of the conspiracy.

284
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,240
Why are you being silent and not backing me up on this assertion?

285
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,320
Oh, I'm sorry. I was reading. I wasn't paying attention.

286
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,320
Oh, well, that's understandable.

287
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,040
The Bobliagraphon will distract anyone, I suppose.

288
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,560
I was distracted because our background music...

289
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,940
The background music isn't loud enough. It's from that movie Alien.

290
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,380
Alien?

291
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,440
Yeah, the first one. The original Alien.

292
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,780
Yes. Well, you know...

293
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,360
It's very quiet.

294
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,820
It was originally composed for the movie Freud,

295
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,860
and then that composer decided it would work best for the situation in Alien.

296
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,280
Incidentally, did you know that James Horner just died in a plane crash?

297
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:41,680
No!

298
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,360
He was the only pilot, the only passenger of the plane.

299
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:46,840
And...

300
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,560
James Horner?

301
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,580
The paleontologist.

302
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,920
James Horner, the composer of music for movies.

303
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,000
Jack Horner is the paleontologist.

304
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,620
You're thinking of Jack Horner, yes.

305
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,500
James Horner is a music composer for many recent movies,

306
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,560
including all kinds of monster movies that we view and like.

307
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,600
And who is to say that the conspiracy is not also at work there?

308
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,860
The conspiracy that we truly hate.

309
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,780
The real conspiracy.

310
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,760
Which, of course, doesn't even know it's a conspiracy.

311
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,440
A faceless confederacy of dunces,

312
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,540
so vast and so broad that it underlies all the lesser conspiracies

313
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,660
and permeates all human reality.

314
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,600
Quite the opposite of devious.

315
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,320
It dominates by merely exploiting the overall mealy-mouthed,

316
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,720
chicken-butt-kissing code of normality, or con,

317
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,320
of all the pinks, normworms, and mere humes at large.

318
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,200
More than anything else, the conspiracy is an attitude,

319
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,320
a fear of pinkness, a cancer of the imagination,

320
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,580
the hatred of the real, the yearning for cuteness,

321
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:04,260
the eagerness to obey, and the lack of true faith in Bob Dobbs.

322
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,100
This fear of the unfamiliar permeates society.

323
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,860
It's what lets the con get away with real murder on a massive scale.

324
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,060
The obvious injustices and insanity,

325
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,780
written into law books by Illuminati bigwigs,

326
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,740
are insignificant compared to the little things.

327
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,200
The unspoken agreement with the status quo,

328
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,340
the unthinking daily cowardices,

329
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,560
the petty, subtle put-downs,

330
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,060
the judgmental gossip,

331
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,460
and all the mundane venalities that make up human nature.

332
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,220
Bummer, man.

333
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,860
So the conspiracy.

334
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,780
The conspiracy goes deep.

335
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,100
That's what Bob said.

336
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,540
Bob actually predicted this.

337
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,520
He said, it's going to be a bummer, man.

338
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,220
And the cops, of course, are working for Obama minions,

339
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,220
and Obama minions work for Obama,

340
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,240
and Obama works for the Illuminati,

341
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,080
and the Illuminati works for the conspiracy.

342
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,140
I'm real original.

343
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,120
I call him Obama.

344
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,660
I call him Obammy.

345
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,960
Obammy, get it?

346
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,680
And, of course, the conspiracy itself ultimately works for Jehovah One,

347
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,600
the alien space god from corporate sin galaxy, as everyone knows.

348
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,880
Well, so do we, though.

349
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,560
Stop snoring, sleepo.

350
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,140
Wake up and face the music.

351
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,720
Now, Hal, I did read that same section about ten shows ago.

352
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,540
That's okay, though.

353
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:39,460
Hal is reading the word of Bob as reprinted from our books in that dissertation.

354
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,700
Yeah, it's this guy's academic paper here.

355
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,120
Uh...

356
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,100
By Reverend Lee Chrysler.

357
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,200
It's full of many diagrams and illustrations.

358
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,880
Right, yeah.

359
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,860
It's up to the minute.

360
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,680
And in a thick leatherette cover, a black book like Liber Innominatus,

361
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,260
a work of foul and malefic sorcery.

362
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,340
I don't think anybody else owns a copy like that.

363
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,780
This is the only copy.

364
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,620
Maybe the author and maybe the Library of Congress

365
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,220
and the school that gave him the PhD for that.

366
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,120
God, did he pull one over on their eyes.

367
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,740
He's gonna be at X Day.

368
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Well, here's a...

369
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,540
Reverend Lee Cipher will be at X...

370
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,580
He'll be at the Judgment.

371
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,260
Uh...

372
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:32,280
I have a whole list of at least 31 preregistrants.

373
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,700
That many souls will be saved.

374
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,560
We know that many.

375
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,420
There will be 31 called.

376
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:36,740
That's right.

377
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,960
If they're paid up, even though they may be some sort of Internet troll

378
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,080
who just happened to...

379
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,000
on the whole thing, they...

380
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,300
They get seized up in the saucers while others,

381
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,280
who some might think more deserving,

382
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,400
will be forced, owing to the capricious legality,

383
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,420
to be left behind.

384
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,540
Speaking of legality, Dr. Howell, you know,

385
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,020
we can't name prices on this type of station.

386
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,280
Did I mention a price?

387
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,900
No. I'm just warning you ahead of time,

388
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,720
so I don't have to hit the dump button.

389
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,020
Of course, there is the pearl of a great price.

390
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,520
Right.

391
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,320
It's like a kidney stone.

392
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,540
Once it's removed, it's a valuable, valuable thing.

393
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,860
Here's a letter to you from R. Crum

394
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,480
about how good the book of the subgenius is.

395
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,300
I better believe I was surprised.

396
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,580
That guy hates everything.

397
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,840
He says, thanks for the copy of the book.

398
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,100
It is Bible II.

399
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,160
I read it every day for inspiration.

400
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,840
It's much groovier than the old Bible for today's world.

401
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,620
Well, then illustrate it, Crum!

402
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,140
Every motel room should have a copy in the bedside drawer.

403
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,880
That Gideon society should get with the times,

404
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,840
the pervasive influence of Bob shows itself in subtle ways.

405
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,500
Check out a jar of Paul Newman's spaghetti sauce.

406
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,640
A subliminal Bob, if I ever saw one.

407
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,740
God, that's lame.

408
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,540
Enclosed is a must-read item a friend of mine sent me.

409
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,800
This guy, Francis E. Deck,

410
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,940
is the high holy saint of paranoia.

411
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,280
His history of the computer gods.

412
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,480
You know what?

413
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,600
That thing you're reading right there,

414
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,980
the reprint of Francis E. Deck,

415
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,620
the Francis Deck that accompanied it,

416
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,180
was the Francis Deck document that got out into the world.

417
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,440
Crum was one of the first people to send it.

418
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,460
Yes, he printed it in Weirdo Magazine on the back.

419
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,160
Right.

420
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,060
But I had never seen it before.

421
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,020
He sent it to me,

422
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,000
and I started sending it around, of course,

423
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,880
to everyone I knew.

424
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,300
And sooner or later,

425
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,900
you started hearing that professional recording of the Francis E. Deck.

426
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,200
Yes.

427
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,640
The Frankenstein computer god.

428
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,420
Right.

429
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,040
The deadly Tabin needle.

430
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,640
Right.

431
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,080
The deadly Tabin needle.

432
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,600
A thing to send shivers through one's nervous system,

433
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,560
says Mr. Crump.

434
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,560
Yeah.

435
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,460
Well, a lot of people think that that announcer guy is Francis E. Deck.

436
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,580
Unfortunately, the late Mr. Deck would never have been able to speak that way.

437
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,400
A professional radio announcer.

438
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,560
And where did Mr. Deck ever find one willing to mouth those poisonous platitudes?

439
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:04,580
He didn't.

440
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,080
He was already in a rest home by then.

441
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,520
I know a subgenius who went and harassed Francis Deck on his deathbed,

442
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,060
got a short little VHS home video,

443
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,880
and he was in a long movie of the dying kook,

444
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,580
just before they kicked him out of the rest home.

445
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,120
Terrible.

446
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,560
Yeah, it kind of was.

447
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,320
It'll happen to us now,

448
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,260
through the ineluctable laws of karma.

449
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,700
For all we know, it already has happened to us.

450
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,420
You mean our corpses are being examined somewhere and given an indecent...

451
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,100
No, that somebody busted into our rest home and interviewed us.

452
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:34,920
Oh, yeah.

453
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,060
How would we know if we're in that condition?

454
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,900
Unfortunately, we have the same discussion every week

455
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,980
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave, but he...

456
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,540
and Princess We seem to be gone somewhere.

457
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,880
I wonder what that's all about.

458
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,960
Well, there you have it.

459
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,780
An interview with the subgenius...

460
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,560
They've been ruptured already. The Xs are already here.

461
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,280
X-State started.

462
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,760
The holiest ones were taken already.

463
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,060
Princess We's gone.

464
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,300
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, that innocent, crazy man.

465
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,960
The emotional responses of the subjects during this interview were technically augmented.

466
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,260
Oh, yes.

467
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,060
Well, yeah, we were sitting there in the rest home,

468
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,440
and they came and they attached their little leads to us,

469
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,680
and they got about 15 minutes out of it.

470
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,240
Princess We, have you heard from Dave?

471
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,780
Dave is going to call!

472
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,980
He's going to call, or he's going to pay a call?

473
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,420
Is he going to come, or is he going to call?

474
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,220
Oh, if he would only be able to pay a call.

475
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,800
Who's there? Is it Dave?

476
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:37,940
Oh, it's Dave.

477
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:37,940


478
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,540
It's that scary guy! It's that scary pipe guy!

479
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,960
I'm starting to have my X-State nightmares again, Dr. Howell.

480
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,440
They're no fun.

481
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,180
It's always got Bob sneaking through the woods, creeping up on me.

482
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,880
Bob sneaking through the woods.

483
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,160
Come on, be a man. Pull yourself together.

484
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,080
We tried to catch him last time.

485
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,800
Yes, you saw how well that turned out.

486
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,120
No kidding. Well, you know when you go chasing Bob,

487
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,760
that's only happening because he wants to be chased.

488
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,340
And you're only going to catch him if he wants to be caught.

489
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,020
Well, yes.

490
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,520
Because that's the way it is.

491
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,580
You can put a little salt on that dicky bird's tail,

492
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,200
and who knows, he might hold still for you.

493
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,260
Yes, I would never say, never try.

494
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,860
I would never say never, because after all,

495
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,740
as one grows desperate and the final moment approaches,

496
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,220
one is likely to try any stratagem.

497
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,860
It's a Bob hunt.

498
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,920
That's right.

499
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,740
It was just a Bob hunt.

500
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,240
It might as well have been a bug hunt.

501
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,040
It might as well have been, and it might yet be,

502
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,880
after Earth is remade, perhaps newly formed creatures

503
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,220
of a different bowel plan will take over.

504
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,420
Of course, our writings tell us that...

505
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:54,500
How is Bob be formed?

506
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,720
Our cities, or enough of them, will be left, according to the prophecy,

507
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:06,180
so that a coleopterus or beetle-like race can dwell in their ruins.

508
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,600
A pehe with a coleopterus...

509
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,260
Yeah, really, exactly.

510
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,780
I just read the novel The Beetle.

511
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,860
Have you ever read it?

512
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,520
No.

513
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:23,460
It was a big sensation in its day in the late Victorian period, in the 1890s.

514
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,820
It was more popular than Bram Stoker's Dracula for a while.

515
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,560
And it's just as good, I have to say.

516
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,840
The Beetle?

517
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,940
The Beetle is a being from ancient Egypt

518
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:41,260
who threatens the Victorian politicians and other people in the story

519
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:46,180
with unspeakable horrors and can transform into a large beetle.

520
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,060
A scary scarab.

521
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,980
The curse of the scarab skybees.

522
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,660
The scary skybees of the scarab.

523
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,920
No, no, the Beetle used to be...

524
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,440
It's like a British horror story that's book length,

525
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,620
and it's very well done, actually.

526
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,660
But what can I say?

527
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,940
The Beetle is the progenitor...

528
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:04,920
Yes.

529
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,600
...of future Earth life.

530
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,000
And here's one of those beetles now.

531
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,980
A child of Isis.

532
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,780
I think this is one of those beetles, right?

533
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,580
A be-be-be-be-be-beetle.

534
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,140
It's one of those.

535
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,740
It is, okay.

536
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,420
I'm Beetle.

537
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:29,740
Yes, it's been a hard day's nuit.

538
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,380
Nuit.

539
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,820
C'est ça, monsieur?

540
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,500
I'm spraying Renews It right now

541
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,780
on my horrendous lumps and insect bites,

542
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,420
which I got from standing out under the cherry tree.

543
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,660
Nobody else but me.

544
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,260
Yeah, I don't get bit.

545
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,800
Well, you just don't taste good, Stang.

546
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,260
You haven't cultivated your inner deliciousness.

547
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,560
I was explaining to Hal this morning

548
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,960
the reason that I fly him in

549
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,400
is to keep the skeeters off.

550
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,520
Just as the giant, gassed planet Jupiter

551
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,320
draws off dangerous meteor and asteroid,

552
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,520
and Bola Day strikes,

553
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,540
so I draw the worst of the blood-sucking

554
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,180
arthropods away from Ivan Stang.

555
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,680
I did not know that.

556
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,440
You could charge money for doing that.

557
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,180
You could keep the flies off of this watermelon.

558
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,660
Yes.

559
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,940
Yeah, a watermelon also works, too.

560
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,180
Leave a watermelon out there,

561
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,880
and all the flies will be immediately caught.

562
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,300
No, no, no.

563
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,480
Hal's here to keep the flies off that watermelon.

564
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,820
Ain't no flies on Jesus.

565
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,020
Oh, is this on?

566
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,400
Well, look, I...

567
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,340
It doesn't seem entirely fair.

568
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,160
We don't know that.

569
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,240
Jesus done been here.

570
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,700
Yes.

571
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,720
And did a radio show in Gaum.

572
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,840
Just all right with me,

573
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,080
but as far as the flies and so on,

574
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,500
these are ancient enemies of the human race.

575
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,400
Was not Baal-zebub the lord of the flies,

576
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,560
one of the princes of evil,

577
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,380
long after known in Palestine?

578
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,360
One fly above them all.

579
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,160
Ashena, the queen of the SS, or...

580
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,460
No, that was Esther.

581
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,980
No, no, it wasn't Esther.

582
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,440
It was...

583
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,020
Who was Isis?

584
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,200
Ishtar.

585
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,500
Ishtar, yes.

586
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,960
Heaven's queen and mother both.

587
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,820
Unstaffed.

588
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,220
Mooned Ashtaroth.

589
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,800
Ah, well, they all have to knuckle under

590
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,980
to the unbearable rigidity of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

591
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,400
Thank Dobbs for that.

592
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,160
Their slack ends where Bob's fist begins.

593
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,580
Right at the knuckles.

594
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,440
The whore of Babylon had better get her sheets cleaned.

595
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,080
She'd better quaff her cup.

596
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,140
She'd better keep them sheets clean,

597
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,080
because Bob's a-coming.

598
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,060
Yes.

599
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,860
And the men from Planet X are coming.

600
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:31,940
Yes.

601
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,660
Bob's coming.

602
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,560
And the whore of Babylon better start running.

603
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,040
Although, wasn't she associated with Princess Ouillardeau,

604
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,280
queen of all the UFOs?

605
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,060
She was pictorially associated, yes.

606
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,260
Mounted upon a seven-headed beast with seven horns.

607
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,200
No, in her case it was a ten-headed chocolate triceratops.

608
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,680
Oh, that's right.

609
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,860
Now, the ten-headed chocolate triceratops,

610
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,000
I can think of nothing more likely.

611
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,060
Leaving a series of Hershey kisses behind.

612
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,180
Like a black monkey.

613
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:01,260
That's where you live.

614
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:07,460
The triceratops was Lye's idea, and the Hershey kisses were courtesy of St. Joe Riley.

615
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,500
Okay.

616
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,400
Another person.

617
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,020
Well, that's a spoiler trail.

618
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,280
Well, that's absolutely nothing, because you have to explain who he is in great detail

619
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,980
for the rest of the Listerd List audience to create fully the understanding of the meaning

620
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,040
of the, you know, uncomprehended and stuff.

621
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:28,380
I have a reflex by which I have to give credit for things.

622
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,360
I blurt out credits.

623
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,160
Mm-hmm.

624
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:38,900
Because I see that people posting graphics and videos without any credits on Facebook

625
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,020
all day long.

626
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:46,460
It's like, I look at, turn on Facebook, and there's this beautiful painting of a thousand

627
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,560
bobs that some guys post.

628
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,000
And I happen to know it was by the great artist Heart Ignition, wherever the hell he is now.

629
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,420
But these people just post this stuff as if they made it up themselves.

630
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,140
And I get a great kick out of going, wow, that's great.

631
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,900
Did you do that?

632
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,420
Because I've got the same picture as a poster on my wall.

633
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,320
How did that happen?

634
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,240
I think you're arguing with your nostrils, because you need to at least elucidate the

635
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,820
audience, incorrectly, of course, with no citation necessary.

636
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,620
At least fill in some blanks about the person that you mentioned, because, oh, that's by

637
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,560
the doctor's sister, Jean Fung-Foy.

638
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,520
Well, if you were cool, you'd know their names and fill in the blanks yourself.

639
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,100
But no, you don't know who Saint Joe Riley is.

640
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,260
You're cool.

641
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,400
You made the Bob mask.

642
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,420
Oh, wait a minute.

643
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,260
I know that one.

644
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,520
I've seen it before.

645
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,600
It's by a doctor, a Mr. Made-Up Church name.

646
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,280
Yeah, Mr. Reverend Funny named it.

647
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:39,800
Yeah, right.

648
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,900
So I'm familiar with this work, and it's fine.

649
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,860
It's very good.

650
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,120
I saw him at the Baltimore show.

651
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,600
Excellent stuff, really.

652
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,280
And there was too much wine to be drunk.

653
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,060
The Baltimore show, eh?

654
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:51,900
No, not that one.

655
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:57,540
How many went to the Orlando Divival with Don just recently?

656
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:58,840
Right.

657
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,080
Yeah.

658
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,400
Last night.

659
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,680
Tony Orlando and Don had a big meeting.

660
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:03,680


661
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,380
They were down there.

662
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,460
All the big-time subs were beating on the TomTom.

663
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:07,600
Everything to know that.

664
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:15,660
Now, the sponsors of that are coming to X Day, Reverend Fox and his fiancée.

665
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Yes, the Tight T-Shirts Go Wild video crew is going to be accompanying them all the way

666
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,240
from Florida.

667
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,080
Unfortunately, it's men with that disease, men's mammalia disease.

668
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,180
Yeah, and they never give us the videos anyway.

669
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,960
It's all happening, folks.

670
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,240
It's all happening.

671
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:38,620
And we, the elect, will be saved with these books of subgenius stamps now finally assembled.

672
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,980
It ought to be a walk in the park.

673
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,720
Subgenius saving stamps?

674
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,500
Yes.

675
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,860
These books here.

676
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,360
But we, the selected?

677
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,620
I don't know if you were specifically referring to we are doe.

678
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,220
You said we, the selected?

679
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:52,860
The elected?

680
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,300
Well, we are doe, of course, yes, has been long ago selected.

681
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,520
So one is selected.

682
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,240
But not like everybody else who is, in the famous phrase, selected for extinction.

683
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,240
Yeah, but what if you guys all go like mosquito nostrils and things like that?

684
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:09,760
Oh, damn.

685
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,640
Well, that's a likelihood of me.

686
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:11,920
It could happen.

687
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,200
Mosquitoes are a little bit too forward in my case.

688
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,960
One errant thought, one misplaced errant thought on them flying away saucers on X Day and stuff.

689
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,700
Next thing you know, you're surrounded by Canadian soldiers and mayflies or other kinds

690
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:26,700


691
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,580
of birds.

692
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,300
And you've become one.

693
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,960
Clouds and stinging nightflies buzzing the restful slumber.

694
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,600
If you make an error in the course of rebuilding your own physical body on your escape vessel,

695
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,420
you can always just hit rewind.

696
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,500
You can play.

697
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,080
You can go back.

698
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,080
Yes, be kind.

699
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,800
So all I change on my mind.

700
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,600
Rewind the immediate time.

701
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,100
I don't want a row of breasts running down my back after all.

702
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,900
It just feels awful.

703
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,700
There's like a control Z or something that you can just.

704
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:53,700
Yeah.

705
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,500
I want giant bat wings.

706
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,140
Oh, my God.

707
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,680
These are heavy.

708
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,400
I don't want them.

709
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,100
Take them off.

710
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:58,680
Ouch.

711
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,480
Okay.

712
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,000
I want a giant brain.

713
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,900
Oh, no.

714
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,360
Oh, good.

715
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,300
Take it back.

716
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,580
I can never thank you adequately for this.

717
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,300
I want a bigger Johnson.

718
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,720
That's what half of them are going to say.

719
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,780
They want what?

720
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,900
A bigger Johnson.

721
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,180
And so they'll get a lifelike facsimile of the former.

722
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,020
Lyndon Baines Johnson.

723
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,300
Yes, of Lyndon Baines Johnson.

724
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,940
On the toilet.

725
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,120
To share their living space for eternity.

726
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,660
Oh, my God.

727
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,120
Yes.

728
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,860
I have them situated.

729
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,620
When I was a young lad, I had the Zappa, Zappa, Crappa and the Johnson on the Johnson poster

730
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,760
kind of like situated in kind of like an L shaped room.

731
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,600
All of us.

732
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,260
All of us.

733
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:39,640
Sleep.

734
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,980
All those in college.

735
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,200
Well, we need to do one.

736
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,520
You want to lose your body?

737
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,020
Sleep.

738
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,780
All had Zappa five Zappa, Crappa.

739
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,520
I didn't.

740
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,520
By the way, I don't Tommy the toilet poster by our crime instead.

741
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,860
That was much more rare.

742
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,580
I also.

743
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:04,020
I also had the black velvet painting of Chairman Mao with big sad eyes by a person I later much

744
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,480
later got to know quite well.

745
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,400
Now, that was really.

746
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,200
Farmer free.

747
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,100
Exactly.

748
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:16,240
I ordered it from Ripoff Press and my house got it in South Dakota and I still have it

749
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,600
South freaking Dakota.

750
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,140
Yes, I do.

751
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,140
South freaking.

752
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,060
I never knew about that strange.

753
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,060
That is where the real the true people live.

754
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,780
West by Dobbs, Cleveland Heights.

755
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,660
Well, I was right.

756
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,640
South Dakota.

757
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,800
Watch for the.

758
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:42,100
See, Chungo, Yonkei in South Dakota without seeing Orson Welles in your mind, like wearing

759
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,740
like a phony, you know, white guy, American Indian headdress.

760
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,860
Well, he's calling himself an arguing like a like a like a little robot monkey or some.

761
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,160
You know what I mean?

762
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,280
Well, I suppose you know Orson Welles in an Indian headdress.

763
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,880
Well, you said Rose.

764
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,840
But that was in Colorado.

765
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,500
Well, it it it hardly.

766
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,000
Well, that's how the elements got.

767
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,400
Now.

768
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:10,960
Okay.

769
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,420
Okay.

770
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,280
Now I'm okay.

771
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,560
Now I understand.

772
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,980
Didn't we have exactly the same conversation last week only without Dr. Howell?

773
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,680
Oh, dear.

774
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,260
I believe we did.

775
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,960
Yes, I believe we did.

776
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,140
I think we did.

777
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,140


778
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,900
Well, I was.

779
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,340
I see what I mean.

780
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,060
Dr. Howell, they've been interviewing us in the rest home and we don't even remember.

781
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:34,400
They technically augmented our response because our response wasn't good enough.

782
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,460
See, they're allowed to do that in the future.

783
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,320
But what a laugh.

784
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,740
They're forced by many common magnum laws of the municipalities of the state, especially

785
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,920
around here in this one.

786
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,880
They're condemned by law.

787
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:53,000
You're actually physically forced at the point of a gun to to do that.

788
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,880
To do what?

789
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,800
You have no choice.

790
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,640
Oh, well, you got I forgot what you guys just said you were doing.

791
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,700
And well, the emotional response is technically augmented.

792
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,500
That means they can they can mess with you to make your response more acceptable to viewers.

793
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,940
You know, viewers think that everybody ought to react big when they're watching.

794
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:20,760
They're just told that they have just one of the publishers clearinghouse contest or

795
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,600
that their loved one has been crushed.

796
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,260
Under us falling safe or something like that.

797
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,040
And you could also win.

798
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,980
Well, it's all possible.

799
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,760
It's a matter of the lottery.

800
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,780
But it just could be that you don't react immediately.

801
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,900
And then they think there's something wrong with you because you're not giving them a

802
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,400
big reaction.

803
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,800
So they have the leads hooked up to you and they give you the biggest emotional response

804
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,400
ever, which is all a matter of just turning the knob all the way over to the right.

805
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,440
I'm so excited.

806
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:52,580
I'm so excited.

807
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,520
I'm so excited about next day.

808
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,080
The aliens are going to come and make my whole world better.

809
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,600
See, as long as the dial is over here to the right, a river of sand goes on.

810
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,540
But let's turn the dial down a little bit because we don't want to harm his heart there.

811
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,600
But that's typical.

812
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,660
See, that's a face and pop.

813
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,700
This is at the low setting.

814
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
That's a little too low.

815
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,320
Now, the opposite danger could happen.

816
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,820
The heart might fail to fire.

817
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:20,980
There.

818
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,980
This is the middle setting.

819
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,020
This is where it should be.

820
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,400
See, this is Stan the way he normally is.

821
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,560
Amazing, you say?

822
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,440
Incredible?

823
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,120
Fantastic?

824
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,560
But this is real.

825
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,860
This is the Halbot 4000.

826
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,560
I am a robot.

827
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,960
Boop.

828
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,980
Where did he go?

829
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,080
What happened?

830
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,400
There was this huge, like, billy clun...

831
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,760
Margarine-type...

832
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,460
Large robot thing.

833
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,020
Open the bathroom door, please, Hal.

834
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,180
Robot.

835
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,320
Hal, open the bathroom door, please.

836
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,560
I am not a robot.

837
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:02,960
I'm sorry, Doug.

838
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,440
I don't believe I can do that.

839
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,880
I am not a robot.

840
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,240
See, that's what I like.

841
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,880
A theosophist.

842
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,600
Hal, open the bathroom door.

843
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,140
I'm not kidding.

844
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,240
This is really serious.

845
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,620
It's going to take me five minutes to get out of this space suit.

846
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,100
Come on.

847
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,220
I'm sorry.

848
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,600
You'll just have to go in your survival suit, Doug.

849
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,180
No, no.

850
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,420
I'm trying.

851
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,920
Take deep breaths.

852
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,660
You can actually breathe urine in space.

853
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,580
And it's quite a favor to treat to many of my...

854
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,600
I noticed the Russian crew that was sharing there on the last time with the American crew.

855
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,720
Oh, the Ruskies thought of it first.

856
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,780
Hello, this is Dr. Hal.

857
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,120
I'm on this frequency, too.

858
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,500
I'm listening to Lonesome Cowboy Dave right now.

859
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,200
Stang is spanned and out of control.

860
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,200


861
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,200


862
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,200


863
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,200


864
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,200


865
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,200


866
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,520
I'm going to go outside the personnel capsule.

867
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,540
I really need to go bad.

868
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,760
Yeah, we've got to get him in.

869
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,340
I have a retractor arm that's not responding.

870
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,040
Dave, can you operate the retractor arm from where you are?

871
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:03,980
Over.

872
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,960
I am a robot.

873
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,200
Oh, man.

874
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
We've got some bad news.

875
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,420
I'll give you the bad news first.

876
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,820
The supply ship blew up on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral.

877
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,200
With what?

878
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,200


879
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,200


880
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,200


881
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,200


882
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,200


883
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,200


884
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,200


885
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,360
With that load of comic books for those kids.

886
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,280
Yeah, the comic's going to say the comic books aren't going to make it to you, boys, or the

887
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,020
Playboys.

888
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,180
And so you're going to...

889
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,520
I know you've got enough food.

890
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,060
They all have turned into confetti in Earth's outer atmosphere.

891
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,580
But you're going to have to use your own urine for shampoo.

892
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,540
And I'm going to walk you through that if you will pick up the instruction manual 7SB.

893
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,540
Just remember, it's not really sham.

894
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,540
It's...

895
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,220
Yeah.

896
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,900
It's ShamWow.

897
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,360
Well, it's not really pee.

898
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,200
It's actually poo.

899
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,280
Exactly.

900
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,180
We'll let them in.

901
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:48,180


902
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,440
We'll let them in on that by degrees.

903
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:49,920
We'll let them in on that by degrees.

904
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,120
Shoot everybody else.

905
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,020
Anyway, and I'm sorry that you're still going to be stuck in that space station.

906
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,660
Ground control.

907
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,220
But we will be working on it.

908
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,120
There's room to expand in this cabin capsule.

909
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,660
Swing a cat.

910
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,740
Take off your survival suit.

911
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,520
Stretch out.

912
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,360
Put on your slippers.

913
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,020
Oh, there's our flashing dragon.

914
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,520
And the object, let's just take a little walk to the logarithm south, northeast by 25.

915
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,960
And here we are at Black Bear, where he's standing from.

916
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,180
And I'm going to go to the lab.

917
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:18,180


918
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:18,180


919
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:18,180


920
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:18,180


921
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:24,380
You know what it is, there's lots of vegetarian, different appliances for each and every heart's

922
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,680
desire you'd care to carry on with.

923
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,200
You're breaking up!

924
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,080
You're breaking up.

925
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,480
We can't understand you.

926
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,720
Roger that.

927
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,100
We have six degrees of yaw at your last position.

928
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,500
Boop.

929
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,320
Yaw.

930
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,640
Yaw, yaw.

931
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,920
We have six degrees.

932
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,260
Und it's yaw all the way down.

933
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,160
And Ibane, Persian.

934
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,160


935
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,380
sure that you're going to yaw again.

936
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,700
Oh, look, there he goes.

937
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,820
He's yawing all over the field.

938
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,220
Well, he was once a great player, huh?

939
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,980
I have a feeling from she-she-ya-ya-da-da.

940
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,580
What is that called?

941
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,240
It's called incipient baby talk syndrome,

942
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,240
and it is to be guarded against like the plague it is.

943
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,880
Yes, we cannot revert to the infantile

944
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,380
at this important juncture in history.

945
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,620
This is no time for baby talk, men.

946
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:23,380
We need manly men to climb out of the gravity well.

947
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,620
See there, kids?

948
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,700
Just look out the window there.

949
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,600
You can see Saturn flying by.

950
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,060
You think the men from Planet X are looking for a bunch of yelling babies?

951
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,060
Comet, Farrah, Fawcett, and Mages.

952
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,580
So, we're...

953
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,880
When I started the cadet care, well, the first days in the academy,

954
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,780
we were a little rough, but...

955
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,420
Yes, those hilarious, scatological Starfleet Academy movies,

956
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,120
but I think we're beyond.

957
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,060
All that.

958
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,460
Those days of youthful yoiks and hijinks are long gone

959
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,420
because now in our mature old age,

960
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,900
we're prepared to settle comfortably into our roles

961
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,580
as masters of the survivors of the human race.

962
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,200
Masters of the universe!

963
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,320
Key men!

964
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,580
Not she-girls!

965
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,600
Well, of course it's a she-girl.

966
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,420
I don't mean to exclude anyone.

967
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,160
I'll take that sandwich now.

968
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,060
Dude, whatever sandwiches we please.

969
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,180
Yes, we distride the earth like a colossus.

970
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,960
And watch how you talk about sandwiches.

971
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,880
In terror and woe, I throw my right arm to the north,

972
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,700
my left arm to the south,

973
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,080
and my feet stamp the nether abyss

974
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,400
in trembling and howling in dismay.

975
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,620
At what point in west and east, I wonder,

976
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,060
your carbuncles in your dairy area?

977
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,260
Yes, uh...

978
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,140
I'm not talking about the farm either.

979
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,240
You never outgrow your need for dairy in that area?

980
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,280
But, uh, we are transitioning on to something bigger,

981
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,760
bolder, brighter, and grander.

982
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,500
What about batter?

983
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,360
And cheesier.

984
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,180
Batter and cheese are part of the

985
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,040
inevitable panoply of deliciousness.

986
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:02,860
Better batter.

987
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,600
But cows are not forbidden in literature,

988
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,900
but some devious mayors, on the other hand,

989
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,180
encourage...

990
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,820
Cheeses from the udders of unspeakable alien cattle,

991
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,680
and nuts that grew in no-terrine gardens.

992
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,260
Encouraging.

993
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,020
Oh, you know what I mean?

994
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,580
Now you can hear the sacred bull of Apis bellowing.

995
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,020
Oh, let's go pat him, kids!

996
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,220
Come on, let's go!

997
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,640
I don't know about pine corn!

998
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,280
Praise Bob!

999
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,080
He said it very gently,

1000
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,440
so he won't kick us in the forehead and not make us eat it.

1001
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,180
I'm ready for some slack!

1002
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,300
Easy, bossy.

1003
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:35,840
Slack!

1004
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,060
Yes, that horned one has many temptations to offer.

1005
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,320
Praise Bob, huh?

1006
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,260
Where's the frock?

1007
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:44,640
No!

1008
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,360
We can't feed these bulls.

1009
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,360


1010
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,640
They're beef critters on frock.

1011
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,460
They've got to eat cellulose like their ancestors before them.

1012
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:52,780
Whoa!

1013
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,520
Check out the udders on her!

1014
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,340
And ruminate on that.

1015
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,880
Yes, it's true.

1016
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,500
Oh, that's cellulite.

1017
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,900
Did you know that cattle were carnivores?

1018
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,540
Well, now it can be told.

1019
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,880
They don't eat the vegetation that they consume,

1020
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,180
but only the animalcules that are released from it.

1021
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:11,840
What?

1022
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,160
Yes, it's true.

1023
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:13,680
What?

1024
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:13,960
Cattle?

1025
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,160
I've been eating meat for years.

1026
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,180
Here you go.

1027
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,100
Here you go.

1028
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,520
My food has been eating germs for food?

1029
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,040
My food has been eating meat?

1030
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,960
That's right, and it's been traveling through their multiple stomachs.

1031
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,400
I've been eating meat made of meat.

1032
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,240
You see, you hear…

1033
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,620
Digesting and pooping out and eating and digesting and pooping out and eating an endless cycle?

1034
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,260
Get used to it.

1035
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:39,940
You hear vegetarians talking about how every cow takes so many umpteen zillion gallons of

1036
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,740
water, and it's true because they're fed on grains.

1037
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:43,940
But, as you can see, they're feeding on meat, and that's all they're doing.

1038
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:43,940


1039
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:43,940


1040
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:43,940


1041
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:43,940


1042
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:43,940


1043
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:43,940


1044
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,900
They're not supposed to be.

1045
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,380
They're supposed to be eating grass.

1046
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,360
They're supposed to be out there chewing cuds of cellulose

1047
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,100
and not being fed on super expensive water-intensive grains.

1048
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,880
They're bad for the beef critters, and they're bad for the humans, too,

1049
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,340
giving them all sorts of digestive lapses, upsets, burps, farts.

1050
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:04,860
And arthritis.

1051
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,140
Yes, it's true.

1052
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,360
Angry cow disease.

1053
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,720
And mad cow breaches.

1054
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,560
Easy, Wilbur.

1055
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,860
Wilbur, don't worry.

1056
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,120
We're going to take them two by two, the cattle and the kine,

1057
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,620
onto the master saucer.

1058
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,260
The two giraffes will line up over there,

1059
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,240
and the pygmy hippos better stay in line.

1060
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,540
I want to be with the dinosaurs.

1061
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,220
And if you think you can be over there, you've got another thing coming.

1062
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,800
Everybody in line now.

1063
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,940
Meep, meep, meep, meep.

1064
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,420
I'm sorry, sir.

1065
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,600
Could you please step aside from the line for a brief moment?

1066
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,540
I need to check something.

1067
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,300
Moving, moving, moving.

1068
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,580
Though they're disapproving.

1069
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,800
Keep those doggies moving.

1070
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,180
Row high.

1071
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,520
Don't try to understand them.

1072
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,500
Just walk through and brand them.

1073
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,680
Soon they'll be lying on their side.

1074
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,300
Lying by my side.

1075
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,800
She builds our knees.

1076
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,340
Come pen.

1077
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,000
Come pen, come pen, come pen.

1078
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,780
Row high.

1079
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,580
Through wind and rain and weather.

1080
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,900
Hell bent.

1081
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,340
For the.

1082
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:12,840
Leather.

1083
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,220
I wishin' my gal was at my side.

1084
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:16,800
At my side.

1085
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:17,720
At my side.

1086
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,460
Row high's calculatin'.

1087
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,800
My true love will be waitin'.

1088
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,060
Waitin' if they end up in the rain.

1089
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,340
And we'll become youthful in the rain.

1090
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:25,900
No offense.

1091
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,180
Row high.

1092
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,220
Row high.

1093
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:28,220


1094
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:28,560
Ow!

1095
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,220
Ow!

1096
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:30,680
Shut up.

1097
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,100
It's not funny anymore.

1098
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:32,500
Ow!

1099
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,940
Mom, cut it out.

1100
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,440
It's not funny.

1101
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:36,460


1102
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:36,660
Move him out.

1103
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,200
Move him out.

1104
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:37,680
Head him up.

1105
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,300
Move him out.

1106
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:38,780
Head him out.

1107
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,300
Row high.

1108
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,480
Ride him in.

1109
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,240
Brand him on.

1110
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,540
I'd like to be.

1111
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,180
I'd like to be.

1112
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,500
Row high.

1113
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,980
Much better than the.

1114
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,660
The more recent remakes of Diversion.

1115
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,640
I'm getting too excited.

1116
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,200
And I think all Diversion should get.

1117
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,820
And look at the five pound tick on that one.

1118
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,660
You really gotta watch out there.

1119
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:03,080
Under the chestnut trees and wisteria, the huge ticks, like in that movie, they drop

1120
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:03,780
down on ya.

1121
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,120
You know, ticks drop on ya.

1122
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,320
You're getting all scared again, Al.

1123
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,420
There's spiders drop on ya, and a lot of things drop on ya.

1124
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,360
Are you trying to make the.

1125
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,060
I mean, can you.

1126
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,060
The younger and the older and the in-betweeners don't survive.

1127
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:21,540
But, you know, certain comely subgeniates groom other subgeniuses.

1128
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,120
I saw Pantiera plucking these huge ticks off.

1129
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,480
What's the guy's name?

1130
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,660
You know, the.

1131
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,440
Reverend Bastard.

1132
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,140
The Virtuoso.

1133
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:30,840
What's his name?

1134
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:32,540
Virtuoso.

1135
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,260
The Virtuoso.

1136
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,980
The guy who played the violin real hard.

1137
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,920
No one had a violin in the middle of the sump pond at X Day.

1138
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,040
No.

1139
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,900
Not even a toy.

1140
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:47,520
The twangy ukulele was permitted to sully the damp air with its plaintive sounds.

1141
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,800
Are you so very sure of that, my California friend, my friend of green house?

1142
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:58,700
Well, I did see Pantiera grooming Doc Designflaw as they stood shivering in the middle of the

1143
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,260
pond.

1144
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,900
So, you see, we take care of each other.

1145
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,720
We do not allow each other to have our flesh macerated by bulbous ticks.

1146
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,760
Dr. Hal, frankly, the squeamish ones will leave you there to drown rather than get in

1147
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,340
that water.

1148
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,000
They will?

1149
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:13,680
Yes.

1150
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:14,880
I guess they will.

1151
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,920
Now, he was describing a scene of pure subgenius compassion.

1152
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,720
And here you are.

1153
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,080
I'm telling the truth.

1154
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,320
What's your feeling?

1155
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,820
Half those kids won't even get near that pond because they're afraid somebody's going to

1156
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,020
ask them to get in it.

1157
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,140
But if you do.

1158
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,420
And because of the amphibious devices in the military personnel, sure, every kid should

1159
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,880
be afraid of that if it's pointed in the wrong direction.

1160
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,060
You wouldn't want the same thing to happen to it.

1161
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,460
Oh, when it was a swimming pool, though.

1162
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:41,740
Don't you?

1163
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:42,220
I'll jump in.

1164
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,920
But now that it's got a giant prehistoric turtle down at the bottom of it, no bottom.

1165
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,780
You see, it gets a little bit harder.

1166
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,020
Suddenly, it's just that now they don't.

1167
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:55,740
Oh, well, I'd rather we should have these in hotels like the sci-fi conventions.

1168
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,480
It was easy at first.

1169
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,740
But now, I think.

1170
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,500
That's the boys talking, by the way.

1171
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,820
We should be doing this in a motel.

1172
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,480
I'd go to it if we were in a motel.

1173
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,840
I'm not going to go out there and.

1174
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,760
I don't know.

1175
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,780
I don't know.

1176
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,420
I think we're the same buns.

1177
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,740
Throughout the entire weekend, he will be talking in the same fashion.

1178
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,300
And it kind of like, like, you'd be wearing high heels.

1179
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:23,060
And one of those nose pins and stuff that all the kids have to have nowadays.

1180
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,360
And there in the wood, a piggy wig stood with a ring at the end of his nose.

1181
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,300
His nose, a ring at the end of his nose.

1182
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,400
Soon to be a hose.

1183
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,400
I mean, you know, a vessel for getting rid of stuff.

1184
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,400
Dear pig, are you willing?

1185
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,940
to sell for a shilling your ring,

1186
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,700
said the piggy, I will.

1187
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,760
So they took it away

1188
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,140
and were married next day

1189
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,360
by the turkey who lives on the hill.

1190
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,900
Oh, that's a terrible child's rhyme.

1191
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,700
They dined upon mints

1192
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,440
and on slices of quince,

1193
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,000
which they ate with a runcible spoon.

1194
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,760
Runcible spoon, kids.

1195
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,180
And hand in hand at the edge of the sand,

1196
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,380
they danced by the light of the moon.

1197
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,400
The moon, they danced by the light of the moon.

1198
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,740
By the hairy shudderings of our lunar surface,

1199
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,140
I will not be condemned by your nasty, nasty words,

1200
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,160
for you have profusely and profanely

1201
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,040
disinformed all members of the public here

1202
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,080
by what you just said,

1203
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,520
because that is not true.

1204
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,500
It's not always about you, Dave.

1205
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,080
It's an intelligence test.

1206
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,140
Can you dig it?

1207
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,380
Yes, they have to decipher the secret meaning.

1208
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,100
It's an intelligence test,

1209
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,760
because I used to know that poem by heart.

1210
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,660
Yes, I know.

1211
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,780
I'm five years old.

1212
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,480
I know.

1213
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,300
My father can still recite it just like Hal did.

1214
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,240
But can I?

1215
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,840
Because I can start to.

1216
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:52,900
I can jump in on the refrains a little bit.

1217
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,480
But then the damage kicks in?

1218
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,600
Man, I feel like I've been interviewed in the rest home

1219
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,520
all for every day for years

1220
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,040
and still don't remember any of it.

1221
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,500
It'll come back to you.

1222
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,360
Well, when you have to carry your bag around

1223
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,500
and you forget it,

1224
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,500
then you should remember.

1225
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,960
Just a word.

1226
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:13,620
A bag, eh?

1227
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,860
What were we talking about?

1228
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,880
Well, we were just talking about some...

1229
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,180
Dr. Gary Prada?

1230
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,020
You know, the thing you were talking about.

1231
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,200
What you were calling?

1232
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,600
You were talking about that hoochie-ma-whopper.

1233
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,840
That brain problem we had.

1234
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,980
Yeah, it's some kind of ding-futzer

1235
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,980
you were yakking about.

1236
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,120
Memento?

1237
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,840
You know, it's...

1238
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,100
The thingamajig.

1239
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,600
The Fireside Theater thing.

1240
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,380
Yeah, you're right.

1241
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:38,680
Yeah.

1242
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,140
Uh, God.

1243
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,140
B-L-N-D-N-P-G

1244
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,460
That spells blind pig, don't you see?

1245
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,400
Teacher said with some surprise

1246
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,900
Gal, you've left out both the eyes

1247
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,820
Then I said, now, teacher dear

1248
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,160
Won't you please and listen here?

1249
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,420
Blind pigs have no eyes, you see

1250
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,360
You're right, the teacher said to me

1251
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,560
Wah-wah-wah

1252
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,180
Boop!

1253
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,060
Well, I think that puts it in a nutshell.

1254
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:10,740
Very good.

1255
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:10,740


1256
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:10,740


1257
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:10,740


1258
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,660
Well, uh, now we needn't make no further comments

1259
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:19,180
since it's all been so paradigmatically expressed.

1260
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,720
It only remains to insert a few commercials,

1261
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,560
to keep the monetary flow into the coffers

1262
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,800
of the Church of the Chub Genius

1263
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,700
until the last possible moment,

1264
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,980
to cover any emergency that may arise.

1265
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,880
People experiencing last-minute panic attacks,

1266
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,860
uh, arthropod infestations,

1267
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:45,420
and conceivably unusual weather controversies and incidents.

1268
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,160
And I don't want to alarm anyone, but, uh, bears,

1269
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,620
and I think you know what kind of bear we're talking about...

1270
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:53,720
Baby bears?

1271
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,700
...have been sighted in the earth.

1272
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,760
We're not worried about the baby bears.

1273
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,300
We're all worried about the huge adult bears

1274
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:02,860
who have crawled around in the garbage can.

1275
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,660
I mean them with bare necessities,

1276
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,980
old Mother Nature's recipes,

1277
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,600
the simple bare necessities... Maybe there will be a judgment.

1278
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,880
You would not talk about bad bears.

1279
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,620
Bad bears? No, no.

1280
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,800
But even if there were such bad bears,

1281
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,740
as some have theorized,

1282
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,560
they wouldn't bother Baby Bear,

1283
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,100
because, uh, she is of their clade.

1284
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,600
But everybody else would have to watch out.

1285
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,360
Yeah, stay out of her way, boys.

1286
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,200
Better watch out.

1287
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,780
Well, uh, it hasn't happened yet.

1288
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,500
Nobody's wanted to rub on her because she's just like honey?

1289
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,060
Bears, man.

1290
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,840
We're talking about these semi-legendary bears.

1291
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,480
Not the ill-behaved campers at the campground.

1292
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,500
Reverend Wilhelm Stahlhelm will be at the judgment.

1293
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,480
There you go.

1294
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,680
Dr. Dark will be at the judgment.

1295
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,540
You know, this will be his 20th

1296
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,220
ex-day...

1297
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,280
...campout waiting for the saucers.

1298
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,960
Oh, next year will be my...

1299
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,660
Many of your denizens have never left these places.

1300
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,080
They've camped there the rest of their lives

1301
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,020
and started little micro-industries.

1302
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,960
And began new lives

1303
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,840
where things left off back in...

1304
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,180
when days were bad.

1305
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,820
At least in September when Milholly and Orwell left.

1306
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,840
All together at one time.

1307
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,760
Slapping their thighs and arguing with each other

1308
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,440
about absolutely nothing at all.

1309
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:25,180
It was a bad day for you, wasn't it?

1310
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,520
And you promised yourself you'd never let anything like that

1311
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,460
ever, ever happen again.

1312
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,100
Boy, is my countenance crimson.

1313
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,560
Well, uh, you can make the best resolutions,

1314
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,060
but nonetheless, some...

1315
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:42,200
How you just get caught up in the sheer cussedness of things.

1316
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,000
It was just such a day.

1317
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,920
I think it was in April.

1318
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,040
A day like many others.

1319
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:50,860
I appreciate you came to my window.

1320
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,680
They spoke little soft words and...

1321
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,100
I couldn't understand exactly what they were saying,

1322
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,160
so I opened the window.

1323
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,940
Big mistake.

1324
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,020
Big stag.

1325
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,600
Big stag?

1326
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,980
Big mistake.

1327
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,380
When you opened the window, I mean.

1328
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:10,160
You know, because in there stepped a stately raven

1329
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,860
of the saintly days of yore.

1330
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,620
Anyway, you shouldn't open the window,

1331
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,660
even if you think there's something at your window lattice.

1332
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,260
We learn.

1333
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,800
If we learn slowly.

1334
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:26,880
These are sad lessons which we've now all absorbed.

1335
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,460
Like bluffing people.

1336
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,200
I stared nervously out the windows, but never opened the door.

1337
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,160
That's what my grandfather used to say.

1338
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:40,100
Because around the edge of a crack your feeling fingers can creep.

1339
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,540
Come on in, little humans.

1340
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,800
We'll tell you about the church of the subgenius, we will.

1341
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,400
You can just sit over here on this apple box,

1342
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:59,540
and that old granny tell you about the church

1343
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:04,180
that leaves you alone for about 25 minutes.

1344
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,140
Can we have some tea?

1345
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,860
Can we have some candy, granny?

1346
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:06,660
No!

1347
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,880
Now shut up and listen.

1348
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,420
Oh yes, of course you can, my dear.

1349
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,680
Can we have pumpkins and big white things?

1350
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,680
Look, the walls are made out of candy corn.

1351
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,820
No, don't pull a piece out, it'll all fall.

1352
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,860
Oh, you clumsy little schlimeels.

1353
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,500
Well, it's unfortunate that the generations can't get along.

1354
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:28,820
I want more candy.

1355
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:29,940
All right, all right.

1356
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,280
Calm down, calm down.

1357
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,700
It's because of the actual lack of contact, Hal.

1358
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,540
If you guys are not all together hugging,

1359
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:43,400
then it's hard to make out the, well, it's kind of like the Cinque Fatte at the market.

1360
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,520
You know, I'm going to tell you something actual and honest.

1361
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,280
I'm going to get it off my chest here.

1362
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:55,660
Each year I go to this thing in California called the Dragon's Breath Fire Festival,

1363
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,640
where I'm a performer, and these, they're all hippies, they're out in the woods,

1364
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,660
and there comes a certain point during the program

1365
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:07,700
when I know they're going to call everyone down from the rocky seats of the amphitheater

1366
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,100
for the big group hug.

1367
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:15,960
And at that time, at that time I'm already moving back through the woods to avoid it.

1368
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,360
Edging away.

1369
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:21,820
Yes, I subtly remove myself from the circle of the firelight

1370
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:29,100
so that when they're calling everyone down for this unspeakable ritual, I myself am...

1371
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:29,200
I love you, too, Juan.

1372
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,540
Oh, yeah, you too, also.

1373
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,280
Yeah, one develops an instinct for these things.

1374
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,780
Time for the amoeba hug.

1375
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,400
Let's have an amoeba.

1376
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,540
But I thought Tommy Amoeba wasn't coming.

1377
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:44,940
Amoeba.

1378
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:48,620
That's actually really fun, if you're on drugs.

1379
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,120
Hugs, not drugs.

1380
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,400
Oh, that's not fun.

1381
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,720
I hate that feeling when people just suddenly decide,

1382
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,880
people you don't know suddenly decide they're going to comfort you somehow

1383
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,520
by wrapping their big slobbery nose,

1384
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:07,600
and even trying to smooth your cheek like a little bastard child would,

1385
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,080
you know, like when mommy's left home.

1386
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,620
Hey, hands off.

1387
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:12,840
Hands off?

1388
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:17,920
I know you mean well, but do that again and I'll kill you.

1389
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,060
Oh, is this on?

1390
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,460
Well, you know, we all have different customs, and that...

1391
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,820
Diversity, they call that.

1392
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,380
That's what I think about diversity.

1393
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:29,940
It's communist.

1394
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,260
That's what Philo Drummond says.

1395
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,480
He's constantly raging...

1396
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:34,780
Communist!

1397
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,120
Raging against the concept of diversity.

1398
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:38,720
But...

1399
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,740
Well, we're all diverse.

1400
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,160
Well, he explained to me that that's because he's old.

1401
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,520
We discussed that just the other day.

1402
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,280
Oh, he did?

1403
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,720
Philo, why do you hate everything?

1404
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,480
It's because I'm old.

1405
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,140
Well, I'm damn near as old as you, Philo, and I don't hate everything.

1406
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,900
Yes, what about the little birds and the flowers,

1407
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,080
the perfumes on the breeze,

1408
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,420
the skunks and the pollens?

1409
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,000
Stop and smell the skunks and the pollcats, man.

1410
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,260
The badger and the armadillo.

1411
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:06,720
Yeah.

1412
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,480
The...

1413
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,600
Yeah, the pollcats.

1414
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:13,600
And what about all the youth in their little sequestered utility room,

1415
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,100
sitting in school waiting for something to happen?

1416
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,360
Well, you can't give everybody a pass.

1417
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,200
Somebody's gonna have to go under.

1418
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,180
We have to plow some under so that we can...

1419
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:20,480
But they're crappy at everything, too.

1420
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,040
Well, you have to make a judgment somewhere.

1421
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:29,480
You know, there's no point in unrealistic, fatuous affection for everyone.

1422
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:30,920
All right. Yeah.

1423
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,720
Of course, might be done.

1424
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,940
People say they want the affection of God in heaven,

1425
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,700
but they're talking about some grandfather in heaven,

1426
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:45,160
a benign, senile presence that lets you tug on its watch chain.

1427
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,080
Yes, I tell you, it's gonna be slightly different.

1428
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,220
Slightly different.

1429
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:57,660
And it will be even more different because this show has come to a bitter close.

1430
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:58,800
Oh, no!

1431
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,440
Yes, the time has come...

1432
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,560
Oh, no!

1433
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,620
...for us to say goodbye, but just for a little while,

1434
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,640
because we'll be back again next week,

1435
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,280
which happens to take place within just a few minutes.

1436
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:11,960
We will?

1437
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,360
Yes, we will.

1438
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:13,700
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1439
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,000
Because we are not going to leave.

1440
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,640
I get you.

1441
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,040
The listeners may leave.

1442
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:17,700
Now I understand.

1443
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,660
The internet listeners may leave.

1444
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,080
You got me now.

1445
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,020
I understand.

1446
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,960
I was just a little slow on the uptake there.

1447
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,120
Still on the uptake there, huh?

1448
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,280
Yeah, exactly. I wasn't too fast on the...

1449
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,380
And so, you've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack,

1450
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,140
in its classic form...

1451
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:31,280
Slack.

1452
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,460
...with special guest Dr. Hallin-O.

1453
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,500
Hi, folks.

1454
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,380
And Princess Wiardo...

1455
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:37,160
Hi.

1456
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,400
...with lonesome cowboy Dave...

1457
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:39,900
Hi, Dave.

1458
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,180
...and your host, Reverend Eric Tseng.

1459
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:41,660
Thank you.

1460
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:46,380
And for more information, you may check out subgenius.com.

1461
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,980
Check it out.

1462
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:48,780
Dude.

1463
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,540
And with that, Dave, you'll have to call back when, Dr. Sinister?

1464
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:55,680
Sometime?

1465
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,300
Try again in a little while?

1466
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:00,980
Because...

1467
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,820
I will try again.

1468
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:03,520
I'll try and...

1469
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,460
Because that way...

1470
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:04,980
...I'll continuously...

1471
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,080
You're fading.

1472
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:06,620
...try to understand...

1473
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:07,080
You're fading.

1474
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:07,280
Just a brief...

1475
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,340
There he goes, Dave.

1476
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,740
...just a brief interlude.

1477
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,220
...a tiny fading...

1478
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:11,840
I got news for you, guys.

1479
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,740
...at the bottom of the sound...

1480
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,800
You guys are fading, too.

1481
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,300
God, what is going on here?

1482
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:16,800
Jeepers.

1483
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,020
Are you too stupid to see what's going to happen?

1484
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,640
I know what's coming.

1485
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,700
Have I got to beat you to make you understand?

1486
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:23,780
It's...

1487
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,660
The subgenius, Hour of Slack.

1488
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:28,660
...with lonesome cowboy Dave.

1489
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:29,280
...with lonesome cowboy Dave.

1490
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:29,280


1491
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:29,280


1492
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,420
It's going to end more horribly than anything in all history.
