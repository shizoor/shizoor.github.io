1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,240
We always have something very funny happens when we start.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,480
The Self Genius Hour of Splash.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,240
Just keep still, keep together.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,980
I believe in that face!

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,000
That face!

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,420
That cliff art cut out of some old yellow pages and face!

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,340
And March 14th also, which is this Tuesday,

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,560
it's also Albert Einstein's birthday.

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,460
A lot of people didn't know that.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,660
It's also Pi Day 3.14.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,120
Oh gosh, where's my subgenius calendar?

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,900
Yeah, so anyway, here's, I'm going to open up these phone lines.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,080
Hello, you're on the air.

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,260
I feel full of air right now, knowing what I don't know.

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,000
You know, I feel filled to the brim with things I don't know, too.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,200
Dave has risen.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,780
The vacuum expands.

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,280
That's right.

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,180
In fact, it's expanding.

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,940
It's such an explanation.

21
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm worried right now.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,600
I don't know if we can even talk about it.

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,260
We're just probably going to explode in a second.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,900
Are you sure it's not yeast?

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,200
Because that's what I had.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,120
A yeast infection?

27
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,420
Well, just all over.

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,820
Well, you know, I hear that Dr. What's-Her-Face can treat those really well.

29
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,020
Read the yeast particles?

30
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,340
Dr. Carolyn something?

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,220
Carolyn Dean.

32
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,460
Yeah, Dr. Carolyn Dean is an expert at treating those things, isn't she?

33
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,600
She reads yeast infections the way they read tea leaves?

34
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,200
Well, you know, apparently.

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,260
She can take your yeast infections.

36
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,980
She can actually make some tasty bread with it.

37
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:31,780
Yeah.

38
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,140
There's a...

39
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,500
I'm in a rap group called the Yeasty Boys, actually.

40
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,120
There's actually a rap group called the Yeasty Girls.

41
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,460
They make, like, crazy feminist acapella rap tunes, and I should...

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,560
I don't know.

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,180
They're kind of...

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,420
Well, you know, they're indecent.

45
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,000
So, you know, we're in safe harbor now.

46
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,240
Maybe I can get away with playing them later.

47
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,860
What's wrong with Yeasty Girls?

48
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,160
The Yeasty Girls, yes.

49
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,500
They have a song called F Yourself,

50
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,120
which is encouraging girls and women to take...

51
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,420
charge of their sexual gratification.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,980
And, you know, not depend on...

53
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,400
on, uh...

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,540
you know, unreliable male companions for that kind of thing.

55
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,580
That's perverted.

56
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,560
That's against the Bible.

57
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,180
Yeah.

58
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,500
And they also have a song called...

59
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,680
We're just spreaders of something vile

60
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,640
rather than they're the incubators of such a thing.

61
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,420
Well, you know, they're good boys and bad boys.

62
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,020
You know what I mean?

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,240
We all want to share the love and drink wine

64
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,100
and break bread and stuff like that.

65
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,320
But we don't want to break bread if it's going to make us...

66
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,000
break wind.

67
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,620
And you know what?

68
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,880
And you know what?

69
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,160
If it weren't for the Yeasty Boys,

70
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,020
we wouldn't be able...

71
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,820
the yeast, you know, we wouldn't have...

72
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,120
we wouldn't have wine or bread.

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,960
What's the word that's alluding, you know,

74
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,600
to describe the Yeasty Boys?

75
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,520
They're very...

76
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,100
ha ha ha.

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,660
You know, they're very, um...

78
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,040
They have kind of a...

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,560
I don't know.

80
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,320
Full of, uh...

81
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,400
Kevets?

82
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,760
Fermented?

83
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,580
I'm full of piss and vinegar.

84
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,020
I don't know.

85
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,120
Yeah, that would work.

86
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,700
But, uh, I don't think it's yeast involved in...

87
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,860
Maybe they do.

88
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,180
I don't know.

89
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,560
No, no, no.

90
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,520
Hello, you're on the air with us.

91
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,640
Hello, you are on the air.

92
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,580
Hello, um...

93
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,580
First, I want to ask about the background music.

94
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,560
Is this, uh...

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,360
Is this like the instrumental version of El Norebi?

96
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,020
Is this from...

97
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,180
Is this somehow the Beatles' original track?

98
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,720
Or is this from a George Martin album, or what?

99
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,240
This is the original, uh...

100
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,900
It's actually from a Beatles anthology.

101
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,100
Uh, volume, uh...

102
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,640
Volume...

103
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,040
Two.

104
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,420
Two, yeah.

105
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,520
And, um...

106
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, volume two off the Beatles anthology.

107
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,480
And, uh...

108
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,260
That's funny.

109
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
I should have people call in and freestyle over this.

110
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,100
You know, because it's so good to find instrumental tracks that people...

111
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,860
I wonder what would it sound like if somebody started freestyling over this.

112
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,900
Oh, if I would...

113
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,200
My problem is every time you add another person to the line,

114
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,500
it takes a little volume out...

115
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,800
Well, then you'll...

116
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,360
...of my hearing of it.

117
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,180
I don't know if it's just doing it to my brain, my ear, or the phone line, or...

118
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,780
Do you have a...

119
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,860
It causes structural...

120
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,380
Structural, uh, change in the brain.

121
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,480
You focus on the list...

122
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,480
I mean, the caller, which is a smaller voice.

123
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,500
And then your own voice grows smaller,

124
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,060
and you wonder if perhaps you're in some kind of weird, you know...

125
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,740
You're a weird...

126
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,540
No, my voice stays really big in my head.

127
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,280
But the...

128
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,560
But the caller is tiny, tiny, tiny.

129
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,100
And, uh...

130
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,180
Dr. Sinister is fairly big.

131
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,380
Well, that's...

132
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,360
I mean, it's the truth.

133
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,100
But you, Dave, sound...

134
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
As more and more people come on,

135
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,980
you sound lighter and more ignorant,

136
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,760
but yet more...

137
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,220
More fragrant.

138
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:26,940
More.

139
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,360
That's real.

140
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,200
Mumble more.

141
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,580
And when somebody sounds fragrant,

142
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,300
you know you're experiencing synesthesia.

143
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,020
Yeast fragrances?

144
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,960
What about the dead Miloseviches?

145
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,080
You haven't parsed that band yet.

146
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,540
Oh, man, the dead Miloseviches,

147
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:39,880
they...

148
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,760
They were great while they lasted.

149
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,080
My favorite, uh...

150
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,660
My favorite Balkan dictator was, uh,

151
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,860
Slobodan Milosevic.

152
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,580
Uh, and what did he do?

153
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,380
I...

154
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:50,700
I...

155
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,500
He, uh...

156
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,100
He was responsible...

157
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,900
He was responsible for some of the most, uh,

158
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,380
atrocious crimes of the, uh,

159
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,760
the Balkan Wars of the 90s.

160
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,040
Mine was Tito.

161
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,800
Marshall Tito?

162
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,980
Who doesn't love Marshall Tito?

163
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,400
Marshall Tito.

164
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
And I also like the...

165
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,400
What was the, uh,

166
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,480
the friendly sheriff guy?

167
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,100
What was his...

168
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,740
Gumpkins or Petervich?

169
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,400
I thought you were into Moshe and Kettler.

170
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,760
The sheriff of Nottingham?

171
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,120
He'd say things like,

172
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,600
Marshall, we're going to stomp in a...

173
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,920
You know, and they...

174
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,260
Oh, who can forget Pol Pot?

175
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,000
Pol Pot?

176
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,440
Eh, overrated.

177
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,820
Although the, uh,

178
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,360
The Killing Fields,

179
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:21,840
that was a...

180
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,420
That was a good movie.

181
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,900
We had, uh,

182
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,360
recently two...

183
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,200
to, uh,

184
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:26,520
uh,

185
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,100
dredge up the numbers

186
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,200
of statistics

187
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,120
for who is the

188
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,180
most vicious tyrant

189
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,960
who had killed the most people

190
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,300
and what wars had, uh,

191
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,680
caused the most, uh,

192
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,920
mass deaths.

193
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,280
And it was kind of a toss-up, really,

194
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,800
between Stalin and Mao and Hitler,

195
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,260
depending on the...

196
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,840
how you feathered the numbers.

197
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,340
Depending on how...

198
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:49,460
Yeah.

199
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,500
Because, uh,

200
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,120
about 30 million people

201
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,880
starved to death

202
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,600
during, uh,

203
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,880
some of the more tumultuous, uh,

204
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,360
parts of the war.

205
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,380
Right.

206
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,620
Yeah, but those...

207
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,540
You can't call those

208
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,600
direct murders.

209
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,080
Well, you can

210
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
because of the kind of policies

211
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,000
he instituted, um,

212
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,740
that caused the entire

213
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,160
agricultural system to fail.

214
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,600
I mean, they said that

215
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,140
we're going to...

216
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,680
He could conversely

217
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,160
blame the United States

218
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,420
for the genocide

219
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,300
of the Indians

220
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,040
by very scientifically

221
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,500
removing food sources

222
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,260
and trade routes

223
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,940
and just, uh...

224
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,640
And introducing all kinds

225
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,160
of horrible plagues that, uh...

226
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,640
Yeah, burning them out

227
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,500
pretty good, you know?

228
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,080
Yeah, actually,

229
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,240
I would say that, you know...

230
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,040
Actually, I mean,

231
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,080
new research all the time

232
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,360
is kind of...

233
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,640
coming up,

234
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,620
showing just how extensive,

235
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,400
um, a population

236
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,520
there was in North America

237
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,180
before...

238
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:31,460
that aren't around anymore?

239
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,480
I mean, a real lot?

240
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,460
I mean, actually,

241
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,060
some of the...

242
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,100
a lot of the Amazon rainforest

243
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,980
was actually man-made.

244
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,740
Some of it was.

245
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,120
I've heard this, uh,

246
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,940
this, um,

247
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,640
not hydrothol-like,

248
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,300
but danic,

249
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,180
von danic and light

250
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,780
sputter.

251
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,200
Sputter.

252
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,580
Sputter.

253
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,180
And now it's time

254
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,360
to cleanse ourselves

255
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,140
of that horrific experience

256
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,220
we just went through

257
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,700
and join the Feminist Kitchen.

258
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,760
We're gonna walk...

259
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Because I've worked up

260
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,360
an appetite!

261
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,200
...walk on down

262
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,060
to Feminist Kitchen.

263
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,660
Sorry, sorry,

264
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,220
do I have to walk

265
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,440
Today we have an esteemed,

266
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,480
powerful woman, um,

267
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,180
guest,

268
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,940
a member of the hierarchy

269
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,700
of the Church of the Subgenius

270
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,360
and actually

271
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,840
queen of all UFOs,

272
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,680
Princess We Are Doe.

273
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,280
Um, for you

274
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,060
burgeoning subgenius out there,

275
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,760
you established subgenius

276
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,200
out there,

277
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,020
or just basically,

278
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,220
anybody who's ever

279
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,360
thought,

280
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,040
questioned that they were

281
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,080
better than anyone else,

282
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,440
this interview

283
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,520
is going to rock your world.

284
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,520
Princess We Are Doe.

285
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,500
Let's, let's,

286
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,160
let's speed it up.

287
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,020
Hello? Hello?

288
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,760
Just cooking up

289
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,300
some delicious treats in here.

290
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,640
It's time for me

291
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,820
to finally have my voice.

292
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,940
We're clearly soldiers

293
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,100
in petty coats.

294
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,740
Leaders for women,

295
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,580
our fathers.

296
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,080
Vote for me if you can,

297
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,080


298
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,620
Though we adore men

299
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,840
individually,

300
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,200
we agree that as a group

301
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,320
they're rather stupid.

302
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,900
Can you pass butter?

303
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,200
Cast off the shackles

304
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,120
of yesterday.

305
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,560
Shoulder to shoulder

306
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,320
into the fray.

307
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,120
Our daughters' daughters

308
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,560
will adore us,

309
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,200
and they'll sing in grateful

310
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,420
chorus.

311
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,700
Well, run!

312
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,400
This the suffragette!

313
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,800
Princess Wee, my god!

314
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,560
It's Princess Wee, live in your ear.

315
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,600
Princess, we're so happy that you could join us here today

316
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,580
and see some nutrition.

317
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,320
I'm so glad I could be here.

318
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,540
So, Princess.

319
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,520
Excuse me, as the man, I feel like I should take charge of this feminist kitchen.

320
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,900
For those of you listeners at home, we're talking with a woman who is up with the likes.

321
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,480
She is queen of all the UFOs.

322
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,300
She controls the pleasure saucers who will rupture us one day.

323
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,900
God, we're still waiting.

324
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,640
July is coming up.

325
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,060
Fifth.

326
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,880
I'm waiting.

327
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,020
I want to be ruptured.

328
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,060
Every second of every day, actually.

329
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,380
It could happen any time, you know.

330
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,120
Yeah, so...

331
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
You know, that actually...

332
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,260
Rake, if I may interrupt.

333
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,980
Princess Wee, I'm not trying to trap you here in a vicious cockfight,

334
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,400
but there's something I've really needed to get off my chest for the last ten years.

335
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,540
Okay, Amos, if there's any way you can make your voice louder to me, do that.

336
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,540
I believe so.

337
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,320
How's that?

338
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:41,900
Okay, beautiful.

339
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,140
Well, I've been a card-carrying subgenius minister since 96.

340
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,860
Wow, 96.

341
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,120


342
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,040
Thank you very much.

343
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,320
Thank you very much.

344
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:57,280
And I speak not only for myself, but for all the subgenius men and women on this doomed rock

345
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,180
who would like to know when your private, you know, agenda

346
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,480
to make Bob and Reverend Sting look like the stupid men that they are

347
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,540
by holding back the pleasure saucers,

348
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,360
when are you going to let your domestic squabble go and let us get off of this doomed planet?

349
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,060
You're the queen of the UFOs.

350
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,040
That was a evil...

351
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,540
Evil cackle.

352
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,860
You know it, and I know it.

353
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,580
Look, he's not going to leave the toilet seat down.

354
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,700
He's just not going to do it.

355
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,820
But do you have to keep the exes from letting me experience the euphoria and pleasure?

356
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,300
That is my birthright.

357
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,880
Wise, wise, wise young man you are, I must say.

358
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,620
But I actually could never reveal the thing that you have asked me.

359
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm sorry.

360
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,580
I understand that you've waited a good full decade to get the answer to that question,

361
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,020
and yet...

362
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,600
Yes.

363
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:49,800
Yes.

364
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,040
Yes.

365
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,380
And I just can't reveal.

366
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,260
I'm sorry.

367
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,180
Can...

368
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,140
Is there anything we could do, maybe fiscally, to help that along?

369
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,660
Is there...

370
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,340
Like, listeners at home, is there any...

371
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,840
Like, could we do a pledge drive to raise a couple thousand million dollars?

372
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,960
I don't know how much it would take.

373
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,080
And then you'll release the pleasure saucers.

374
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,780
Oh, well, but of course.

375
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,620
There's an ongoing, constant need for funding at the Church of the Subgenius.

376
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,940
The Subgenius Foundation is always in need of sponsoring,

377
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,880
and any donations that are given,

378
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,780
we'll definitely go in that direction.

379
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,960
You can put your life on that.

380
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,600
And where do we send checks to?

381
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,760
Oh, you would send checks to Bob.

382
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,200
Just right.

383
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,180
It's kind of like Santa Claus at the post office.

384
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,420
J.R. Bob Dobbs, they just know where to send it.

385
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,320
Yeah, pretty much.

386
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,840
I mean, it's helpful to have the P.O. box number on there,

387
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,740
but you can just actually put Bob on an envelope,

388
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,400
and, well, it'll get closed anyway.

389
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,460
You know, we don't really have time to talk about Bob today.

390
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,860
I'd like to talk to you.

391
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,620
Let's talk about Connie, shall we?

392
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,520
That's fine.

393
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,180
A controversial, strong female force in the Church of the Subgenius,

394
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:05,020
arguably the most influential person in the Church of the Subgenius,

395
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,960
arguably even more so than J.R. Bob Dobbs himself,

396
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,040
just based on pure ability to swindle and to exert her will.

397
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,480
Have you ever met her?

398
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,940
Do you think she's the real power behind the pipe?

399
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,440
Well, Connie is definitely the real power.

400
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,700
I mean, that was very, very kind of you to have said what you said at the beginning of your intro to me,

401
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,380
but Connie is indeed the true power behind the power behind the pipe.

402
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,180
So, yes, you've named it, that's for sure.

403
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,860
And there are definitely not enough Connieites.

404
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,340
There's not enough support out there.

405
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,980
Reverend Stang is constantly complaining that women are always complaining that there aren't enough Connie products.

406
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,540
So he churns out quality.

407
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,060
Quality Connie products, and no one buys them.

408
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,740
Really? I mean, like, how about like an anti-wrinkle cream, a thigh-buster cream?

409
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,740
I mean, I want to look like Connie.

410
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,140
Well, I've actually considered putting on the market the only soap that I use

411
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,520
because it's a goat milk soap that's made in Lodi, Ohio,

412
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:18,780
by some people that actually, you know, milk the goats themselves, and they make the soap there.

413
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,960
That's the only soap I've used in the last 20 years.

414
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,360
And I've been considering marketing that.

415
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,540
That's my only beauty secret, though, that soap.

416
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,900
Well, in this day and age, marketing certainly is the only application that makes sense.

417
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,260
Dollars make sense.

418
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,160
And on that note, would you care to talk about the forthcoming book project you're working on?

419
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,040
The subgenius cyclopedia?

420
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,080
The Bobliographon, you mean?

421
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,200
Yes.

422
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,700
Yeah.

423
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,420
Well, yeah.

424
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,900
That is churning away on the third floor of this house as we speak.

425
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,120
It's being written.

426
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,740
It's being produced.

427
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,480
It's happening.

428
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,480
It's an exciting, happening thing.

429
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:07,880
And why should some of us faithful, subservient subgenius go out and buy this book

430
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,620
when we have, like, six at home?

431
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,800
Is this going to offer us more chances for rupture?

432
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,200
This is all new, all new stuff.

433
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,280
Everything in this book is not.

434
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,020
It's been seen before.

435
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:29,820
So this is definitely going to be revelatory of new, new things that all subgeniuses should see and know

436
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,460
and will want to see and know.

437
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,620
The good news is we just signed a new book deal.

438
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,400
Last week.

439
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:47,900
Last week, I suddenly was informed that it was time for, like, a third testament, you might say.

440
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,560
After the book of the subgenius in Revelation X.

441
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:59,260
The bad news is I have to have it completely finished, illustrated, and laid out in front of the cameras by May 15th.

442
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,640
So I'm starting to write it right now.

443
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,220
And you guys get the help, I suppose.

444
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,100
So these little notes I'm looking at are actually the first notes from the beginning of the book.

445
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:17,740
And I ask you, is there a 10-foot long spike stinking your wallet?

446
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:17,880
Is there a 10-foot long spike stinking your wallet?

447
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:17,880


448
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:17,880


449
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,960
And you're very face to your job, friends.

450
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,720
Are you serving two masters at all times?

451
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,300
Sometimes you can't crap or get off the crapper.

452
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,340
And that's where Bob comes in.

453
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,480
Bob can help the pea shy, my friends.

454
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,760
He's been in the pants of the man with the spastic colon.

455
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,480
He can be your diaper.

456
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,100
He will wipe and clean you spiritually.

457
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,720
Get rid of those false beliefs.

458
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,680
He's like the handyman.

459
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,160
He's like the diaper wipe.

460
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,400
And this magic dispenser of slack can be yours.

461
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,180
A little more.

462
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
I'm not trying to encourage anything.

463
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,440
Anyway, friends, a lot of us find ourselves trapped in this cage of only six dimensions.

464
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,600
And you can let Bob bell the cat that is your head.

465
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,620
You'll finally know whether you're coming or going.

466
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,320
You'll know exactly what you think.

467
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,400
But you'll have to pay for it.

468
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,500
Slow money for dark matter, we call it.

469
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,740
Something's been added.

470
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,360
Something's been removed.

471
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,460
How will you know once it's gone?

472
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,900
You've got that problem with any cult you join or any belief you start believing in.

473
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,480
One of our most beloved ministers, Reverend Onan Kanabite, said,

474
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:46,600
To sell a religion, you don't need all the answers, just one good answer.

475
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,700
And that's Bob!

476
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,460
That's that face!

477
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,440
You don't need to know what Bob believes or what he teaches.

478
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
You just need the damn head.

479
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,020
And if you look at it, those of you who look at that thing and instantly understand how

480
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,460
cool it is, you're subgeniuses already.

481
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,380
I probably don't have to tell you anything else.

482
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,340
And this show, by the way, is dedicated to the high school teacher in Ventura who just

483
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,800
a few days ago saw a bug.

484
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:17,880
Oh, my God.

485
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,600
A bug on his table.

486
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,760
And he had a 40mm grenade.

487
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,400
And he blew it up the bug?

488
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,640
That I used to fire with my blooper.

489
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,680
And he grabbed it.

490
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,620
And the damn bug went bam!

491
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,580
And he hit the bug.

492
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,340
With a grenade and it blew up?

493
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,260
In class?

494
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,280
In class, in front of everybody.

495
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,480
He lost his right hand.

496
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,480
And he lost his job.

497
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,780
Did it kill the other children?

498
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,660
No, it didn't hit anybody.

499
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,680
Amazing, fortunate.

500
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,480
Wow.

501
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,040
Yeah, just the whole thing.

502
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,100
He didn't know it was alive.

503
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,860
That it was a live grenade, huh?

504
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,660
That the bug was alive?

505
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:47,860
Yeah.

506
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:47,860


507
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:47,860


508
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:47,860


509
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:47,860


510
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:47,860


511
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,460
Yeah, the bug's no longer alive.

512
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,640
No, that the grenade was live.

513
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,780
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

514
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,320
He had this thing on his desk for years.

515
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,040
He's got a live 40mm grenade.

516
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,560
Grenade launch and wrap.

517
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:01,100
Okay, now I think it's time for Hal to read his original response written back in 1984.

518
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,060
Entitled, Soaking in the Sludge.

519
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,400
Dear Glug and Doob, what's with you guys?

520
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,140
Like, this tour wasn't any fun or anything.

521
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,840
I thought the purpose of the whole thing was that I personally could...

522
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:17,840


523
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,860
I should have a good time, but you jerks ruined my fun.

524
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,340
Why, you're all nothing but a pack of cards.

525
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,620
Yes, you so-called pros turned out to be euphorial, numinous mouseholes.

526
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,900
Paul, if you're through with my antique crystal radio, the one you said you needed to open

527
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,520
your performance with that last frantic night in L.A., I'd like it back.

528
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,140
Stang, that seance of yours was humiliating beyond words.

529
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,900
No wonder you wouldn't look me in the eye.

530
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,820
It wouldn't have fooled a Bobby Croc to the gilch.

531
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,600
Yes, I couldn't have been more

532
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:59,600
The dramatic image I'll carry around in my pants pocket for a lengthy interval is of

533
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,080
you oscillating your pinky below my nasal appendage while squeaking like a sphincter-plugged

534
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,640
Rotarian.

535
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,860
Don't you be worrying, if anybody believes in it, we've got their money.

536
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,220
If you got it, I didn't, which makes me the chump.

537
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,660
You left me holding the bag while certain others...

538
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:17,800
I did.

539
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:24,140
slug gimme's frisked and frolicked in Mother's Baw's palatial penthouse pad, probably accompanied

540
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:31,680
by his gall-derned girlfriend. Did you think I, the great Dr. Hal, was tentatively a convenience

541
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,440
or another one of your little sug-deemy whipping boys? What was the deal? I mean, this was me,

542
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:43,900
Dr. Hal himself, the master of church secrets. You were whinnying and bleating, too. I could

543
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:50,820
throw it all up, since, like the show itself, you were an emetic. Why is it that I, a genuinely

544
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:57,700
poverty-stricken artiste, received no plane fare or travel compensation of any kind? Really,

545
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:04,160
ten bucks is big news to me any day, but that fat cat, that plutocratic muckety-muck, the poke of

546
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:11,240
all New York, had all but thirty-one dollars paid of his travel expenses, his travail expenses.

547
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,660
Of course, I'm not a big-time

548
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,980
preacher or a nuclear materials expert like Keckhaver, or even a trained assassin like

549
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:25,740
the Brow. Must I resort to lewd exhibitionism like that Gabofram fellow to gain notoriety

550
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,700
in this so-called church? If you insist on making me the gollywog at the nuptials, wait

551
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,840
until you see my little dino-boy towel.

552
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:42,180
What was the barely articulated secret subtle guillotine blade of resentment I felt everywhere

553
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,660
I went?

554
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,640
What was the barely articulated secret subtle guillotine blade of resentment I felt everywhere

555
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:43,800
I went?

556
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,360
I went to the bathroom.

557
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,020
Huh?

558
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,280
You know I'm only in it for the collaboration, the late-night creativity sessions, the hearty,

559
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,840
masculine free interplay of fellowship and good, clean ideals, but I come up with the

560
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,780
ideas on my radio program, you steal them, and then somebody turns my microphone down

561
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,700
so you can get all the credit. I seem to be the gag writer for you guys. Yeah, you've

562
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,640
got a lot of nerve, Stank, printing my radio broadcast verbatim in that crummy little pamphlet

563
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,060
of yours.

564
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,460
than sending me your grocery lists when I asked for input?

565
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,480
Were you afraid we were shutting you out of our radio show?

566
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,060
Doesn't Doug constantly send you tapes of our performances?

567
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,920
Haven't we telephoned you during our 4.30 a.m. broadcasts again and again?

568
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,740
You simpering hypocrite.

569
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,260
My loyalty to you is unquestioned.

570
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,720
We never do a show without mentioning you,

571
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,660
but for that kind of treatment, at this kind of wage,

572
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,660
I'll go back to legitimate theater.

573
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,780
That'll show you.

574
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,000
Now, I didn't know what to expect when my train pulled into L.A.,

575
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,100
but I certainly didn't anticipate waiting

576
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,380
through lustrums and epicycles of cosmic time

577
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,500
to be picked up, and waiting in vain.

578
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,460
I couldn't believe that I was hooked up with such a bunch of bushleaguers.

579
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,220
But nobody came, and I was forced to rent a car,

580
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,500
despite the expense,

581
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,120
just because no taxi drivers would take me into that part of town.

582
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,760
Those precincts in the colorful Barrio de los Boratos,

583
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,560
section of Los Angeles,

584
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,340
wherein stands the stately Alexandria Hotel.

585
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,280
The hotel, oh, best beloved,

586
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,080
the hotel, how could I have been prepared for its retrofitted third-world charm,

587
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,060
for the tasteful red-plush Mexican velvet painting-style ambiance,

588
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,100
for the Latino wedding scheduled in our exhibition area,

589
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,480
at the same time as we were scheduled there,

590
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,160
for the bustling pharmaceutical exchange,

591
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,640
eternally,

592
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,840
active in the gentlemen's lounge and adjoining areas,

593
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,440
for the scientific thrill of collecting,

594
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,460
right on the premises,

595
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,960
our own three-foot field specimen of Ratus norwegicus,

596
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,680
only slightly decomposed.

597
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,120
Most of all, I remember the bungling of Guyon de Cruel,

598
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,360
our social director,

599
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,580
when he said he'd fix me up with a beautiful babe

600
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,140
who could out-speechify the late Vince Lombardi

601
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,760
for a deeply meaningful, warm, and sweet,

602
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:10,760


603
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,080
soul-sharing encounter with our comely stage manager,

604
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,120
particularly since I distinctly heard him utter a phrase

605
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,540
containing the word manager, as I handed him a slight premium.

606
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,840
But here, too, I was destined to be surprised.

607
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,700
Do not expect me to reveal the details of my night of passion

608
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,920
with Senora de Botulisma, the hotel manager at the Alex.

609
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:36,180
However, as a gentleman does not discuss that sort of thing in public.

610
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,680
Was it out of pique, then, I wonder, that Siri dragged the podium petulantly,

611
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,020
over the cable to the organ,

612
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,000
cutting off the accompaniment to my musical number,

613
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,480
when I attempted to sing my moving hymn to Dobbs,

614
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,780
Bob is My Story.

615
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Face it, it was a great song, but you gang of no-talents

616
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,920
all saw fit to conspire against me

617
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,820
just because your puerile adolescent attempts

618
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,980
at fulfilling your juvenile rock-and-roll fantasies

619
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,960
couldn't out-a-sludge with the ultra-sophisticates of the L.A. hip-wimp set.

620
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,760
But you had to go on and on,

621
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,600
way too long, exhausting the shallow patience of the crowd,

622
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,300
until, during the scant forty-five minutes of my song,

623
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,380
while that was going on, every ten minutes,

624
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,780
more and more of precisely the people who can best appreciate subgenius,

625
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,020
which is to say, appreciate my stuff,

626
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,940
left in droves.

627
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,660
Yes, history could have been made that night, but what can I say?

628
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,300
Being too short-sighted to turn the show over to me,

629
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,880
you all blew it completely.

630
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,920
At the time, it seemed that we were in a tight spot.

631
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,240
The audience was getting in an ugly mood.

632
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,840
We could even have been on the threshold of an S.O.B. club type of incident.

633
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,340
It seemed then that it would have been disloyal to whine and complain.

634
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,040
Now, however, it seems like a great idea.

635
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,400
Uh, His Holiness Dr. Howell, Master of Church Secrets,

636
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,900
P.S. Paul, you can forget my velvet dino-boy painting.

637
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,880
Just send me a grand and we'll call it even.

638
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,900
Hey, he does owe me a velvet dino-boy painting.

639
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,720
Hey, suddenly it comes back.

640
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,380
Wow.

641
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,700
Because that's the way the church is.

642
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,600
Coming back years later to stick up a fish.

643
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,180
He's slapped in the face with a fish.

644
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,280
The tar baby of religion is sticking up a fish.

645
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,380
You know that letter had certain points of accuracy.

646
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,360
There was a giant dead rat in there.

647
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,960
And there was a giant foam head.

648
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,080
And there was a giant horrible, screaming, spitting hotel manager also.

649
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,420
Yep. And there was a giant Lies riding around with a bullhorn, being a little dictator.

650
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,260
Yeah, he was like beyond control, I understand.

651
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,980
Way back in mountain time where the skies grind against the pavement.

652
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:50,380
You'll find the flavors that taste so good you'll have to savor the paste of yurd.

653
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,700
You say, what's the paste of yurd? I never heard of it.

654
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,860
They ain't got it in the store. I never heard of paste of yurd.

655
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,540
Well, it's pretty good paste. I've used it on my wife.

656
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,720
I've got some papers and my glue's taste good.

657
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,820
It tastes like the draper's been dopping up a gravy boat.

658
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,240
Pasting on my head, I love to eat it.

659
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,920
Doss of paper.

660
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,560
Got some monkeys on my shiny box head.

661
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,200
Got a dog, a cat, I've got eight foxes.

662
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,140
I got a big old smashed up orange Cadillac.

663
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,520
I pick up chicks, I drive home when I got three in the back.

664
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,980
That's a load to take her home.

665
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,420
I pick one up at six and one up at eight.

666
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,960
I pick up a couple more and I'll swing back at ten.

667
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,460
I got four girls in my car, it's time to take them home.

668
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,100
To my home.

669
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:02,380
Standing the line, two at a time, times two is plenty.

670
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,920
It's what I do.

671
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,120
Sally and Jane, you go in first.

672
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,900
The others can play in the living room and warm up the hearse.

673
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,140
I gotta delegate authority.

674
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,580
Get yourselves warmed up because it hurts my wrists.

675
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,560
To do all the work, the work for four women.

676
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,640
Delegate authority.

677
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,140
Jane do this and Margie do that.

678
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,700
Edwina do this and Sally do that.

679
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,840
Sometimes I do it all via the telephone.

680
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:57,080
I've got a team of scientists, supercomputers running my log of life from an electronic tube.

681
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,820
I've got a device in my ear, a device in my leg.

682
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,620
I've got four mechanical dicks tied to my waist.

683
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,940
Sex in the future.

684
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,420
Jane never understood the problems that I had.

685
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,020
The high tech solutions and the way she seemed drab.

686
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,320
I made her fuck a robot pill accord at the three wind.

687
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,520
Finally she was ready to come sit with me.

688
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,840
Get in the truck.

689
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,620
Jane wouldn't fuck the robot.

690
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,120
Gotta keep in the closet.

691
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,700
Come on everybody's fucking my robot.

692
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,120
Gotta keep in my closet.

693
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,780
I don't like to spend a lot of time on foreplay.

694
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,800
So I send my robot.

695
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,220
To play the games.

696
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,100
I ain't got time to play.

697
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,960
I ain't got no time for foreplay.

698
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,320
When you go to the doctor's office the nurse comes and talks to you and makes you wait a long long time.

699
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,980
The doctor just kind of comes in and takes care of business and leaves.

700
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,380
That's how I do it.

701
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,880
I don't have time for foreplay.

702
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:32,400
Not really interested in that because assembly line fornication requires a lot of delegation.

703
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,840
Delegation of authority.

704
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,660
You need a big mechanical robot in the closet that does exactly what you say.

705
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,700
Sometimes the robot gets lost and does the wrong thing to the wrong thing.

706
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,800
You walk out and the robot is mounting the refrigerator.

707
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Very unhappy women are sitting on the couch smoking cigarettes.

708
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,180
Things have gone astray.

709
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,520
Robot.

710
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,740
Robot.

711
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,920
Unhand the refrigerator and mount Sally.

712
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,660
Robot.

713
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,060
Do what he's told.

714
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,100
Robot.

715
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,000
Away from the air conditioner.

716
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,340
Robot.

717
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,020
Mary.

718
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,060
Do the robot.

719
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,820
Mary do the robot.

720
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,380
Do the robot does you.

721
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,440
Robot.

722
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,180
Mary.

723
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,180
Do the robot.

724
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,940
Mary do the robot.

725
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,620
Do the robot does you.

726
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,640
Sometimes I just watch as the robot works its way through the window.

727
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,820
What they are looking for.

728
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,600
And the robot still isn't there.

729
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,600
They just stop there.

730
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:45,600


731
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,180
Childhood.

732
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:56,180
Uh-huh.

733
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,200
Cute salespeople.

734
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:04,640
Y бр emerging in immersedということ in a really nutty world, and I'm asking myself whether

735
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,140
One, two, three.

736
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,700
Robot, destroy!

737
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,660
Your ill will and fornicate with these women.

738
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,120
Prepare them.

739
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,440
Prepare them for insertion into the device.

740
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
Prepare them.

741
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,200
Robot!

742
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,720
Do as you're told.

743
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,920
Robot will not obey one afternoon.

744
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,300
I don't know what I'm going to do with my robot.

745
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,920
Robot!

746
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,340
Soul harvest.

747
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,620
Soul harvest.

748
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,680
Evil games played with evil women.

749
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,300
Oh, poop on it.

750
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:22,700
Robot.

751
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,160
That was and will be Johnny Future.

752
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,660
And this is Hour of Slack.

753
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,420
Number 1045.

754
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:39,280
Earlier, we heard Dr. Howl on Puzzling Evidence with Philo and Kitty.

00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:44,360
And a live subgenius preaching at Winterstar of 2006.

Calsium helps you runs.

765
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,120
And all there is calcium.

766
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,820
Calcium helps you to enjoy more active runs.

767
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,520
And now there's calcium.

Yes, I creaky smooth delicious calcium cook instantly.

00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,900
whom made fun of me.

771
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:31,900


772
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:31,900


773
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:31,900


774
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:39,280
of us in junior high for wearing glasses. And aside from mindless abject worship of Bob, no matter

775
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:46,840
what he says or does, what are we into? Friends, the subgenius must have slack. Slack is what it's

776
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:52,400
all about. In fact, we thought about naming our new book Slack with a Vengeance. But I think it's

777
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:01,480
actually going to be called the Bobliagraphon, a subgenius cyclopedia. But the ancients knew slack,

778
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,860
friends. The yetis of fabled Mutantus built a great slack crystal that powered their whole

779
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:13,400
advanced civilization and allowed them to create the humans in a test tube. That was a terrible

780
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,960
mistake. They abused the knowledge of slack, friends. And that brings us to the question,

781
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:29,140
can there be too much slack? I hope not. Slack, what is slack? Of course, if you have to ask,

782
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,200
as you know, you'll never know.

783
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,640
No, wait. No, it's, those who know don't say, and those who say don't know.

784
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:41,480
I don't know. Maybe I do know, since I don't know anymore. I'm starting to forget.

785
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,320
We can teach you to forget, friends. You can learn to forget.

786
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:54,000
Slack can be gravitational. It can be electromagnetic. But usually it's glandular,

787
00:34:54,120 --> 00:35:01,460
friends. The wrong parts of the body can exude a type of slack.

788
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:08,880
Slack can be unseemly, wrongful slack. And there are some people, and this is sad, there are some

789
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:17,180
people who have conditional slack. Oh, I'll have slack when I get that raise. Oh, I'd have slack

790
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:23,120
if I could get, oh, three-week vacation a year instead of two. I'll have slack if that beloved

791
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,240
one would only love me back. Oh, oh, I know what slack really is. Slack is when you know which bands

792
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,120
are cool.

793
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,040
Friends, I am sorry, but most of these people would not know slack if it was lethally injected

794
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:45,340
into their collapsing veins. The devil owns you, friends. The devil owns you and me and

795
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:52,940
every one of us. But he doesn't own Bob. He owes Bob. The devil owns you, but he owes Bob.

796
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,000
You are one of Bob's payments to the devil.

797
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,240
Where would you rather be, my friend?

798
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,660
Would you rather be in the devil's back pocket or in Bob's?

799
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,720
Bob's playing pocket pool with me.

800
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:17,440
You can reach down there and feel that slack. Oh, yes. Your subgenius heritage is just running down

801
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:25,800
your jeans in no time. Slack, such the case may be. You can become a fount of slack, not a sponge.

802
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,460
Once you have slack, it just radiates everywhere. You can chew the slack.

803
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:39,160
You can chew the cud of slack forever. Just keep, because if you really know what, slack is just

804
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:46,980
appreciating what slack you already have. That's the honest truth. And it's sad, but the way that

805
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:53,560
most people finally learn how much slack they have is when it's taken away. And suddenly they go,

806
00:36:53,640 --> 00:37:00,220
oh my God, I was complaining that I didn't have enough money and I was rich as hell all this time.

807
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,440
And I'm sure you can all think of a different example of that. I personally am married to slack

808
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,540
in the form of Princess We Are Doe over here. We have a kind of a, but neither one of us has a

809
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:23,500
complete brain cell anymore. But you might say we have a kind of a joint brain. She represents one

810
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:30,080
type of subgenius and I'm another type. She is what we call a rewardian and I'm an emergentile.

811
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:38,180
Emergentiles are the ones that actually get slack from working too hard. It's hard to explain.

812
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,580
We don't just eat that hamburger. As Bob said, don't just eat that hamburger, eat the hell out of it.

813
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,180
The rewardians, on the other hand, have this whole, they have their own rituals.

814
00:37:52,060 --> 00:38:00,080
Rest implants. These are cake handling. Pyrocrastination.

815
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:11,660
Low browsing. Follow the gold-breaking road. And just eating a hamburger.

816
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:22,260
The Church of the Subgenius, friends, pardon my language, it's like having a pet you can fuck.

817
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,220
And that brings us to the magic of the Church of the Subgenius.

818
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:46,840
One of our spouting partners on the radio show, lonesome cowboy Dave. Dave noticed a high quotient of what we call idiot synchronicities last week.

819
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:55,080
You know, well you'll find out when you leave tomorrow, probably every newspaper you'll still have the name Bob on it or something like that.

820
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,660
Or you'll see some sign that says slack and then you'll see another one. Synchronicities, you know.

821
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,460
As a result of the radio show.

822
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,700
And as I told Dave, I said, look, it was a full moon last week and your lunacy causes you to notice those things.

823
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:15,440
Bob makes simple coincidences happen so that your human brain will misinterpret them as being meaningful.

824
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:21,520
But it's the same difference, see? If you think it's meaningful, it is. That's the magic.

825
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:28,080
That's how the magic happens. Why does Bob do this? So that you'll feel special.

826
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,460
So that you'll feel like Bob.

827
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,720
Your $30 for that Subgenius minister's card was not wasted.

828
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:49,580
It makes you feel that the magic is happening and it is. It's the magic of your mind, your human mind, misinterpreting such a simple thing as magic.

829
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:57,860
But, you know, the magic world has been cluttered by a lot of kookademic jibber jabber.

830
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,240
You know what I mean?

831
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,460
Sometimes it seems like magic.

832
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,080
It seems like the people who believe in the magic are the most unlucky.

833
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,400
And self-reassuring bullshit tends to be self-regenerating.

834
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,640
And that's why we see so many pests in our community who never got past mysticism 101.

835
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,880
They get just far enough to where they can start generating their own bullshit and they just eat their own.

836
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,180
They eat up their own crap as fast as they can spew it out.

837
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,040
There is not exactly.

838
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:31,960
They eat up their own crap.

839
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,820
There is not exactly mysticism 102.

840
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:38,700
And the ones who know that are the ones who are teaching mysticism 101.

841
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:48,720
As Bob said, shit in one hand, puke in the other and see which one fills up first.

842
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,860
And that brings me to the problem of subgenius kooks.

843
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,740
Yes, believe it or not, there are kooks in the church of the subgenius.

844
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,700
You know, well, that's a mean thing to say.

845
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,320
I mean, you know.

846
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,920
We're all kooks on some level.

847
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:13,440
But I've got to admit, there are times when I regret the fact that the church of the subgenius does, yes, make assholes worse.

848
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,980
It's not the only one in the cult that does that.

849
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,060
You know, but hump them if they can't take a joke, I guess.

850
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,040
The pink boy's got a Bob complex.

851
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,160
And so we find these people who take themselves real seriously.

852
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:40,300
And when they find out that, like, if you don't take yourself real seriously and they find out you don't take yourself real seriously,

853
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,740
they won't like you because that indicates that you may not take them all that seriously either.

854
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,420
And I know that you know who I'm talking about.

855
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,360
Half of you are going, yeah, that guy's sitting next to me.

856
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,360
Some of us, luckily, take drugs seriously.

857
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,120
But I'm not talking about your conspiracy street drugs.

858
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,400
All that stuff that they're having the war on.

859
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,380
We're trying to get people to turn their heads inside out.

860
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,720
To make your head examine itself.

861
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,360
Not a pretty sight.

862
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:19,760
But by studying J.R. Bob Dog's frappetic utterances or listening to his prophecy on the hour of slack.

863
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,000
Well, that's the thing.

864
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:30,240
We put together these media shows that are designed to replace drugs by devolving your mind down far enough to make you almost normal.

865
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,200
And then suddenly their music sounds good.

866
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,720
One time I took, when I was in college, I took a bunch of Thorazine.

867
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,900
And for the first time, Black Sabbath sounded fantastic.

868
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,440
I hate to say it.

869
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,320
Yeah, but yeah, the drug of the church and the subgenius can make you so stupid that you're almost normal.

870
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,980
Which for a subgenius is really pretty messed up.

871
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,780
It's like being high, only a lot stupider.

872
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:10,000
Now, we've noticed over the years that pot, marijuana, and the church of the subgenius have something in common.

873
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:16,200
They both attract both very smart people and very dumb people.

874
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:22,760
And we figured out that the very smart ones like pot because it makes them feel dumber.

875
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,440
And the very dumb people like pot because it makes them feel smarter.

876
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,720
The church of the subgenius helps prevent...

877
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,840
smart people from thinking they're smarter than they are.

878
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,620
And it prevents dumb people from thinking they're dumber than they are.

879
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,500
And they both like the way pot makes them feel.

880
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,000
And they like the way the church of the subgenius makes them think.

881
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,220
Now, many ask, Reverend Stag, Bob's smoking that pipe!

882
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,880
I bet I know what's in that pipe, man.

883
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,540
What were you guys on when you came up with that stuff?

884
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,160
Does the pipe equal drugs?

885
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:58,800
Nay!

886
00:43:59,020 --> 00:43:59,540
Nay!

887
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,180
The pipe does not mean drugs.

888
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:01,460
Friends.

889
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,240
The pipe, that pipe stem is a tunnel to knowledge.

890
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,660
That's what it's a pipeline to eternal slackdomness.

891
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:15,260
Your path to the very lungs of Bob are in that pipe.

892
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:20,160
If you can butt, throw your butt into that pipe and light yourself,

893
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,040
it's better than sex or crack, my friends.

894
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,920
And the meaning of life lies at the other end of Bob's pipe.

895
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,240
So you have to ask yourself, are you ready?

896
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,380
You thought the fundamentalists were crazy.

897
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,900
You can be a billion times crazier.

898
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:44,340
Yes, friends, you can, as Bob said, you can relax in the safety of your own delusions.

899
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,760
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

900
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,300
You're still blind, but at least it's your wool.

901
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,540
And as I said, the point is, Bob can teach you to forget.

902
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,700
You can learn to forget. You can forget your old life.

903
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,500
Oh, oh, Bob, I tried to be normal, Bob.

904
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,280
But they called me nerd.

905
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,380
They called me Trekkie.

906
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,840
They called me old one penis.

907
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,840
It's just not fair, Bob.

908
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:22,560
Friends, that's why it's up to you to pull yourself up by your own big red straps.

909
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,980
Tomorrow might be X day.

910
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,320
We don't know what time.

911
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,600
Why do you even think this planet is Earth?

912
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,160
Do you know that for sure?

913
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,580
I don't know. You're so sure of everything.

914
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,300
But you know nothing. You know nothing, I tell you.

915
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,800
Oh, but Bob's immaculation.

916
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,300
That didn't really happen, did it, Reverend Stang?

917
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,280
That's just a metaphor.

918
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,380
Bob was just a man, that's all.

919
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,440
Just a teacher. A great teacher.

920
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,680
My God!

921
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,240
If the immaculation was nothing but a metaphor,

922
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,100
then the whole Church of the Subgenius might as well be just a joke.

923
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,340
Friends, you have got to let loose.

924
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,560
Just the Bob in you.

925
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,040
Beat the slack into that child.

926
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,440
Speaking of which...

927
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:12,700
Uh-huh.

928
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,540
Actually, I'm going to recommend a book.

929
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:14,720
Have you heard this name?

930
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,700
If I may, my opinion, I enjoyed reading this book.

931
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,040
It was called 1491.

932
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,340
And it just came out last year.

933
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,040
So it, uh, you might find that in your public library.

934
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:25,840
Who wrote that?

935
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,860
I can't remember the guy's name. Let me look that up here.

936
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,800
There's a wonderful book called,

937
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,040
A Distant Mirror.

938
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,560
I think the author's name is Barbara Tuckman.

939
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,200
I could be wrong, but the title is A Distant Mirror.

940
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,440
She's a historian, and this particular book,

941
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:48,960
uh, is a really vivid account of life in, around that time in Europe.

942
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,880
The 1300s and 1400s, when the plague hit, and the Crusades were going on.

943
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,640
She followed a, had a particular French nobleman who had a lot of,

944
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,620
whose life was well recorded.

945
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,580
Looks like the author's name was, uh, Charles C. Mann.

946
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,500
With two N's.

947
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,420
On 1491.

948
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:07,800
1491.

949
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,860
What a fake name.

950
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,400
On, in the year 1491,

951
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,060
Columbus had a little son.

952
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,100
Bob Numbus sailed the ocean scum.

953
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,820
That's the year, uh, Henry VIII was born.

954
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,560
Bottled Numbus.

955
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:25,280
Well, there are crackpots who believe that, uh, Amerigo was, uh,

956
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:30,780
some kind of Masonic super-Uber land that, uh, this fake Christopher Columbus was sent to.

957
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,440
Uh, I don't know why they want to take credit for the guy.

958
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,360
I guess he turned out to be a little bit nasty.

959
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,260
He and his brother kind of went mad, you know?

960
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,440
Mm.

961
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:46,960
Have you ever heard these tales of, uh, wiping out the Arawaks and the Caribs of millions and millions of people just by being real jerks?

962
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,740
Uh, you know, I've, I've heard a number of, uh, stories about, uh...

963
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,240
Yeah. I, I hear stuff like that every Columbus Day.

964
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,280
Yeah. And, and, uh, in Mexico they call it Dia de la Raza.

965
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,780
They consider that, like, the, uh, the anniversary of the first, uh,

966
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,400
founding of, of their very culture.

967
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,820
Because it, it's like the three-way.

968
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:11,540
Yeah, well, you, you have the, uh, the Spanish culture merging with the, the local, uh, you know, Indian culture.

969
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,680
And then they merge together to form the, the third culture.

970
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,660
And so that's a really big holiday in Mexico, I guess.

971
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,000
I did not know that.

972
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,440
And Italian Americans are, tend to observe it more, too.

973
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,420
Because, you know, Columbus was a famous Italian who did great things.

974
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,140
If you want to call them.

975
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:29,240
No.

976
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,400
I mean, I, I, sure, they're great.

977
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,560
Some of them were greatly bad.

978
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,480
Some of them, uh, I don't know.

979
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:39,960
If a certain sea battle had gone a different way, this would probably be, we'd all be speaking Portuguese.

980
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,860
Well, that's, that's conceivable.

981
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,620
Or Spanish.

982
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:50,260
Or if, um, Benedict Arnold hadn't been caught, Canada would be part of the United States right now.

983
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:56,880
Now, I understand there's a movie out called, uh, Confederate States of America, or CSA.

984
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,760
Yes. It's a fake documentary.

985
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,220
Right.

986
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:03,580
A fake documentary about what if the South had won the Civil War.

987
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:11,280
America ends up siding with Germany during World War II, I believe, and, and bombs Japan on Pearl Harbor Day.

988
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,440
Wow.

989
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,080
There's, uh, there's another.

990
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,560
I can't wait to see this movie.

991
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,560
There's a series of.

992
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:24,540
It sounds really, uh, and, oh, and because of slavery still happening in the United States, uh, the slaves, uh, flee to Canada.

993
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,540
And Canada becomes the home of rock and roll, jazz, free expression.

994
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:28,720
Right.

995
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,500
Well, that's conceivable.

996
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,420
Yeah, yeah.

997
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,780
Well, if there is a second Civil War, it'd be like on the, on the level of a Cold War, wouldn't it?

998
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,940
Well, this was a, a what if, uh, the, the South had won.

999
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:42,500
Right.

1000
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:47,540
Actually, I'm gonna recommend another, uh, an alternate history book, uh, by an author named Harry Turtledove.

1001
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:48,860
I can't remember the.

1002
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,200
Yeah, he's well known for alternate history.

1003
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,580
Yeah, he, he wrote an excellent one about, um, well, I think it's excellent anyway, um.

1004
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,540
Did he do that Rutger Hauer movie, Fatherland?

1005
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,640
I don't know.

1006
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,640
Fatherland, he goes back to kill himself like all of, what's his name's principal.

1007
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,040
He's, he's Hitler's son, right?

1008
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,260
All right, I'm gonna free up a phone line here.

1009
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,200
Hitler's like, uh, reptilian Diogenes' son or something like that.

1010
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,200
Six days, seven.

1011
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,920
He goes, he takes a time machine or some sort of one of the new government sex pills or something like that.

1012
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:27,580
He goes back to 1939 and he becomes, uh, Hitler's favorite guy and then later kills him.

1013
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,240
Or tries to.

1014
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:29,720
Yeah.

1015
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,340
Is that, is that the, pretty much the premise of it?

1016
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:33,140
No.

1017
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:33,600
No.

1018
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,100
No.

1019
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,260
No, actually in, uh.

1020
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:39,860
I think you're thinking of, uh, Life of Bob chapter three, the Neuronicon.

1021
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:40,580
The Neuronicon?

1022
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:41,580
Yeah.

1023
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,940
The Encyclopedia Neurotica.

1024
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,140
That's a strong one.

1025
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:43,480
Went back in time.

1026
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,580
He killed Hitler, but he also had, he accidentally, there's a Futurama based on this.

1027
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:54,360
He accidentally killed his grandfather, so he had to make love to his own grandmother so that he would be born.

1028
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,860
But in a way, fathering himself.

1029
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,620
Grandfathering himself.

1030
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,060
Grandfathering himself.

1031
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,720
Ah, my own grandpa.

1032
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:10,360
In his DNA, he was resistant to, uh, uh, rays that, uh, these flying brains would emit that would make people stupid.

1033
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,540
He was immune to that.

1034
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,760
Well, Hitler was his own, uh, uncle and his own cousin or something like that.

1035
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,520
He was, uh, a little inbred.

1036
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,200
Well, these are Hellenized myths.

1037
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,600
You know, when you create any new hero, you have to come up with some kind of supernatural birth or death.

1038
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,840
Like in the case of Bob there, having sex with his own grandmother is not something that you can do.

1039
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,480
It's something that, you know, most of us haven't at least dreamed of.

1040
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,480
The idea to be self-born.

1041
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,300
You know, I've seen some pictures of, uh...

1042
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,900
Chicken sandwiches, and that's, that's the real lure of it.

1043
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,260
Germany consented to incest because they knew that they had to populate the fatherland.

1044
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:48,560
They didn't care, you know, uh, how they, how they created babies just as long as they were creating babies.

1045
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,440
And that the gene pool remained pure.

1046
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:56,600
Anytime we populate or have sexual, even with ourselves, we are trying to maintain the fatherland.

1047
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:02,500
We're trying to reproduce to replete the depleted mankind accordion.

1048
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,520
We're trying to bring ourselves as the only creature.

1049
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:11,680
No, it doesn't count if you're just, like, onanning into your, uh, Kleenex.

1050
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,900
Yeah, we're gonna...

1051
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,280
That's so bleak.

1052
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,620
Oh, dear.

1053
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,840
That's such a bleak view.

1054
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,460
Onanism is pure semiotics.

1055
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,880
That's all I'm doing is just masturbating when I'm doing this.

1056
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,600
Onanism is pure semiotics.

1057
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,940
And, uh, with that...

1058
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,700
Oh, boy.

1059
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,440
Actually, that's in the intro sequence to my shows.

1060
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,760
Somebody's saying, onanism is pure semiotics.

1061
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:33,620
Well, nano-onans are, are what we're all created.

1062
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:42,960
We're, every subgenius is created out of quadrillions of nano-onans that seek to, to change whatever, whatever they encounter.

1063
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,300
That's a creepy thought.

1064
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,440
Nano-onans?

1065
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,760
I'm sorry, I was born from, from a, from a mega-onan.

1066
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:53,160
Well, I just crawled out of one of those yeast infections and here I am.

1067
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,600
I don't see anything, uh, period.

1068
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,460
Hey, it's almost yeaster.

1069
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:02,940
Some, uh, you ever have a beer that has, uh, yeast on the bottom of the bottle?

1070
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,160
A beard?

1071
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,140
Beer with yeast on the bottom of the bottle?

1072
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,740
Oh, I've had a yeast infection in my beard.

1073
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,380
Not in your beard.

1074
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,920
It's my pubic goatee, so it's...

1075
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,420
Right, right.

1076
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:10,900
Never mind.

1077
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,100
Never mind.

1078
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:17,460
I'm talking about bottle conditioning of, uh, tasty fermented beverages.

1079
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,060
But anyway.

1080
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,540
I don't know about you, Neves Niscus.

1081
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,620
Don't leave me alone with these clowns, please.

1082
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,480
Pleasure is where you find it.

1083
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,580
And many of us are not alone.

1084
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:25,580


1085
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:25,580


1086
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:25,580


1087
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:25,580


1088
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:25,740
And here comes the guy in your head.

1089
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,940
A bottle that's a bottle.

1090
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,620
Bottom of a bottle.

1091
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,380
And stumble around for a long time.

1092
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,260
Yeah, we...

1093
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:33,540
You know, I'm, uh, I'm, I'm seeing triple vision right now as we speak.

1094
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,960
Beer goggles.

1095
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,380
Your eyes are not blurred.

1096
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,480
You actually grown new retinas.

1097
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,340
No, Reverend Triple Vision just entered the station.

1098
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,100
No wonder nobody can see him three times.

1099
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,200
I'm going to kill you.

1100
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:45,780
I'm going to kill you.

1101
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,060
Wednesday.

1102
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,220
Man shot an arrow into the air.

1103
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,160
Completely gone.

1104
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,060
When did your first lose contact?

1105
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:52,900
Contact was broken.

1106
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,780
Bob's commanding.

1107
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,120
They shot an arrow into the air.

1108
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,240
Naked News TV is here.

1109
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,040
We're doing it naked.

1110
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:58,820
Uncharted asteroid.

1111
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,820
And as of this moment, there is little certainty.

1112
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:01,860
We're in bad shape.

1113
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:02,720
It's hot, see?

1114
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:03,760
It's very hot.

1115
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,260
This man's gonna die!

1116
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:06,980
That's odd.

1117
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,540
I'll kill you!

1118
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,360
Spoiler for the game.

1119
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,280
Did you see?

1120
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,440
Well, maybe I could get some kind of a fix.

1121
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,660
I went west towards nothing.

1122
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:14,700
I wanna know why.

1123
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:15,840
You're out of your mind!

1124
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,440
I was wrong.

1125
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,220
I must have been wrong.

1126
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,540
He was trying to tell us something.

1127
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,380
What do you suppose he...

1128
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,200
You're demented.

1129
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,120
You're out of your mind.

1130
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:21,980
You're already...

1131
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,200
This is a jungle where only the tough animals survive.

1132
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,160
Think, think.

1133
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,380
Probes at the back of your head.

1134
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,140
If you stop, maybe sanity will get you by the throat.

1135
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:28,500
Oh!

1136
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,380
We never left the Earth.

1137
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,500
We just crashed back into it!

1138
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,000
Practical joke perpetrated by Mother Nature.

1139
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,420
Small human drama.

1140
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,180
And of course, the Twilight Zone.

1141
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,300
Noriel Preff did that.

1142
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,880
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1143
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,940
Of famous subgenius.com.

1144
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,100
The background music is The Amino Acids.

1145
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:17,460
Smogon.

1146
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,280
Produced and directed by Virginia Moo, Ralph Moo, and Sammy Moo.

1147
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,740
The script was specially written for Smogon by Sammy Moo, Ralph Moo, and Virginia Moo.

1148
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:32,780
With editorial supervision by Ralph Moo, Virginia Moo, and Sammy Moo.

1149
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,040
The music was composed and conducted by Virginia Moo, Ralph Moo, and Bill Moo.

1150
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,800
Sound patterns by Ray Moo and Sammy Moo.

1151
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:44,540
Featured in the cast were Sammy Moo, Ray Moo, Bill Moo, and Ralph Moo as Cock.

1152
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,260
And Virginia Moo as Kit-Kit.

1153
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,420
Join us again next week for another specially transcribed story on...

1154
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:51,960
The Smogon.

1155
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:51,960


1156
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:51,960


1157
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:51,960


1158
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:51,960


1159
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:51,960


1160
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:51,960


1161
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:51,960


1162
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:51,960


1163
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:51,960


1164
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,380
Smogon.

1165
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:04,060
And thanks to WCSB for letting us use their microphones and recorders.

1166
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,960
Here's hoping it all blows up real soon.

1167
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,180
Uh.

1168
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,680
And now...

1169
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,700
Uh.

1170
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,040
Arrhythmic dodges from the Prince of Pants.

1171
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,880
Excuse NCI.

1172
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,980
This is Ape World.

1173
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,760
I-I-I-I'm President Bush.

1174
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:21,940
I'm President Bush.

1175
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:21,940


1176
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:27,700
The winners of the record-breaking, record-breaking, break-break-breaking, bald power pot jack step forward Wednesday to claim their prize.

1177
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,600
The eight co-workers from North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia will each receive about $22 before taxes.

1178
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:40,920
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling for increased scrutiny of a deal that would allow increased scrutiny of the White House.

1179
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,880
There is nothing wrong.

1180
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,780
There is nothing wrong.

1181
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,740
There is nothing wrong.

1182
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,580
There is nothing wrong.

1183
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,480
And President Bush will name 15 new Cardinals Wednesday.

1184
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:50,200
The new Cardinals come from Nebraska or in Iraq.

1185
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,840
Dozens of Cardinals have been attacked.

1186
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:51,940
Dozens of Cardinals have been attacked.

1187
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,180
The project of burned-in retaliation from 11 new Cardinals eligible to vote is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is including Ape World.

1188
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,680
The Arvetleyna.

1189
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,880
Throughout history, gigantic creatures, pastors, and saints have been born in the church pulpit.

1190
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,600
The Arvetleyna.

1191
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:17,180
In a moment, I'll tell you about the gigantic pastor who stirred himself before he could complete it and has remained at Mount Vernon ever since.

1192
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,960
The Arvetleyna.

1193
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,240
What are your dreams for ten years from now?

1194
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,380
Perhaps you'd like to abroad.

1195
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,340
Ten years, comfortable broads will certainly be available.

1196
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,600
Well, if you've been counting on future leisure broads,

1197
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,840
or a college broad for your children,

1198
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,420
or a time abroad of your own,

1199
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,200
the solution is still the same.

1200
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,640
My broads.

1201
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,360
Purchase them the easy, automatic way where you work,

1202
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,740
through the broad of the month plan.

1203
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,240
Broad are profitable.

1204
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,220
For every $3 invested today,

1205
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,320
you'll receive four mature broads.

1206
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,900
Remember, buy a broad through the broad of the month savings plan.

1207
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,400
Recently, in a big eastern city,

1208
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,620
a group of trained housewives asked this simple question.

1209
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,240
What food do you buy?

1210
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,880
An overwhelming majority of housewives said they preferred to buy small children,

1211
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,360
and by a ratio of more than 8 to 1,

1212
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,560
they insisted on prepared babies packed in glass.

1213
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,220
Here are the reasons.

1214
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:25,540
First, you can heat, serve, and store leftover babies in the same glass container.

1215
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:31,980
Second, you can buy an increasing number of the better brands of young, sterilized babies packed in glass.

1216
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:34,660
Four.

1217
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:35,280
Four.

1218
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,280
Yeah.

1219
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:38,820
Uh-huh.

1220
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,380
Yes, sir.

1221
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,100
Uh-huh.

1222
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:43,660
Uh-huh.

1223
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,160
Uh-huh.

1224
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,040
Uh-huh.

1225
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,080
Yes, sir.

1226
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,600
Uh-huh.

1227
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,020
Uh-huh.

1228
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:48,300
Uh-huh.

1229
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,300


1230
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,260
Uh-huh.

1231
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:49,880
Uh-huh.

1232
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:50,160


1233
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:50,460
Uh-huh.

1234
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:50,900
Uh-huh.

1235
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,620
Uh-huh.

1236
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,020
A word of advice for those of you who suffer.

1237
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,400
Who do you know about the little white tablet?

1238
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,420
Just waiting for the moment when you need them.

1239
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,240
Best for any kind of distress.

1240
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,300
Keep under control.

1241
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,000
The modern formula has never been surpassed for effectiveness.

1242
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,160
Only 49 cents.

1243
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,220
Impulsive spending and goals and...

1244
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:18,860
Things like that.

1245
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,140
Dope everybody up.

1246
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:20,440
Right.

1247
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,700
Dope everybody up.

1248
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:22,840
And...

1249
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,120
Yup.

1250
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,160
Dope everybody up.

1251
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,280
And...

1252
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:25,740
Yes.

1253
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,240
Just dope everybody up.

1254
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:27,500
Yup.

1255
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,200
Dope.

1256
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:28,520
Dope.

1257
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,300
And, uh...

1258
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:29,900
Dope.

1259
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:33,620
Dope.

1260
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:35,800
1240 PM.

1261
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:36,620
Uh-huh.

1262
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,320
Certainly is.

1263
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,300
What's your problem?

1264
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,480
No, no, not at all.

1265
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:39,880
Yeah.

1266
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:40,220
Yeah.

1267
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:40,600
Yeah.

1268
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,060
Uh-huh.

1269
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,040
Yeah.

1270
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:43,540
Yes.

1271
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:43,880
Yeah.

1272
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:44,160
No.

1273
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:44,540
Yeah.

1274
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:44,940
Yeah.

1275
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:45,640
No.

1276
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,080
Yeah.

1277
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:46,480
Right.
