Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
Tonight we add another name to the long list of those we have honored.
The truth that I'm about to give you has exploded.
In power!
Woo!
Woo!
Thank you, though, I'm enjoying this.
Buried within the uncharted depths of waters surrounding a group of islands off the 50th parallel
lies man's most formidable challenge.
The awesome awakening of prehistoric monsters longed for extinct.
Savage and deadly,
their one hope is to rule our planet,
as they once had thousands of years back.
And that ain't all!
Shit!
Science was baffled and powerless.
This is confusing!
A terror-stricken humanity knew that it was on the brink of total destruction.
Heh heh heh! Well, things are looking up!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
A once proud civilization now had to place its trust and hope in Godzilla and his powerful ally,
Bob.
Bob.
Titan against Titan.
Giant against giant in the most spectacular battle yet.
But things weren't normal.
There were changes.
Ah!
Ah!

Ah!
Your mother bit me!
I never saw him by like that.
It's a beautiful sight!
Strange, frightful changes.
That night, it all started.
Stop doing that.

This was the Night of the Crawling Terror.
American International presents...
The Subgenius Hour of Swatch!
Hosted by your friend and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.
Uh, yes, uh, thank you, Joe.
Uh, joined tonight, dear friends, by Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence, yes, and of course, uh, Reverend Joe Riley,
whose, whose, uh, brand new media barrage tape will be hearing the cuts of...
Have the technology, have the tapes.
Bob told me to make this.
Not gonna resist.

Ah, yes, dear friends, and tonight, it's a re-run.
From nineteen and ninety-seven, I calculate.
This cassette master here says,
Hour of Slack, 356, Joe Riley barrage, and KPFA with Stang,
which means I must have been in, uh, California and done a, a show at, uh, KPFA in Berkeley with puzzling evidence and all them,
and, and I know that Joe Riley did this incredible, uh,
but, barrage, sort of a, a collage, a media barrage tape.
In fact, my, it says here, some sort of note that I believe this is a re-run of a re-run,
because it was run as Hour of Slack 681, now being Hour of Slack number nine hundred and eighteen.
Uh, oh yes, yes, yes.
It's Candy Frappy.
It's Frappy Candy.

You're both right.

Yeah, Frappy Candy, Candy Frappy.
Well, I can see these two won't need any words or worms for several days now, I should say, I think.

On this tape, you'll hear rantings from every two-bit B-movie actor ever born,
cold, precision auto monster boys,
and from hundreds of dysfunctional infortunates across our globe.
Oh, hi there.
How do you do?
I'm your new neighbor, Herman Munster.
Thank you.
Welcome to Mission Control, space travelers.
What the hell are you doing, Lee?
I'm watching Bob.
You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Krusty used to be.
You backstabber, you traitor, you...
Snap out of it, Bart.
Um, I lost my job.
I had a job.
Now I don't...
Ah!
I want you to be like me.
I want you to worship me.
I want you to feel like I am.
I want you to enjoy the fearlessness that I have,
the courage that I have,
the compassion that I have,
the love that I have,
the all-encompassing mercy that I have.
I want you to be what I am and something greater.
I want you to give you more than I have.
I want you to be greater than I am.
And if you don't want to go this route,
then go to hell where you want to, but don't bother me.
I really didn't realize it.
I told you, heal my back, heal my bottom,
but don't you heal my mind, because my mind is too sick.
Christianity was never based on the idea of an unknown God.
I'm going to cause you to know that you are what Jesus was.
Jesus said that every human being was a God.
It is written that you are God.
I'm a God and you're a God.
And I'm a God and I'm going to stay a God
until you recognize that you're a God.
And when you recognize you're a God,
I shall go back into principle and will not appear as a personality.
You are God.
And until I see all of you know who you are,
I'm going to be very much what I am.

Silence, Kay.
Yes, your hands are covered with the blood
of the thousands of souls that you have murdered.
Murdered?
But I never murdered anyone.
Not with a sword.
But you have sentenced a thousand souls to hell
with your malicious tongue.
It would have been a thousand times better
had you murdered them with a sword.
Oh, no.
But I never said anything about anyone except what was true.
I only spoke the truth.
No, Kay.
You spoke that which you wanted to be true.
But granting that you did only speak the truth,
who gave you license to defame and destroy the character of others?
The serpent with his venom and his ire,
with his slimy, slithery foes and his noiseless crawl,
with his deadly call and fatal fang
is the only fit emblem
of the world.
Of the man or woman
who stabs and kills the character of another.
Let your own words condemn you.
May 10th, 1973.
Linda's been such a good friend in spiritual health.
Well, when you've known her as long as I have,
you'll really get to know her.
What do you mean?
She's not as concerned about your spiritual life as you think.
She's just a good friend.
But I'm not one to say anything.
You just call me when you need advice.
Well, I've got a lot to do.
I have to go.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Oh, no.
Well, I didn't think being a Christian was going to be like that.
I don't believe I want any part of it.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
My God, have mercy on me.
I never realized.
Have mercy on me.
You, Kay, with your gossipy tongue,
have driven the babes away from my church.
You have in your lifetime destroyed the weak among my flock.
You never knew what it meant to show mercy.
Would you dare ask this court of mercy?
There is no mercy for you.
You are sentenced to hell where you will be haunted forever
by the souls you sinned.
Oh, no.
I don't want to go to hell.
You can't send me to hell for something I didn't know.
I didn't know.
I only repeated what I heard.
You didn't know that the most fearful of all crimes
is the crime of gossip.
Your record will speak for itself.
Oh, no.
But yes, friends, send in that love offering, that check,
addressed to Tammy Faye Dobbs,
daughter of Connie,
and the wife of my son,

Oh, that felt so good.
I forgot.
Oh, look out!
Evelyn Donut.
Call her!
Well, call her right outside the building.
Come on.
I hope you all enjoyed that brief moment of silence you had there.
It was almost a half second.
That will last forever in my memory.
First time ever.
Okay, no.
Oh, we got some more.
Why do I?
I feel that they're...
Bergman knew how to use silence.
The silence of the soul.
Sure is nice out here.
I hope the boat comes, though.
Fellini knew how to use silence.
But that horrible boatman with his grisly hands.
Yeah, I know.
Don't touch him.
That giant flaming oar.
Mr. Boatman.
Please, Mr. Boatman.
And look, you have to put a coin on his tongue,
and it's all black and icky.
Climb aboard, Dr. Howell Robbins.
No, no.
And be prepared to go past my dog,
my three-headed dog's cerebrus.
Oh, he looks rather cerebral.
The triple-brained monster which guards the gates,
the gateway.
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.
What's he reading from?
Yes, I am away...
It's a B-movie script.
...into eternal fall.
I am away from forsaken people.
Gee, you're right.
I know.
I'm not Virgil, said Dobbs.
It is getting hot in here.
Only those who came in time cannot bear
what were made beyond me and beyond time, my staff.
Yeah.
Bob and Virgil went several levels further down into hell.
It makes you forget all about the ocean.
Suddenly, Bob, shifting his plight from one hand to the other,
pulled out from his voluminous ditty bag
a sop of cakes with wine and honey,
fermented, which he threw dexterously into the slavering three mouths
of the three-headed monster which guarded the cavernous...
...and his campers.
...to infund the world.
And in return, he was given a mighty blivet by Satan.
And a mighty belt shook the canine's, uh...
Uh...
...bulging stomach.
His three-headed, uh...
His three-headed thing...
...wafted in the air.
That's enough of horrible horticultural facts
from the world of mythology.
His gigantic, postulous, scabrous hide quivered unspeakably,
as with canine lust, he scraped his hindquarters across the floor,
howling and dribbling from all three heads simultaneously.
Huge ticks the size of small land crabs leaped from his fur-sparse epidermis.
Suddenly, the dog leaped across the vast expanse of hell
and saddled up to Ivan's leg.
Yes, he was forced to be on the show hour after hour.
P-Dawg, why did you make me do that horrible thing?
Yes.
Yes, the bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling
for you and not for me.
Take my glands away, King P-Dawg.
They bang and bong and bing-a-ling-a-ling and ring eternally.
Yeah, they don't ever stop.
That's from Cerebus the P-Dawg.
They all go for Ivan's leg.
Ow! Get that damn...
Get those horrible little poodles off of me!
I hate poodles!
That was Madame Wazonga and her dancing chihuahuas
performing once again on the subgenius hour of mystery and dark.
That was really a beautiful little dance number, Dr. Howell.

You know that there's a certain song that we have to play

It's called the tune-up song, you know?

Yeah, there, baby. You can sit down.
There's a little rocker there, yeah.
Yeah.

Just remember you don't have anything on me that I care about.
Because everything you have on me I've left it all hanging right out for everybody to see.
Now you are getting worried about yourself.
I don't mind losing my life.
What about you?
I don't mind losing my reputation.
What about you?
What about me?
I don't mind being tortured. What about you?
I'm just no longer afraid and I've lost interest in this old world of capitalist sin.
Racism, I've lost interest in it.
So if somebody wants to make me stay in it by compromising with filthy-minded people
that cannot even have respect for somebody that would die for even his enemies
and they want to cause anarchy in our midst,
I would just as soon bring it all to a gallant, a glorious screaming end.
Your ultimate goal on this adventure through inner space
will be the very hub of this microcosm.
The microcosmic solar system, the atomic nucleus.
Its capabilities are almost unimaginable.
It is a million times smaller than the atom
and yet it contains 99% of the atom's weight.
The density of the nucleus is such that if we had one cubic centimeter,
half a teaspoon, it would weigh 100 million tons.
And at the same time, with 250 units of tetanus immune globules,
we would have a total of 1.5 trillion human cells.

Cleve told me...
There was a little incident that happened to him the other day.
He was standing in a nearly deserted Boston subway station.
Tell it, brother, tell it.
There was a drunk standing on the other side across from him.
And he said,
What's your name?
And Cleve, not wanting to tell his real name, said, Bob.
That's right, he said Bob.
And the drunk said,
All the best drunks are named Bob.
In fact, the greatest drunk on earth is named Bob.
Oh, he sure is.
And then that man...
He was running...
...got down on his hands and knees and he licked that third rail.
How many of you listening by radio can lick that third rail?
How many of you have been sitting the way Bob wanted you to, huh?
You've just been sitting on your little fannies, your tokuses...
Yes.
...sitting there praising Bob, singing hymns to Bob,
but you're afraid to get out there and whoop P-Dawg for Bob, huh?
Aren't you being a little harsh with these people?
In particular...
...you Californians are so laid back.
We're into violence and hate in Texas.
I mean, we thought Bob was a nice guru.
We thought he was a good guy.
We thought he was, like, on our side.
Look, we didn't give you all that ammo just to praise him.
Just to praise his sweet name.
I didn't get any ammo.
I got some PCP.
Well, you'd best be glad.
But I didn't get no ammo.

There's little kids in China who don't even get any PCP.

Something unwholesome about that critter.
Don't look at it too close up, little show.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.








There's kind of a capacity there for isolation.
Yeah, we thought we'd get as far away as we could and then give you a call, so it's the
bad show again.
Well, good.
We're going to take those chromosomes and DNA fragments from that.
And mix them all around.
And somehow mediate a recombination between those two types of DNA.
Just plop them in the plumber's closet and let them realign on the wall.

We're going to take the resultant strain and inject it right into that golfer head.

Once upon a time, long, long ago.
A lovely queen sat by her window sewing.
Dreaming, she pricked her finger with her needle.
Ah.
Ah.
Some time later, a little daughter was born to the queen.
And she was just as beautiful as the queen had hoped she might be.
Is that a boy or a girl?
Is it a faggot?
It's a dyke.
No, it's a hippie.
A communist?
Perhaps it's a drag queen.
Or a washrag queen.
Probably a speed freak.
Or a pothead.
Or a muffin queen.
Look at her.
It's just a whore.
Or maybe a gold digger.
Or she's a hustler.
Or some sort of intellectual.
The happy mother decided to call her baby Snow White.
It could be a backpack.
Or maybe it's a b-girl.
Snow White dreamed beautiful daydreams about a handsome prince.
Someday she knew he would come and carry her off to his castle in the clouds.
And I often imagine that a girl is actually a boy and use her accordingly.

Take the princess into the forest and bring me back her heart in this jewel box.
Alone in the forest, Snow White wept with fright.
But she was not really alone, she found.
All the little woodland animals were her friends.
You're all right.
And, chirping and chattering happily, they led her to a new home.
Hey, what kind of a place is this?
It was a sweet little, tiny little house in the woods the animals showed Snow White.
Looks like a rogues gallery.
The sink was piled with unwashed dishes and everything was thickly blanketed with dust.
Shut up, shut up.
You're dopey.
They had almost forgotten what the word meant.
She took a deep breath and said,















I'll take one bite, and sank lifeless to the floor.
And that ain't all.
Now you drop dead, you nitwit.
God bless you.
It's a beautiful thing.
Praise Bob.
Why not?
The man with the plan.
Focusing up now on the future of America.
The world domination.
The post superior mutants.
Marching across history or the face of it.
Well, if you go with the plan, you'll be a hero.














You know, here on page 45 of the Bay Guardian, you do find there is a whole section of WADADs,
mutants seeking other mutants and stuff like that.
It's a wonderful, theatrical world.
It used to be cool and lonely to be a mutant, but now everybody's doing it.
Well, I mean, there used to be a time when it was sort of like, you know, a mule.
You cross a mutant with a normal and you get some sort of mutation.
But now that mutants are doing it with other mutants, it's almost become, I don't know,
a little mainstream.
I know.
It's really sad to see the best minds of our generation doing all that 50's stuff over
again the same way they did it back then.
And now, you know, now it's almost like uncool to be anything but mutant, you know?
I mean, it's sort of like, well, you know what I'm saying?
I mean, it's...
Yeah, you're saying it, it, it, it, it, it.
Yeah, exactly.
And on top of that, if you're mutant...
It's...
It's like, be different for the sake of being the same.
Yes, that's right.
We're all different here for the sake of being the same on the air.
And I, that's, that's really no better than the normals.
I mean, when you get right down to it.
Here on show.
Yeah.
Well, that's why the Church of the Subgenius is no longer a viable instrument in any of
our lives.
Soon we may have to just revert to normality as an alternative to mutating.
Well, I think the ultimate thing to be is just to be me.
I just want to be the...
Not the, me.
Well, me, for ye, is ze.
Yeah, but that's the wrong me for you.
You gotta be the you me.
I gotta be the I me.
Well, this is no longer the me generation.
That was last generation, so perhaps it's the...
Yeah, but I'm sterile, so, you know, I'm kinda stuck with it.
Well, uh...
If I could really be the me...
If I could reproduce, then I might have a ye generation.
Ye?
Ye, that's true.
No, no, ye.
Ye, that's true.
Right.
These get confusing after a while.
Why not?
Reverend Sandler, let me ask you.
Bob's number is 999.
Whose number is 911?
Sir, I know who you are.
God bless you.
I'm Bob.
I'm Bob.
I'm Bob.



Hello?
Yeah, how you like to be mutilated, you mother...
Come on, that's a pretty unprofessional obsession, right there.
Well, it's true, but it's all we got.
Well, we'll just have to be, uh, cartographers of the head, and it's our duty to explore
the wilderness.
It's artillery-like art.
This new gray matter preserve.
Just don't look up its next stump.
When I see something you wish you'd never seen.
It was an ugly sight.
That's pretty romantic, Reverend Stang.
Yeah, I know what you do with that neck stump, Pope Sternodoc's kick-haver.
I know exactly what you've been doing with that neck stump.
I've detected the potential many times in the past and have been dazzled by the ill-matched,
intimidating circumstances that this relationship has provided for me.
It's a breath of abnormalcy amidst a normal atmosphere of, you know, inhaling deeply of the church air.
On the earth.
Reverend Sternodoc, would you hang on just a second?
We're going to go to the caller. Hold on.
Okay.
Sir, I know who you are. God bless you.
Why is that nasty caller diverted before we can even get our hooks into him?
Well, he's probably trapped in a gas-filled tunnel when he's lifting his head at the scent of that golfer head.
And we're more and more interested to learn how far this...
...mighty affair might have progressed tonight.
Might have. That's the key, I think, for you listeners who are collecting clues, as I'm often doing in the show.
Yes, all you grass-banned trapped out there.
Might have is the grass-banned caller that would have found the other side to be a possibility.
The clues are buried in the show.
But that board stood up like a Christmas tree, Commander.
Well, the character and climate of the show no doubt have exerted a slight influence on his actions.
A tidal influence, we would say.
Yeah.
At the moment, they've dragged him right out of the room.
That's right. They're taking him off to the land of the sky-blue waters.
Well, we'll...
The water's best for brewing.
We'll delve deeper and deeper into the more compelling mysteries, which lay beyond those that we had deduced to the security of the poop-dog hat.
A monster, eight feet tall, half man, half beast.
Perhaps the elusive missing link between humans and apes.
In the Himalayas, it's called Yeti.
Yeti.
Yeti.
Yeti.
I was cursed by being fitted with the hair of a monkey.
The big question in all this, of course, is are these animals real?
Why don't we catch them?
You must decide.
Or...
You are the jury.
It's not my intention to delay this court.
God bless you.
Wouldn't that be weird?
Of course, a lot of folks say, well, what do you believe in, Brother Dave?
I say, I believe in everything.
You don't mean that.
Yes.
Even that?
Yes.
Yes, I...
Yes, yes, I do.
I believe in everything that exists in this whole planet Earth.
I believe in every philosophy, every religion, every ideology.
Everything that exists.
And that don't give me no room for no argument.
If the world is wrong, then right your own self.
That's something to think about.
Sure.
Frankly, I believe in love and charity and goodness and kindness.
And I believe if a man's down, kick him.
That's right.
If he survives it, he has an opportunity to rise above.
God bless you.
We were afraid there would be too many people on Main Street.
So we walked on down and stood in the...
grassy slope just this side of the triple underpass.
The president's car turned the corner and started toward us on Elm Street.
There were a lot of motorcycle police in front of the president's car.
My friend was afraid I didn't see the president.
So she said, look, there's the president's car.
Get a picture of him.
He turned to us and waved.
He faced forward again.
I lifted my Polaroid.
Just as I snapped the picture, I heard a shot.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!

That's a pile of horse manure, son.
God bless you.
I don't know.
You must try, Comrade Zilkov, to cultivate a sense of humor.
Just because you're not the same
It doesn't mean you're weird or strange
You're just different
Being different
Is being great
You too, isn't that a risk?
Just because you're a different one
There's no telling what you might become
Thinking different
Being different
Is being great
God bless you.
It's not who you aren't.
It's who you are.
And being yourself
Is being great
From the church of
The subgenius
Let's get into trouble, baby.
I'm gonna give time to play some music because we should.
I'm gonna give time to play some music because we should.
I'm gonna give time to play some music because we should.
I'm gonna give time to play some music because we should.
And the show rolls for him.
And the show rolls for him.

Where the subgenius is going ass.

A hurtling juggernaut that can't be stopped.
But, Mike, let's be serious.
And squabble.
Well, all right, what's a four-letter word for...
Oh, wait, hold on.
What's a four-letter word for pronate?
Food.
How about prolapse?
Just prolapsed on me.
Alamin.
Oh, wait.
Terribly sorry.
Bear with me a moment.
There's a fond analog that...
I mean, I'm gay.
I'm gazing into the mirror now.
Okay, I'll eat it. I'll eat it.
Okay, we're going to go with the menu.
It's a punch-up 3D food.
Okay, well, how about the spooky strips of light
and I'll take the dead moth shining pie.
At Dead Moth Drive-Thru Plaza, the pie is our profession.
I'll take the fluttered wall soup.
Now available at Wall Drugs.
And the dipping French woman. Okay, thanks, here.
From Local Slaveway.
I'll take a real loony Cajun prune whip, too.
Wait a minute, I've been about to squeeze again.
Ah!
A memo to Attorney General Edwin Meese III
about a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline.
Yeah, it makes me think of Meese, too.
I don't know if it's visual or maybe it's a sense of smell.
You know, basically...
An ancient sense of smell just kind of makes you think of Meese
when, well, when the whole building squeezes like that.
You get it?
And suddenly it dawned on a crooker friend that...
What is it, 6 o'clock?
Things had changed a bit.
Rappaport hired a long time Meese friend E. Robert Wallach
to get him a piece of...
Well, I just got...
I just went to the bathroom there and almost finished the stark fifth.
But then I forgot, I turned around, I flushed it before I even thought about it.
And so more shows...
He's probably going to be backing up the pipes.
He's coming out with these little microphones.
I need a gift.
And I really...
I just have no idea what to get him.
I know just what you mean and I have just the gift you need.
But I can't sell it.
No cameras of any kind will be allowed.
I will not tolerate any outbursts.
Donation.
Any talking among yourselves.
Any laughter.
No laughter.
No anything that would interfere with the normal, orderly presentation of testimony.
Oh, a radio.
With your mid-afternoon news.
Well, all of Southern California seems to have sighted another UFO in today's sunny, smogless skies.
The official...
One every three and a half days.
Oh, they put a microphone especially in the bathroom.
The stark fifth removal is a good...
Oh, it's coming alive.
Oh, no, it's crawling out of the...
Oh, it's in the toilet.
That's Mobius.
Mobius, hey, hey.
Let go of my...
Let go, let go.
Don't pull me in there.
Oh, my God.
Ow!
And children, this is what you get when you eat at Cafe Neutron.
Is the new...
Irradiated food.
Is the new stark fifth out yet?
Yeah, it's out.
A little listener asking a real question.
Get out of here.
Stop it.
Yeah, it's out.
It's $40.
Let's go over that again.
Dear friends, the stark fifth.
The long, long, long awaited stark fifth of removal.
Is indeed almost finished.
Just as we've been saying for the last two years.
And this time, we really do mean it.
And...
Whoop, there went that...
Shoot, we flushed it away again.
Now I've got to start all over again.
You can back flush these things.
And there's a little caller.
He's floating up.
He'll be floating face up there.
It'll be out soon, but we can tell you what the theme of the next issue is.
Get the plunger.
Get the show plunger.
Get that little caller up out of there.
The theme of the new stark fifth is not you, Gary.
I'm afraid he's drowned.
Yeah, well...
Put it down as slowly as you can.
Oh, it's only an overshot.
Like Patty said.
On the floor.
Put it on the floor.
Gently.
Now, just what could have happened to get such a piece of tripe?
You have no idea what I've gone through in the last three months.
Sometimes I'm perfect in all, mentally.
I sit for hours and hours looking in the mirror.
Hoping and praying for the slightest sign of my physical change.
But it doesn't come.
Then I feel myself going back to the animal instinct.
I try to fight it.
The w Shane.
I try to fight it all my willpower...
And I feel...
địa$$
Een, What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
Fighting.
That's all you can do.

We better get back, because it will be dark soon.
And they mostly come at night. Mostly.
God obey, O Zealand.
Translate.
It sure is preferred, it is, isn't it?
I like that.
What is the truth about rock music?
I think it's an octopus.
Plato said, when the music of a society changes, the whole society will change.
Certainly, I got married so I could retire.
Lennon said...
The best and the quickest way to undermine any society is through its music.
Can you think of anything else?
No, you've covered it all.
Satan has taken music and he has counterfeited it.
See that?
Convoluted it.
Twisted it.
Exploited it.
And now he's using it to hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer...
Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer...
A message into the minds and the lifestyles of this generation.
And that ain't all.
What kind of ungodly being was that?
Don't you believe in reincarnation?
A wise guy, huh?
Quick, kill him!
Subdini's in space.
They took me up to the top of that space needle.
And they showered me with beautiful gifts.
And beautiful girls.
Moon babes.
Wow, what moon babes?
Yeah, look at those satellites.
Look at them spiked heels.
Oh, that one's looting me now.
I can't tell whether those are convexities or concavities, but that looting...
Hey, they some kind of moon babes.
I say, do that again.
Or you can see-dig those potatoes out of the craters.
Hey.
Oh, I love it.
Tiny flagellants move through this microscopic stool as if they owned the place.
What happened? What, did something die in here?
Meanwhile, Nancy Reagan rolls a pocket of...
It's that dinosaur ink that Hal's been sitting on for the last twenty days.
Look, it's cracking!
I hear a scratching, a scratching noise.
He's not even aware that his own child is being born now.
It's got the head of a boy and the body of a Tyrannosaurus.
Yes, but it smokes sherbets. Do you think that it could be?
And it's still talking.
The PLO chief rates full pardon for safe sex.
I just don't know about this guy.
Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev bought covert aid for erosion.
Yes, Hal had his own dinosaur baby child on the show and didn't even notice.
And so we're going to cook this little rare creature up for...
President Reagan, passing secret meetings.
Breakfast.
Yes, this single living example of a...
Look, the dinosaur baby child's making his first phone call.
...a homosaurus sapiens.
It's Jack.
...the show that is no longer available in your area.
The show fought its way to the front of the castle.
The show thought to itself, should I swim across the moat or should I crawl through the mud?
Or should you crawl six miles over the broken glass and radioactive...
...mind-tales just to hear our program?
How many callers, how many records, how many eardrums?
We're going to talk about some of the subtle racism and sexism in the Bibles.
The sexism's pretty well accepted, but we will talk about the racism because it's so much more hidden...
...and it's so much more dangerous what genocide the wretched can justify with the racism in it.
Through devious ways Satan has tainted the Bible and they justify their racism on the fact that...
...Cain, the son of Adam and Eve, went off to a great city.
How is there a city if Cain was the only first son of man?
Well, this city was not occupied by man, but the beast of the field.
And Mormons and many other religions still teach at Blackford the descendants of Cain and the beast of the field.
We single out these tainted Bibles, even St. John and St. Luke versions...
...so you will know that ours is the only Bible that should be read.
...versions of the Bible...
...which have racism in them...
...is going to be exposed and then we will announce how we will edit the Bible.
Oh, yes, yes!
Finally, the only one microphone is on and...
...Dr. Howell and Gary Dubrow...
...and Buzzling Evidence all went to rock it away.
Rock it away.
And that's what I'm going to do in a minute.
And while we haven't been on the phone to our friends...
...we've been, well, the quick cut barrage that you've been listening to...
...the edits of wonderful little sound bits...
...holy messages from the collection of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself...
...that was all edited by St. Joe Riley...
...oh, praise St. Joe Riley...
...saves us so much work and lets us get away with murder.
Oh, other little bits and pieces that were done by others...
...there's a song called Used Slack...
...buried in there.
That was by Out of Band Experience, OBE.
You heard some Church of the New Faith there down at the end.
They'll, of course, finish their explanations next week.
On the commercial for our new product, Candy Frappy Frappy Candy...
...it was produced by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy...
...oh, yes, up there in New York land.
The background music that's on right now is, of course...
...J. Condom from his album, Zombofropland.
And now, this.
Well, no, how about this?
How about the post office box of the Church of the Subgenius?
I know that so many of you have been sitting there...
...with your pens in your hands...
...just aching to write down that address...
...where you can write for free information...
...about all the other services of our beloved church.
Ah, yes.
And, uh...
...that post office box number, we'll just write to Bob.
That's all you need to do.
Write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306...
...in beautiful Dallas, Texas.
That zip is 75214.
Once again, that's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.
And now, this.
The dead hours of the morning between 4.30 and 6 o'clock.
This is the time when women who have been many hours in labor...
...finally deliver, and when the idea of the supernatural...
...seems the least implausible.
Mobius Rex is clambering around on top of the equipment here.
Amazing camera.
For those of you interested, monitor number four will show Mobius.
At this time...
Wrecking the show.
Ancient superstitions and night fears have the greatest hold on human thoughts.
The time when those who sleep are deeply lying.
And this is the hour when the callers call...
Hello?
...the church of the subgenius radio show.
Hello?
Hello, you're on the air.
Cookie, this is the show trying to bother Philo.
State short question, please.
What's for breakfast, Cookie?
Cookie, this is Ivan.
You have to wake up Dr. Drumwock.
Hey, hey, hey, I gotta go.
So we can hurt him.
How many presidents does it take to screw in a light bulb?
No, no, wait, wait.
What's the most beautiful sight in the world?
A busload of presidents going off a cliff.
Get it?
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Spooky bad show.
Cookie.
Oh, no.
Can we talk to little dude?
Don't listen to these men.
Not unless you have a connection to dog heaven.
Oh, no.
Friends, this is dog heaven.
And this is Philo Drumhead.
Hey, dog heaven.
Philo Drumhead.
We've woken up just to be here entertaining you in all of Northern and Central California.
No, I'm still asleep.
You are going to save the universe this time.
Yeah, that's right, Philo.
You have a link up to the sleep.
Be of good cheer.
Well, just tell us what you're dreaming about and we'll let you go eventually.
I'm dreaming about little dude.
Your dog?
Your dog that you had five years ago?
Yes.
I've never forgotten the little chap who was so dear to us.
Still running out there in the fields of toxic substance.
That's what it is.
He's prancing and dancing through the fields of clover and dioxin.
In that land where no cars are.
And the smell of good clean earth under his nails.
The only cars that are there are those that are run over by dogs.
Yeah.
Little dogs.
Well, we're all going to meet at the Jefferson Memorial Fair.

We're going to be there for something later.
So we just wanted to call you up.
Yeah.
I'll be down there.
Don't order anything before I get there.
Okay?
Okay.
That's Salvation and Infotation at www.subgenius.com.
Or, got that pencil ready?
