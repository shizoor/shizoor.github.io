1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
It'll be Saturday night for Sunday in the afternoon.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,720
Sunday night into Monday.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,500
Saturday's gonna be Monday, which is right about on target for this time of year.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,620
We're looking at pretty stable Midwest moving across the middle of next week as we're looking at St. Louis.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,540
Hey, Connie.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,180
Hey.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,520
What's the matter, Connie?

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,840
Aw, wake up, Connie.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,160
Smell the coffee.

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,820
Smell the...

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,680
So genius.

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,800
Power of...

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,560
What?

14
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,600
It stinks.

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,160
No kidding.

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,260
Good evening, fellow citizens.

17
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,880
This is the voice of the illegal radio to which you are forbidden to listen under penalty of death.

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,880
I'll have three meals a day, five if I want them.

19
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,140
Roof over my head to drink every now and then to warm me up.

20
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,700
I'll be worshipped and fed and treated like a high priest for telling people things they want to hear.

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,640
It's the new original that has the legendary Bob talking.

22
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,600
Tell us, Alan Gruden Greenspan.

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,760
No bobs.

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,480
No sticky, smelly bobs.

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,860
Zesty, stiffer bobs.

26
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,820
Small bobs.

27
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,740
Hot, delicious, personal bobs.

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,180
Got me some slack.

29
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,140
Slack.

30
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,580
Did he say slack?

31
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,020
You want to talk about slack?

32
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,700
You want to talk about slack?

33
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,580
You want to talk about slack?

34
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:28,100
Well, you wouldn't understand if we told you right.

35
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,640
We'll tell you behind your back.

36
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,160
The radio promo, bromo, bubbles in your belly form a gas called the hour of slack.

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,280
When released, some police eat their own badges.

38
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,840
So the guns of the sun shake their mustaches.

39
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,960
Cut their penises off and carve their own badges.

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,500
And cauterize it all with some kitchen matches.

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,560
We watch Charles Nelson Riley with suspicious eyes.

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,140
For fear that if we don't, his corks out surely rise.

43
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,760
Well, I didn't understand when I first heard it.

44
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,460
Then I heard again.

45
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,600
Then I didn't understand.

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,300
And even better.

47
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,520
The letter of the law wears a sweater in her bra.

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,420
So you better take it off and just forget her.

49
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,160
We gaze into the light, reflecting from the eyes.

50
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,680
Light from the coal inside the bowl of sacred pipes.

51
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,560
Quit your job.

52
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,380
Mom?

53
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,600
Slack.

54
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,060
Quit your job.

55
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,140
What?

56
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,480
Slack.

57
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,880
Quit your job.

58
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,620
Mom?

59
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,980
Slack.

60
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:25,640
Slack.

61
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,320
Quit your job.

62
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,360
Mom?

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,240
Slatitious a bringà¸´ous.

64
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,620
Drag a towline behind a broke down Cadillac.

65
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,720
driven by a mad man.

66
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,180
Blinded as a baseball bat.

67
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,960
Spot the matters getting everywhere I look.

68
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
It's all over the face.

69
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,580
It's on the carder's bill of riches.

70
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,320
cover of this book.

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,400
Subtenus is the only

72
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,160
word still legible.

73
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,680
I'd rather follow Bob

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,440
than be a vegetable.

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,840
My testicles have

76
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,740
fortitude and quite a

77
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,200
bit of hair.

78
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,220
But if you listen to

79
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,080
them hour slack is

80
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,560
what you'll hear.

81
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,260
Listen to my testicles.

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,520
Listen to my testicles.

83
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,080
Listen to my testicles.

84
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,680
Listen to my testicles.

85
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,320
Listen to my testicles.

86
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,000
Listen to my testicles.

87
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,520
Listen to my testicles.

88
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,120
Listen to my testicles.

89
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,500
A new hour of slack.

90
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,820
Charles Nelson testicle

91
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,500
mix in that by the El

92
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,280
Queso All Stars.

93
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,560
It's a new hour of slack.

94
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,560
With the Lemurian intro

95
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,940
there bringing hour of

96
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,560
slack number 1032 to

97
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,800
rampaging life.

98
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,940
But now let us go back

99
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,000
in time to Stang's

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,680
giving 2005 and the

101
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,780
over the puzzling

102
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,720
evidence edge show on

103
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,560
KPFA in evil Berkeley,

104
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,540
California.

105
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,300
This is your 484425 banquet

106
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,620
facilitator is he isn't.

107
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,120
And we're back here with

108
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,280
the end of over the edge

109
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,680
or way past over the edge.

110
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,400
That's all gone.

111
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,020
Forget that.

112
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,220
This is the subgenius

113
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,740
Thanksgiving.

114
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,120
Call executive banquet

115
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,520
of you fellas got that I

116
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,800
haven't got about to tackle

117
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,980
about to tackle the economic

118
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,460
side of this organization

119
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,500
for once out in the open.

120
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,640
Transparency is the motto.

121
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,120
And I think I agree.

122
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,300
I think I'm going to get

123
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,500
down.

124
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,900
I've got the budget numbers

125
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,420
here and I'm ready to talk

126
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,760
to the let's start with a new

127
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,020
department.

128
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,920
Let's start with income.

129
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,580
How much did the subgenius

130
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,400
foundation make.

131
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,280
Well you know I don't

132
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,840
understand what these numbers

133
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,720
are saying because there's

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,200
an introduction here that has

135
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,700
got those measurements and

136
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,900
weights and things and

137
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,420
equivalencies translation

138
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,520
tables a bunch of different

139
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,380
tanda tangential axes that

140
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,020
talk about the effects of

141
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,100
propeller and roll.

142
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,100


143
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,200
So it's all about the

144
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,500
motor wash and size and

145
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,600
shape of aircraft and the

146
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,980
good bone structure of the

147
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,340
members.

148
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:32,720
Yeah.

149
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,920
And the bone structure.

150
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,860
What's that got to do with

151
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,080
anything.

152
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,080
I see Mr.

153
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,780
Stang stepping to the head

154
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,100
of the banquet table about to

155
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,500
I guess give his yearly report

156
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,460
What about this neurotoxin

157
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,940
this toxin which attacks any

158
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,540
nerve tissue.

159
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,340
What about that.

160
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,660
Don't mention that Philo.

161
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,720
That's pretty scary at a

162
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:51,980
banquet.

163
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,980
What about these passive

164
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,880
defense measures.

165
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,740
I see that there's sixty

166
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,460
thousand dollars dedicated to

167
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,820
passive defense measures.

168
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,140
Notice how you notice how

169
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,640
they've avoided Congressman

170
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,580
Izzy's question for over 20

171
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:08,880
minutes.

172
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,620
This chair is all flips.

173
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,620
Now I'm just running.

174
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,580
I haven't been elected yet.

175
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,720
So is the mic.

176
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,860
All flipsy dipsy.

177
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,080
Running from those bullets.

178
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,260
All the time running.

179
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,580
And here is Mr. Stang now with

180
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,160
his annual.

181
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,480
That's.

182
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,520
Annual report.

183
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,080
That's that's Reverend Stang.

184
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,880
If you don't mind.

185
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,340
I'm sorry I'm Congressman.

186
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,320
Is I didn't attend Dobbs Town

187
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,260
University Divinity School for

188
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,700
15 years to be called Mr.

189
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,720
Stang.

190
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,200
Normally it takes a good.

191
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,660
Four years.

192
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,600
You have to Mr.

193
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,180
It's Mr.

194
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,040
Smith.

195
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,240
Didn't they all commit suicide.

196
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,220
Well that was.

197
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,580
Say why was it that it took you

198
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,140
15 years to get a degree that

199
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,420
normally takes two years.

200
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,460
Look I can't.

201
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:55,460


202
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:55,460


203
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:55,460


204
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,200
Kind of killed the show.

205
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,180
I can't compete with Texas accents

206
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,620
here.

207
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,120
It's.

208
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,420
What about this hog collar of virus.

209
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,220
There's too many of them and makes

210
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,700
me sound like a northern liberal.

211
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,280
Oh God.

212
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,800
The growing custom in the.

213
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,440
That's OK.

214
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,240
You know we're an open organization.

215
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,960
The church is not a political

216
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,720
organization aside from patriotic

217
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,000
psychotic and narco materialism which is so broad as.

218
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,460
To be defined more as a species rather than a political or a lifestyle.

219
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,020
We have a lifestyle maybe.

220
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,500
Yeah but back to that.

221
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:33,820
Report.

222
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,960
Yes back to the report.

223
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640
What about the ding fever virus.

224
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,800
Dollars and cents.

225
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,920
Let's get down to some transparency here.

226
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,020
Three thirty six twenty one.

227
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,320
No it's up twenty four.

228
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,840
Actually as I'm watching it it's going up taxes for instance.

229
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,100
Did you pay any taxes.

230
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,320
That's what I just told you.

231
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,880
I'm sorry.

232
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,220
The number and it's still going up.

233
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,880
So exactly.

234
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,700
Tell me when you want the cut off moment.

235
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,440
Well can I have your Social Security number.

236
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,780
I told you three thirty six.

237
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,080
Now it's forty three.

238
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,720
I got that.

239
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,300
I thought that was your phone number.

240
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,780
Thirty six twelve thirty six.

241
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,500
Yes baby.

242
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,620
The treasurer.

243
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,900
Connie has entered the room.

244
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,380
Stand up boys.

245
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,580
That's what I take your hats off.

246
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,480
I'm standing up over this.

247
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,760
Well it's.

248
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,120
Go.

249
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,480
Go.

250
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,860
Nobody could ever go like Connie.

251
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,140
Check out that logistical system.

252
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,600
Crazy.

253
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,500
Crazy.

254
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,580
Crazy.

255
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,120
Crazy.

256
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,620
Crazy.

257
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:48,620


258
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,500
Crazy.

259
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,500
Crazy, I'm half crazy.

260
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,400
I'm half crazy.

261
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm half crazy.

262
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,740
Crazy, I'm half crazy.

263
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,360
Wow, Larry.

264
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,040
Those were great stories about loving your family.

265
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,900
Thanks, Bob.

266
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,220
Um, speaking of families,

267
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,020
I've been feeling kind of bad that I never told you about mine.

268
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,840
So, I gave my brothers a call so you can meet them.

269
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,300
What?

270
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,120
Come on in, guys.

271
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,520
Bob, this is Bob.

272
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,480
Bob and Bob.

273
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,400
Well, hi, guys.

274
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,140
It's really great to meet you.

275
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,580
Uh.

276
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,240
Uh.

277
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,920
Rumors of Bob, but never Bob.

278
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,860
It is Bob.

279
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,320
Right.

280
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,740
What is it you tell people you do these days, Bob?

281
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,520
Between State Department and Defense.

282
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,000
Bitterness and bigotry.

283
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,560
Bitterness and bigotry.

284
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,880
Bitterness and bigotry.

285
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,840
There's definite brain damage.

286
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,320
There's definite brain damage.

287
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,300
Fragile plastic gas bag.

288
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,860
Fragile plastic gas bag.

289
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,060
My own ideas.

290
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,060
My own ideas.

291
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,040
My own ideas.

292
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,140
I try to take my inspiration from the beat.

293
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,120
Always busy, busy, busy.

294
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,380
BABY

295
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,260
JUST PICKED UP SOMETHING

296
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,260


297
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,560
HALT

298
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:48,560


299
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:48,560


300
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:48,560


301
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,660
I'M GETTING CLOSED

302
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,340
I'M STILL

303
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,160
RESIGNED

304
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,660
I'M NOT

305
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:51,700
QUITE

306
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:51,700


307
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,100
WE Bradley

308
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,100


309
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,100


310
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,100


311
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,100


312
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,100


313
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,000
devouring them alive.

314
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,660
They paralyze the victims

315
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,660
and then take their time

316
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,580
devouring them alive.

317
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,700
Oh, women.

318
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,280
Men.

319
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,940
Meanwhile, back in the city,

320
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,860
in the end,

321
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,400
I try to take my inspiration

322
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,080
from the bees.

323
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,060
Always busy, busy, busy.

324
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,380
My own ideas

325
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,480
disappear by magic.

326
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,000
Fragile plastic gas bags.

327
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,280
There's definite brain damage.

328
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,200
Bitterness and vigor creep.

329
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,440
There's definite brain damage.

330
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,280
Fragile plastic gas bags

331
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,420
disappear by magic.

332
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,440
My own ideas.

333
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,760
I try to take my inspiration

334
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,400
from the bees.

335
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,400
Always busy, busy, busy.

336
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,560
In the end,

337
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,240
meanwhile, back in the city,

338
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,900
Oh, women.

339
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,440
Women.

340
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,920
They paralyze the victims

341
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
and then take their time

342
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,820
devouring them alive.

343
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,440
Somewhere a perversion

344
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,260
has taken place.

345
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,540
Somewhere a perversion

346
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,380
has taken place.

347
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,660
Somewhere a perversion

348
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,460
has taken place.

349
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,500
In the end,

350
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,600
the end.

351
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,140


352
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,140


353
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,140


354
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,340
Oh, my goodness.

355
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,020
That was almost my end,

356
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,820
wasn't it?

357
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,480
No, it was

358
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,260
In the End

359
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,460
by Norrell Preff

360
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,720
of

361
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,560
norrellpreff.com

362
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,740
That's N-O-R-E-L

363
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,420
P-R-E-F-P-R-E-F-P-O-M-E-L-P-E-N-D-T-O-S-K.

364
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,480
And now, back to the subgenius business meeting on KPFA.

365
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,540
But what about the report?

366
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,940
Rarely is there any direct corollary between the report and the Connie activity.

367
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,720
It's a calibrated, sensory array.

368
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
I think that was it. That just went by.

369
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:52,460
We uploaded the report to all of the commission members last week.

370
00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:00,040
If you didn't check your F-mail, then it's certainly not Bob's responsibility.

371
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:08,420
The report was F-mailed last week.

372
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,000
For the chip to reach the downstream state.

373
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,140
I have it here.

374
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,340
Usually a stopwatch.

375
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,660
As you can see, John.

376
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,480
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposed merger with the Church of Scientology was cancelled.

377
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,580
And that caused a precipitate drop.

378
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,180
We call it the ripple effect.

379
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,440
Stock price, of course.

380
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,080
But as you can see, that's starting to bounce back.

381
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,940
And we're negotiating with the Mormons right now.

382
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,440
Does that mean you paid no taxes in 2004?

383
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,060
Why do you keep harping on this?

384
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,340
Sensitive subject.

385
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,700
We donated to charities.

386
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,400
I want transparency.

387
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,700
I want to see this organization come out front.

388
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,580
Get out in front.

389
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,360
And do the purple.

390
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,980
Yeah, you know, sunshine laws, okay?

391
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,860
Get out in front of whatever this is.

392
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,840
We've got the exact number if you want it.

393
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,420
The taxes we paid in 2004 are now $340.22.

394
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,000
Now it's $24.

395
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,280
That's $340.22.

396
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,380
Like a locomotive bearing down on us.

397
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,000
At first, apparently not moving.

398
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,060
But then, suddenly.

399
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,360
Looming large.

400
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,820
We didn't do much business in taxes.

401
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,960
Only in Cleveland.

402
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:28,460
But you know, folks, it doesn't matter where you hang out your shingle in the street.

403
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,500
Yes, it does.

404
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,460
Location, location.

405
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,060
It's everything.

406
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,760
It certainly does matter.

407
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,740
But what about the better business boost of commerce, Caucasian Christians?

408
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,720
But that brings up an interesting question.

409
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,400
Christians for Jews.

410
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,160
Where?

411
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,920
Where is the subgenius church located?

412
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,240
Well, the building itself.

413
00:14:49,240 --> 00:15:00,120
The subgenius church is located in the heart and the mind and deep in the glands of every dues-paying subgenius minister.

414
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,140
And it's located in the wishful thinking compartment of the non-dues-paying subgenius minister.

415
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,900
See here on this screen, there it is.

416
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,580
The giant 700-foot tower of the Dobbs Idea in Dobbstown, Malaysia.

417
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,020
It's made of solid, uh, what is that?

418
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,760
Now, that's the physical church.

419
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,820
Actually, it's adobe.

420
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,800
It's adobe, but it's a front.

421
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,480
No, it's not adobe.

422
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,660
It's, uh...

423
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,100
Oh, he was saying it's adobe.

424
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,360
Searsidey knuckle.

425
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,700
It's just an expression they use out there.

426
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,140
And, uh, yeah, those are the bobbies working all day and night, 24 hours.

427
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,040
Dolomite.

428
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,800
It's made of solid dolomite.

429
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,500
Dolomite is my name!

430
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:41,860
Dolomite!

431
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,820
You see, uh...

432
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:53,240
Genius Architectural Union bid to have this unusual structure created for the Nabob of Ooze in the year 1972.

433
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:09,540
And it's just one of the many wonders, wonders of science, wonders of human creation, brought into being by the love of God.

434
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,180
And, uh, this is the source of all our climatic data.

435
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,240
This particular chinless wonder is Dob's seventh son.

436
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,220
Which makes him the seventh son of a seventh son.

437
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,260
Possibly the even higher epoch.

438
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:42,720
We'll find out this X-Day 9 at Brushwood, when the seventh son of the seventh son of Dob's will be unveiled.

439
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,500
This space is killing.

440
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,240
He will make himself naked to you.

441
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,560
And you may decide.

442
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,040
It will be up to you to choose.

443
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,380
Do you feel the fire, friends?

444
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,580
I certainly don't.

445
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,440
But I know that if I, if I can kindle it.

446
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,880
Where's a picture of Dob's?

447
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,740
There's one here.

448
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,860
Give me that picture.

449
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,840
Give me that Dob's head.

450
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,600
Now!

451
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:12,760
Now!

452
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:12,760


453
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:12,800


454
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,100
Now!

455
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


456
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:14,600
Now!

457
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:14,600


458
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:14,600


459
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:14,600


460
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:14,600


461
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:14,600


462
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:14,600


463
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:14,600


464
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:14,660
Now!

465
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:14,660


466
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:14,660


467
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:14,660


468
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:14,940
Now!

469
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,880
users i'm gripping

470
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,000
Uh, uh, I'm holding a copy of the book.

471
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,700
Abu Ibnä½¿ 65

472
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,520
I've got the book of the subgenius in my hand and i'm staring into that eye bob ...

473
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,580
andI'm feeling it, I'm remembering

474
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,300
What brought me into this church.

475
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,740
It didn't have anything to do with my ...

476
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,040
It didn't have anything to do with being a young yeti.

477
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,500
It didn't have anything to do with being picked on in elementary school

478
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,040
and the unfortunate fact that I throw like a girl.

479
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,040
No, it was this and this fact only.

480
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:01,980
When I looked at Bob's face, I instantly saw how cool he was.

481
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,820
And that is what made me a subgenius.

482
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,120
I saw how cool his face was.

483
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,340
And that is all that defines a subgenius.

484
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,140
You can pretty it up.

485
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,780
Oh, you won't.

486
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,300
But that is it.

487
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,700
That's the final truth lies in that face.

488
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,640
This is a one-face religion.

489
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,120
A face-based religion, Mr. George Bush.

490
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,100
You hear me, Mr. Bush, Mr. President Cheney?

491
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,940
This is a...

492
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,020
This is a...

493
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,100
This is a...

494
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,200
Face-based religion.

495
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,340
Forget it all. Thank you.

496
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:43,840
Yes.

497
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,240
Put on one of those religious straitjackets.

498
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,500
Card him off.

499
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,120
Muffle him if they can't take a joke.

500
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,920
This is our beloved hip-hop Reverend Ivan Stang.

501
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:59,180
He is often music and he communicates to us many wonderful secrets of the church.

502
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,220
He claims that he can steer the church using these visions.

503
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,580
Yes, we all love Ivan Stang.

504
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,460
Be careful of him there.

505
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,160
Make sure he's restrained suitably.

506
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,380
He's a real man.

507
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,680
I'm half crazy.

508
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:22,540
Z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z.

509
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,400
I'm half crazy.

510
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,060
I'm half crazy.

511
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,940
I'm half cra cra cra cra cra cra crazy.

512
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,040
A little remix there by Noor El-Pef.

513
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,100
And now, a little remix.

514
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,120
A little soupy sales introduces Little Theodore.

515
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,760
Well, what do you think, gang?

516
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,940
Well, listen, do you have any other songs?

517
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,840
All kind of songs?

518
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,460
Cha-chas and rock and roll?

519
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,860
And even operatic areas?

520
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,900
What are these songs about?

521
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,640
About each other?

522
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,060
Happy people.

523
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,840
So close you dance so slick.

524
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,460
Happy people.

525
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,260
You make me stomp and kick.

526
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,920
Happy people.

527
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,660
Look at you, the right.

528
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,440
Happy people.

529
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,120
They laugh instead of fight.

530
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,720
Happy people.

531
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,400
You've taken the system's fate.

532
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,120
Happy people.

533
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,840
They think it's up and straight.

534
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,480
Happy people.

535
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,220
You're part of Megan's plan.

536
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,880
Happy people.

537
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,600
No matter what you think of his clan.

538
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,280
Happy people.

539
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,680
You're all but introduced.

540
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,620
Happy people.

541
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,600
These are our golden noose.

542
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,100
Happy people.

543
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,860
Should be put back in your place.

544
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,080
Happy people.

545
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,260
With the rest of our miserable race.

546
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,900
Happy people.

547
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,640
It's you I most detest.

548
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,260
Happy people.

549
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,920
Make me wanna be a pest.

550
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,700
Happy people.

551
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,460
You stray from the right course.

552
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,080
Happy people.

553
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,760
You justify the use of force.

554
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,460
Happy people.

555
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,060
You wanna be ashamed.

556
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,900
Happy people.

557
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,560
Please don't give us someone to blame.

558
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,500
guitar solo

559
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,960
guitar solo

560
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,260
guitar solo

561
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,760
Little Theodore, dear friends,

562
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,080
from his new CD,

563
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,340
the very best of Little Theodore's greatest hits.

564
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,860
And that's pretty good, I guess.

565
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,040
On discriminataudio.com

566
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,360
or you can find more at www.littletheodore.com

567
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,060
and I'm going to spell Theodore.

568
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,160
That's F as in Frank.

569
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,720
Y-O-D-O-R

570
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,940
littletheodore.com

571
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,760
And you'd have to see him

572
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,800
to believe it.

573
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,940
And now we go back

574
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,700
to the point in the KPFA recordings

575
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,340
where they let me back on the air.

576
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,580
By the power of Bob within you.

577
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,480
Power, oil, charger.

578
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,900
All right, I promise I'll be good now.

579
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,840
By the charge of Bob within you.

580
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,540
Car charger, but...

581
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,420
I'll power it up.

582
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,060
They gave me my pill.

583
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,440
I'll quit yelling now.

584
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,360
I'll be good now.

585
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:38,880
I'll be good now, you guys.

586
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,100
All right.

587
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,240
I'm sorry I yelled.

588
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,340
I'm sorry I got all excited about J.R. Bob Dobbs.

589
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,040
I'm sorry I brought it up.

590
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,720
Yeah, don't do that again.

591
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,240
I guess we better get back to business now.

592
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,180
Yeah.

593
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,580
I guess we better forget about Bob and Slack

594
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,700
and just go get that God-given business.

595
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,860
Bob's Car Work.

596
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,940
Well, is there any new business?

597
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,260
Well, J.R.K.'s still dead.

598
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,220
I must say I can empathize with Reverend Stang's enthusiasm.

599
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,020
I do myself feel very...

600
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,220
Except you again, caller.

601
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,940
...as if in my spirit I were let loose.

602
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,660
Caller.

603
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,100
Identify yourself.

604
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,640
Caller.

605
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,140
Michael Pepe was called up in the spirit

606
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,020
and given roaming charges.

607
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,000
I was called to Bob many, many years ago

608
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,160
and I do sometimes feel that efflorescence of the spirit.

609
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,340
God.

610
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,980
Caller.

611
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,060
Bob, uh...

612
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,340
Occasionally...

613
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,600
What can you tell us about the dismounted patrolling

614
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,880
going on in your neighborhood?

615
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,260
Yeah, because it rocks.

616
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,020
Well...

617
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,860
Are there variations of this technique

618
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,140
that you can, uh, simulate?

619
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,020
Oh, look, this is you.

620
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,100
This is Philo.

621
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,780
Yes, this is Philo.

622
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,700
He's in his car.

623
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
Okay, I...

624
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,600
I'm driving with my mullet flying in the breeze.

625
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,320
Man, look at that devil-may-care-debonair-devil.

626
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,660
And look, uh, they all know him in his neighborhood.

627
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,600
Yeah, Philo's a popular dude.

628
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,340
Hey, that's Super Philo.

629
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,400
He's an overman in his underwear.

630
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,360
He's Funky Philo.

631
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,060
I got it.

632
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,640
Everybody.

633
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,160
He's a dude with a plan

634
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
to stick it to the man.

635
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,140
Oh, Bob.

636
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,660
I got security.

637
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,960
This is violent action.

638
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,440
Follow.

639
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,580
Pick up control.

640
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,780
I've got his back.

641
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,480
From PR News in Washington,

642
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,160
I'm undignified, unbecoming,

643
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,520
unfortunate, and unnecessary,

644
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,780
and must end now.

645
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,920
On Wall Street 510-841-4921.

646
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,740
This is PR.

647
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,780
Dirty PR News.

648
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,480
PR News.

649
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,080
PR News.

650
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,820
Undetected cracks

651
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,920
allocate up to one and a half billion dollars

652
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,360
to help people with older TVs

653
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,300
buy converter boxes.

654
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,900
The Senate has rejected an attempt

655
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,420
to allow PR News in Washington.

656
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,160
Now, less than four minutes from right now.

657
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,140
Today we do have tonight and tomorrow,

658
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,680
then a Thursday through Friday on Saturday.

659
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,080
I-94 eastbound at Greenfield

660
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,240
and U.S. 23 southbound

661
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,320
between Grand Blanc and Washington.

662
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,120
I-95 and Thompson Road still possible.

663
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,680
8 Mile Road westbound at I-75

664
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,340
reported along that stretch.

665
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,080
And it is probably Wayne Road at I-94

666
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,800
and I-280 between I-75

667
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,560
and State Road 795.

668
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,260
It is completely possible

669
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,980
through the end of this month.

670
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,420
We'll have scattered today.

671
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,260
Otherwise, tonight is hanging in there.

672
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,360
Good chance for Wednesday

673
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,300
and the extended outlook Friday

674
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,960
climbing out of Thursday across the region.

675
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,180
Expect Washington for Detroit.

676
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,940
Less than four minutes from right now.

677
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,280
We'll have scattered on Thursday

678
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,280


679
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,280


680
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,280


681
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,280


682
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,280


683
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,280


684
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,280


685
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,280


686
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,420
The Chief has just said

687
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,520
the tribe faces a big meat shortage.

688
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,480
And for the first hunter to return with fresh meat,

689
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,460
he offers a surprise his beautiful daughter,

690
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,280
Minnie Hatcher!

691
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,460
This is James Earl.

692
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:33,960
James Earl.

693
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,460
James Earl.

694
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,280
James Earl Jones.

695
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,640
Jones Jones.

696
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,040
Jones Jones.

697
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,320
This is James Earl.

698
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,320


699
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,320


700
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,320


701
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,320


702
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,880
James Earl, James Earl, James Earl Jones.

703
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,180
Battle, battle.

704
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,540
The United States.

705
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,180
Listen to this.

706
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,500
Listen to this.

707
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,000
Four, four years ago, the United States brought forth war.

708
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,120
Dedicated to the proposition that all men are living and dead.

709
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,800
Little note, it is altogether war, war, war.

710
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,980
That that nation might take increased dead.

711
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,060
We should do this.

712
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,140
We cannot, we cannot, we cannot score, score what they did.

713
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,320
War, what they did, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what they did.

714
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,520
These dead, dead, dead have died in vain.

715
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,140
This nation under war shall have a new birth of war.

716
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:36,020
And the government of the government, by the government, for the government, dead, shall perish from the earth.

717
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,160
Thin, thin, thin.

718
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:44,860
By the shores of Gitche Gumee, by the laughing big sea water,

719
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,260
Neath the shade of mighty pine trees, dwelt the warrior, Heel Wather.

720
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,680
A flat-faced, pigeon-toed, knock-kneed, blubber-headed, tub of lard.

721
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,240
Respectfully submitted for your perusal.

722
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,040
What you're looking at is the butt zone.

723
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,540
Weight in the neighborhood of 350 pounds.

724
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,100
Origin unknown.

725
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,580
Lemur did it, dear friends.

726
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,800
And before that, I Cannot Score by Norrell Kraft.

727
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,960
And before that, some more Lemur.

728
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,060
And the puzzling evidence show with Dr. Philodrum and Dr. Howell.

729
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:30,400
Michael Pepe, Izzy Isn't, and Gary DeBrock-Fran calling in.

730
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,720
And yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, with Princess We Are Go.

731
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,220
And now, PR News.

732
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,060
PR NEWS

733
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,300
PR NEWS

734
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,580
On PR News in Washington, I'm the fourth turkey.

735
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,420
Germany has said Iran will face serious jack straw.

736
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,720
On Wall Street, 3-12-11-11.

737
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,000
Turkish health officials say they have detected a 15th human in the center of the country.

738
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,600
The government is trying to prevent a health crisis by slaughtering the public.

739
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,800
In the border town of Dubai, is it?

740
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,480
Chickens and roosters watched as two teenagers stuffed children into plastic bags.

741
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,460
This is PR News in Washington.

742
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,280
PR NEWS

743
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,780
Next, we have texto from Tobe.

744
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:19,500
They're screwed because it's way off the beaten track record.

745
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,900
They gave this up in action.

746
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,180
And this is PSAT'somon and AkaiMé» hut in stitches

747
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,420
It's 001 Nerd and it's left now trips out of a

748
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:32,420


749
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:32,500


750
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,580
Hit the cellphone button down.

751
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,460
Good job.

752
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,260
No pressure.

753
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,260


754
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,260


755
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,260


756
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,260


757
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Nobody can tell me what to do

758
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,180
Not even you

759
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,980
Nobody wants to play with me

760
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,740
Just because I am not friendly

761
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:01,120
All the other kids are playing funny games

762
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,040
While I stay by myself and examine my brain

763
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,140
I got a world of my own

764
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,900
I see things that you don't

765
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:20,340
Nobody can tell me what is good

766
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,900
Though you wish you could

767
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,820
Nobody wants to play with me

768
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,520
Just because I am not sexy

769
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,240
All the other kids are fooling around

770
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,920
But I'm several miles above the ground

771
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,000
I got a world of my own

772
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,760
I see what is not there

773
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,860
Nobody can tell me how to feel

774
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,500
I know that's real

775
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,240
Nobody wants to play with me

776
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,920
Just because I have no family

777
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,740
All the other kids have wives and jobs

778
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,640
While I lay in the gutter and think and sob

779
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,800
I got a world of my own

780
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,520
I see sadness and dirt

781
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,660
Nobody can tell me what is right

782
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,480
Try to fight

783
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,520
Try to fight

784
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,300
Nobody wants to play with me

785
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,260
Just because I am old and ornery

786
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,660
All the other kids have grandchildren

787
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:58,300
They chatter and they squabble but I ignore them

788
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,200
I got a world of my own

789
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,980
I see all that I am

790
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,840
Nobody can tell me why I live

791
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,700
You have nothing to give me

792
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,640
I see all that I am

793
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:35,640


794
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Why does it have alos for me

795
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,760
I see all that I know

796
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,080
I can and want to

797
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,060
Why does a soul of mine

798
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,320
How exactly they flesh my flesh

799
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,240
And tell me that when man's blood runs dry

800
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,240
How often it hurls out Am slips of my tongue

801
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,000
I feed my human flesh

802
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,620
I ask to be what I want

803
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,980
And carrieth a briefcase and brown loafers.

804
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,320
And yea, he shall attend to thine barbecue.

805
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:28,800
You know, some people think that the pipe of Bob Dobbs is a symbol of drugs and drug abuse.

806
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:35,100
And nothing could be further from the truth because it is a tunnel of knowledge.

807
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,700
It is a funnel for slack.

808
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,480
Nothing could be further from the truth.

809
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,760
That tunnel is a funnel.

810
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,620
Nothing has no relative distance to the truth.

811
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,620
It is in fact a pipeline to eternal slackdomness.

812
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,640
You mean a pipeline to eternal damnation.

813
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,920
No, into the lungs of Bob, my friend.

814
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,900
It is your path into the lungs of Bob.

815
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,000
If you can butt, throw your butt into that pipe.

816
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,240
Light yourself.

817
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,400
Light yourself.

818
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,200
Stop it.

819
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,920
Cut it out.

820
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,140
You.

821
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,280
You got me.

822
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,680
Out of the lotion.

823
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,080
Baby, there's nothing like it.

824
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,680
It's real slack.

825
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,380
It's better than sex.

826
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,460
It's better than crack.

827
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,240
They say it's better than winning at gambling.

828
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:32,600
It's better than the finest hamburgers you ever had.

829
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,720
They say about Bob.

830
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,140
Slack.

831
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,180
They say.

832
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:36,720
Oh, yes.

833
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,120
No, no.

834
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,520
Radio, you holding it down, though.

835
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,340
The burning cigarette.

836
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,820
Thanks, man.

837
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
We're trying to hold it down.

838
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,500
It's flying out from under our hands.

839
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,500
It's out of control.

840
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,620
Oh, you're doing fine.

841
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,500
Maintain.

842
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,880
You know, you're saving lives.

843
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,080
You can relax in the safety of your own delusions.

844
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,260
That's what Bob said.

845
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,620
So pick up on it.

846
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,860
We do it for the children.

847
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,200
Pick up.

848
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,080
Will you pick up?

849
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,500
Feel good?

850
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,880
Yeah, but that's mind-body.

851
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,520
You trust in your most sacred.

852
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,600
Yeah, we're doing it for the children.

853
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:05,960
We're not playing.

854
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,620
It's not for the kids, man.

855
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,880
It's all about the children.

856
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,100
Won't anybody think of the children right now?

857
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:11,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

858
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,680
Ah!

859
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,760
Alien space monster Jehovah One really exists.

860
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,780
Over three billion people on this planet believe in Jehovah.

861
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,500
So even if he doesn't exist, with that kind of firepower behind him,

862
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,260
you'd better believe he exists.

863
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,140
And anyway, it would surely take a conspiracy bigger than the military,

864
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,160
industrial, international, advertising, music, government, film, media,

865
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,820
and fashion conspiracies to completely convince that many suckers.

866
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,420
Oh, right, that's right.

867
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,860
You'd better believe in him.

868
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,140
We've reported his insane, murderous, genocidal activities to the elder gods,

869
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,640
but there's nothing they can do until 1998.

870
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,700
And so, until then, we must do as Jehovah says.

871
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,240
In fact, if he's as omnipotent,

872
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,080
as they claim, we have no choice but to do what he says.

873
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,520
What he says is what we do.

874
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,520
We are just puppets acting out in his bizarre snuff movie.

875
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:15,980
Probably.

876
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,880
I mean, to be honest, it's quite difficult to work out what God's saying,

877
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,560
what with all these false religions around.

878
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,300
And I should know, I'm a minister in one of them.

879
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,360
The point, brothers and sisters, is that even Bob doesn't have all the answers.

880
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,920
And neither does anybody else.

881
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,220
You must love...

882
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,440
Learn to think for yourself.

883
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,300
Only Bob can show you how.

884
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,420
For just a small fee, we can at least help you flesh out your fantasy

885
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,600
that there are some answers.

886
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,920
Help you pull the wool over your own eyes.

887
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,060
My final point this evening, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, is this.

888
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,580
The official, divine, all-inclusive excuse.

889
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,020
Every subgenius minister gets a lovely copy of these

890
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,300
in beautiful second-generation photocopy.

891
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,400
Because Bob comes not to forgive our sins,

892
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,060
but to justify and excuse them.

893
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,800
The text of the excuse goes a little like this.

894
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:25,080
I'm a high priest apprentice of a man class

895
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:31,300
in the church of the subgenius.

896
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:45,100
A religious faith for scoffers, blasphemers, infidels and heathens.

897
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:52,900
For heretics, sinners, creeps and freaks,

898
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,900
the ungodly and the indifferent.

899
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,760
In general,

900
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:10,580
the ethnically all-encompassing subgenius race.

901
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:19,120
The mission of the subgenius church

902
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,060
is total blissful slack.

903
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,980
And no one better get in the way of a subgenie

904
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,880
than Bob.

905
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,060
And whatever he may lack,

906
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,580
he's got an excuse.

907
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,800
He's got an excuse.

908
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,300
He's got an excuse.

909
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,520
He's got Bob's excuse.

910
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,280
He's got Bob's excuse.

911
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,280


912
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:02,840
He's got Bob's excuse.

913
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:11,180
To manipulate an alien monster.

914
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,960
Jehovah one and his star fist.

915
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,100
The very meaning of wrong

916
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,540
as its known on this planet

917
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,560
is meaningless shit.

918
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:42,480
Right and wrong and everything else are equal at least in theory.

919
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:54,460
Thus to restrict my behavior in any way invites God's wrath.

920
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,700
I have an excuse.

921
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,540
I have an excuse.

922
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,900
I have an excuse.

923
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,040
I've got Bob's excuse.

924
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:17,780
Excuse.

925
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:28,420
I'm a tool of Jehovah so you're human.

926
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:34,280
Be they religious, scientific or moral.

927
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:46,100
They don't apply to use them against me is against God's inscrutable plan.

928
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,840
He'll return this world to an Eden-like state.

929
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,700
By whatever means he feels.

930
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:10,600
Be it atomic war, economic disaster or hostile UFOs.

931
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,420
I've got an excuse.

932
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,220
I've got an excuse.

933
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,700
I've got an excuse.

934
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,500
I've got an excuse.

935
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,720
I've got Bob's excuse.

936
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:45,040
To accuse a church member of any wrong.

937
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:50,040
Cause him pain or steal his slack.

938
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,040
Is to restrict his freedom of religion.

939
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,680
Not to mention bringing death.

940
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:58,680


941
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:58,680


942
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:58,680


943
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:58,680


944
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:58,680


945
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:58,680


946
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:58,680


947
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,700
Doom upon us all

948
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:09,020
What I've done was my fated duty

949
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:14,560
Forever sanctioned and condoned

950
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,520
Justified in perpetuity

951
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:25,360
By Bob and God and church and soul

952
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,680
I've got an excuse

953
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,380
I've got an excuse

954
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,560
I've got an excuse

955
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,600
I've got Bob's excuse

956
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,520
Thank you ladies and gentlemen!

957
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,480
Praise Bob!

958
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,100
And praise Andy!

959
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,680
Reverend Priest in London, England

960
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,720
Just amazing dear friends

961
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,340
With the musical sung version of

962
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,840
The huge excuse document

963
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,360
That every subject is actually

964
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,620
Yes, in its ordainment package

965
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,660
Which

966
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,040
Uh

967
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:24,740
Uh

968
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:25,940
Now uh

969
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,200
Actually what was my point gonna be about that?

970
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,900
The point is you can learn to forget!

971
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,560
You can learn

972
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,040
Now what was it we were supposed to forget?

973
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,440
To forget

974
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,840
You can forget about God

975
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,420
You can forget about money

976
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,800
You can forget about sex

977
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,540
But you can't forget about Bob!

978
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,340
You know I think when people first realized

979
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,180
That that's when they start to get a little scared of the church of the subgenius

980
00:44:59,180 --> 00:44:59,560
Cause uh

981
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,420
They realize they can't forget about Bob uh

982
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,940
And for all the goofing around they

983
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,760
They might be doing they uh

984
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,900
They start getting a little bit concerned and uh

985
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,760
That's when we have your first tier subgenius attacks

986
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,900
These figures from deputy sheriffs across the United States

987
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,340
Show a surprising incidence of subgenius acts

988
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,620
Especially when the moon is full

989
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,340
For some strange reason or other, you know?

990
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:25,820
Um

991
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,880
It's probably because we've never been able to figure out

992
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,560
Are these rings?

993
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,220
You can be part of the evil ones plan my friends!

994
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:33,900
Oh

995
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,800
Don't be left out!

996
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,320
Join us humans!

997
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,180
We'll accept you also!

998
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,920
You are free gentlemen

999
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,120
She did manage it then, this way

1000
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,080
Beware the false prophets who will lead you astray

1001
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,200
With their promises of uh

1002
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,240
Uh, of, of, of...

1003
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,300
False slack!

1004
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,820
Where gimme bob and pinkness dwells,

1005
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,360
false prophets from their citadels,

1006
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,200
he topples down to nether hells.

1007
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,060
Friends, just take a look around you

1008
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,940
and you can tell that what we're saying is true!

1009
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:15,460
Oh, gosh!

1010
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,740
It couldn't be more obvious!

1011
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,260
They hide it in plain sight!

1012
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:25,580
This is the mighty city of Thanagotopolopolis.

1013
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,900
You have no choice.

1014
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,880
The ancients knew slack!

1015
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,820
But they found that when they tried to harness its awesome power,

1016
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:44,540
the city of Mutantis was forced beneath the earth's crust.

1017
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:45,880
Yes, friends!

1018
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,900
Giant palaces of science and shining sorcery

1019
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,480
destroyed forever.

1020
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:58,040
The great, the great city of Mutantis was destroyed, and why?

1021
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,500
Because they misused slack.

1022
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,700
They thought they could wear slack.

1023
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,980
Turns out that...

1024
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,020
But you must ask yourself, what is too much slack?

1025
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,160
Is there such a concept as too much slack?

1026
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,060
Never.

1027
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:19,040
Is there ever too big a bowl of cereal that you can't eat before you go to bed?

1028
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:19,620
No!

1029
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,160
There's not too much slack, friends, but there is false slack,

1030
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,900
or slack focused in the wrong places.

1031
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:33,660
The wrong parts of the body can exude a type of slack that is unseemly.

1032
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:38,900
And how does one recognize wrongful slack, you might ask, my dear friends?

1033
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,680
Well, the fact is that when wrongful slack occurs, you don't need to ask.

1034
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,120
You know it's wrong.

1035
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:45,760
Oh, you can tell.

1036
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,780
You feel the wrongness of it.

1037
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,160
That's most slackly known.

1038
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,600
The unclean, slimy...

1039
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:49,880
That's most slackly known.

1040
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1041
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1042
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1043
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1044
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1045
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1046
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1047
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1048
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1049
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1050
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1051
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1052
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


1053
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,700
Crawling wrongness on it.

1054
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,280
Crawling in reptile flesh upon the bosom of the ground.

1055
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,100
And you want to flee back to Bob's bosom.

1056
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,120
The eye of man, a little narrow orb closed up and dark.

1057
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,040
510-848-4425.

1058
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,900
That's the number of the beast!

1059
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,200
The great light communicating with the void.

1060
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,740
The devil, he's here.

1061
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,380
He's among us.

1062
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,060
The devil owns this world.

1063
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,540
He owns this world.

1064
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,300
He owns this building.

1065
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,500
He owns KPFA.

1066
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:21,980
Wait.

1067
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,660
But he don't own Bob.

1068
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:24,980
He owns all Berkeley.

1069
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,700
Wait.

1070
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,460
All of California is owned by...

1071
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,500
He owns you, but he don't own Bob.

1072
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,280
Well, I don't own to that.

1073
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,540
He owns Bob.

1074
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,680
He owns this whole hemisphere.

1075
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,540
Wait.

1076
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,980
Owns Deuce Trace Couture.

1077
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:39,660
The devil...

1078
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,720
He owns the whole world.

1079
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,940
The devil, my friend, owns you.

1080
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,260
But he owns J.R. Bob Dobs.

1081
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,340
He owns the whole world in his hands.

1082
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:46,760
Oh, my God.

1083
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,100
He's down by his...

1084
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,820
Glove and hoof and his forked tail.

1085
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,080
You are the devil's payment to Bob, my friend.

1086
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,780
That is your role on this planet.

1087
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,980
That is why you were brought to this planet.

1088
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,500
To have pure slack.

1089
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:05,320
To squirt or ooze in sexful sex urge.

1090
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:12,580
And to further Bob's plan by being part of his payment from the devil.

1091
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,540
The devil is handing your soul over to Bob.

1092
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,660
Praise Bob.

1093
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,780
I gave my soul...

1094
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,680
Where would you rather be?

1095
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,740
In the devil's back pocket or in Bob's?

1096
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:34,720
Bob's playing pocket pool with your soul right now.

1097
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,620
I was wondering what was jiggling around and jiggling...

1098
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,220
I want you to rejoice.

1099
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,980
I want you to feel that slack rising up.

1100
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:45,960
Oh, my God.

1101
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,800
I can feel it.

1102
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,960
I want you to feel the power.

1103
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:49,940
I can feel it.

1104
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,960
Coming through these radio waves tonight.

1105
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,420
I want you to feel that slack.

1106
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,160
And I want you to praise Bob.

1107
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,180
That's right.

1108
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,340
Praise Bob.

1109
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,020
How did I ever get mixed up in this horrible, slimy religion?

1110
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:04,880
Party!

1111
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,120
You're some genius heretic.

1112
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,080
It rings true.

1113
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,480
What about these line items that I'm going to say?

1114
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,160
Where do all these pockets go?

1115
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,120
What about these line items?

1116
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,500
Do I have to constantly be bringing them?

1117
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,700
I'm going to give you back to the line items.

1118
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,040
The space bankers see every bit of this.

1119
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,900
If you can tell me what the secret word is...

1120
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,820
You'll talk about anything but the line items.

1121
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,300
And that's why we are gathered for this business meeting.

1122
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,200
You'll talk about anything but the budget.

1123
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,940
Why we've got the mental stability of a peanut.

1124
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,500
All we can do is just wander around aimlessly.

1125
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,880
One tangent to another.

1126
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:47,560
And all we want to do is just go over these line items one by one.

1127
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,180
Look, look, look, look.

1128
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,280
Examining each of them.

1129
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,100
We'll trim every one of them in the minutest detail.

1130
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:01,460
As we consumed our special meal of gruel and some genius biscuits.

1131
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,140
Yes, meat biscuits.

1132
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,400
They're much like pemmican.

1133
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:15,360
We learned this special recipe from our Native American brothers.

1134
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,580
Brought it forth.

1135
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:21,820
And revealed it to us, the subgeniuses.

1136
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:27,860
And that's why we eat it at this special occasion of Stanksgiving.

1137
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,900
Out of your honey.

1138
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,760
Well, Stanksgiving was actually yesterday.

1139
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,580
And that was most enjoyable.

1140
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,600
The food was quite good.

1141
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,340
Well, mention it.

1142
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,660
Well, I thought I'd be quite good myself.

1143
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,780
But that's, you know...

1144
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,080
And beholding of the time of...

1145
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,540
Stanksgiving is...

1146
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:47,980
The time of...

1147
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:48,620
Pee.

1148
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,420
Pee.

1149
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,700
And put...

1150
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,580
Pee dog and poop dog.

1151
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,640
We must remember that together...

1152
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,680
Kind of the Jesuits of the church.

1153
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,520
We can bring the church into the future.

1154
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,620
It's so easy to satisfy these guys.

1155
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,320
We can have our budget and our line items.

1156
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,240
And the e-pump too.

1157
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,700
We can have the special recreational vehicles.

1158
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,520
Hey, is this the subgenius radio show?

1159
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,240
Yeah.

1160
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,240
Yeah, the...

1161
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:12,800
Talk about that.

1162
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,440
That's the gobo fam.

1163
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:13,980
Talk about that.

1164
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,040
It is gobo fam.

1165
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,380
They have a subgenius radio show in my sector and no one showed up.

1166
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,920
Well, we waited for you to play some song about sharkies.

1167
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,760
You showed up to be there to know if my subgenius shows live.

1168
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,880
How can you even listen to this show?

1169
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:29,960
I wasn't listening.

1170
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,480
I was chasing my turkey.

1171
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,340
It got away.

1172
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,320
She got some sharkies.

1173
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,120
Damn, that thing was fast.

1174
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,820
Why didn't you put the blow torch to it like you said?

1175
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,060
You gotta kill it first.

1176
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,500
That's a thing.

1177
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,720
You gotta kill it first.

1178
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,940
Now, did you pull the feathers out before it got away?

1179
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:43,340
No.

1180
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:43,560
No.

1181
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,660
We were just trying to pacify it so that it would die for us.

1182
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,940
You didn't want to tell her that you were going to kill her and cook her and eat her.

1183
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:50,060
That's the problem.

1184
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,720
You can't pacify a turkey.

1185
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,720
They never satisfied.

1186
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,160
I said, please, little bird, die so I can eat you.

1187
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,120
I'm your friend.

1188
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:56,680
Hey, would you pull my finger?

1189
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,260
The Turkodopteryx is a hearty beast.

1190
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,600
Did you experience turkinosis?

1191
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,320
I was...

1192
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,340
So, a turkinosis?

1193
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:04,340
Yes.

1194
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,880
It was stuck in my nose.

1195
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,220
Well, you're...

1196
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,400
You tried showing it to them.

1197
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,220
Both of them.

1198
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,560
More turkey speaking than...

1199
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,340
Oh, gosh.

1200
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,160
It was terrible.

1201
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,040
It was terrible.

1202
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:18,660
I tried so hard to get to Berkeley and I swam, I rode, I paddled, I surfed, and I still

1203
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,420
didn't get there.

1204
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,300
Why didn't you try to take a car?

1205
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,000
Talking about simply this...

1206
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,560
I'm sorry.

1207
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,280
I'm just...

1208
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,120
You know...

1209
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,580
You didn't say that.

1210
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,260
That's what I said.

1211
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,720
There was a sign on the freeway.

1212
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,480
You didn't say that.

1213
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,360
You tried to say the word turkey.

1214
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,800
There was a huge sign.

1215
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,000
It said, KPFA that way, not you, Gary.

1216
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,160
Oh.

1217
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:38,400
Oh, that sign.

1218
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,840
It took us 20 minutes to put that sign up.

1219
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,320
Well, you know, I was coming up here all this time and I only had one question.

1220
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:43,320


1221
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:43,320


1222
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:43,320


1223
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,180
I only noticed that sign about two weeks ago.

1224
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:45,640
I got the air in there all this time.

1225
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,720
Yeah, I read it for hours and I just couldn't figure out whether it was me or whether it

1226
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:54,120
was the turkey, but the turkey did take a turn the other way at the sign and I was...

1227
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,080
Oh, it was awful.

1228
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:55,680
Oh, my soul.

1229
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,820
I think they call it the rapture of the road.

1230
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:58,600
Oh, okay.

1231
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,320
Hey, are you guys talking turkey?

1232
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,320
So you've been Gary?

1233
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:00,680
Gary?

1234
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,140
Gary?

1235
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:01,600
Gary?

1236
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:01,900


1237
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:02,040
Gary?

1238
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,040


1239
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,040


1240
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,060
Gary?

1241
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:02,320
Gary?

1242
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:02,360
Gary?

1243
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:02,480
Gary?

1244
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:02,520
Gary?

1245
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,340
Gary?

1246
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:15,700
Gary?

1247
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,120
Gary?

1248
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:19,820
Gary?

1249
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,880
Is that a turkey?

1250
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,500
Is this kid a turkey?

1251
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,300
Are you a turkey?

1252
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,020
Gary?

1253
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,040
Gary?

1254
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,040


1255
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,040


1256
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,040


1257
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,040


1258
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,040


1259
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,040


1260
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,040


1261
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,600
Oh, it's a turkey.

1262
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:30,600


1263
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:30,600


1264
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:30,620


1265
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:30,760


1266
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:30,800


1267
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:30,800


1268
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:30,800


1269
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:39,680
fut, are you a turkey?

1270
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,140
Were you a turkey when you were in school?

1271
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:42,320
You know, I'm a turkey.

1272
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,300
You know, I was good.

1273
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,900
The subgenius hour of slack.

1274
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,480
Yes, the subgenius hour of slack is what you've been hearing.

1275
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:56,900
And if you want to hear and or read or even feel more,

1276
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:01,520
there's plenty of it at subgenius.com

1277
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:08,060
or actually at any library that has the book of the subgenius or Revelation X.

1278
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,000
Meanwhile, we're at this address.

1279
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,460
Friends, you got your pencil ready?

1280
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:17,460
We're at Post Office Box 181417.

1281
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:31,220
That's subgenius at P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1282
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:37,760
The background music has all been from their new album, Blue Marble,

1283
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,420
The Flying Ryan Brothers.

1284
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,440
And you can get more Flying Ryan.

1285
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:47,760
Ryan Brothers information at Ryanetics.com.

1286
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:53,280
Sort of like Dianetics, but it's R-Y-A-N-etics.com.

1287
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,680
Friends, they hail from Des Plaines, Illinois, however that's pronounced.

1288
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,260
And now, the news.

1289
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,940
Hello, this is Shouting.

1290
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,380
Welcome to PRTR.

1291
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:20,080
We're talking about a brand new book that's titled The Ick Ick Girl.

1292
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,780
And I see you all the time.

1293
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,240
And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven,

1294
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,060
How are we going to cum?

1295
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:33,940
Listen to me, friend.

1296
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:34,980
Here's how we're going to cum.

1297
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,080
And they came by the blood of the Lamb.

1298
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,800
And they love their cums.

1299
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,440
How?

1300
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,800
First of all, shed cum to Jesus.

1301
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,960
Come to him and say,

1302
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:46,980
People today, they are all perverted in some way.

1303
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:47,920
Why?

1304
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,820
Because they is perverts.

1305
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,320
It makes me perverted.

1306
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,140
The animals are perverts.

1307
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,600
God wants you to be like him.

1308
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:02,500
God wants you to enjoy eternal cum with perverts like him.

1309
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,960
Now, let's cum.

1310
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,100
How are we going to cum?

1311
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,320
Say, Pastor, lay it out there.

1312
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,780
The wrong parts of the Bible.

1313
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,900
The body can exude a type of slack that is unseemly.

1314
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,500
Okay, below are the earnings per share of the Subgenius Foundation.

1315
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:22,520
Oh, my God.

1316
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,660
That's all mine now, isn't it?

1317
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,300
I need that money for a good cum.

1318
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,540
Boy, you'd better get down here.

1319
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,500
We're really in a pickle.

1320
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,020
We're in a financial situation.

1321
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,340
We're in a hole.

1322
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,300
You've got to come through for us.

1323
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:39,360
This whole church is going to go down in a spiral, down the drain, into the sewer.

1324
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,780
Well, if Gary's here, we have a problem.

1325
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:41,780


1326
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:41,780


1327
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:41,780


1328
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,280
A quorum.

1329
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,020
The carpet.

1330
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,000
Well, the...

1331
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,320
A quorum?

1332
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,100
We do have a quorum.

1333
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,940
We've got some gherkins here.

1334
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,320
I mean, we're really in a pickle.

1335
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:49,920
So what does that mean, like nine?

1336
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,320
I know.

1337
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,480
That means we can fuck anything.

1338
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,780
I can tell you're in the pickle because the seeds are falling out of your ears.

1339
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,760
Yeah, well, that shows about how much trouble we're in.

1340
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:01,880
So get the banker on the phone and get him down here before two hours.

1341
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,680
We're sending our seed out of our ears.

1342
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,520
We've got the armored car carrier coming around the back.

1343
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,360
Oh, good, good.

1344
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,900
I'll put the armored car in it.

1345
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,100
Yeah.

1346
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,320
And we'll carry it away.

1347
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,200
Right.

1348
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,620
Do you think there's enough room left in there for my turkey?

1349
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,000
I just thought go left again.

1350
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,540
I don't know if the stockholders would...

1351
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,240
You know, if we can get the turkey to turn left twice more, I'll be at the station.

1352
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,520
All right.

1353
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,620
Bring your firearms.

1354
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,800
Bring everything you've got.

1355
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,220
AK-47s.

1356
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,000
Oh, is that little Michael there?

1357
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,160
How about A.O.

1358
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:30,360
Hippie?

1359
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:30,980
That's little Michael.

1360
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,200
I do recognize him as little Michael.

1361
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,360
Now I'm glad I didn't.

1362
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:38,380
Yeah, but the real question I have is can we get into Dino Island for free still?

1363
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,420
Yeah, you can get into Dino Island.

1364
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,180
It's still there.

1365
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:41,380
Of course.

1366
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,360
That's where we're going now.

1367
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,280
We can still go into Dino Island.

1368
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:44,980
Are you sure about that?

1369
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:45,980
I'm going to retire you.

1370
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:46,720
No way.

1371
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,860
Treasure Island, you mean?

1372
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:48,540
Yeah.

1373
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,300
There's no Dino Island.

1374
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,320
No, that's over in the city.

1375
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:51,740
Yes, there is.

1376
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,820
You just don't know about it.

1377
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:53,440
Oh, damn it.

1378
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,380
It's Wino Island that I want to go to.

1379
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,700
Oh, now it's changed entirely.

1380
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,280
You go back there, it's very depressing.

1381
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,500
The tourist winos have taken over.

1382
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,920
The dinosaurs are on a reservation.

1383
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:02,200
That's right.

1384
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,180
We've dressed the suits.

1385
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,920
We've dressed the tourists in suits.

1386
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,260
And then we sit in the chairs and shake ourselves until we're still able.

1387
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,180
Well, that's one alternate universe.

1388
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:17,060
Much trouble as you want now because they can't get me for your troubles.

1389
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,540
You're in over your head now.

1390
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,840
I am in over my head.

1391
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,840
In fact, it's double over my head.

1392
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,520
Dr. Sorokin, the renowned sociologist at Harvard says...

1393
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,660
That the show should stop right now.

1394
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:27,860
What?

1395
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:28,000
What?

1396
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:29,460
Just go home.

1397
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:32,820
Stop hurting people's brains like this.

1398
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:33,940
My goodness.

1399
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,280
That was almost my end, wasn't it?
