1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,220
Why am I not getting any cassette sound?

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,060
Cassette 1, cassette 2.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,740
Alright, thanks very much, Ray.

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,620
Yes, we're entering a little difficulty with this line.

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,980
One of the guests here makes a distinction.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,300
I think he's being a little facetious, but I'm not bothered.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,140
I think he's just trying to make it.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,420
Most possibly, I'm really mean to him.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,440
I feel quite fashionable.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,820
You honestly believe that?

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,260
Oh, you're Bob Lips?

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,300
Bob Lips?

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,260
Bob Lips?

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,420
Bob Lips?

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,820
Hello, my friend. How are you?

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,260
I am sending you this tape that you will play over the air to the millions of fans who will listen to me.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,100
Ah, Hour of Slack, one of the greatest shows in the world.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,180
And I have a new guest, a new person, who is here with me.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,160
Yes, Mr. Pee-Pee will like to introduce his son, Baby Pee-Wee.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,020
Hello, this is Baby Pee-Wee.

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,620
Are you nice today?

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,180
I'm very nice. I've always been very nice.

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,020
And how big are you, Mr. Pee-Pee Jr.?

24
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,100
I'm twice as big as my daddy.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,000
Son, what did I tell you about bragging?

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,720
I told you that this is the Hour of Slack program.

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,820
You should not brag.

28
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:42,060
But if you do, be honest and tell us how big is it really the listening audience of Hour of Slack would really like to know?

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm always twice as big as you have ever said.

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,460
Ah, like father like son.

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,820
Oh, the momentum.

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:58,900
Oh, well, I just want to say hello and thank you, Hour of Slack and Ivan Stang for playing this tape.

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,960
And if I could do anything for anybody, ooh, just come over anytime.

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,220
Bye-bye.

35
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,520
Bye-bye.

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,740
Bob loves you.

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,020
Bob loves you.

38
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,840
Bob loves you.

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,940
Bob loves you.

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,000
Anyway, I think you're broadcasting from Berkeley, California into the Bay Area.

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,520
And he's in Dallas, you know.

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
And there's people in Dallas who don't know the difference between James Joyce and Joyce Brothers.

43
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,140
So that's why you have to lecture them.

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,580
And besides, I think you should sometimes lecture your audiences.

45
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,620
You are a doctor after all.

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,400
You're up there in front of them all.

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,980
You have the controls.

48
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,160
You have the microphones.

49
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,260
All they can do is either listen or not listen.

50
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,040
You put them in a binary state.

51
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,420
A passive binary state.

52
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,120
They can either listen to what you have to say or not listen to what you have to say.

53
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,160
They can turn you on or turn you off.

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,100
And perhaps until the moment they tune you in, you're nothing but a wave front probability.

55
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,040
You don't really exist for them.

56
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,600
But there's nothing wrong with that.

57
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:13,820
And I think that's the way it is.

58
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:13,820


59
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:13,820


60
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:13,820


61
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,120
Just stompin' a few butts.

62
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:26,400
I've always believed that one of our most important functions in this church has been to administer a good kick in the ass.

63
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,500
Maybe if you kick them hard enough in the ass, it pops their eyes open.

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,240
And a jolt of surprise opens up their lobes.

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,020
They see something and registers, you know.

66
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,400
The devil owes you money, friend.

67
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,640
But Bob Dobbs is the bank where you can cash it in.

68
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,340
We gotta burn out the banks of the devil.

69
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,620
We gotta root him out.

70
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,920
Burn out the hate.

71
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,280
Burn out the radiation.

72
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,800
Burn out the fire.

73
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,860
These words may be harsh.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,180
They may not go down well on the polished ears of the rationalists, the modernists, those who wish to see proof of Bob.

75
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,720
But I don't care what they say.

76
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll keep preaching.

77
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,560
If you go down, pull them with you.

78
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,180
Please, Bob, help me.

79
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,940
Somebody let there be slack.

80
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,420
Welcome potential initiates.

81
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,500
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

82
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,340
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

83
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,040
Hour of Slack.

84
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,940
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

85
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,400
Welcome dear friends to the subgenius hour of Slack.

86
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,080
Slark.

87
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,980
Slark.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,020
Slark.

89
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,100
Slark.

90
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:03,780


91
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,380
Slark.

92
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,760
Slark.

93
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,840
Slark.

94
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,000
Slark.

95
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,520
Slark.

96
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,520


97
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,700
Stardust.

98
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,100
Today aColl senhor.

99
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,100


100
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,100


101
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,080
Welcome.

102
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,300


103
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,340
Listen all, come all.

104
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:44,060
And as we watched, my friend very suddenly and violently vomited.

105
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,480
Who's going to listen to that?

106
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,200
And when they do, how are they going to feel?

107
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,020
Well, I don't have to think about that.

108
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,420
You do.

109
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,400
Whoever you are.

110
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,100
Wish you were a genius but feel like only a sub-genius.

111
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,800
Have a kisser Darth Vader's mom would expunge.

112
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,560
Tired of gorge-clogging crypto-wimpism?

113
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,460
I have a solution.

114
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,180
Stay tuned in the weeks to come for exciting lectures such as

115
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,040
Drink Your Way to Happiness

116
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,460
and a special tour of the Roy Rogers Museum

117
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,020
where Bob will prove the trigger has moved again.

118
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,320
All this and more on your favorite soundtracks.

119
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,900
Soundtrack for a crumbling society.

120
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,980
Food Fights of the Gods.

121
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
All great things are happening.

122
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,300
God is showing people things.

123
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,120
Many of you are hearing verses.

124
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,020
You're tormented.

125
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,520
Your mind is tormented.

126
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,180
You're famine.

127
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,960
Some of you husbands and wives.

128
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,700
You mumble, grumble, complain, frostbite.

129
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,160
Few demon powers has tried to destroy your marriage, your home.

130
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,920
So you need to come.

131
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,080
If you can't man, you ought to get these tapes in hell

132
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,220
on Demonology Tape 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

133
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,480
6 and on right on up till we get through.

134
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,600
And we'll be offering the tape on

135
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,820
Can a Christian Be Demon Possessed?

136
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,080
at the end of the program.

137
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,240
But we're going to take you into that service right now.

138
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,180
We're going to take you into that service in progress

139
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,040
where we are sharing on the subject

140
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,300
Can a Christian Be Demon Possessed?

141
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,580
Friends, the conspiracy altogether has something like

142
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,320
50 or 60,000 nuclear weapons.

143
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,060
How many does the church have?

144
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,160
Only three.

145
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,900
But yet we dare to fight the...

146
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,980
We're going to do it.

147
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,400
We're going to fight them.

148
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,280
We don't care how many we have.

149
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,780
Because, friends, it's always the crazy people.

150
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,000
It's always the eccentrics, the outsiders

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,660
that are dumb enough to take on the conspiracy.

152
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,160
Oh, yes, friends.

153
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,120
Another rule of the Church of the Subgenius.

154
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,140
Don't just eat that hamburger.

155
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,320
Eat the hamburger.

156
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,380
The hell out of it.

157
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,380
Friends, do you know how to have a good time?

158
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,100
Say yes.

159
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,560
Yes!

160
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,740
Do you know how to have a good time?

161
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,300
Yes!

162
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,560
Do you need Bob to have a good time?

163
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,060
Yes!

164
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,480
No! No!

165
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,340
Bob once said, no, we're right.

166
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,040
You don't have to have Bob to have a good time.

167
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,320
That's how you know whether you're a subgenius.

168
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,680
If you...

169
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,000
Do you need Bob?

170
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,760
No!

171
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,420
Then you have Bob in your life, my friend.

172
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,180
Bob has...

173
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,460
Bob has already entered your life.

174
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,520
We can't fight him, but they can't win.

175
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,080
And it's...

176
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,040
It's his life.

177
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,080
This is the sorrow of world religion.

178
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,640
Bob is out there...

179
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,500
It's the Robin Hood of religion.

180
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,480
Bob's out there scratching a bloody bee

181
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,520
on the beefy seat of that monstrous conspiracy.

182
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,920
No offense.

183
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,000
Not that much.

184
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,100
Bob's out there scratching a bloody bee on the beefy seat of that monstrous conspiracy.

185
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,140
Bob's out there scratching a bloody bee on the beefy seat of that monstrous conspiracy.

186
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,340
Hi, girls.

187
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,300
Welcome, everybody, to the Hour of Slack radio ministry on KNON 90.9 radio.

188
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,440
I'm Pastor Bob Pegg.

189
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,280
This is Ivan Stang running the tapes tonight and Dr. Chaos.

190
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,220
Yeah!

191
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,040
Yeah!

192
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,080
Yeah, we're going to tell you a lot about...

193
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,180
The Men in Black tonight.

194
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,720
This is our Men in Black show.

195
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,460
We have come to make you function.

196
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,920
What does it say in my guy's head?

197
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,020
Hold on.

198
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,780
We have come to make you function.

199
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,820
We're not here to destroy.

200
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,780
We are here to employ.

201
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,300
We have come to make you function.

202
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,520
So we can eat you at our functions.

203
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,480
Well, we're going to talk about the Men in Black tonight.

204
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,160
Because UFO aliens...

205
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,700
They're already living among us, friend.

206
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,200
That's right.

207
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,220
Evil aliens in the form of subversive Men in Black

208
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,340
are infiltrating Earth secretly,

209
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,480
preparing for a takeover of our planet,

210
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,560
say the experts.

211
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,840
Electronics expert Oscar Magosky reveals

212
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,620
that he's traveled through galaxies following their evil plans

213
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,760
ever since he was contacted by friendly aliens ten years ago

214
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,420
and told of the planned takeover.

215
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,360
I'm being starved.

216
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,880
We cannot identify...

217
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,940
Take you...

218
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,280
The Men in Black.

219
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,880
They are humanoid in appearance.

220
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,520
We know them by their actions.

221
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,440
They penetrate every level of life.

222
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,040
The Men in Black wear dark business suits

223
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,900
and do the dirty work such as terrorism.

224
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,060
They drive big black cars.

225
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,780
The classic bad guy image.

226
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,440
The Illuminati, however,

227
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,080
manipulate politicians and financiers.

228
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,540
You know, friends?

229
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,740
Behind every...

230
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,640
Senator...

231
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,000
Every...

232
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,420
Banker...

233
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,280
Every big deal...

234
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,040
These evil creatures are back there,

235
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,960
whispering their commands.

236
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,720
And they all work together.

237
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,920
We'd like to hear about what you know

238
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,740
about the Men in Black.

239
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,060
I'll be talking to you on the phone.

240
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,100
And if you know anything at all about the Men in Black,

241
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,560
we'd be happy to talk to you.

242
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,900
Our number tonight...

243
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,620
Only use this number tonight, please.

244
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,520
828...

245
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,400
Sorry, it's 828...

246
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,280
9500, thank you.

247
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,620
828-9500.

248
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,020
Just call us back there.

249
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,520
Okay.

250
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,060
All right, people,

251
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,320
but listen to this.

252
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,320


253
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,800
This is a beautifulじゃgnon on the record of this play.

254
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:15,800


255
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,780
You'll then find Mary gumbo will join us somebody,

256
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:16,780


257
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:16,780


258
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:16,780


259
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:16,780


260
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,640
Every-

261
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:17,820
I am SHE.

262
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,180
And-

263
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,120
I am her.

264
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,240
Just kind of my proceed

265
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,000
When some man comes along

266
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,480
And claims a godly need

267
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,380
He'll clean you up

268
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,680
Right through your teeth

269
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,840
That's right, you asked for it.

270
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,980
Remember, there's a big difference

271
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,980
between kneeling down and bending over.

272
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,020
He's got $20 million

273
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,180
In his heavenly bank account

274
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,760
All from those chumps

275
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,140
Who was born again

276
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,480
Oh, yeah

277
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,680
Oh, yeah

278
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,180
He's got seven limousines

279
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,220
And a private plane

280
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,420
All for the use

281
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,120
Of his special friends

282
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,160
Oh, yeah

283
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,480
Oh, yeah

284
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,780
He's got thousand dollar suits

285
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,000
And a wimply tie

286
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,840
Girls love to stroke him

287
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,580
While he's on the phone

288
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,760
Oh, yeah

289
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,780
Oh, yeah

290
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,080
And the House of Representatives

291
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,160
He's a group of men

292
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,160


293
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,560
Who's the guy

294
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,920
When he gives thanks

295
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,420
He is not alone

296
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,540
He is dealing

297
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,540
He is really dealing

298
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,620
IRS can't determine

299
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,600
Where the hook is

300
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,680
It is easy with the Bible

301
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,520
To pretend that you're a chauvinist

302
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,360
And the one and the two

303
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,780
They will get him

304
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,780
They will never get him

305
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,220
For the naughty stuff that he did

306
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,380
It is best in cases like this

307
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,560
To pretend that you are stupid

308
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,760
Fuck you

309
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,080
He's got presidential help

310
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,500
He's a good person

311
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,500


312
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,500


313
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,500


314
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,500


315
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,500


316
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
He says the breaks

317
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,140
While the lawyers chew

318
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,440
Oh, yeah

319
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,680
They sure do

320
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:51,560
And the governor's agreed to say he's a lovely man

321
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,900
He makes it easier for them to screw

322
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,260
All of you

323
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,500
Yes, that's true

324
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,360
Cause he helps put the fear of God in the common man

325
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:19,820
Smashing up money everywhere he can

326
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:26,180
Oh yeah, oh yeah

327
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:33,000
He's got twenty million dollars in his heavenly bank account

328
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,720
You ain't got nothing, people

329
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,340
You ain't got nothing, people

330
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,340


331
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,260
You ain't got nothing, people

332
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,960
You ain't got nothing, people

333
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,900
Thank the man

334
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,980
Oh yeah

335
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,180
As we end another broadcast, let me say

336
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,680
It's all a scam

337
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,020
It's all just dancing

338
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,560
Around a pipe

339
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,340
Of bulls

340
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,140
And Bob Dobbs

341
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,600
And Bob Dobbs

342
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,540
Might be able to change your life

343
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,480
If you grab this chance

344
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,200
If you send three lousy guilders

345
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,140
And what is three guilders nowadays?

346
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,520
It's nothing

347
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,340
If you send those three guilders to Dallas, Texas

348
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,200
And we will once more give you the address

349
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,820
You will be saved

350
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,340
And Bob Dobbs

351
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,140
You might not believe what happens to you if you're saved

352
00:16:47,020 --> 00:17:00,660
And that address, once again, my friends, is P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214

353
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,360
And that address, once again, my friends, is P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214

354
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,180
And you can address it personally to Bob

355
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,060
And it's spelled J.R. Open for the public

356
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,060


357
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,060


358
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,260
And quotation marks

359
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,940
B.O.B.

360
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,660
Close quotation marks

361
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,020
Dobbs

362
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,960
Sure he makes you stay fucking

363
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,740
What he did with those young women that time

364
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,920
Well, I think the newspapers exaggerated that

365
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,020
I know that Bob will do all of us fine in the long run

366
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,980
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob in our lives

367
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,900
In our lives

368
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,640
In 1981

369
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,660
And in 1984

370
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,960
¬%$¬% cop

371
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,020
And in 1994

372
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,980
My little brother

373
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,360
And in 1991

374
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,440
And in 1995

375
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,160
When they bring the conspiracy to its heels

376
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:09,160
and in that wondrous year that we know is going to come all too soon upon us.

377
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,600
And we'll leave our earthly things behind and we'll go and join the exes

378
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,920
from God only knows what strange planet they come from

379
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,380
if they really even come from a planet at all

380
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,020
and not some energy star beeping away in the darkness

381
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,800
lighting our lives with the technology and the spirituality

382
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,180
and the mentality of planet X.

383
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,700
Planet X coming down to take care of us subgeniuses

384
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,480
and see that there's a place for us in the world

385
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,140
and give us our rightful seat at the right hand of Bob or the left hand of Bob

386
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,400
depending on whether we're rewardians or mediocrities

387
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,060
but I don't want to get lost in the dark and I want to tell you something.

388
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,900
Hello there.

389
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,640
Hello there my friends.

390
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,220
This is Reverend Dr. Sardonicus J. Chaos.

391
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,660
Oh yes, dear friends.

392
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,220
I have a little case history I'd like to relate to you.

393
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,480
All the names of the people and towns in this have been changed to protect the insane.

394
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,680
This story concerns a former associate of mine

395
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,980
the Reverend Albert H.

396
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,540
Radwell.

397
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,640
He used to be a fine, fine colleague of mine in the church.

398
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,420
My own chaotic church of Nege.

399
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,120
And he was doing fine

400
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:49,600
until, well, I'm going to read you excerpts from his journal that he wrote

401
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,040
before he was committed.

402
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,620
The first entry here I'm going to read from.

403
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,540
It's dated on December 12th.

404
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,920
It doesn't have a year listed.

405
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,280
I gave my two weeks notice that I am leaving my job at the power plant.

406
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,080
My supervisor was a bit disturbed by this sudden seemingly motiveless action of mine.

407
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,580
But I feel like I have no choice.

408
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,540
I must leave.

409
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,880
This town has been infiltrated by the men in black.

410
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,740
This fanatical group composed of every sort of...

411
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,000
...discouraged.

412
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,640
Hideous.

413
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,540
Hideous.

414
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,620
People.

415
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,400
And these vermin have had me under observation for the past two weeks.

416
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,580
I knew that they were keeping an eye on me when that black Mercedes, which I have never

417
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,940
seen before, followed me to within half a block from my house.

418
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,900
They must think that I know too much about them.

419
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,760
Actually, I know very little about these men in black.

420
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,460
I wish that I knew what they're going to do next, but it's really up to them to make the

421
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:56,980
next move.

422
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,840
Damn it, I feel so powerless.

423
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,120
So, so confused.

424
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,960
All I can do is play a waiting game and hope that they don't make their move while I am

425
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,240
asleep.

426
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,740
Next entry.

427
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,140
December 17th.

428
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,800
Well, I have lived to see the end of another week.

429
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,140
Next week is my last hit at the power plant and my last in this town.

430
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,680
I'm worried that the men in black will send someone after me before I can get out of town.

431
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,440
I'm afraid that I will be left behind.

432
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,740
What are they waiting for?

433
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,520
This not knowing is making me apprehensive.

434
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,000
My telephone has been making strange clicking sounds, and I fear that my conversations are

435
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,240
now being wiretapped.

436
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,740
Of course, I have spoken to no one about these men in black, and I do not plan to.

437
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,740
So, what will they gain from tapping my phone?

438
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,020
At what point will all this be over with?

439
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,880
I suspect that they will stop at nothing.

440
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,420
I'm afraid that they will stop at nothing.

441
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:02,700
In order to preserve the security of their organization, only time will tell.

442
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,440
Next entry is December 23rd.

443
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,700
There was an explosion today in one of the plant's generators.

444
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,480
A company official said that sabotage is suspected, and I have my own suspicions as to the party

445
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,640
responsible for this sabotage.

446
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,380
I have one question.

447
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,820
What is the cause of the sabotage?

448
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:25,820


449
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,780
meters or so away from the generator in question.

450
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,200
Fortunately, I was at lunch when the blast occurred.

451
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,440
This is making me a nervous wreck.

452
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,160
I'm relieved that this is my last day here at the plant.

453
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,160
After giving the matter some more thought, though, I have decided the explosion was meant

454
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,420
only as a warning because they have watched me closely enough to know that I was out to

455
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,220
lunch and therefore I would not be hurt.

456
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,960
How very considerate.

457
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:05,160
Anyway, this journal goes on and on and apparently we're not sure what exactly happened to him

458
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,840
but he did end up being committed.

459
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:17,300
He's our former co-worker here at the church, Dr. Albert Radwell, and we don't know whether

460
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,780
this is being committed as a result of...

461
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,200
the men in black or his own delusions concerning them.

462
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,260
This is the Nightman calling from K-N-O-N.

463
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,600
You better listen up right now.

464
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,440
I've got some very important news for you.

465
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,900
Brand new mailing address for the matter K-N-O-N is...

466
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,300
Post Office Box 710909.

467
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,320
Dallas, Texas 75371.

468
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,880
That's Post Office Box 710909.

469
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,720
Dallas, Texas 75371.

470
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,960
That's if you want to contact the hottest station on the planet Earth, K-N-O-N.

471
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,680
Dallas, for work.

472
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,140
Hello, friends.

473
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,620
You're on the air with the Hour of Slack radio ministry.

474
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,680
And there's a secret society of scheming aliens that have already gained control of education,

475
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,160
politics, private banking, major law firms, and philanthropic foundations.

476
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:45,120
A researcher, Jerome Eden, explains that evil extraterrestrials will use propaganda to subvert mankind

477
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,980
so that no one will...

478
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,060
even notice they're in control until it's too late.

479
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,920
This is the Men in Black show.

480
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,920
I can hear you.

481
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,840
I can hear you.

482
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,740
Get off there.

483
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,080
I can hear you.

484
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,280
Oh, yes, friends.

485
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:16,080
That was broadcast on a pirate radio station around midnight of June in Amsterdam, Holland.

486
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,920
Pretty weird, eh?

487
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,980
It gets as far away as Amsterdam.

488
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,860
And we got those three guilders in the mail.

489
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,560
Please.

490
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:30,820
Please.

491
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,720
Please.

492
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,200
Please.

493
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,160
Please.

494
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,760
Please.

495
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,820
the knowledge must have come from...

496
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,120
the.

497
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:58,280
space. Watch the heavenlies. It's your spaceship out of control. Does that sound fearful, my friend?

498
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:05,580
Would you say, Jesus, a final great space event as Christ returned to the earth?

499
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:13,480
This is just another one of those kooky concepts that people get and try to pass it off for

500
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,400
gospel truth. You continue to believe in the rapture and look for Jesus Christ,

501
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:26,080
because he's coming very soon. And I seen one of them flying right by over my car,

502
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,280
and he stopped my car, and they took me in, and they said, Jimmy, Jimmy, we're real. We're here.

503
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:39,440
We're here to help you. You understand? We're here to help you and your mother and all those

504
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,380
dear to you and your friends and brother Roloff, and we're going to stop

505
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,460
the evil.

506
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,920
What's going on in the world? We're going to come down, and we're going to help those

507
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,780
evil people find themselves. So you're going to help us, Jimmy. You're going to help us.

508
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:57,360
You're going to tell us which ones are the evil people that we need to correct. Now,

509
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,500
you're going to help us, Jimmy, okay? And then they got back in their spaceship, and

510
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,180
they flew off, and I just found myself in my car again, and I drove on down to that

511
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:12,140
7-Eleven, and my father, of course, he's dead, but they're keeping the water on him. He's

512
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,440
okay.

513
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,460
They're keeping him safe.

514
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,140
They're keeping him safe.

515
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,980
They're keeping him safe.

516
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,180


517
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,220
They're keeping him safe.

518
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,220


519
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:22,080
He told me, he said, I see little men, and he held his fingers like this. It's illusions.

520
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:31,600
He said, I see little men about three inches high. He said, I'm over in Spain or somewhere

521
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,060
like that. He said, I even go into a place like that, and he said, I see these little

522
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,900
objects and these little men and all these little things, and if your heart doesn't go

523
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,820
out for something like that, I don't want you to know.

524
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,220
I said, I've been in the world, and my heart goes out for people like that, and I want

525
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,720
you to know something else. Those people are actually, you know what they're doing?

526
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,820
Those people are really reaching out, trying to find something, and if they can just, if

527
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,360
they can just realize that Jesus has the answer, that Christ has everything that they're looking

528
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:07,620
for, and Christ can get, let them get on high and give them joy, give them peace in the

529
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:07,840
life.

530
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,480
You'll not want any more, don't.

531
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,700
You'll not want any more.

532
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,420
You'll not want any more.

533
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,220
You'll not want any more.

534
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,320
No, don't let me drink those pills, no!

535
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,520
This is KNON 90.9 FM.

536
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,980
This is KNON 19.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

537
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:35,780
Please stop.

538
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,020
Please stop.

539
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,360
Oh yes, dear friends.

540
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

541
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:49,960
Stop.

542
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:00,120
Hi, Pastor Buck here, and if you want to call us at the station, the number is 828-9500.

543
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,820
Give us a call about the Men in Black.

544
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:03,820
Stop.

545
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:05,920
Stop.

546
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,980
But friends, let's begin our sermon tonight by looking to the...

547
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,320
Book of the Subgenius, Chapter 11.

548
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,680
The UFO made me do it.

549
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,580
For these observations on the Men in Black.

550
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,360
But first, one short quote.

551
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,840
Stretch forth thy hands on high.

552
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,080
Rescue me and deliver me from the many waters.

553
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,840
From the hands of aliens whose mouths...

554
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,860
Speak lies and whose right hand is the hand of falsehood.

555
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,280
Psalms 144.7.

556
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,760
And be not forgetful to entertain strangers.

557
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,660
For thereby some have entertained angels unaware.

558
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,220
That was said by St. Paul the Contactee.

559
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,620
But ignore all that.

560
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,820
Any sensible subgenius knows.

561
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:20,160
That Republican and Democrat are laughably meaningless terms for identical pawns in a bigger game.

562
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,400
What they didn't understand was just how little differences there are between any political parties.

563
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,360
Anywhere on the political spectrum.

564
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,580
Looking in perspective at the whole conspiracy.

565
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,300
From a vantage point several steps back from the big circular monster.

566
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,180
They all begin to look the same.

567
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:41,980
It's a big...

568
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,460
Vice.

569
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:50,620
With radical and reactionary rioters forming the bottom half and a fake establishment at the top half.

570
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,820
And the earth itself is being squeezed in between.

571
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,700
With both subgeniuses and humans getting all smushed up together.

572
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,120
The humans don't seem to mind.

573
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,240
But what's bad is the nature of the things that are using the big vice.

574
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,960
Ever-presenting.

575
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,080
The political group claims that under them the people will run things.

576
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,720
But when the people find out what's really going on.

577
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,520
They'll just run.

578
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,680
It wouldn't be so bad if the manipulators were at least human.

579
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,060
If they were at least bipeds.

580
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,480
Now before I say this let me tell you this.

581
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,000
I didn't vote for neither one of them.

582
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,320
One day in the not too distant future.

583
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,600
You funny Americans.

584
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,460
That played that old funny unethical game.

585
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,080
That goes to the polls with pride and dignity.

586
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,260
And stoop to the lowness of always voting for the lesser of the two evils.

587
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,680
It looks like somewhere that funny history ain't too far back.

588
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,380
That's how them Germans got in trouble.

589
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,640
Let Hitler and them Nazis slip up on them.

590
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,060
And y'all go with pride and dignity.

591
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,080
Look at that.

592
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,260
The forces exist.

593
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,020
Without definite form.

594
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,620
But only with an intention.

595
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,160
And a thirst to gain form.

596
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,140
To take on life.

597
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,960
We are what gives them shape.

598
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,420
It is an energy we possess.

599
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:26,800
Slack.

600
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,200
That they vampirize.

601
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,620
In order to lock their non-materiality onto our material world.

602
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,940
Their natural energy stems from nothing less.

603
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:44,060
Than the fitful dreams of the Elder Gods.

604
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,300
And except for top brass.

605
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,760
Most of our military has no idea.

606
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,660
That the country is run by puppets.

607
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:59,580
Kept dancing by inhuman hands from above.

608
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,880
That the line of control goes upwards.

609
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,500
Behind each big wig.

610
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,780
In the smoke-filled boardrooms of the conspiracy's New York bunkers.

611
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,360
Is a shadowy consultant.

612
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,420
Telling him how to deal his cards.

613
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,060
And while the human insiders may squabble among themselves.

614
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,000
The men in black behind them work as one.

615
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,860
Bob knows.

616
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,940
Bob has sat in on their calm, civilized get-togethers.

617
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:42,020
And noticed that the slightest ghastly murmuring from one of these creatures.

618
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,520
Is enough to make a senator break into a cold sweat.

619
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,000
A prime minister suddenly changes tune.

620
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:56,240
A CIA operative inexplicably decide not to give the complete report.

621
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,700
And when the migraine machine is activated in those boardrooms.

622
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,400
All arguments with the plan are cut short.

623
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:12,860
Faster than Darth Vader's mind beams can stoke a death car, Captain.

624
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,240
That's not true.

625
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,220
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack, and a conspiracy of pinks.

626
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,880
The subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

627
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:30,180
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1998.

628
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,940
When the television signal of Amos and Andy.

629
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,420
Reaches the men from planet X.

630
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,500
The aliens will unleash their wrath upon the earth.

631
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,680
And he's looking over his right shoulder at me.

632
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,140
And he's smiling and.

633
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,320
He's.

634
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:48,940
He's.

635
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,720
He's.

636
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:53,960
He's.

637
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,820
He's.

638
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:57,780
He's.

639
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:57,780


640
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:57,780


641
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,240
He's.

642
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:58,560


643
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:58,560


644
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:58,560


645
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:58,560


646
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:58,560


647
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,020
He's.

648
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,880
He's.

649
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,900
He's.

650
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,180
He's.

651
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,500
He's.

652
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:18,600
He's.

653
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,300
He's.

654
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:19,840
He's.

655
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:19,960


656
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,220
And he calls, for the quest to go home.

657
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:22,320


658
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:22,320


659
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:22,500
Black doers don't gather in the light.

660
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:22,900
Half of this сложies.

661
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,280
Half of my territory has been abandoned by me.

662
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,860
All of it.

663
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,320
I'm talking to you.

664
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,240
Oh, yes.

665
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:48,460
Dear friends, it looks like someone's ready to fall victim to our little plan here.

666
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,740
No, I think that Gary has mysterious...

667
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,740
Oh, could this be Gary?

668
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,160
Is this Gary?

669
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,260
Hello.

670
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,420
Who's this?

671
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,080
It's Professor Mickey Grant.

672
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,860
Mickey Grant.

673
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,260
Oh, it's Professor Mickey Grant.

674
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,520
Oh, yes.

675
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,480
I just got back from my recent trip along to Northwest China.

676
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,640
Oh, how is Northwest China, Professor Grant?

677
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,840
Many, many, many Muslims.

678
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,460
How is traffic on the Great Wall?

679
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,460
No traffic at all.

680
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,800
Completely clear when you get to the desert.

681
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,860
Well, now how many copies of Book of the Subgenius

682
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,840
were you able to...

683
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,100
Distribute, Professor Grant.

684
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,160
We got it.

685
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,200
39500 Bob Davison.

686
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,740
You released?

687
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:35,780
Hello?

688
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,660
No, operator.

689
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,460
That's a crank call.

690
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,500
No.

691
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,960
Excuse me, Professor Grant.

692
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,040
We had the conspiracy trying to break in there.

693
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,160
I know.

694
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,760
I know.

695
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,960
It's all the Deng Xiaoping friends.

696
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,580
They always interrupt and cause trouble.

697
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,800
We got 25,000 distributed in land.

698
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,800
And in June, in Inner Mongolia,

699
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,540
we got another 10,000 books out.

700
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,020
They're kind of confused.

701
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,460
Most of them were Muslims, like I said.

702
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:10,680
I explained to them that Bob Dobbs was a latter-day Muhammad.

703
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,060
And they said, oh, hi-ho, hi-ho.

704
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,420
Oh, yes, dear friends.

705
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,780
In case you're totally confused,

706
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,400
this is actually a call from our fellow minister

707
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,260
who just returned from the tour of China.

708
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,420
Yes, and our member in China, Xia Li,

709
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,780
is so excited.

710
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,920
I played him the last broadcast,

711
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,940
and he's doing much research

712
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,680
and talking with the people.

713
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,700
You must remember the people.

714
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,060
He is distributing literature,

715
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,020
taking his very life in hand.

716
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,340
Oh, that's Taipan.

717
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,100
Li Jing, the Pope of all China,

718
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,340
Dr. Grant is referring to, friends.

719
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,400
And this is serious work.

720
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,500
I mean, when you spread the word of Bob in China,

721
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,720
they can't be released.

722
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,780
Oh, the keepers.

723
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,500
They're interrupting to stop the broadcast.

724
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,460
All the way from China, their arm reaches out.

725
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,620
It's the men in black.

726
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,920
Friends, this is the first long-distance calls

727
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,400
KNON has ever received from the mainland China.

728
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,900
Friends, we need more martyrs for the church.

729
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,920
If you live in a communist country...

730
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,680
They're running down all the way in the U.S.

731
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,260
to interrupt and stop all of our work.

732
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,200
And the men in black are working right alongside them

733
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,520
the whole time.

734
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,000
Yes, evil aliens in the form of subversive men in black

735
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,300
are infiltrating Earth, secretly preparing for a takeover of our planet.

736
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,040
I will answer.

737
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,720
It's true.

738
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,460
They're even on the Great Wall.

739
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,360
They used the Great Wall as a guidepost to land their ships.

740
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,100
Oh, those sinister men in black.

741
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,780
The Great Wall spells welcome in the simple alien tongue.

742
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,940
Oh, yes, friends.

743
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,600
Oh, my gosh, they've completely cut us off.

744
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,940
I'm afraid there's only one thing to do in a case like that.

745
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:09,360
But the other one with the evil face, he looks like a Nazi.

746
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,140
He's a Nazi.

747
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,060
Did he have on a uniform?

748
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,920
Yes, yes.

749
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,600
Did he have faces like other people?

750
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,260
His eyes are slant.

751
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,920
Oh, my God.

752
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,860
Angels don't have any emotions.

753
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,660
Doesn't make them any difference either way.

754
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,760
All they're programmed to do is what God tells them to do.

755
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,440
And they'll hearken only to the voice of the Lord Almighty God.

756
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,600
And they are sent to be servants.

757
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:55,500
They are sent to be slave and servant to the heirs of salvation.

758
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,920
Ministering spirits.

759
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,240
sent to minister for those who shall be heirs unto salvation.

760
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:07,820
Let us note in passing that the true symbol of the conspiracy, the eye on the pyramid,

761
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:13,600
was presented to Thomas Jefferson by a mysterious man in black.

762
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:20,000
The actual emblem for the conspiracy is a plastic spoon, fork, and knife,

763
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,140
partially crossed in an ill travesty of the Christian cross death sign.

764
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:31,320
The reason for this stupid logo? Plastic, because that's the nature of it all.

765
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,300
The eating utensils, because they eat us.

766
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,140
The men in black are cannibals.

767
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,460
Not so much in the sense of devouring human flesh, for they do that only on special occasions,

768
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,260
but in the sense that they consume our energy.

769
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,740
The men in black do eat human flesh as often as possible,

770
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,120
and don't.

771
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,200
They draw off our psychic juices,

772
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,140
and they're small timers compared to their masters.

773
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:12,780
And all the angels of God will begin to work and intercede and operate and look under the affairs around it.

774
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,440
I mean they'll begin to work in every direction.

775
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,920
They don't sleep either.

776
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,040
They're not emotional. Angels don't have any emotion.

777
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,000
All they're programmed to do is what God tells them to do.

778
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,120
And they'll hark away.

779
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,720
And only to the voice of the Lord Almighty God.

780
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,640
The Bible says your angel will not forgive you.

781
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,520
They don't have to come here from heaven.

782
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,360
The Bible said they're all sent forth.

783
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,780
They're all already here.

784
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,820
You've got to have substantial proof,

785
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,540
or you're just another nut.

786
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,900
Friends, you hear what he said?

787
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,100
You're just another nut.

788
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,040
Unless you've got the secret file.

789
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,900
Now I want to tell my callers,

790
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,200
this is Pastor Buck,

791
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,800
I've been screening the calls tonight.

792
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,820
I want to tell my callers that I have nothing to do with the fact that every time I reach over

793
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,580
to put a caller on the air,

794
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,780
they mysteriously blink off.

795
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,140
Now does that mean that the men in black are in their homes,

796
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,400
Reverend Stang,

797
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:18,280
and actually hanging up the phones for them and killing them because Gary can't call me back?

798
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,640
The first guy in the first half hour couldn't call me back?

799
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,020
They seem to have control over Electro-Man.

800
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,960
I'm going to have to go to the magnetic processes that we don't even begin to understand.

801
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,640
I am not piddling around with my...

802
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,320
I'm going to just see who...

803
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,980
Oops, and they blinked out again.

804
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,080
I swear it, friends.

805
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,280
I had two callers light up, and they are gone again.

806
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,460
By the way, friends,

807
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:44,620
while we're on, I must say that the revival last night at the Fantasy Fair was a resounding success.

808
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,860
I had to carry bags of money out of there.

809
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,620
Some of it was a tad burnt.

810
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,580
But, you know,

811
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,080
we had to make certain sacrifices

812
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,700
before we can, you know, keep it all.

813
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,180
Who are we talking to on the phone right here?

814
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,780
This is Saint St. St. St. Deanna De'Brien.

815
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,520
Oh, good.

816
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,280
You called back, then.

817
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:02,940
Yeah, yeah.

818
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,440
Good for you.

819
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,640
Here with Pope Robert De' Bob, the pope on the rope.

820
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:12,900
We're here with the 69th Impervious Narcoleptic Church of the blistered, screaming hooter of Bob.

821
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:13,880
Excellent.

822
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

823
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,920
You had something about the men in black.

824
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,680
Let me have that again.

825
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,240
Okay.

826
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,160
Well, I'm here to tell you, friends,

827
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,560
about how the men in black are taking over our minds

828
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,600
by filling us up with factoids,

829
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,080
little bits of useless information that can do nothing for us.

830
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,820
Because, friends, how often have you sat and stared,

831
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,540
loose-jawed and mumbling into that cyclopean's cathode-ray slack vacuum

832
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,400
and awakened to find that six hours had passed,

833
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,440
the hours and minutes sucked into the polished, colorful void of TV land

834
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,560
like a camp accident of Brenda Vaccaro?

835
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,860
Where did that time go?

836
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,520
Where was your time control then, friends?

837
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,720
And how often have you been forced to spend seven hours in a cramped and mind-numbing room

838
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:01,300
with dozens of pink normals adding and indicting the peaceful strains of Lionel Richie

839
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,680
falling gently like a silk teddy on a soup commercial model?

840
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,120
And again, you wait to find that the hours have disappeared and your time spent,

841
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,020
but nothing is different from before.

842
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,140
But is it? Has nothing changed?

843
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,060
Oh, you poor, poor lost soul.

844
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,500
You're barreling down the slack loop.

845
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,720
This freeway that conspiracies set you on,

846
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,500
careening wildly past the JoJo's and fern bars

847
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,080
where more fall slack is readily available in clear $4 bottles of Corona

848
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,960
and individual servings of unsweetened sugar.

849
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,180
You're losing your soul, brother.

850
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,400
And you'll probably never miss it till it's gone.

851
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,180
But wait, you say.

852
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,720
I'm a pretty bright guy.

853
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,660
I keep up on the world around me.

854
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,740
I know what's going on, right?

855
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,280
Oh, son, you're lost and don't even know it.

856
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:47,940
And why?

857
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,200
How did the cons suck your soul out

858
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,680
and leave you a used, discarded condom?

859
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,060
It was easy, friend.

860
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,760
They stole your ability to dream.

861
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,720
And that was simple, too.

862
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,000
They pumped you full of factoids

863
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,980
and told you there was nothing left but what they filled you up with.

864
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,900
And just what are these factoids?

865
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,500
Well, friends, let me tell you a little story.

866
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,300
Before the dawn of man, when we were all naturally asleep,

867
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,220
our universe was suffused with thictoids,

868
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,140
the amino acids of the imagination.

869
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,040
We lived dreams.

870
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,340
We breathed fantasies.

871
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,980
We nocturnally emitted freshets of fancy.

872
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,240
And after the rude awakening,

873
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,960
consumption of thictoids dropped off dramatically,

874
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,800
as illustrated on this chart.

875
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,580
Can you see this in the back row?

876
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:33,300
Oh, yeah.

877
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,640
Hold it up higher.

878
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,480
I can't see it.

879
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,860
So what happened?

880
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,960
Give me my glasses.

881
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,860
The conspiracy found a way to capture those thictoids

882
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,620
that make life bearable and twist them to their own enslaving purpose.

883
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,120
They codified them into an art which they can control.

884
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,180
No, hey.

885
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,900
No heads can roll in the Iliad without the sappy moral instruction of virtue.

886
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,100
No boffing the queen without progenerating a noble city.

887
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,280
In short, no basic fun without a lesson.

888
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,740
And yet we bought it until the conspiracy came up with something even more insidious.

889
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,580
Facts.

890
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,540
You can't dispute the facts, they tell us, because facts are immutable.

891
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,660
They're how the world is.

892
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,500
But they forgot that eventually we'd find out what the facts really were and we'd seize control.

893
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,580
What happened then was obvious.

894
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,240
They panicked.

895
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,600
If they couldn't keep the facts from us, they'd lose control.

896
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,560
What could they do?

897
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,600
Friends, don't believe for a moment that the black boys are stupid.

898
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,340
They saw the way clearly.

899
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,220
They can't kill the facts.

900
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,900
They can't completely control fictions.

901
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,360
So the conspiracy is drowning them all with something more powerful than spermicidal douches,

902
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,740
more insidious than crabs, and more palatable than Coca-Cola.

903
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:41,880
What is it?

904
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:49,180
Friends, the conspiracy is pumping us with factoids, the very stuff of infotainment, the lip gloss on Vanilla.

905
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:49,460
The white.

906
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:54,160
None of those people on that are time that tonight exist, except this electronic lick on these.

907
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:00,240
Wouldn't that factoid, didn't that come from Norman Mailer about how he wrote a book about how he came with Marilyn Monroe?

908
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,540
Yeah, exactly.

909
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:06,760
The news about Gavin McCloud and fights between Linda Evans and Joan Collins.

910
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,340
Right.

911
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,820
Ed McMahon's laugh.

912
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,960
They're cable TV millionaires and they don't exist.

913
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:12,560
Yeah.

914
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,940
Well, thanks a lot.

915
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:18,240
And thanks a lot for that insight into the men in black, if indeed that was insight into the men in black.

916
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:18,620
Yeah.

917
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:35,220
And because the left-right spread is being aggravated to start a war that will put a stumbling block in the way of a further development to save the first third dimensional door.

918
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,640
The conspiracy has just recently bombed my lavatory in Geneva.

919
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:47,220
You can call us with your factoids on the men in black at 828-9500.

920
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,000
That's 828-9500.

921
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,960
This is the R Slack radio ministry.

922
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,940
He was kind enough to offer assistance he could.

923
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,720
Voice of the Yeti.

924
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,760
Unfortunately, money is not enough in time like this.

925
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,660
If the Air Force does have a UFO in their hands, where would they hide it?

926
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,300
This hour, Mr. Secretary.

927
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:05,940
All right.

928
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,680
Where are we, Bob?

929
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,200
The code is broken.

930
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,200
Trouble?

931
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:10,920
Big.

932
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:11,960
Security?

933
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,320
I have the lid on tight.

934
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,160
Well, take it off for me.

935
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,780
The message is Mars.

936
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,860
Mars needs women.

937
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,600
Mars needs.

938
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,100
It's a gag.

939
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,340
It's a prank.

940
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,140
It's a fake.

941
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,020
I don't think so, sir.

942
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,700
The door will be saved in time, Bob.

943
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,100
Oi!

944
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,420
It's getting cold.

945
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,600
It should have ANDED to 10%, so be careful.

946
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,380
I hope we can go home by the corona, now here.

947
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:10,380


948
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:10,920
Kid.

949
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:14,600
It's Mr. Sam.

950
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,780
More estas.

951
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,560
Bufa are tame.

952
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,680
They're certainly a clone.

953
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,800
They could be anywhere.

954
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,220
Bufa, yakatisma.

955
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,820
Yakatisma.

956
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
Yakatisma, the buffalos.

957
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,480
Yakatisma.

958
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,160
But not true.

959
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,360
I like things to be like that.

960
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,880
That things and people can't always be the same.

961
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,360
Hello, I'm a margin.

962
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,760
I hope I speak your language.

963
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,780
This is a recording.

964
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,380
This is only a recording, friends.

965
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,660
All of these calls are on tape.

966
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,560
This is completely a previously recorded show.

967
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,400
Copyright 1986 by the Subgenius Foundation.

968
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,740
You there, Ludd?

969
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,320
Yeah.

970
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,080
Yeah, I'm here.

971
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,520
Yeah, I'd like to tell you, I've seen these men in black.

972
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,240
Yeah, sure.

973
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,520
They came into the place I work.

974
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,320
They sure did.

975
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,880
And they told me, they said, listen to Reverend Buck on the radio.

976
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:27,580
What?

977
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,680
They showed me that.

978
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,580
I deny this, Reverend Stang.

979
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,380
I deny this call.

980
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,080
That was Buck's agents.

981
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,040
That wasn't the sinister men in black.

982
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,760
Maybe you got, no, my girlfriend is black here, but she's not a man.

983
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,340
Well, I'd also like to tell you.

984
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,100
I was at that baptismal this week.

985
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:45,920
All right.

986
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,360
Brother Dilbert's baptismal.

987
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:48,560
Praise Bob.

988
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,480
Praise Bob.

989
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,540
Praise Bob.

990
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,240
Well, thank you.

991
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:51,580
Thanks.

992
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,680
Thanks for your testimony, Ludd.

993
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,700
Thanks for your.

994
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,220
Thanks for your.

995
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:04,560
And the ancient Hebrews didn't think it was so funny either.

996
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,880
When huge, noisy heliopters abducted and brainwashed Ezekiel and Elijah.

997
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,220
A rain diseased.

998
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,120
They raised frogs on the Egyptians and turned rivers to blood.

999
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:21,900
In fact, much of the time they mistook them for Yahweh's angels.

1000
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:29,180
Just as today's holy rollers mistake demonic possession for the spirit of Jesus.

1001
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:37,480
The men in black appeared to Abraham to tell him that his barren aged wife, Sarah, would

1002
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,480
bear children.

1003
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,700
Genesis 18 one.

1004
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,060
Later in Genesis.

1005
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:41,800
One of these.

1006
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:49,440
Beings disguised as an angel wrestled with Jacob and put his hip out of joint just by

1007
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,300
touching it.

1008
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,540
The watchers manipulate people and nations in many ways.

1009
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:03,140
The crudest ones drag people into their saucers and hypnotize them.

1010
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:11,780
Others work through dreams, telepathy, seances, automatic writing, Ouija boards, blank, writing,

1011
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:11,780


1012
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:20,240
recording tape and microwave beams of pink light used to brain rape their victims.

1013
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:30,020
The most persistent caller of the night.

1014
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,120
Gary's on the line.

1015
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,960
The Slack radio ministry would like to introduce Gary.

1016
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,480
Gary, is that you?

1017
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:44,960
Gary?

1018
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,020
Gary, are you there?

1019
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:47,900
Can you hear me?

1020
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:48,760
Are you Gary?

1021
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,140
Yeah, I'm Gary.

1022
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:50,220
Gary, I'm Gary.

1023
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,220


1024
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,220


1025
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,220


1026
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,220


1027
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,220


1028
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,220


1029
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,220


1030
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,220


1031
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,420
Okay, Gary, you got a book called what?

1032
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,740
Clear intent.

1033
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,480
Okay, let's have some details about the men in black, Gary.

1034
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,460
Come on, fire it at us.

1035
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,640
Well, I've just started reading the book, but I can say one thing.

1036
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,020
There was a wave of UFO sightings that occurred during the 70s at military bases.

1037
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,260
70% of UFO sightings occur at military bases.

1038
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:13,900
They've been doing all sorts of insidious stuff, and you can believe they're trying

1039
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,720
to cover it up.

1040
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,020
The government don't know what's going on, or do they know what's going on?

1041
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:19,980
No one really knows.

1042
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,820
I think they're just a little part of what's going on.

1043
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,940
Remember, Gary, remember, it's one conspiracy.

1044
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:36,080
You know, you can say, okay, Coke is in red China and Pepsi's in Russia because the Republicans

1045
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,640
put the concession in Russia and the Democrats put it in red China.

1046
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,760
It's all one conspiracy.

1047
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,440
Yeah, I believe that.

1048
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,980
All right, praise Bob, Gary.

1049
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,700
Thanks for keeping trying to call us back.

1050
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,620
We've had a rugged night.

1051
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:49,940
We've had a rugged night.

1052
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:49,940


1053
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:49,940


1054
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,920
The men in black don't want us

1055
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,620
to tell the truth.

1056
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:58,040
But what if that if the story news

1057
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,900
remember just decoys strategies.

1058
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,060
No.

1059
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,620
We're not here to destroy

1060
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:19,960
We are here to employ

1061
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,540
Hello?

1062
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,260
Hello?

1063
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,200
Yes, dear brother.

1064
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,620
How can you hate us in our quest for forbidden knowledge?

1065
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:39,040
I just called to say I am one of the men in black.

1066
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,960
Oh, we always get these times.

1067
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,600
They're all Bob, or they're really the men in black, or they're really Jehovah's Witnesses.

1068
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,660
But it's true.

1069
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,360
It's true.

1070
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,440
Yeah, prove it real quick.

1071
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:57,880
All right.

1072
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,460
I've been watching you staying, and you too, naked.

1073
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,580
How would you like a nice FBI investigation?

1074
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,940
Bobby has an emergency.

1075
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,720
828-9500, will you please?

1076
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,380
No, operator, that's a...

1077
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,540
Please make that guy pay.

1078
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:14,620
Sir?

1079
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,140
Make that guy pay.

1080
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,940
I want that guy's number, and I want it on my desk in the morning.

1081
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,500
I don't want that guy on the line.

1082
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,060
Praise Bob.

1083
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:28,600
Praise.

1084
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:29,560
Praise.

1085
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,040
Praise.

1086
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,660
Millions of people have been contacted, and every single one gets a different story.

1087
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:41,340
But what if the stories which the contactees remember are just decoy strategies?

1088
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:47,620
What if the men in black are inflicting some unknown kind of subliminal brainwashing,

1089
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,140
with all of these people getting the same instructions implanted secretly,

1090
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,060
all to be triggered at once, at some crucial time?

1091
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:56,600
Say,

1092
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,200
just before the X-ist,

1093
00:55:59,200 --> 00:55:59,780
landing?

1094
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:01,380
Or,

1095
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:09,060
are we being set up for the sudden unleashing of an army of crazed, gun-toting Manchurian candidates?

1096
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,520
Is this perhaps what the Christian rapture,

1097
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,660
uh, means,

1098
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,520
which the fighting Jesus never discussed?

1099
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,620
If the scales dropped from our eyes for a moment, my friends,

1100
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,380
would we see a sky swarming with demonic entities?

1101
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,160
Yeah.

1102
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:33,140
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up, and it wasn't really a dream,

1103
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,320
until I saw these sacred nasal positions.

1104
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,700
And suddenly it all came back to me.

1105
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:45,020
And I realized that they'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life,

1106
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:49,300
when they put me in that tiny room and plugged all those wires into me,

1107
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,340
and made me talk, and talk, and talk, and talk.

1108
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,660
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth,

1109
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:03,000
I come to you from a long, long ways off.

1110
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,720
I come from a planet that is similar to yours.

1111
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:12,420
Your many fears, tensions, and frustrations are no longer ours.

1112
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:19,760
Oh, time could do as he chose.

1113
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:26,160
He could extend his finger down into the world of man,

1114
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,380
and...

1115
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,320
El montan.

1116
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:28,640
El montan.

1117
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:28,640


1118
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:32,740
And swirling around as we would stir up a cold, meatball.

1119
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,080
Yucateezma.

1120
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:38,560
Causing events which no man can explain.

1121
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:40,920
Yucateezma!

1122
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,040
Yucateezma.

1123
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,840
Yucateezma.

1124
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,360
Yucateezma.

1125
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:48,680
Yucateezma.

1126
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,740
Say, uh, you want to go to see your yucateezma partner?

1127
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,420
Yeah, she's a yucateezma lover.

1128
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,640
Yucateezma.

1129
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,860
Yucateezma.

1130
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,220
Perhaps the ugliest aspect of the whole business

1131
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:13,100
is that the human conspiracy aids and abets them whenever possible.

1132
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:19,740
These sick traitors to Earth are operating on the same string of promises Hitler was.

1133
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,640
That if they play along,

1134
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:27,580
the advanced supersonic Nazi Hell creatures from beneath the hollow Earth

1135
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:33,720
would make them lords over a new race of Aryan super normals.

1136
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,180
Of course, oil sheiks are told it will be Arab super normals

1137
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,420
and African despots are told it will be African super normals and so on.

1138
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,560
Deep inside the hollow earth in Hitler's library,

1139
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,280
yes, he still lives, or at least his head does,

1140
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,140
there exists a book called Beware of Bob.

1141
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:57,680
For the church has been fighting these creatures

1142
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:02,940
since Admiral Byrd discovered the entrance to their domain at the Pole.

1143
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,180
And so we find that there are two groups of supernatural teams

1144
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:13,140
exerting influence on the bovine, pliable minds of humans.

1145
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,360
The Watchers are the silence group,

1146
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,720
attempting to smother our potential to evolve

1147
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,560
and carrying the basic message of lay off.

1148
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:28,120
Our rivals, Jehovah One's shock group,

1149
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,100
are saying, get ready,

1150
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:35,800
trying in a sense to condition us to the idea that we are not alone.

1151
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,660
One is a cosmic infection,

1152
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,920
the other a cosmic inoculation.

1153
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,780
Somebody's faith is being tested

1154
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:54,120
and the stark fist of removal is...

1155
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,880
raised in judgement,

1156
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,700
poised for a great evacuation,

1157
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,500
a movement,

1158
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,240
an elimination and a wiping from the face of the earth.

1159
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,280
Not to be confused with the rapture, which is a minor thing.

1160
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,120
Some geniuses do it nightly.

1161
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:16,320
They rapture in their sleep and in the morning are raised incorruptible, yet changed.

1162
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:21,420
But then the rapture might be for real, but more like night of the living dead.

1163
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,120
Some geniuses leading the living in the night.

1164
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,660
They are in battle against these heathen false Christian golems

1165
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:32,080
because rapture is from the same root word as rape.

1166
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,780
Oh, hear ye, ye of the deaf ear!

1167
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,720
The Lord saith, heads up!

1168
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,260
And the people will feel the lash of the thousand scourges of the tribulations,

1169
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:49,500
even, yea, lo, verily unto the final rapture

1170
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,080
of the equilibrium of the scales of time.

1171
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,720
Omicron epsilon, the vision beholding itself.

1172
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,700
Repent, ye mockers!

1173
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:06,240
Elijah puffeth scornfully on his pipe, though he smileth.

1174
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,960
Wake up! Get off your butt!

1175
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:29,160
That is the faith of Jesus Christ.

1176
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,940
That is the faith of Jesus.

1177
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:45,060
That is the faith, that is the Rabb

1178
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,600
that's theナ
