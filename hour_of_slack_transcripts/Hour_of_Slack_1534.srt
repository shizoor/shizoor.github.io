1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
You'd better go now, Madge.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,840
I won't go home alone.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,440
Bob will take you.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,960
I don't want to have anything to do with her.

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,020
Then I'll call a taxi.

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,580
Sure.

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,920
Around Dard City and in the Territory on West,

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,700
there's just one way to handle the killers and the spoilers,

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,480
and that's with a U.S. Marshal and the smell of...

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,800
The Sogenius Power of Squash.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,220
Bob said we'd get along fine.

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,240
Who's Bob?

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,320
You remember things, don't you?

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,320
Some things.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,260
What about this Bob?

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,920
He's engaged to somebody else.

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,840
She hates him now, but at the same time...

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,180
She didn't want anybody else to have him.

19
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,620
Why are you...

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,160
Pressed up?

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,480
Because I'm expecting Bob any minute.

22
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,520
All right. That's all right.

23
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,960
I can hide in the bedroom.

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,980
No. No, you won't.

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,360
Why not?

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,700
Because it's cheap.

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,040
You mean you're afraid Bob might walk into the bedroom?

28
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,000
You think he makes himself at home here.

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,120
How should I know?

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,740
If you don't know, why stick your dirty needles in?

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,420
I don't like it.

32
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,300
Well, please, Annie, don't get so excited.

33
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,500
What Bob does doesn't make the slightest difference to me.

34
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,300
That's Bob downstairs.

35
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,880
Go now down the hall.

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,800
I won't go.

37
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,480
I can't go.

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,800
If Perry finds me, he'll kill me.

39
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,260
Don't you understand?

40
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,600
Hello, Irene.

41
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,120
Hello, Bob.

42
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,180
What plan are you doing?

43
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,280
Why don't you leave people alone?

44
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,140
You're not satisfied unless you're bothering people.

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,220
If it isn't your family you're pestering, it's your friends.

46
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,160
It's people you don't even know.

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,520
It's me.

48
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,800
We have talked more than a little bit on this program in the past couple of years about slack.

49
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,180
Blame it, they say, on slack.

50
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,180
Slack meaning folks who have given up looking for a job.

51
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,220
Higher than we thought it was.

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,680
There's more slack than expected.

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,000
It's expected based on unexplained slack.

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,600
The effect of this slack, though, is clear.

55
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,060
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

56
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,280
Bob?

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,120
Bob?

58
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,900
Bob, where are you?

59
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,940
Bob, where are you?

60
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,460
Bob.

61
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,440
Bob.

62
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,380
Bob.

63
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,760
Bob.

64
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,080
Bob.

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,360
Bob.

66
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,360


67
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,220
So why negotiate with strangers when you can deal with Bob?

68
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,080
What the hell was that supposed to mean?

69
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:15,660
Relax.

70
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,560
Bob's found a way of making some money.

71
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,240
Ah, that rich jerk.

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,180
I'm not making any sense.

73
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,880
I'm not making any sense.

74
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,560
I was convinced that he was.

75
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,620
He was some kind of demon.

76
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,060
Demon.

77
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,900
That's when I stabbed him in the eye with a kitchen knife.

78
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,480
Oh!

79
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,560
I owe him everything.

80
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,300
J.R.

81
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,740
Bob.

82
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,040
Bob.

83
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,100
Teach us about slack.

84
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,280
You've just been done wondering, sir, about Bob.

85
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,160
Well, let's just shoot the S.O.B. and figure it out later.

86
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,680
You're a true American hero, man.

87
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
I demand that you shoot me now.

88
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,480
Kill him.

89
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,100
Kill him now.

90
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,480
Do it.

91
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:53,540
Do it.

92
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,800
Do it.

93
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:55,900


94
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,500
Do it.

95
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:56,500


96
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,900
Did you kill Dobbs?

97
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,580
Yes.

98
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,360
I killed him.

99
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:00,900
Bob.

100
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,380
Always found room in your heart.

101
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,380
And this is where the satire ends and the special comment begins, because this is not

102
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,480
even remotely funny.

103
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,960
One audience member shouts, kill him.

104
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,400
As usual, Bob does nothing about it.

105
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,460
Now it's a little bit more complicated than that.

106
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,540
Behind the scenes at the Natural History Museum, scientists hope they'll solve the mystery

107
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,360
of why pinks are pink.

108
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,180
As scientists, I can't tell you why a pink is pink.

109
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,580
And it's a little bit exasperating when everybody's talking about them, everybody loves them,

110
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,160
and yet you can't tell people why they're pink.

111
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,120
So this is another pink that's here on loan for us to do study on.

112
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,400
In scientific terms though, these are actually more important than this big pink one,

113
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,480
even though it's worth $33.

114
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,700
Ironically, that's true, because the key is the large pink, we have no idea what its origins are.

115
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,000
And so as a scientist trying to study the history of these pinks, I need to know where they came from.

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,560
So yeah.

117
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,800
I still want to hold it though.

118
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,240
Oh, I understand that.

119
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,140
Scientists think that pinks may be caused by molecular changes,

120
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,500
the result of a shock billions of years ago when the pinks were being formed.

121
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,340
This machine agitates the pinks and captures the atoms that are released,

122
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,720
which adds to the mystery of pinks.

123
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,900
Scientists are pretty certain the pink is caused by a defect,

124
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,860
they just need to find it, but many people will never be anything less than pink.

125
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,540
Yes, Pop?

126
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,980
Every one of the United States remembers

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,160
that pinks were made in the same country.

128
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,300
We'll tell you which country they came from,

129
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,180
and what you can do to protect your kids.

130
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,080
That's an important story.

131
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,840
Welcome back.

132
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,700
Well, every one of the 24 United States so far this year have been manufactured in China.

133
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,220
What could be done about all of this?

134
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,980
I wonder what parents are thinking to themselves as they look at these states.

135
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,300
What sort of recourse do parents have as they're looking at the United States

136
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,500
when they're not manufactured here in the United States?

137
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,300
This is a really difficult problem for parents.

138
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:47,920
Right.

139
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,720
Everyone thought that the real problem was with the dollar.

140
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,600
It's stamped made in China, and it's a problem.

141
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,040
Here you have 80% of counterfeit Chinese,

142
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,140
but 60% of Chinese,

143
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,860
70 to 80% of the United States from China,

144
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,200
and it's an alarm.

145
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
It's a real problem.

146
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,280
How do you prevent a factory worker making $150 a month

147
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,760
given a gun that's filled with lead?

148
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,980
It's a real problem.

149
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,300
Yeah, and as we're looking at some pictures here on our screen,

150
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,700
these are some of the recalled states.

151
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,880
These are all made in China on the screen here as we're talking.

152
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,460
Yeah, that's a problem because I can remember growing up,

153
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,700
I mean, as I was growing up,

154
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,580
most of the United States were made in China.

155
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,400
But what has changed?

156
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,440
Why have these laws gotten so lax, or were they always lax,

157
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,120
and now we're just seeing more influx from China?

158
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,180
Well, actually, there's more influx from China.

159
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,180
In the 1970s, something like a very tiny percentage of the United States came from China.

160
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,120
Now we have a large percentage of the United States coming with lack of safety standards.

161
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,900
The Chinese government,

162
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,560
the government themselves say 20% of the United States,

163
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,860
they admit 20% of the United States are some kind of safety hazard.

164
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,840
This is unbelievable.

165
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,300
It is, and of course we've been talking about these same kind of problems for weeks.

166
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,940
It's a major scandal in the making.

167
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,520
Wow.

168
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,520
Today, we know it's not only the government's fault,

169
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:22,520


170
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,680
is the number of illegal people,

171
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:23,680


172
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,140
you is tong alker

173
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,180
h

174
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,180


175
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,680
where

176
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:35,680


177
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,700
don't

178
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:43,700


179
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:43,700


180
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:43,700


181
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:43,700


182
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:43,700


183
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:43,700


184
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:43,840
the

185
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,360
Olympics,

186
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,140
just

187
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,140
like

188
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,000
In a neon that's red and blue

189
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,180
This is the time when the false will feed

190
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,580
You better watch out, it's a glamorous stampede

191
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

192
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,580
It's all plastic

193
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

194
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,720
It's all plastic

195
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,140
You gotta look clean, you gotta get mean

196
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,700
You gotta be seen

197
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,380
We can defeat them anytime we want to

198
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,480
They will repeat this anytime they need to

199
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,360
This is the place where elites get mean

200
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,640
You gotta disappear, not to be seen

201
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

202
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,660
It's all plastic

203
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

204
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

205
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,720
It's all plastic

206
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,220
You gotta look clean, you gotta get mean

207
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,800
You gotta be seen

208
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,340
You spoke to me in my dream about Bob

209
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,380
He was my familiar

210
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,560
Where does Bob come from?

211
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,120
That cannot be realized

212
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,240
What does Bob want?

213
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,660
He is Bob

214
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,800
Eager for fun

215
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,640
He wears a smile

216
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,200
Everybody run

217
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,460
Do you understand the parasite?

218
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,420
It attaches itself to a life form and feeds

219
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,260
Bob requires a human host

220
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,160
He feeds on fear

221
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,080
And the pleasures

222
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,160
Of the world

223
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,320
They are his children

224
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,060
Those surviving birth assumed grotesque shapes

225
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,780
Inducing mental disease

226
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,740
They will find this place

227
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,600
They will gather around this tower

228
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,520
Screaming for the blood of my children

229
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,340
What do they call them?

230
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,420
Mutants?

231
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,540
As if they asked to be deformed

232
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,360
They hate anyone who's different than they are

233
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,180
It doesn't hurt me

234
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,960
I will

235
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,280
I will not forget

236
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,640
I will not forget

237
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:17,640


238
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,860
And I will not forget

239
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:18,860


240
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,180
I will not forget

241
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,180


242
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,140
I fear for him constantly

243
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,740
Because he still has hope for me

244
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,620
That one day he will see me normal again

245
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,860
Perhaps I'm too monstrous to take seriously

246
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,080
Mutant!

247
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,780
Mutant!

248
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,500
Kill it!

249
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,160
Kill it!

250
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,980
Kill it!

251
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,760
Kill it!

252
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,340
Kill it!

253
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,160
Kill it!

254
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,940
Kill it!

255
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,840
Somebody stop him!

256
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,040
Somebody stop him!

257
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,700
Aaaaaaaahhh!

258
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:41,960
Stop!

259
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,100
Oh!

260
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:46,700


261
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:46,940


262
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:46,940


263
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:46,940


264
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,720
prints on my ashtray and not yours. And that was enough for them. They won't believe that. They

265
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,100
will when they hear the things you and Bob said to each other the other night in Irene's apartment.

266
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:02,140
You were there and you've got Bob with you. He'll be with me all right. And you're alone.

267
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,620
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

268
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:46,900
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

269
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,920
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

270
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,920
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

271
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,500
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

272
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:46,900
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

273
00:12:46,940 --> 00:13:16,920
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

274
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:46,160
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

275
00:13:46,940 --> 00:14:16,920
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

276
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:46,920
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

277
00:14:46,940 --> 00:15:12,880
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

278
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:30,560
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

279
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,020
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

280
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,300
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

281
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,160
I don't go out with Bob anymore.

282
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,900
We have a number of new collage artists

283
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,000
contributing to this show

284
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,100
and it's hard to say who did what

285
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,000
usually, you know, Fernand and Andy Leamer

286
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,080
does a lot of that, but this particular time

287
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,220
he just did the titles

288
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,320
We got a lot of clips from our friend in Sweden

289
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,700
Dr. Italics

290
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,100
and we got a very cool mix

291
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,760
called Cranial Discharge

292
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,760
by Soren and Dr. Laniulos

293
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,720
I'm not sure who they are

294
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
but I hope they send more stuff

295
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,060
because it was a really good collage

296
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,680
and also we had several cut-ups there

297
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,440
by Doc Cosmack

298
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,400
a new friend that we met last X-Day

299
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,380
He's been sending stuff in

300
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,600
and we have some more of those

301
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,740
and I even cut up

302
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,080
some of the music

303
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,080


304
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,320
something from Conspiracy Radio

305
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,420
that was fun

306
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,300
Let's see

307
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,820
Oh, the music!

308
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,700
Yes, there was music

309
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,000
Now that last piece of music

310
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,820
the all instrumental

311
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,100
of course that was the Psychoskeletons

312
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,140
They're pretty recognizable with that style

313
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,100
and there was a song that we played earlier

314
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,340
It's All Plastic

315
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,840
that sounded a little bit Devo-esque

316
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,660
That was the

317
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,620
The Fantastic Plastics

318
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,240
which is a band that we met at the Devotional

319
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,680
a couple of weeks ago

320
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,900
That was a really fun Devotional

321
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,820
here in Cleveland at the Beachland Ballroom

322
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,840
Really wise

323
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,320
As usual there's always some Devo-esque

324
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,520
like kind of sound-alike bands

325
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,080
and then there's all the really weird bands

326
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,520
that do twisted covers

327
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,920
like Rural War Room

328
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,100
and then there's bands like

329
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,520
The Fantastic Plastics

330
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,120
who did do some covers

331
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,460
that were really good

332
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,360
but they have a CD out called Devolver

333
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,960
I think it's pretty new

334
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,620
Oh, and our pictures from the Devotional

335
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,040
are on subgenius.com

336
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,460
Yay!

337
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,980
But to find them you would have to

338
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,500
look for the events page

339
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,680
and or the devivals of yore

340
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,040
or past devivals

341
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,000
There's lots of...

342
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,500
They're not that sexy, unfortunately

343
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,940
Well, depends on how you look at them

344
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,640
Right, if you look at them through the eyes

345
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,120
of a lustful dog

346
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,780
a dirty dog

347
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,020
I wouldn't know anybody like that

348
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,520
but actually, yes, there's some pretty hot stuff in there

349
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,100
Unfortunately, the shots of Rural War Room

350
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,240
the stills were all kind of blurry

351
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,180
so you don't ever get to see the beautiful

352
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,120
Theramina in our pictures up close

353
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:35,960
Mmm...

354
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,520
She looked great in the videos, though

355
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,220
but that's another story

356
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,500
Oh, yes, yes, yes

357
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,540
Theramina

358
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,060
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

359
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,620
So, did that cover the credits?

360
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,420
I guess it did

361
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,300
And I was kind of half expecting

362
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,520
the Lone Cow Dave to call in

363
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,580
and he appears to be running late

364
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,240
Yes, I would say we're still expecting him to call

365
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,940
Which is too bad, because I was...

366
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,100
I guess really had my heart set on offending listeners tonight

367
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,320
but it's kind of hard to do it with just you

368
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,260
because you're too nice

369
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,720
and Dave's not exactly mean

370
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,400
but somehow he's the perfect foil for me to be mean

371
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,000
So, aside from kids say the darnedest things

372
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,160
I think I'm going to go back to

373
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,860
a mega collage by another contributor

374
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,660
our great co-subgenius show host in Atlanta

375
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,480
Reverend Susie the Floozy

376
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,580
who does a show on WREK Atlanta

377
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,140
one of the great college stations of all time

378
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,340
Praise Susie!

379
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,020
These are some clips she edited together

380
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,200
for one of her earlier shows

381
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,980
many years ago

382
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,860
I guess I'll just pull down this Petra Hayden

383
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,520
we have in the background

384
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,940
Pull down Petra

385
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,080
Pull down Petra

386
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,220
and we'll go to...

387
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,840
to Bob's Slack Time Fun House

388
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,120
and just see what happens

389
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,280
Let the joy jump in the good times roll

390
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,460
Let the pleasure pop

391
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,740
Now let's take a stroll

392
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,440
Let's all get mellow

393
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,740
Get smoke in your eyes

394
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,140
Get hip when I say fella

395
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,680
Hey, what is this jazz?

396
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,040
Let's all get ready

397
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,460
I know how you feel

398
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,400
Light up

399
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,800
Now don't be afraid

400
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,420
You'll find what I mean in any old field

401
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,040
Pop

402
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,920
And I think we have some kind of a Dave on the line here

403
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,000
No

404
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,340
Is that true now?

405
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,480
How about now?

406
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,960
Right now

407
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,760
Yeah, now

408
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,640
Now, now

409
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,260
Calm down now

410
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,780
There's nothing to get all nary about

411
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,100
Oh, tell that to Theramina

412
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,140
Theramina's a beautiful name

413
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,460
That was one of the enchantresses

414
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
the Chanteuse

415
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,700
Theramina

416
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,640
She was, she's a member

417
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,160
a relatively new member of the band Rural War Room

418
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,600
and we had her staying in our own house

419
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,940
We had that famous band in our house

420
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,500
two weeks ago

421
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:17,920
I didn't even pronounce that word

422
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,740
She's been living here?

423
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,380
Just, yeah, for a couple of days

424
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,680
The lovely Theramina

425
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,000
Yes, yes

426
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,260
She did a sort of

427
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,680
In a biblical sense, you know, not carnally or something

428
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,880
but you knew that she was

429
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,700
inhabiting the domicile

430
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,660
for a brief moment, albeit

431
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,300
Well, Dave, you can think whatever you choose to, can't you?

432
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:39,760
I know

433
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,040
That's what I do, too

434
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,640
I think whatever

435
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,280
That's what's wrong with everything

436
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,500
I think what I want to

437
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,040
Well, don't worry, Dave

438
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,860
I'm sure they'll make a law against that pretty soon

439
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,180
no matter who gets elected for president coming up

440
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,500
Although some are much more likely to have you lined up against a wall and shot

441
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,880
whereas other ones would just kind of scold you and say

442
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,780
No, no, no, no, Dave, that's not right

443
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,080
Well, I'm kind of a

444
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,940
I kind of like where Bernie's coming from

445
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,640
It's a place called Vermont

446
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,020
where they have the nachos and the ridges and stuff

447
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,060
and the wild blueberries and the open spaces

448
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,800
People say over here and over there and stuff like that

449
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,640
And park the car

450
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,280
And park the car

451
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,980
Well, that's more elongated, but

452
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,500
So you like Bernie

453
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,200
Bernie's that caller that Dr. Sinister gets on the station frequently, right?

454
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,140
He's probably also running for president

455
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,820
He has Alzheimer's, too

456
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,460
You're right

457
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,440
They're both right

458
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,680
I mean, both of it are, you know, in the plural

459
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:54,320
But do you think that the Americas can really get behind somebody who says he's a socializer?

460
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,960
Well, not if he's a wanton socializer

461
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Some of them like to wear red hats like old men

462
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,280
and old ladies and stuff like that

463
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,260
And, you know, the workers anthem and things

464
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,900
It sounds remarkably like the sub-genius anthem

465
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,880
Because it was slightly ripped off

466
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,900
No, no, no, no, no

467
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,220
I read that a lot of Republican pollsters

468
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,400
You're playing the issues in the background, aren't you? I'm sorry

469
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,820
I read that a lot of pollsters

470
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,700
Not to be confused with certain types of holsters

471
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,820
These pollsters were rather shocked

472
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,960
because they were asking Donald Trump

473
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,900
Why they liked him so much

474
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,980
And they said, because you can tell he's going to make America great again

475
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,940
It says so on his hat

476
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,060
And it does

477
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,920
He's the only guy who wears a hat that says

478
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,340
I'll make America great again

479
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,040
With an accent on the again

480
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,000
Because that presupposes that America was great

481
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,720
And is no more great

482
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,340
Well, one thing's for certain, sure

483
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,920
In the system we have

484
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,960
There will be a lot of people who will say, well, Donald Trump is great

485
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,760
But there will be very little choice

486
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,680
Any of the true wackos who might have an idea or two

487
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,080
How to make things better and stuff

488
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
Will be taken out of the race immediately

489
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,180
After they have their brief moment in the sun

490
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,640
I don't know what to think of Trump

491
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,520
It's kind of an idea of like

492
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,300
What's his name that looked like he had a moccasin for a nose?

493
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,280
Adolf Hitler

494
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,220
Adolf?

495
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,280
Mussolini?

496
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,280
Potato Head? Mr. Potato Head?

497
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,960
Mrs. Tomato

498
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,180
Frankenstein?

499
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,840
You've got your veggies

500
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,080
Of course, Frankenstein, sure

501
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,720
Yeah

502
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,400
Well, I've been really enjoying it

503
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:43,480
And of course I'm not the first person to suspect that maybe, just maybe

504
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:50,300
Sort of a large percentage of the Amerikees

505
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,980
Are kind of just biding their time and waiting for the moment

506
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,620
To really pounce and slap down that guy

507
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,340
And his yahoos

508
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,260
Because if they don't

509
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,640
I'm going to have to use my passport

510
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,680
Because I'll be the first person they'd come

511
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,840
Well, I shouldn't flatter myself

512
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,840
I'd be the 3,007 billionth person they'd come after

513
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,840
But, you know

514
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,780
But Dave, if I was you, I'd be worried

515
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,260
You're quacking like an endangered species

516
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,500
We have nothing to fear

517
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,920
Just because we kind of confusedly and ridiculously express ourselves

518
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,980
That's not against the law

519
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,960
That's not a crime

520
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,520
Well, and plus nobody notices us expressing ourselves

521
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,940
That's the important thing

522
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,120
And I've been pretty

523
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,220
You know, it's worked for us for 35 years

524
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,020
Yes

525
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,920
Nobody's noticed us

526
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,800
And so we continue to be able to do it

527
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,360
Now whether there's any point to it

528
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,200
That's, you know, we'll let the future historians

529
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,140
Yes

530
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,640
Work that one out

531
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,420
Yeah, we'll have the people writing their PhD theses

532
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,540
Theses

533
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,060
Theses

534
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,360
Theses

535
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,900
Theses

536
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,120
Theses

537
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,940
Theses

538
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,420
Hash it all out in APA style

539
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,220
Which is American Psychological Association style of writing

540
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,060
Which is why it's so ridiculously hard to read a treatise

541
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,380
Even though they try and hint at what they're driving at in the first

542
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,020
Very first paragraph

543
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,160
After that

544
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,740
You

545
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,040
You

546
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,520
You

547
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,100
You

548
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,740
Well, we have the most recent of the theses and dissertations on Church of the Subgenius

549
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,120
But it's funny, I was reading

550
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,340
You did mispronounce it, yeah

551
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,460
I, uh, just by

552
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,080
It's a single matter

553
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,200
Somebody was quoting the Wikipedia article about subgenius

554
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,960
And I thought, what?

555
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,720
I didn't, hadn't

556
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,960
I don't remember that part

557
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,840
And I went and looked at Wikipedia

558
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:50,380
And the page on Church of the Subgenius has changed a lot since the last time I saw it

559
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,220
And they were quoting

560
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:59,020
At least four or five different academic papers and books about the Church of the Subgenius

561
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,440
What?

562
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,280
Yeah

563
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,000
Um, three pro and a couple con

564
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,620
Paul Mann is the con

565
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,240
But of course he's not in Wikipedia

566
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
So I never was able to track him down

567
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,480
He's not notable enough

568
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,380
And he didn't like what we were doing

569
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,020
Hmm

570
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:19,380
Well, it's a very common name like, uh, Swiney Newman or Hector Plush Canaveral, Bashing Hood

571
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,200
Or any of those other names

572
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:29,140
Yeah, Peel's Basti Blasterplate, those kind of names

573
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,820
Yeah

574
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,900
Nimbletom, Nimbleton, those kind of, uh, interesting

575
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,780
No, that's Mark Twain right there

576
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,800
Well, it's Cosney, I'm sure, of course

577
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,520
They're gonna run the people with funny names out of this country

578
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,800
If they can

579
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,380
They're gonna just run them right out

580
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,240
That's what I should do

581
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,820
They'll start with the names like Rodriguez and Diaz

582
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,840
And then they'll work their way up to Polish names

583
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,080
They'll be starting to kick out anybody with a funny name that's got a C and a Z next to each other in their names

584
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,700
You gotta know which order, too

585
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,540
That's right

586
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,720
Yep, they're gonna start getting real picky

587
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,600
And, uh, having the little labor camps and the forced marches and everything

588
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,640
They're really excited about that

589
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,260
Yeah, well, then, I...

590
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,100
These things can be done

591
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,640
I just keep on thinking of Peter Sellers

592
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,680
Screaming, I'm...

593
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,700
What was it?

594
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,540
Yeah, mein Führer, it can be done

595
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,760
What was it when he jumped up out of the electric chair and started saluting and stuff?

596
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,560
I believe his key word was

597
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,200
Mein Führer, I can walk again!

598
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,100
Then, of course, the World War III ends everything

599
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,160
That's my political slogan I'm gonna wear on my bumper, ain't it?

600
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,580
I can walk again?

601
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,540
Mein Führer, I can walk, yes

602
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,260
No, Dave, I'm...

603
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,300
You're optimistic

604
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,800
I'm afraid that the only bumper sticker you're gonna be able to have is the one that you're gonna wear on your bumper sticker

605
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:50,800


606
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,240
And the rest of us is gonna be, I can crawl again

607
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,640
And that's if we're lucky

608
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,200
I can crawl again!

609
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,380
But we can't be pessimistic about the future or the suture

610
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,260
Whichever is the most impugnating

611
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,440
Well, you know, I'm still bleeding a little from where my suture was

612
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
But, uh, let's not go there

613
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,740
I most definitely don't want to go there

614
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:15,760
No

615
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,120
Not even on the holidays, especially if they're, like, the rates were special

616
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,040
Oh, I have to go there every couple of hours

617
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:27,720
What about the subgenius specials to Pan America?

618
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,280
The days of the old Dobstown villages

619
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:36,420
All clustered about so neatly, taking care of each and every one of the citizens

620
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,680
In their own special way

621
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,420
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh

622
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,040
Yep, we're gonna make Dobstown great again

623
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,500
I should get a hat that says, we're gonna...

624
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,240
I'm gonna make...

625
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,060
I'm moan make...

626
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,020
Dobstown great again

627
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,760
Make Dobstown great again

628
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,460
It will grate on your nerves, my friends

629
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:02,220
We'll make America great on people's nerves if we possibly can, don't you think?

630
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:02,860
I think

631
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,880
We meaning, uh, everybody else but us

632
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,140
Me and we, that's what you're trying to say, right?

633
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,800
Princess we

634
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,460
You're trying to be poetic, me and we

635
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,180
Yeah

636
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,220
It's supposed to be we and me

637
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,420
Well, it's actually supposed to be we and I, but you can never say that

638
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,040
You've got Sarah Meen in the background, you know?

639
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,340
I'm singing like Beeman Sumac

640
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,620
No, that's, uh, Petra Hayden

641
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:23,900
Oh, it's the other...

642
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,180
In this case, I wish it was, uh...

643
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,720
Sarah Meena

644
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,440
No, this is Petra, this is a woman...

645
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,220
She's the daughter of some kind of jazz musician, right?

646
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:33,800
Yes

647
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,620
And she...

648
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,180
Oh, yeah!

649
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,480
She's doing movie scores, but she does all the instrumentation with her voice

650
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,220
Charlie Hayden, isn't it?

651
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:41,940
Yeah, I've heard of this

652
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,660
So, even the bass line is that and her going...

653
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,660
Boom, boom, boom

654
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,680
Oh, wow

655
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,560
Key

656
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,820
Yes

657
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:52,900
Sexy

658
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,380
She's even doing the violin and cello stuff

659
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:55,800
Yeah

660
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:04,580
That's Nino Rota's Eight and a Half theme, or Carlotta's Gallop, I think is the title of that actual piece

661
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:14,740
Remember how we used to, like, in the days when we were tender and young, like fried fish, we'd hang out together on the meat corners and stuff like that and stop the passengers and everything

662
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,880
And it looked like a scene right out of Eight and a Half

663
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,000
Especially the part where they did the rumba and stuff like that

664
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:27,100
I wish I could remember when I was young, but I can't even remember the last five minutes

665
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,240
I remember a few things

666
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,340
You wouldn't want to do that, I'm pretty sure, at least as far as this radio program is concerned

667
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Well, as long as we have backup, everything is fine, that's the important thing, backup

668
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,020
Backup

669
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,900
We've got to have backup

670
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,460
We trust in cripes

671
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,640
And in my case, that usually means a 20-minute collage by Suzy the Fugitive

672
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,500
I'm not going to call you a fugitive, Fluzy, in case Dave calls late

673
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,160
But it worked out fine

674
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:52,860
Perfectly

675
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:59,640
I thought I was damned for sure as I went to the other bathroom to envision myself as something better than I am

676
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,840
And I looked and I was like, oh, it's 920

677
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,200
Yeah, right

678
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,400
Right

679
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,260
Well, how was the, in the bathroom, was it clear or still kind of pinkish?

680
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,260
It was peaceful, it was not cloudy

681
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:29,720
It was sanguina, kind of morbid atrocity, the kind that we like to have served up here every day at the VFW or WVA, whatever it is, some acronym, anagram

682
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:40,660
It's always so reassuring when you look down in there and there's no little things twitching that look like mosquito larvae or scabs

683
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,640
But we're not going to go down that road or up that highway

684
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,700
We're going to just, yeah, this is a nice

685
00:32:51,700 --> 00:33:00,320
We're going to get real cerebral and stuff like that because a lot of subgeniuses, well, a few of them are kind of like smart and stuff like that

686
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:16,700
The average posting you like to read so well during the mini-show of the show of the tonological miscreants, stupidity of the average person, you know, you're going to get a little bit of that

687
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:16,700


688
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:16,700


689
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,980
American humanoid

690
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,460
Oh, you mean when we copy the comments that follow Yahoo News articles and then read them in silly hick accents?

691
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:38,640
You know, I promised, well, actually I should say, Princess Wee promised on Facebook that we were going to do a controversial show that would be, and that thin-skinned people shouldn't listen to it

692
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,840
But we haven't, we just said that to, you know, get listeners

693
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,280
I don't think we've really lived up to it

694
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:52,800
We haven't, we haven't shaved anybody's skin down to that thin, thin tissue

695
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,260
Well, we better live it up then

696
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,220
Mr. Steg, I think what you've got is a branding problem

697
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:05,180
I think if you need to know how to brand, you should, what you need is branding

698
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,840
Branded, scorned as the man who ran

699
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,180
Stranded, trapped in the toilet bowl

700
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,260
We've already done that one though

701
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,540
Yeah, it's pretty tired

702
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,260
It's very sleepy

703
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,520
What do you do when you're stranded and you can't reach the roll?

704
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,060
Couldn't help it

705
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,340
Couldn't help it

706
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,540
Well, that won't offend anyone

707
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,820
We've got to think of something really

708
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:44,780
Could you and we ever, have you ever, sung together a song of your own choosing as you go along of perhaps in a monkey voice since you both do these monkey things so well?

709
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,260
I was wondering what, what would you do?

710
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:52,660
Mr. Monkey and Mrs. Monkey might sound like together, or whatever it would be called, together

711
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,320
Monkey singing?

712
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:55,740
Yes

713
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:01,800
I've noticed you make a monkey sound once in a while and I noticed that Stan makes a monkey sound a lot

714
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,260
I just wondered what you did

715
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,820
No, I don't, that's not, that's just not right there

716
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,240
You're like, what's your name, you're doing all the parts yourself

717
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:23,700
Yeah, I was doing a Superman theme in Cheetah's voice, but I can't, I can't maintain that, I can't do it for a long time

718
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:31,280
No, did you, do you remember like in Village of the Damned when the kids would get nosebleeds and stuff when they were concentrating real hard?

719
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,740
Village of the Damned, yeah

720
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,380
Or was that from Village of the Damned or another place where people concentrated real hard on making something happen and they got nosebleeds?

721
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,320
That's a movie based on the British horror story The Midwitch Cuckoos

722
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,540
The Midwitch Cuckoos!

723
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:53,920
It involved one bright May day, all the ladies in a little British village wake up and they're all pregnant

724
00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:00,500
Even the ones that could never get pregnant before and all of the men in the village are very angry

725
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:11,400
And nine months later all of the women have these little blonde haired kids with spaced out blue eyes who can read minds and control minds and basically

726
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,960
Uh

727
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,600
Control their, what you call it, environment with their minds

728
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:24,240
Yeah, they're from out of space and that's the invasion, the invasion comes from pregnant ladies

729
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,820
And it's the children of Michio Kaku

730
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,700
Ah, well put, well put

731
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:39,880
But I personally like his rambling even though some of the times I think he's speaking on behalf of the overall and underwear

732
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,380
Conspir-

733
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,460
Ah

734
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,560
See

735
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:51,300
Well, you know everybody, the problem is that everybody has a different idea of the conspiracy

736
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:58,320
Now, apparently it has now become un-PC to be PC

737
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:09,540
In order to be really PC for, well let's just say it, for Republicans, you have to stop being PC in the Democrat way

738
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,860
You know what I'm saying?

739
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,360
They get really upset if you're not PC, their idea of PC

740
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:26,760
In other words, you're supposed to act like a bruh and, you know, make fun of girls that aren't pretty and sing the praises of girls that are pretty

741
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,460
Unless those girls slap you back for sexism, in which case that's not PC

742
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:39,520
To call somebody sexist and complain about their un-PC speech is not PC

743
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:39,520


744
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:39,520


745
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,720
It is itself very un-PC in many circles

746
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:54,320
So it's like what's politically correct for one tribe of monkeys is gonna be for the other tribe of monkeys to just shut up

747
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,540
The person control factor

748
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,820
And vice versa

749
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,400
The one half of the monkeys shut up and the other one jumping around and screaming

750
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,160
Now I've never seen the monkeys fling poo as hard as they're flinging these days

751
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,520
And I believe it's because they have a new poo-flinging campaign

752
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:17,460
A catapult called the internet where they can put a mask on and fling poo and nobody knows where the poo's coming from

753
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,100
Yes sir

754
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,400
Because you don't have to be very brave to fling poo on the internet

755
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,700
Well, yup

756
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,740
Or you don't have to be that brave to fling poo on the radio

757
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:31,120
But people could, theoretically, look up the address of...

758
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,580
Well, let's not give anybody any big ideas

759
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,760
Let's not plan that

760
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,660
Let's not play around about it

761
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,320
Yeah, I'm sorry

762
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,580
So, yeah, we should call the FBI and warn them before we leave the station

763
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,420
Tell them to come protect us

764
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,060
We should call them up every day and say everything's going fine, as smooth as a month's fur

765
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,000
And give them some names

766
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,960
Say, uh, Chief Reverend Slappo Waldo Spackle

767
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,640
I had to call the FBI about him

768
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,640
Just to cover my own fanny

769
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,740
He certainly did

770
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,100
Well, he was talking about...

771
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,100
Doing things that...

772
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,200
It was like, well, if he does do these things

773
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:22,160
And the FBI's gonna look at his phone records and go, well, he's been leaving messages on the subgenius foundation

774
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,180
In fact, that's the only thing he ever calls

775
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,540
Is the subgenius foundation number

776
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,300
Mm-hmm

777
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,180
Why didn't they tell us?

778
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,700
Why didn't they let us know?

779
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,580
So, I did call the FBI one time and said, there's this guy

780
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,420
He's probably not gonna do anything, but he did say he was gonna do something

781
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,520
And they said, okay, well, your ass is covered and...

782
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,440
If he says which police station he's gonna blow up, then you call us again

783
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,760
But he never...

784
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,140
I don't think he is capable of looking up the address of a local police station

785
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,740
I hope not

786
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,340
Neither do I

787
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,860
That's why he always finds these, like, strange American Legion posts

788
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:03,340
Not a French Foreign Legion post somewhere in Tunisia and stuff that haven't existed for a thousand years

789
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,200
Anyway, the bottom line is, don't tell the Church of the Subgenius headquarters

790
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,580
Your plans for domestic terrorism because we're not going to keep quiet about it

791
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,500
If we take you seriously, we're going to cover our butts

792
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,700
So, just don't talk that way to us

793
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,300
You can...just don't do it

794
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,320
Don't go there, don't go there

795
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,340
You can guarantee that those who do will be surveilled

796
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,780
Well, they will...

797
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,340
You know, one of them said on his...

798
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,060
He complained a thousand years ago and that's why they still believe in these medieval creatures

799
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:47,880
On one of the phone messages I played back from the guy that calls every ten minutes

800
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,460
He said, I hope the conspiracy is listening in on these calls because I want them to know that it's over

801
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,200
They can't get away with this

802
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,180
The entire society of humans is all going to die when...

803
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,100
Because I am fed up and I'm not going to take it anymore

804
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,660
Hmm

805
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,080
Then he went on to say, well, they're going to die because the aliens will kill them

806
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,800
And he knows the aliens won't kill him because he saw the UFOs one night and...

807
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,960
So therefore he's safe

808
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,580
But I'm trying to tell him, dude, even though I know you don't listen to the show

809
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,360
Because you don't know it's still on

810
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,100
Don't do it, man

811
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,500
And don't even...don't tell us that kind of stuff

812
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,600
That just puts us in an awkward position

813
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,120
Where we then have to go to the man and go, hey, Mr. Man?

814
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,820
Just so you know, of course we don't like you

815
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,720
And we preach resistance of certain mental kinds

816
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,760
But, you know...

817
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,760
Just don't tell us, okay?

818
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,880
Not that that many were, but we have a couple of pesky...

819
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,460
Psychotics

820
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,240
Yeah, psychotics

821
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,600
You know, here's the weirdest thing

822
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
This one guy keeps telling me that

823
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,920
If only the...he tells this to my message machine

824
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,900
If only the Confederacy had won

825
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,020
Then there wouldn't be a conspiracy

826
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,900
The Union conspiracy calls it

827
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,260
And he wishes that the Confederacy had won

828
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:28,880
Which is a kind of a strange thing for this particular guy to wish for

829
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,940
Because I'm pretty sure he's African American

830
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:34,820
Yes

831
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,120
It's a kind of...it's like...

832
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,760
Oh, I remember that fellow

833
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,460
He's one of the major crazies

834
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,840
You've got about seven really deeply disturbed...seven, eight...maybe more

835
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,780
I don't know, but...

836
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,360
I used to play him on the show

837
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:52,020
But I decided that it's not cool to exploit the mentally ill

838
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,040
And I'll leave that up to Howard Stern

839
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,040
Let Howard Stern exploit mentally ill people

840
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,700
As somebody pointed out

841
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,940
Hey, when Howard Stern exploits him, they eventually get laid

842
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,500
Finally

843
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,420
Yep, it's true

844
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,620
It's true, it's the hairy belly of the great Shabu-Boo

845
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,060
I heard that Elephant Boy finally got a girlfriend

846
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,000
All those...

847
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,840
I haven't heard that show in 20 years

848
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,960
It's been a long time

849
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,760
The great charitable works

850
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,040
Yeah

851
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:25,380
That Dr. Sinister does for many of these psychological miscreants

852
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:30,080
Helping them, you know, make it through another day with their strange comments and stuff

853
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,580
He's helped a lot of people out by directing them to these...

854
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,500
Non-functional escalators

855
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:43,080
Well, you know, there's times when I want to just turn off my toll-free number

856
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,600
But I'm afraid of what would happen to my crazy man callers

857
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,980
I really am

858
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,540
You know, I think I'd kind of miss them

859
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,180
Yeah

860
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,840
It just wouldn't be the same

861
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,560
One time, the guy didn't call for like a week and a half

862
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,880
And I got really worried

863
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,840
I thought, oh no, did he jump off a cliff or...

864
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,480
Or, you know, lose his mind?

865
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,160
And again, more than usual, all the rest of it

866
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,980
Well, he was already spasmodic

867
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,060
He was in four-pressure mode, he was a spasmoder, yeah

868
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:18,400
But he paid his 30 bucks to the Church of the Subgenius that one time

869
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,380
A long time ago

870
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,140
By the way, that is not an operative figure that we use anymore

871
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:23,840
No longer

872
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,860
So don't even think about that

873
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,160
But he was...

874
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,060
30 pieces of silver

875
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:33,800
Yeah, he earned his way onto the escape vessels

876
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,920
And he will be saved

877
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,860
If he doesn't screw up and kill himself

878
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,780
Or get himself killed before July 5th, 1998

879
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,820
Well, might I ask a politically incorrect question?

880
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,220
No

881
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,080
If, say, a person like George Herbert Walker Bush

882
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,780
Who's known to be an insider on many kinds of not necessarily nice things and stuff like that

883
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,920
Well, he was the head of the secret police, sure

884
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,500
Right

885
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,020
Somebody's gotta do it

886
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,600
If he, or say even J. Edgar Hoover in his day

887
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,360
If people like that were to, or the many other villains of history and stuff like that

888
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,900
If they were to pay that 30...

889
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,400
Well, which is no longer a perfunctory label now

890
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,320
If they were to sign up, really sign up

891
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,360
That they would be saved on X day?

892
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:21,820
Well, yeah

893
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,120
That's the whole idea, right?

894
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,060
I mean, isn't it?

895
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:32,440
I know, I just wanted you to stab that pencil further into the heart of the average listener

896
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,640
Who's hoping...

897
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,740
For glimmer of hope

898
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,140
That somehow the Church of the Sub-G should answer many of life's questions

899
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,800
Some meaning in much the same way that thoughts have wings

900
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,260
And birds have whistles

901
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,580
And everybody lives together in perfect harmony

902
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,460
Or the vice versa

903
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,160
I think it's gonna be the vice versa

904
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,780
Unfortunately, I agree

905
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,120
We?

906
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,460
Oui, oui

907
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:06,660
Oui?

908
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
Where are you?

909
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,440
I'm here, Monsieur, where are you?

910
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,700
I could hear you breathing heavily, but I could not...

911
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,800
I know that you're doing the nostril routine right now with the holistic doctors

912
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,760
How do you know?

913
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,460
You're on the phone

914
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:22,660
Because I'm told

915
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:23,880
You can't...

916
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,540
That's right

917
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,140
You can't see us

918
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,400
Just because I can't see the sand of the Sahara Desert

919
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,620
Does not mean it does not exist

920
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,620
Any function...

921
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:34,860
Any...

922
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,540
Any person...

923
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,520
Any person with knowledge of the whereby...

924
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,220
Any...

925
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,440
What?

926
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,160
What?

927
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,000
Dave, you should be teaching Philosophy 101

928
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,120
I should

929
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,060
Should I?

930
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:49,800
Yeah

931
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,100
Yes

932
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,560
Yeah, to sophomores

933
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,280
To hurt their feelings and make them go home and cry and stuff?

934
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:55,940
No, no, give them...

935
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,840
Going out on the island and drinking and stuff?

936
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:01,620
No, give them a bunch of painfully corny things to quote to each other

937
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,720
Yeah, and then clowk it...

938
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,400
I mean cloud it...

939
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:12,000
And then clowk it in modern TV and internet, YouTube, etc., etc.

940
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,040
How about Philosophy of the Occult 101?

941
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,640
Man...

942
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,100
Okay

943
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,980
Talk about a well of vapidity

944
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,820
No, not the...

945
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,780
New Age Philosophy of the Occult 101

946
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,600
Every sentence out of the professor's mouth would be like,

947
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,060
something from a Hallmark card

948
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,620
How about the extremely obscure?

949
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,680
And quotes from brain-damaged rock stars

950
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,840
Well, then...

951
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,920
Like Jim Morrison and Terrence McKenna

952
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,480
Together in the bathtub drinking cognac and slashing each other's nose

953
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,880
I would love to hear a tape of that

954
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,980
Terrence McKenna and Jim Morrison in the bathtub together

955
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,480
He's getting ready to commit suicide

956
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,460
McKenna was pretty funny

957
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,100
And I imagine that eventually Jim Morrison would have lost his patience

958
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,960
Because McKenna just kept, you know, kind of blowing him off and laughing

959
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,580
While he was trying to do his poetry

960
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,120
And they'd eventually...

961
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,680
Yeah, he did like to be taken seriously

962
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,840
I mean, he was not a vapid scooter

963
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,400
Or one of those other benign religious names and stuff

964
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,840
He was more of an autocrat

965
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:32,580
Well, you know, Dave, I'm standing by to put down anybody's most beloved history

966
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:32,980
I'm not going to say that I'm one of the most beloved heroes

967
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,760
I will dare to say, because I have to

968
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,220
Zappa sucks

969
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,260
I'll even say Hendrix sucks

970
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,540
Because everybody sucks sometimes

971
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:45,440
And their worshippers need to be reminded

972
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,200
Their worshippers need wake-up calls

973
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,300
Yeah, and I'm the one to do it

974
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:54,720
Because I'm jealous of all those rich, famous, drug-avid rock stars

975
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,480
You know, by gobs

976
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,840
But at least I can admit that

977
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,160
By golly, by gobs?

978
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,260
By golly, by gobs

979
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,700
By golly, by gobs

980
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,160
Fifteen full solid meters of gobs, by golly, by gobs

981
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,980
I mean, I was inspired by all those artists and musicians and stuff

982
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,360
And copying them, just like everybody else

983
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,920
But, you know, eventually you just have to say to yourself

984
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,880
They suck, and move on

985
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,800
If you're going to get anything done yourself

986
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,660
Now, if you don't plan to get anything done yourself

987
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,100
And just plan to keep on sucking the finger

988
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,100
Instead of going where it points, that's fine

989
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,700
But I say, bite off the finger!

990
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,840
Just bite it off!

991
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,620
If you find yourself sucking on some famous guy's finger

992
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,360
Quit sucking

993
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,620
And if you're not going to go where the finger points

994
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,120
Which unfortunately is towards your own rear end

995
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,160
If you're sucking on it

996
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,680
You might as well just bite it off

997
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,220
And free yourself, man

998
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,280
Free yourself from the famous people

999
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,280
Yeah, just like when they started German Expressionism

1000
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,120
What was the phrase?

1001
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,780
All is to sucken, all is to fallen

1002
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,320
What does that mean?

1003
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,120
It means everything sucks, it's all screwed up

1004
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:14,740
Well, see, like I said, you should be teaching Occult Philosophy 101

1005
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,380
Yes

1006
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,980
A nihilistic philosophy 101, how's that?

1007
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:18,660
No, obscure, not occult, that's too hidden

1008
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,580
We want it to be more like obscure because

1009
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,520
The truth of the hot light shall pierce

1010
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,960
Shall pierce the darkness of the night

1011
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,860
And, you know, stuff like that

1012
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,780
I have existential nausea

1013
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,860
And I hate CGI

1014
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,960
I hate computer graphics

1015
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,040
And I'm just sick of existing

1016
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,540
It's horrible

1017
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,340
They just don't make movies like they used to

1018
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,400
And all the new music sucks

1019
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,380
Rap isn't music

1020
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:47,260
And I'm sick of turducken

1021
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:50,240
And I'm sick of pie-caken

1022
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,120
And I'm sick of all these things

1023
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,440
You mean pie-caken?

1024
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,100
Pie-caken and turducken, yes

1025
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:09,140
How about quail, elephant, cow, dog, turducken, chickadee

1026
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,660
Inside the duck, inside the chicken you put a little chickadee

1027
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:17,560
Inside the chickadee you put a little centipede

1028
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,020
Inside the centipede you put many parasites

1029
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,240
And inside the parasites you put even more parasites

1030
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:24,920
That's a sandwich

1031
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,500
Starts with a whale, ends with a bunch of parasites

1032
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,140
That's God's earth, man

1033
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,840
That is what God granted us

1034
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,000
We are here to consume of it

1035
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,920
You're making me turn blue and climb to the top of the blade of grass

1036
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,480
You're making me turn also blue

1037
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,040
And try to climb Mount Everest

1038
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,940
Where nobody can go there sometimes

1039
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,480
I love what's on the edge

1040
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,480
Actually, uh

1041
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:58,580
Well, we're talking about the parasites that turn the snails blue

1042
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:02,540
And make them crawl up the top of the grass so the birds will eat them

1043
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:08,460
So the birds will fly around crapping little parasite-ridden poops out

1044
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,260
And then hence spreading more parasites for the snails

1045
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,720
And what was the other thing we were talking about?

1046
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,400
Now I can't remember

1047
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,480
See, that's why it's called the Church of the Subgenius

1048
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:26,020
Now, there was this one producer, I believe it was David Letterman's producer

1049
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:29,580
Kept saying, no, we'll never have subgeniuses on the Letterman Show

1050
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,200
Because it's a one joke idea

1051
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,520
Well, it may be a one joke idea

1052
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,120
But it's a multi-idea joke

1053
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,180
Sure, maybe one joke multi-joke

1054
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,840
Multi-idea joke

1055
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,720
So one joke

1056
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,500
One multi-idea joke idea

1057
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,140
But it's a multi-joke that keeps making more multi-jokes

1058
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,580
Yeah, milk it, baby, milk it

1059
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:00,860
That's what I say over here, over there, over here, over there

1060
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,920
Yeah, milk it, baby, milk it

1061
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,820
All I can say is, David Letterman's off the air

1062
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,660
And the hour of slack is still on

1063
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,400
Mm-hmm

1064
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,360
Enron closed down

1065
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:15,820
But the Subgenius Foundation Incorporated's still paying sales tax

1066
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,100
Ohio sales tax

1067
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,460
Yep, and if you said that, then we better pick up on it

1068
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,520
That's right, I said it, so you better pick up on it

1069
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,860
If I pick up on it, you should

1070
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,480
And Jimi Hendrix told me to say that

1071
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,620
In that vision, in the dark

1072
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,700
That was when he didn't say

1073
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,540
Sleepy, resting, me and you awake

1074
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,500
I'm sorry

1075
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,360
It's okay, Dave

1076
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,540
Don't be sorry, Dave, it's okay

1077
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,720
Well, it's the nature of the business, you know

1078
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,820
When you're trying to make yourself heard for no apparent reason at all

1079
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:49,640
Over two other people who apparently have something to say that makes sense

1080
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,280
And you're trying to make sense so desperately

1081
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,960
Not you, personally, no, me, personally, yes, me

1082
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,400
Well, maybe

1083
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,440
Oh, yes

1084
00:53:59,100 --> 00:53:59,860
Yes, sir

1085
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,240
Maybe

1086
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:01,820
Doesn't make sense

1087
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,360
Maybe yes, maybe no, but why not both?

1088
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,580
That's what I say

1089
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,280
Why not both?

1090
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,100
Why not both?

1091
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:10,840
Why?

1092
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,460
Why?

1093
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,320
I got a little email from somebody saying

1094
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,820
I like the way at the beginning of the Subgenius TV commercial you say,

1095
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,060
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1096
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,420
Now, I was listening to NPR the other day

1097
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,740
And the lady on there was saying her wheres and whys

1098
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,160
As if they had an H in front of the W instead of after the W

1099
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:30,420
Perhaps

1100
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,360
That's why we do it

1101
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,560
Maybe she grew up in South Carolina

1102
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,900
I don't say

1103
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,340
Is that a South Carolina one?

1104
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,120
I don't know

1105
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:43,680
I don't say, we'll walk to the wheat field

1106
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,260
I say, we walk to the wheat field

1107
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,440
You see?

1108
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,020
It depends on whether you really know how the words you're saying are spelled or not

1109
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:55,620
We barked in the fields while we bailed

1110
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:59,360
That's another onomatopoeia that we should be at least reckoning with

1111
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,040
Hey, hey, hey, watch your language, we're on the radio

1112
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,780
I'm a onomatopoeia every day

1113
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,720
Any time I can

1114
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,120
I'm a onomatopoeia

1115
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,220
No, it's onomatopoeia day

1116
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,760
It's the time of onomatopoeia

1117
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,060
The mighty time

1118
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,740
Of onomatopoeia

1119
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:16,160
Well?

1120
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,260
He was a great, great leader

1121
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,100
I'm onomatopoeia pretty soon after this show's over

1122
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,100
And this show's gonna be over in about three minutes

1123
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,780
And I have a two and a half minute song to play

1124
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,700
So I'm gonna start wrapping this up

1125
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,220
Dave

1126
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:32,280
Dave, did you know what show you called?

1127
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,240
You called The Hour of Slack

1128
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,060
Which happens to be produced at WCSB

1129
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,460
At Cleveland State

1130
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,860
That's where it's produced

1131
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,160
WCSB

1132
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,680
That's not the only place it's played on

1133
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,460
But, and The Hour of Slack is the

1134
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,440
Spokes noise for the mighty church of the subgenius

1135
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,740
Such an interesting organization

1136
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,060
You can read about it in Wikipedia

1137
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,920
And this week it's all highfalutin sounding

1138
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,780
Oh my, it's all scholars

1139
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,480
Can't wait to see that

1140
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,840
Yeah, it's interesting

1141
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,940
Gotta spell subgenius right though

1142
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,840
That's subgenius.com

1143
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,660
Dave, I'm gonna have to fade you out now

1144
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,220
Cause we're gonna cut to another song

1145
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,740
By the Fantastic Plastics

1146
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,100
Well, don't worry about it

1147
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,460
I've already faded myself here into a disillusioned...

1148
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,720
Oh, Dave, don't fade yourself

1149
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,440
Oh, I'm fading, see, I do that

1150
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,500
That's the trick we do

1151
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,820
Oh, it's so sad

1152
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:21,840
No, it's not

1153
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,580
It's okay

1154
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,480
When we were stuck at the top of a tree

1155
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,160
I was glad it was you with me

1156
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,420
Cause I like you

1157
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,180
Yeah, I like you

1158
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:43,700
Yeah, I like you

1159
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:54,020
Actually, I like kids

1160
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:54,140
But those old chicks

1161
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,340
고고

1162
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,340
This is a no-no

1163
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,760
We gotta gogo

1164
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,520
Split us into where we can't be seen

1165
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,240
All alone like we've never been

1166
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,520
Yeah, I like you

1167
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,300
Yeah, I like you

1168
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,500
Yeah, we were hot, hot on the trail

1169
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,180
So determined to make us fail

1170
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,420
Yeah, I need you

1171
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,160
Yeah, I need you

1172
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:47,940
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1173
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,140
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1174
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,520
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1175
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,100
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1176
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,320
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1177
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,680
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1178
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:12,740
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1179
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:43,680
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1180
00:59:43,700 --> 01:00:13,680
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1181
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:43,680
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1182
01:00:43,700 --> 01:01:12,920
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1183
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:43,680
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1184
01:01:43,700 --> 01:02:04,460
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1185
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:43,220
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1186
01:02:43,700 --> 01:03:13,680
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go

1187
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:18,260
This is a no-no, we gotta go-go
