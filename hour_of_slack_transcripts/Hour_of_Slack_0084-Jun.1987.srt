1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
A candy-colored clown they call the Sandman

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,540
Tiptoes through my room every night

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,520
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,480
Go to sleep, everything is all right

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,220
I close my eyes

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,980
Then I drift away

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,240
Into the magic night

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,520
I softly say

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh, sign

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,980
No trouble

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,600
Just get that gig going

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,900
Recording

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,320
Everything's going fine

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,280
No trouble

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,840
This is Doug Smith, radio operator

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,800
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,620
Bob?

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,460
Bob?

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,280
Ray?

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:04,980
Bob?

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,620
You can read along with me in your book

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,020
You will know it is time to turn the page

23
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,640
When you hear R2-D2 beep like this

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,140
Let's begin now

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,520
It was a dark time for the rebellion

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,520
After the loss of the Death Star

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,500
The evil Galactic Empire intensified its efforts to crush the Rebel Alliance

28
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,320
Prepare yourself

29
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,700
You are about to be remade into a new being

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,200
Through forbidden knowledge previously kept secret for centuries

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,880
By the jealous priesthoods of many religions

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
Caution

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,540
and babbling

34
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:04,540


35
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,020
The King of Hell

36
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,800
The impatience of the olacak

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:06,800


38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:06,800


39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,020
Les average

40
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,020


41
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,020


42
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,500
and his true

43
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:07,940
Transcendence

44
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:07,940


45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,280
andет

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,520
You will be銀

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:17,520


48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,280
We have cheated

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,220
The signs of fate

50
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:25,780
Truck with Scots a lot harder from playing around here

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:36,520
Which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the state of detached electrons to the state of organic humanity.

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,020
I have seen the truth, and I intend to show it to you.

53
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,640
You wonder how it will seem? I will tell you.

54
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,380
Come, a big gib's a golly goshin', better puke your peat on full throttle potent teat,

55
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,520
elsewise your wants'll be waggin' down on mammy's hind nanny.

56
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,120
Why can't your peaser pop a squeezer when the gushers are goin' all normal-like?

57
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,120
Got your no geyser sense in your sneezin' chamber, boy?

58
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,980
Heistin' a empty platter in your beanbag?

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,620
Where's your rollerballs, eh?

60
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,620
I can't grok me no...

61
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,580
love-gro on this loo-joo-moo-joo band?

62
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,980
You gon' have to spreech English, Jake.

63
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,360
Get right with your muscle snake, snunk monkey.

64
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,820
Quit spritzin' your plizzerer lessen it's snowin' white lute juice, baby.

65
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,260
Elsewise your pleatin' bleeder's blowin' hot water.

66
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,680
You go blind or please your neither tryin' not to.

67
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,920
Either way, you're gettin' up on the wrong orbit for this kinda free-kneadin'

68
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,620
bleeder.

69
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,080
You're a good-niggin' side-trade, eh?

70
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,680
Well, won't you go stand there like a damn-nickle slug or you...

71
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,500
Made a complete log, computerized, of all the Hour of Slack shows.

72
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,700
And if anybody out there is an Hour of Slack bootlegger, collector type,

73
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:12,600
you can write to the secret subgenius P.O. box and get that listing from us.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,620
And using that thing, I put together...

75
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,620
I... I... I...

76
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,120
I made it for other reasons, but I did put together a collection of show intros.

77
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,760
Now, don't... don't be frightened.

78
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,920
This isn't the... these aren't the four regular show intros that you're used to.

79
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:36,060
These were all specialties from the last 83 hours of Slack.

80
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,720
You have had that much Slack, dear friends.

81
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,320
83 hours.

82
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,140
That ain't... that ain't really a whole lot.

83
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,120
That's a little more than three days, I guess.

84
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,300
Not much Slack.

85
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,120
But someday, oh, someday, it'll be all... all Hour of Slack.

86
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,660
All the time.

87
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,180
Hope that be...

88
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,540
...

89
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,060
...

90
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,260
...

91
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,500
...

92
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,080
...

93
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,180
...

94
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,260
...

95
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:00,280
...

96
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,960
...

97
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,020
...

98
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,020


99
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,080
...

100
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,280
...

101
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,280


102
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,280


103
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,280


104
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,280


105
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,280


106
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
...

107
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,340
...

108
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,940
...

109
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:03,940


110
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,620
...

111
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,620
...

112
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,960
...

113
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,200
...

114
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,860
...

115
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:26,620
already broadcasting. Ah yes dear friends. Yes and you can see your radio light up and

116
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:39,020
if you look inside the speakers real close you may be able to see the picture. All right.

117
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:48,140
Energize the caller please. Ah yes dear friends welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of

118
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:58,320
slack. Praise Bob. Praise Bob and we'll be orbiting your area for the next hour carrying the message

119
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:08,460
the seed word of the faith of Bob the faith in Bob FIB we call it. Can you keep up the FIB?

120
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:08,920
Can the Bible speak?

121
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,620
FIB friend. You want to dump the main shunts? Thank you. All right.

122
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,680
Okay. Somewhere over there. Show is right up on the green lines doctor. Okay. Show is fully on the line.

123
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,580
We will be landing on another show. We will be docking with another show tonight. Pardon me.

124
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:36,460
You can't land on another show. We'd cause a nuclear explosion. We'll be docking with show four from San

125
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,640
Francisco tonight and

126
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,000
and uh hold onto your seats and

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,520
Oh!

128
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,060
Ah! They pinned!

129
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,900
They pinned!

130
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,260
Behold the bowels of the heavens shall be opened to smite and

131
00:06:52,260 --> 00:07:01,020
You. You look. It's the colon of the earth. Let's pretend like we have a contest going. We'll just call people in the phone book and say you won.

132
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,640
A little bit farther up the colon. Yes there it is. Lips flapping in the wind.

133
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,020
4425.

134
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,540
Like hideous.

135
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,860
Flames of reincarnation.

136
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,100
That's right.

137
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:20,660
Slurms of reincarnation in the hell spirit world that you don't even know about because you're too ignorant. Ignorant because you're just a listener. That's all.

138
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,280
That's right.

139
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,880
Just a mere listener.

140
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,740
Yes.

141
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:35,460
Oh the pathetic fools. The earth fools. Oh ye stiff-legged. Ye, ye pathetic third-dimensional creatures.

142
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,280
You won.

143
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,000
If you could but know.

144
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,520
A little bit farther up the colon. Yes.

145
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:46,120
If you could but dream for an instant of that which could await you, were you good enough to...

146
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:58,200
But friends, friends, there's no escaping me. Literally no escape from the show that never ends. Oh.

147
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,360
Come, fly the teeth of the wind. Share my wings.

148
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:29,820
You know of course that you are living in a power age. What are you doing with it? I call this power TNT because it is dynamite. Use it rightly and it can bring you anything you want. Use it wrongly and it can eventually produce for you what you don't want. But you cannot get away from this power.

149
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,680
Praise Bob.

150
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:51,200
The luck plane has brought you into possession of a subgenius hour of slack show. This could be the greatest thing that has ever happened to you. An unsurpassable beautific experience. Or it could be your worst mistake. A one-way ticket into an insane universe from which there is no escape.

151
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,120
Give it proper listening techniques.

152
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,460
Lead to dependency.

153
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,820
Severe mental and physical addiction.

154
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:57,900
Seizures.

155
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,580
Brain fits.

156
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,620
Chromosomal damage.

157
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,240
I.

158
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,520
Am if conditions.

159
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,560
Pop.

160
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,420
Pop nite glandular mutation.

161
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,460
And even.

162
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
Pop, pop.

163
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,020
Erasure.

164
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,920
Pop.

165
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,620
Hubble .

166
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,620
Squat.

167
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,800
in my territory.

168
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,700
I had to get in there

169
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,380
and it's whole after the rats

170
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,120
one time.

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,680
Rats.

172
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,800
Rats.

173
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,440
I used to

174
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
have to eat rat a lot.

175
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,080
Back in the 90s

176
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,780
in the Depression.

177
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,800
World Depression

178
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,840
II they called it.

179
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,140
This was after the one in the 80s.

180
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,780
Boy.

181
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,060
Them was lean years

182
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,020
brother.

183
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,780
No wonder there was a bad

184
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,440
bad depression all over the world.

185
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,240
Kind of figures.

186
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,120
Dateline for dominance didn't mention

187
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,980
that it would be caused by

188
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,520
some genius church and I can see why.

189
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,900
Why Bob would not want to mention that in his

190
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,400
his teachings.

191
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,680
To the uninitiated.

192
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,660
No, they wouldn't understand.

193
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,660
And it was

194
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,900
and it was

195
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,540
going on behind cool.

196
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,040
So teaching

197
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,040


198
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,300
That move in Mad Max

199
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,880
movies how men

200
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,360
we look at those

201
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,420
or

202
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,920
no wish that being that easy

203
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,240
we got this refrigerator is plutonium

204
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,320
we got on the airwaves is this show.

205
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,360
This weird show.

206
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,660
I remember I used to be amazed that Dr. Gene Scott

207
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,980
was on 12 hours a day on TV in Dallas, Texas.

208
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,380
But now, this show for 24 hours a day forever.

209
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:37,740
Forever.

210
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,320
Hey, hey, you over there.

211
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,440
Wanna buy some show?

212
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,240
Yeah, we got some good show.

213
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,060
Hey, what's the matter?

214
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,420
What's the matter, man?

215
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,320
Aren't you into show?

216
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,420
Eternal salvation.

217
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,300
Triple your money back.

218
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,880
Hello, Dr. Sparrow.

219
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,080
I'm Dr. Sparrow.

220
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,700
I'm Dr. Sparrow.

221
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,340
I'm Dr. Sparrow.

222
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm Dr. Sparrow.

223
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,380
I'm Dr. Sparrow.

224
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:14,560
I'm Dr. Sparrow.

225
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:14,560


226
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:14,560


227
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,500
Let's do this.

228
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,080
My name is Reverend Ivan Stank.

229
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,920
I am the last sole survivor of the Battle of Dobstown,

230
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,500
popularly called Bob's Last Stand.

231
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,360
I knowed J.R. Bob Dobstown.

232
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,460
I knowed the subgeniuses for what he was.

233
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,200
And I knowed the subgeniuses for what they was.

234
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,060
Turn that thing on.

235
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,440
Put on them headphones.

236
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:58,160
111 years ago, when I was 33 years old,

237
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,040
right after the atomic wars,

238
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,360
my church was rubbed out by a band of white men.

239
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,740
Wild pink boys.

240
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,420
Wait a minute.

241
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,880
It's showtime.

242
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,140
Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

243
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,040
The show that dare not even exist.

244
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,240
Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time

245
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,180
into showtime with your favorite horrifying horror host,

246
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,120
Mobius Rex.

247
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,860
And you'll hear the voices of puzzling evidence

248
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,120
Gary Bobram lies in a cast of thousands more.

249
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,700
It's mysterious.

250
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,280
Evil.

251
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,420
Spooky.

252
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,260
Eerie.

253
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:39,760
Creepy.

254
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,360
Wacky.

255
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,780
Kooky.

256
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,260
Fun.

257
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,700
It's loads of chuckles and chock full of gags and novelties.

258
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,000
It's stuff that your boyfriends will want

259
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,420
and that all your girlfriends will secretly admire.

260
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,360
We broadcast during the hours when the mind's grip on what it knows is at its weakest.

261
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,140
The dead hours of the morning between 4.30 and 6 o'clock.

262
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,640
This is the time when ancient superpowers,

263
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,600
superstitions and night fears have the greatest hold on human thoughts.

264
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,320
The time when those who sleep are deep in their dreams.

265
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,260
And this is the hour when on the church of the subgenius radio show

266
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,480
the doctors of the air operate without warning.

267
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,820
We inhabit a twilight world.

268
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,320
A world which feels the rising sun.

269
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,580
Long after nightfall,

270
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,780
when the witching hour has been dead for three and a half hours,

271
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,000
we rise from our coffins and go forth to stalk our living victims.

272
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,300
You, our beloved audience,

273
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,300
good hunting brothers,

274
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,480
howl!

275
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,340
Oh, yes, dear friends.

276
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,220
Well, I can finally hear myself in the headphones.

277
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,880
And you have no idea how important that is

278
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,620
for somebody with an ego as monstrously planet-sized as my own.

279
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,400
And, of course, George can...

280
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,780
George will tell you, too.

281
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,120
That's what it takes to get out there and discuss thousands of people at once.

282
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,460
Anything you can say, I can say it louder!

283
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,180
George probably could say it louder.

284
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,420
But I bet we could say it more irritatingly.

285
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,340
So, I wanted to drop in here with a little bit of news.

286
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,620
Some sub-deany news, as the old-timers call it.

287
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,380
The new reprint of the Book of the Subgenius is out in stores now.

288
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,700
I've seen it in Shakespeare's bookstore on Greenville

289
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,780
and Walden's books in Cleburne.

290
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,200
I don't know about Dallas.

291
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,720
And, of course, at Lone Star Comics.

292
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,520
Right?

293
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,160
Yeah, all over the place, where you can also purchase The Will of Dobbs itself.

294
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,960
And I can say that because I've already been paid for all sales of that book.

295
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,700
So this isn't like an ad that I would be making any special money from.

296
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,520
If you have some burning questions, you can call...

297
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,680
The Hour of Slack.

298
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:40,120
...the Hour of Slack personnel here at 823-7490 or at 828-9500.

299
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,900
And, dear friends, we do have a pledge drive coming up.

300
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,720
Now, you know, two pledge drives ago,

301
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:57,580
We Subgenii were the number one money-making show per hour for K&ON.

302
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,360
Now, this last pledge drive, we were but number four.

303
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,460
Number four out of 86 shows isn't bad.

304
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,160
But we're also the number one trouble show.

305
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,020
We're the fourth most liked, you might say, but the first most hated.

306
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,000
And next week, we're going to go into that pledge drive.

307
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:25,240
And this is your chance, your big chance, friends, to help all of us idiots and wise men and guys.

308
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,160
See, I included you girls, too.

309
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,020
It's your chance to help us achieve triumph.

310
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,600
And I'm going to go over the yuppie fools who like to think they're so smart,

311
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,280
never realizing the invalueability of their own divine idiocy.

312
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,740
Um, you know, this is the...

313
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,680
This could be, if we could get back to number one, friends,

314
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,160
this would be the ultimate put-down of the normals.

315
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,380
And, uh, if we...

316
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,340
You know, think about it.

317
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,900
If you can tell your friends that the Hour of Slack is number one,

318
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,720
the people that hate us will feel even more threatened,

319
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,060
they might even begin to question their own level of ignorance,

320
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,120
and we'd be proving that as much as we subgeniuses hate the conspiracy,

321
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,260
we are still more positive than those who hate Slack.

322
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,480
Um, you know, this show doesn't really fall into a category.

323
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,960
On Kanoan, you got your soul, your gospel, your rock country, specialties, and so forth.

324
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,880
But the Hour of Slack really encompasses all the other categories.

325
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,720
Other ones do, too, but we've...

326
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:35,050
Our Slack has soul, it has gospel, it has rock and roll,

327
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,230
it has country and a godzillion specialties, friends.

328
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,370
And, uh, this show, um, really, I guess you'd say,

329
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:50,530
is for the definitive Kanoan listener who really, actually, truly does want to expand its horizons.

330
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,850
Uh, even if that means risking an eternity in hell,

331
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,510
uh, which you might be doing from listening to this.

332
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,650
This show is, in short, friends,

333
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,370
proof that there could be hope for humanity.

334
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,610
That despite the generally brutal nature of human beings,

335
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,150
there could actually be peace and love.

336
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,750
Uh, it...

337
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,570
Because it shows that there's people who not only tolerate each other's abnormality,

338
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,170
but actually like it, although in small doses.

339
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,830
And, uh, really, that's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.

340
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,630
I... I hate to come out and admit that we aren't really trying to spread hatred

341
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,630
and recruit monogamy.

342
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,170
I mean, we're not trying to turn the world into a place of mindless zombies

343
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,130
and turn them into Manchurian candidates who'll help Dobbs destroy the Earth.

344
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,050
We are doing that, but among other things.

345
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,830
It's like, I'm afraid most of the...

346
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,290
Most of the subgeniuses, really, are people who have to work jobs,

347
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,050
support themselves, and so forth,

348
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:48,290
but who... who yet still have high ideals.

349
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,910
And we don't push the foot around, or else if we do, we do it to a T,

350
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,850
and we don't water stuff down.

351
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,010
But since corniness is, really, the...

352
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,150
the only sin in this church, I'd probably best shut up now,

353
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,610
and, uh, before I get in trouble with Bob,

354
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:07,430
and get on with the, uh, compilation of, uh, introductions to the Hour of Slack.

355
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,470
And, you know, in a way, I... I wonder if maybe this isn't a...

356
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,170
an insane sort of show, uh, like,

357
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:20,250
maybe, uh, everybody I'm talking to has a copy of every inch of this footage on tape already,

358
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,830
but somehow I sorta doubt it, and, uh, yeah.

359
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,970
Dr. Howell, railing in the night,

360
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,170
for that which lived, which is dead,

361
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,090
and for that which is dead, was dead,

362
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,670
and, in fact, was never alive.

363
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,570
So when will we get back to Bob?

364
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,870
The tickering of the...

365
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,950
Dr. I don't want to just turn that down again.

366
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,470
We don't want any of that stuff happening here.

367
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,650
In the swamps bongs the gongs of a throng of frogs,

368
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,670
while a knee-deep sheep bleats in a slippery stream

369
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,290
where slimy snakes whisper sinful secrets.

370
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,370
Let's go back to the knee-deep sheep dip, okay?

371
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,230
Dr. The knee-deep sheep dip dipped deep down below

372
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,810
the steep and chilly waters of the deep stream,

373
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,990
floats on the surface,

374
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,530
like the ancient Egyptians floated on the current of their belief,

375
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,570
for they thought they would never die,

376
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,910
but be reborn as gargling sarcophagi,

377
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,810
horrible mummies to march across the earth

378
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,010
and wreak and spew vengeance.

379
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,150
Give me the pyroflagellate.

380
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,490
All of the little tiny dead deities

381
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,790
march down the side of the subgenius church,

382
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,210
and now leave that night.

383
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,730
Dr. Within the great pyramid,

384
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,810
the secret chamber of the subgenius.

385
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,510
My God!

386
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,710
Dr. What light and steam come from the special effects department

387
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,010
located below the pyramid?

388
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,990
I hate Bob.

389
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,550
My Bob made my daddy go crazy.

390
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,650
My daddy used to make money,

391
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,910
but now he just sits around all day.

392
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,370
I hate Bob.

393
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,510
He's a bad man.

394
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,790
I wish he would die.

395
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,230
He's part of the conspiracy.

396
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,630
I can't help my dad.

397
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,490
My kid's name is Bob.

398
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,510
I'm a black tooth.

399
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,890
Dr. This is so difficult to live with.

400
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,550
Dr. Here.

401
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,450
Take some more of this.

402
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,170
Have some of that.

403
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,130
Maybe the show will finish

404
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,550
and we'll get to make another tape.

405
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,230
Dr. Oh no, more prescriptions again.

406
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,670
I don't know if I can keep up with all these prescriptions

407
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,850
and all these callers and all these fake shows.

408
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,870
Oh my God.

409
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,790
This subgenius thing is more than that.

410
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,530
Just take the pills, doctor.

411
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,270
I can't.

412
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,550
I don't think I can keep up with it.

413
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,570
There's too much of it.

414
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,410
These letters that come in the mail,

415
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,010
these weird magazines,

416
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,790
these characters that show up at the door,

417
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,770
these Bobbies.

418
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,930
They want to know things.

419
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,890
They want to know how to run their lives.

420
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,830
What should I do?

421
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,590
What's he saying about this?

422
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,950
About my girlfriend?

423
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,430
My girlfriend that won't be worshiped by?

424
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,530
What should I do?

425
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,390
What should I do, man?

426
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,210
Relax, relax, doctor.

427
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,950
I'll tell you what you should do.

428
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,350
It's like, doctor, you should do this.

429
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,150
No head launching, doctor.

430
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,950
Oh, take the pills.

431
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,330
Oh, light the fire.

432
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,410
Oh, try some of this false slack.

433
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,290
But we can't talk about that

434
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,470
because it would leave this station open to libel and slander.

435
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,110
That's our lawyer now.

436
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,050
Oh my God, he's here.

437
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,730
Hey, I feel much better.

438
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,150
Better now.

439
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:24,390
Oh.

440
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,070
This episode of the Hour of Slack

441
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,290
is brought to you by the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company.

442
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,870
Serving the public since God knows when.

443
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,090
Featuring the Dobbs approved churchware.

444
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,150
Weeping Cyclops products are available locally

445

448
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,910
Thanks, Weeping Cyclops,

449
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,470
for supporting K&O WEN and the Hour of Slack.

450
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,290
Praise Bob Mann.

451
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,110
Good Lord, man.

452
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,730
That's a pretty cool reggae version of that.

453
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,470
Kind of, uh, uh,

454
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,270
Good, Bad, and the Ugly theme.

455
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:26,770
How about that?

456
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,170
Now, in case you've been totally confused

457
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,350
by the Weeping Cyclops ads that we,

458
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,850
that are different every week,

459
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,690
those are, those are, um,

460
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,050
ads for subgenius T-shirts.

461
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,510
T-shirts with Bob on the front,

462
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,070
uh, which you can get from that P.O. box,

463
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,970
which she, uh,

464
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,990
Popes Cecilia just read.

465
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,950
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

466
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,530
If you take society's tools

467
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,150
You can make society move

468
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,810
You disobey but then you obey

469
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,650
You obey but then disobey

470
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,510
You thought your mom and dad were fools

471
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,270
You never wanted to listen in school

472
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:22,550
Now your dog won't go when you try to make it

473
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:26,290
He's got gold, but he's not gonna change it

474
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,490
Soon the Dark Overlord will engulf the Earth

475
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,490
Nothing human will remain here

476
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,150
Yeah? Well, nothing duck's remaining here either

477
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,750
Move, we're going

478
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,230
You'll get the text

479
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,250
Hate to eat and run

480
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:55,310
I guess ever since the nuclear war

481
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:02,210
It's been hard for us subgeniuses to keep the show running

482
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,590
Like it used to back in the good old days

483
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:10,090
Oh, now I remember those times

484
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:14,090
Those were good times, boy

485
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,990
This is Doug Smith, radio operator

486
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,130
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure

487
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,210
Yeah

488
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:28,670
Anyway, we create special effects with an Ultimac color tone brainwave synthesizer

489
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,210
You may have been reading about those lately

490
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:30,810
They're illegal

491
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:36,590
They trigger a total physical separation by stem cleavage

492
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,330
Of the left and right brains

493
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,550
That's cerebral mitosis to you science fans

494
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:46,390
Creating a forebrain-hindbrain sync lock

495
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,210
If you can dig on that

496
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,130
And that's the whole reason for this show

497
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:50,550
To exist

498
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,310
This is a brain disconnection show

499
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,450
Which operates on a simple new break-thinking principle

500
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,870
By which your brainwave patterns are gradually forced

501
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,270
Into resynchronization

502
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,950
With this tape's underlying messages

503
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,930
And instructions

504
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,430
So

505
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,010
What?

506
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,650
Plug of noise whizzing past your ears

507
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,770
So that's what we do

508
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,170
Is take the old cotton wad

509
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,390
That comes with this station

510
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,530
And clean it out

511
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,610
Incautiously

512
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,670
You did get a cotton wad with your station?

513
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,070
I think it's almost the first of the month

514
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,610
They come every first of the month

515
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,150
So they pour acid down the walls of the station

516
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,530
To make sure they kill it

517
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,490
Diversionary platforms

518
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,230
Which might be producing that kind of trash

519
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,610
And there's only one a day

520
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,890
So be very careful where you use that cotton wad

521
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,770
For all you early morning listeners

522
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,110
Who are up with the chickens

523
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,270
Here's the farm report

524
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,990
Brought to you by Bob's Feed and Grain Storage of Dobstown

525
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,590
Sore bean fueling

526
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:49,870
And the

527
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,450
Hog futures continue at the market rate

528
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,550
While most animal feeds are up today

529
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,470
Hog futures continue to look pretty dismal

530
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,150
But that's what you should expect if you're a hog

531
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,150
That's because most farm dwellin' parkers

532
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,530
Know the end of the line

533
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,890
Is food around the corner

534
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,890
For somebody else's breakfast table

535
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,830
And maybe even yours

536
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,510
Because if you have four legs

537
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,030
Hooves or trotters

538
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,890
And you live on a farm

539
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,750
If it isn't the Grim Reaper

540
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,130
It's the International Harvester

541
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:19,590
So you know where you're at

542
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,590


543
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,590


544
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,590


545
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,590


546
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,590


547
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,590


548
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,070
And now this.

549
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,930
We were talking about how...

550
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,310
It's the Subgenius Show.

551
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:37,090
Yes, if you weren't aware of what's been going on,

552
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,410
then you're probably just the sort of person

553
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,090
to listen to the Subgenius Show,

554
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,690
the indefinitely long, infinitely boring corridor

555
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,290
of horrible horticultural and biological facts.

556
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,330
This is the voice of Radial Subgenius,

557
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,610
bringing to the Greater Bay Area

558
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,710
the unadulterated, infrapulated vocal incarnation

559
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,250
of the sub-divine epistemology of subgenialism.

560
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,230
I'm your host, Dr. Howell,

561
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,670
and during the next hour and a half,

562
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,510
Mobius Rex and I will chair the open forum of subgenial issues.

563
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,210
Yes, it's so exciting I can hardly stand it.

564
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,210
How about you, Mobius?

565
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,750
Yeah, it's great.

566
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,710
And now, Noble Subgenius Knight comes up over the hill

567
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,870
and gets ready to slay the ugly dragon of the conspiracy.

568
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:26,710
See, there it is.

569
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,070
There it is.

570
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,110
So easy this time.

571
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:30,950
Here you go.

572
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,370
Do not over-medicate yourself with this show.

573
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,950
You should, however, listen more than once.

574
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,490
These are complex shows, more carefully orchestrated

575
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,810
and more scientifically accurate than any previous form of art

576
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,550
or expression in all of mankind.

577
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,010
History.

578
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:52,270
Do not operate heavy machinery while under the influence of these shows.

579
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,610
Car listening is legal but not recommended for first-time users.

580
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,350
Do not in any way attempt to dance to these tapes or shows.

581
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:04,570
The demons you see during the initial hallucination sequences are not real.

582
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:08,530
If you become frightened, try not to give up.

583
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,390
The scene, no scene on this show lasts any longer than a minute or so,

584
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,570
so don't panic during the hell scenes.

585
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,670
And a surface from...

586
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,250
...the show slowly at the end of the hour,

587
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,230
because coming out of the show is sort of a total rebirth experience,

588
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,730
if you can do it successfully, that is.

589
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,650
If you have trouble re-entering the Earth plane after this show,

590
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,890
focus on Bob and chant his name,

591
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,610
and then try to remember your own name and chant that for a while,

592
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,010
and don't eat for a couple of days after this show.

593
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:39,770
...

594
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:42,770
...

595
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:42,810
...

596
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,290
...

597
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:44,990
...

598
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:44,990


599
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:44,990


600
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:44,990


601
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:44,990


602
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:44,990


603
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:44,990


604
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:44,990


605
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:44,990


606
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:44,990


607
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,010
...

608
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,010


609
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,010


610
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,010


611
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,010


612
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,010


613
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,070
...

614
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,070


615
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,510
...

616
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,510


617
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,510


618
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,510


619
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,650
...

620
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,910
...

621
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,510
...

622
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:54,330
You are no longer in control, my friend.

623
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:02,350
We shall dominate you, dear listener, as we have dominated others of your species.

624
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,810
There's no escape.

625
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,670
You can only do your duty.

626
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,930
It was me who've done it anyway.

627
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,690
But you know, friends,

628
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:14,770
...

629
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:14,790
...

630
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,210
...

631
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:15,670
...

632
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:16,670
...

633
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:16,670


634
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,210
...

635
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:17,630
...

636
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,090
...

637
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


638
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


639
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


640
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


641
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


642
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


643
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


644
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


645
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


646
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


647
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


648
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


649
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


650
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


651
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


652
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


653
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


654
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:23,050
You start talking about the neither forces,

655
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,410
you might end up summoning some of them things.

656
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:35,970
Yeah, we subgenius ministers here found out there's some things you just don't play around with.

657
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,670
You don't start messing with somebody else's religion, they say.

658
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,090
But you start messing with the elder gods, friends.

659
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,830
You stir up forces.

660
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,830
Suddenly everything's going wrong.

661
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,490
What you gonna do about it, boy?

662
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,590
What you gonna do to get straight?

663
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,510
Not much you can do if you get everything out of balance.

664
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,570
You thought it was real funny, didn't you?

665
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,610
Thought you'd go and pull the devil's leg, eh?

666
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,830
Go ahead, son.

667
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,190
It's funny. Funny big joke.

668
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,250
Let's go. Go ahead, little girl.

669
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:21,150
Let's go spray paint funny pictures on tombstones.

670
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:27,170
Let's go make a fake bleeding head of Arnold Palmer head and launch it.

671
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:32,830
Let's go set up a Bob altar and worship for aliens.

672
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,310
Yeah, aliens.

673
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,750
Oh, fun.

674
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:42,350
Yeah, let's lure weird forces into our immediate vicinity.

675
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,890
You just go ahead and do it, Mr. Subgenius.

676
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,410
Oh, we're in it as deep as you.

677
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,450
We took money for it.

678
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,170
We know our souls are damned.

679
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:08,490
Not much we can do now but try to stay so fropped up we don't think about it.

680
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:15,330
I frankly suggest, friend, that you may be in it too deep to do otherwise yourself.

681
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,590
Pathetic Bobby.

682
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,290
You're Bobby, ain't you?

683
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,310
Thought you'd be cool.

684
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,910
Thought you'd get in with the cool guys.

685
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,430
Thought you'd live away.

686
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,610
We're laughing at you, boy.

687
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,010
Yeah, and you can get even deeper.

688
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:43,790
You can get in even worse trouble, friends, by calling 823-7490 or 828-9500.

689
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,610
Talk to the Will of Dobbs.

690
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,230
Or by writing to me.

691
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,650
Writing Bob himself.

692
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,830
Not that I can guarantee he'll read it, but he might.

693
00:33:51,950 --> 00:34:01,770
At P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

694
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,250
Now we're gonna be face to face.

695
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:15,110
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place.

696
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,930
Now it's my turn.

697
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,370
All right, knucklehead, try it.

698
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,950
Now I wanna be a dog.

699
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:30,830
Now I wanna be a dog.

700
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,350
Sightingly.

701
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:46,210
Now I'm ready to close my eyes.

702
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,030
I can't see, I can't see.

703
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,570
Got my eyes closed.

704
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:53,830
Now I'm ready to close my mind.

705
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,570
I can't think, I can't think.

706
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,670
Now I'm ready to feel your hand.

707
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,570
Feel this numbskull.

708
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:09,230
And lose my heart on the burning sand.

709
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,290
Did it say burning sand?

710
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,390
Yeah.

711
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:13,870
Take it.

712
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,590
Now I wanna.

713
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,090
Be a dog.

714
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,570
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

715
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,290
Attention, Earth people.

716
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,930
I bring you warning from the planet Expenses.

717
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:32,590
We Expenslings have the power to destroy K-N-O-N and the music that you love to hear.

718
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:40,950
K-N-O-N plans to retaliate with a summer pledge drive starting June 22nd through the 28th.

719
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,250
So if you want your music.

720
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,390
And K-N-O-N to live.

721
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,790
You had better give.

722
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,910
Beware, Earth people.

723
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,390
Beware.

724
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,730
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

725
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,250
Well, great.

726
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,370
Man, every time I try to put a cassette into the number two.

727
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,070
Eight track player doesn't work.

728
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,930
There's something evil about the second.

729
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,490
The second eight track player here in this station.

730
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,230
I don't know what to do.

731
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:13,230


732
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,850
I don't know what it is.

733
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:20,010
Well, you know, we we do get pretty ornery around here and we probably deserve all the trouble we get.

734
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:28,130
But, you know, there's people that deserve to be totally enraged by the show because, you know, after all, they do that to us.

735
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,410
All of us constantly, no matter what.

736
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:37,570
And just because we aren't of their skin color or their religion or lack thereof or their level of financial ambitions.

737
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:43,210
And of course, some people we make mad just because there's no one else even bothers to make them mad.

738
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:48,050
And the fact that they do get mad instead of thank us shows that they needed that pie in the face.

739
00:36:48,770 --> 00:37:03,930
We're doing our victims a great service, I think, personally, of course, in that we allow them, nay, force them to get a perspective for once by seeing their normally limited perspective warped and twisted beyond recognition.

740
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,650
Because that's our mission for Bob.

741
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:11,770
And it's your mission for Bob to keep this station on the air.

742
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,190
Not just for this show, but for the rest of the show.

743
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,190


744
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,090
I mean, all the other shows.

745
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,630
We have to do that.

746
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:21,310
We have to, I mean, we've got to keep making people upset.

747
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,270
You know, and they do call in.

748
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:28,230
They call 823-7490 and 828-9500 and tell us how much they hate us.

749
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,310
And we wish you would, too.

750
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,850
And we're trying.

751
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,590
We really are.

752
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:41,190
For instance, when we moved to 9 o'clock and started following George DeMarc, we thought, wow, you know, George is probably bringing a big audience over to KNON.

753
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,190
And some of these people are bound to be there.

754
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,730
Some of these people are bound to be potential subgeniuses.

755
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,370
What was that?

756
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:55,550
So half of, when we came to this time slot, half of my brain started thinking, hey, you know, this could be our big chance to get more popular.

757
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:05,550
But the stronger half, friends, the less conscious half, the stupid brain, which is the truthful one, was saying, no, don't do that.

758
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,670
Anything but that.

759
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,650
Don't try to be popular.

760
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,130
That's the conspiracy's most evil lure.

761
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:17,110
And really, it tricks most weirdos into selling out.

762
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:23,190
That's what prompts weirdos to slowly, gradually self-lobotomize their own creativity.

763
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:29,210
So, of course, we did one show where we tried to be nice to George's audience, to seduce them over to Bob.

764
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,770
But, yes, I hear you.

765
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,170
That's my wife in the background.

766
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:41,110
But ever since that first show where we were being nice, we've been doing it.

767
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,310
We've sort of intuitively begun to challenge their hipness.

768
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:49,850
And it's like, sure, you know, the New Wave audience is into, quote, new music.

769
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:50,970
But big deal.

770
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,230
That's unusual, slightly, I suppose.

771
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,830
But it's also very fashionable.

772
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:04,170
You know, how much of their so-called hip New Wave philosophy is sincere and how much is fashion groveling?

773
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:04,350
Eh?

774
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:11,090
You know, how long will their hipness stand up against the conspiracy juggernaut of unpaid heating bills?

775
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:15,410
When mama puts them out on the street and they have to get jobs and support a kid?

776
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:15,610
Eh?

777
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:24,450
So, you know, generally, I'm afraid a few are probably open-minded rebels and scholars of human cultural variational extremes.

778
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,430
But most of them are fashion grovelers.

779
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,770
And praise Bob, subgeniuses aren't all young hipsters anyway.

780
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:30,370
Nay, nay.

781
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,770
But a huge range of types, you might say.

782
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,370
Intellectuals, rednecks.

783
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,030
Intellectual rednecks.

784
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:40,090
Preverts, nerds, sex fiends, tough guys.

785
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:42,510
Nymphomaniacs.

786
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,670
Rich folks, poor folks.

787
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,890
Drug heads.

788
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,350
Straight folks.

789
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,310
Oldsters.

790
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,030
Babies.

791
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,910
You hear the baby in the background there.

792
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,570
Lawyers and junk dealers.

793
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,170
Christians and pagans.

794
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,670
Both the slackless friends and the slackful.

795
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:01,990
So, next week, when you make your contribution to K-N-O-N in the name of the Hour of Slack,

796
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:08,710
that's a contribution towards the subgenius album, which we've been talking to Ralph Records about.

797
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,330
Yeah!

798
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:13,270
Which in turn is a contribution towards the subgenius movie.

799
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:20,730
In turn, a contribution towards the subgenius TV network, like Dr. Scott has.

800
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:24,950
And finally, friends, for the subgenius world.

801
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:30,610
It's a contribution, yes, to cosmic tolerance of everything, except the conspiracy.

802
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,270
Because they're already way ahead.

803
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:39,310
Really, the subgenius church is probably the true ground floor of the subgenius world.

804
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,270
The so-called new age.

805
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,330
Not the corny, empty-headed, positive thinking will save us new age.

806
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:51,710
But the new age of Bob's iron-fisted rule over all thinking beings.

807
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,690
B-O-B.

808
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,990
B-O-B.

809
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,530
Bob.

810
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,250
B-O-B.

811
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:06,550
Bob.

812
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,570
Kisna! Kisna!

813
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:10,710
Kisna!

814
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,690
Hare! Hare!

815
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:12,690
Hare Rana!

816
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,810
Hare Rama!

817
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,570
Rama!

818
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,030
Rama!

819
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,350
Hare! Hare!

820
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:16,750
Hare!

821
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:17,890
Kisna! Hare!

822
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,310
Kisna! Kisna!

823
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:19,710
Kisna! Kisna!

824
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,850
Hare! Hare!

825
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,710
Hear the watch in front of us blurs and distorts time.

826
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:28,510
Soon we will be deep in a hypnotic trance.

827
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,010
What wonders will we see?

828
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:38,890
Hey kids, get some money out of your pants' socks and send it to Bob.

829
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:39,290
Ask him what he wants to see.

830
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:39,290


831
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:43,030
Yeah, pull up the level and you go.

832
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,550
Ladies and gentlemen, this is for our Slack.

833
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:53,850
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

834
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,410
living avatar of Slack and saint of Satan.

835
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,050
You have to love Bob.

836
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:08,010
He loves you, but you love Bob.

837
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,330
Bob, you have to.

838
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,190
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

839
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,210
He'll kill you.

840
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,990
So Bob, you out.

841
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:26,290
We're now deep inside the brain cavity of Doug Smith.

842
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,710
As you can see all around you, there are sparks.

843
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,810
There was a short circuit.

844
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,870
The brain seems to have recovered.

845
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,750
There are sparking energy thoughts all around us.

846
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:49,410
Far more than the normal human brain.

847
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:54,610
But as we know, another misfire there.

848
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,470
We know Doug Smith is not a normal human.

849
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,810
No, and here inside the brain of Doug Smith,

850
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:06,870
we can observe some of the differences that make this man unique.

851
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,250
He's a leader among men.

852
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:14,090
Over here in this corner are the memory bags.

853
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:20,710
And over here is the main printout area.

854
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,950
This is the subcommittee of the radio ministry.

855
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:30,330
Power of Slack on KNON 9029 in the left excess.

856
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,530
Praise Bob.

857
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,990
We've just experienced the first of the two days of the radio ministry.

858
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:37,990


859
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:37,990


860
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:37,990


861
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:42,690
The epiphany of Ivan Stang is presented by Globaco Oil Conglomerate.

862
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:47,210
And now we return you to the hearings in their 157th day.

863
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,130
As the testimony begins,

864
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:56,490
Mr. Stang is drinking his fifth pitcher of ice water.

865
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,810
He appears to be relatively calm.

866
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:04,690
Oh yeah, that's some great ice water you got there, Tammy.

867
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,350
Oh.

868
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:06,510
Oh.

869
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:07,990
Uh.

870
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:14,350
Well, yes, uh, there, we did have a computer in the backseat of the car.

871
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,110
As a matter of fact, I can, uh, I can prove that.

872
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,230
I can, I can show you the, uh, readouts.

873
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:21,830
And of course, there are the direct memory recordings, uh,

874
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,430
always available in the Akashic records.

875
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,030
Uh, uh, of course, not that I expect most of you to believe me.

876
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,010
You know, we're very interested in those records.

877
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,730
We're interested in the cash records.

878
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,830
Some sort of magic, uh, it's not magic at all, it's science.

879
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:34,670
Sweet money.

880
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:38,310
Uh, subgenius preachers, uh, every thought, word, and deed is recorded.

881
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:45,290
And, uh, just as are all the deeds witnessed by bobheads, Xerox bobheads.

882
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:49,370
Uh, uh, for instance, uh, you know, if I were to play,

883
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,370
I'm sure I could probably play back all sorts of, uh, tape.

884
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:53,690
Okay, Mr. Stang.

885
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,350
That you'd hate the Lord to see on Judgment Day, wouldn't you?

886
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:03,490
Uh, we've got your, uh, can we look again at your 1972, uh, tax returns?

887
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,810
We didn't make any money at all in 1970.

888
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:15,370
Okay, how about, uh, how about, uh, tax records for 1973, 74, and 75?

889
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,490
Uh, we only made 78 RPMs.

890
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,250
Those are on the public record.

891
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,970
If you call the Secret Service Secret Files public record, uh,

892
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,970
anybody has access to them, right?

893
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,570
Freedom of Information Act.

894
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:31,110
So go ahead and get them yourself, dig them out.

895
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,270
Fine, I don't care.

896
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:33,290
No problem.

897
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,750
Why don't you pick on Dr. Drummond?

898
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,470
Pick on some of the people who started this thing.

899
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,690
I was just hired on.

900
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:40,130
Yeah.

901
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:41,390
I was just following orders.

902
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,290
Eat well, stay fit, and die anyway.

903
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:48,970
Orders from a, uh, uh, uh, if, if, I mean, bring Bob in here.

904
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:49,990
He owes me money.

905
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,010
You think he owes the government money?

906
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,630
That's nothing compared to what he owes me.

907
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:58,070
And my poor wife, she's had to go into the detoxification clinic

908
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:03,270
to get off of these, these so-called pills he, his doctors kept, kept giving him.

909
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:03,950
She got prescribing.

910
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,790
She got to where she couldn't even see my head.

911
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,830
Poor money.

912
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:11,990
She'd look out on the plane window and see tiny, uh, desert frogs hopping around.

913
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:14,930
That's the famous Amy Simple McFord clinic.

914
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:18,690
But I think our greatest strength is still that we tell the truth as a government,

915
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,430
and the approval was a great relief.

916
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,730
It was very important for us to know.

917
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:28,890
Well, but, but to, to tell the, the truth, uh, of course, in 1972 through 74,

918
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:32,850
the, uh, we, we had, there were abuses.

919
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:38,010
There were abuses with the seminars, the subgenius motivational training seminars.

920
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,850
There, I will admit that in certain, uh, local...

921
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:45,810
I'm afraid there's been a lot of abuse, uh, just tonight for as near as I can tell.

922
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:51,890
...every single, uh, seminar that goes out there, every little Bobby and Connie Ike that, uh...

923
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:56,370
Thrilled to the animated senators in the seventh seminar of Zimbabwe.

924
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,210
See the battle with ten million scrapers.

925
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:01,850
See Menfolk State.

926
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,150
See the

927
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:22,310
And this is the news.

928
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:25,970
In the expected confidence...

929
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,370
The show ends and the show begins.

930
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:31,250
Above all, we want you to...

931
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,250
We want you to...

932
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,050
Never forget...

933
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:33,790
To...

934
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:34,230
Be satisfied...

935
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,350
The terrible waste of lives that you've spent...

936
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:38,490
We are willing...

937
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,270
The collective years of listening to this rotten show...

938
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:42,510
Anything...

939
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,290
Yes, and you don't even get it.

940
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:44,590
...in our power...

941
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:45,870
To...

942
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:46,610
To...

943
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:47,070
To...

944
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:47,750
To...

945
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:48,110
To...

946
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:50,770
On a friendly basis.

947
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:51,790
...to...

948
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:54,330
To...

949
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:56,750
To...

950
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,790
To...

951
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,210
To...

952
00:47:59,210 --> 00:47:59,290
To...

953
00:47:59,290 --> 00:47:59,330
To...

954
00:47:59,330 --> 00:47:59,370
To...

955
00:47:59,370 --> 00:47:59,410
To...

956
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:01,910
to...

957
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,590
sunk in the DAG big time.

958
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:04,630
Forget it, mysteries.

959
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:04,630


960
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:04,650
We're now dedicated to...

961
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:04,650


962
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:04,650


963
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:11,170
Now, we're, uh, heading into the sexual or gonaddial area of the Doug Smith brain.

964
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,610
Model, Person, Association

965
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:13,610


966
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:13,950
competitive

967
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,110
Now, it's off in the flesh...

968
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:16,110


969
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:16,110

00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:17,130

Next!

975
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:19,310


976
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:20,810
Next!

982
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,070
saying, hey, hey.

983
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:35,270
Yes, that's all the trigger the Smith brain needs

984
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:38,810
to get an enormous rise.

985
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:40,090
Hey, hey, hey!

986
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:41,970
Can I say something?

987
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:43,870
Can I say something?

988
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,230
Can I say something?

989
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:50,850
This show is our only method of communicating with you Earth people

990
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:54,070
in hopes that in the storm of Babel,

991
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,970
you will understand the basic reality of our method

992
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,330
and apprehend that we are not simply a comedy group

993
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,570
or a humorous exercise,

994
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:06,170
but actually the emissaries of a distant civilization

995
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:09,490
which only wishes to confer its own understanding

996
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:12,550
upon the citizens of your rather backward planet.

997
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:13,930
We thank you for listening.

998
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:16,410
How do they do it?

999
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,950
Well, like this.

1000
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:19,790
Put that in that range.

1001
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,570
Oh, no, not like that.

1002
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:22,150
And like this.

1003
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,730
Ouch, that hurts. No, cut it out.

1004
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:24,450
And like this.

1005
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:25,630
Oh, hey, hey, that.

1006
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:26,590
Yes, you'll see.

1007
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:26,950
I don't know.

1008
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:27,490
I don't understand her question.

1009
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:30,510
Enthroned in glory, trailing clouds of glory

1010
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:34,950
and emitting the sacrosanct decor of heavenly flame.

1011
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:36,690
Like the gods we are.

1012
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,170
Yes, that's our aura.

1013
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,730
What, radio gods?

1014
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,090
Yes, I think so.

1015
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,930
You can relax and enjoy this quality product,

1016
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:51,250
secure in the knowledge that it has been specially created

1017
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:55,250
for the lover of fine things and the man of good taste.

1018
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:56,450
Oh, sorry.

1019
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:57,910
You can edit that out, can't you?

1020
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:58,750
Yeah, no problem.

1021
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,270
Roll up for the mystery tour.

1022
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:07,850
Step it right this way.

1023
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:09,310
La la.

1024
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,870
Roll up for the mystery tour.

1025
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,590
See the light.

1026
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:20,070
I'm not sure you're having it.

1027
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:21,990
Feel the heat.

1028
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,310
We'll be doing bombing in five minutes.

1029
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,270
Who do you want?

1030
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,630
Do you want to pull it down?

1031
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:32,130
Do you want to pull it down?

1032
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:36,150
Do you want to pull it down?

1033
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:36,990
Do you want to pull it down?

1034
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:36,990


1035
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,110
Yes, dear friends.

1036
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,030
Here we're back.

1037
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:40,370
Yes, friends.

1038
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,510
We're back.

1039
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:43,550
That wonderful hour.

1040
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:45,810
Friends, that bad hour.

1041
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,210
That one time hour, friends.

1042
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:49,810
That mysterious hour.

1043
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,450
That poltergeist infested hour.

1044
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,790
Friends, the poltergeist is working tonight.

1045
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:55,650
Yes, he's working.

1046
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:56,050
Because one of these tables.

1047
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:56,290
Because one of these tables.

1048
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:56,710
He's got a double time.

1049
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:56,910
He's got a double time.

1050
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:57,750
He won't turn off.

1051
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,130
Get your finger out of the hole there, Dr. Stang.

1052
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,490
You're liable to hurt your...

1053
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:01,750
You're liable to hurt your...

1054
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:03,390
There you go.

1055
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:04,110
There you go.

1056
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:08,530
Well, let's turn on the dampers and see if we can get the nuclear power plant started

1057
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:09,290
here, doctor.

1058
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:12,230
I'm anxious to take off.

1059
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:12,570
I'm anxious to take off.

1060
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:12,870
Take off.

1061
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:16,270
All ground personnel, clear of bacteria at this time.

1062
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:16,350
Oh, wait a minute.

1063
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,530
Will you get all those guys out of the other side there, please?

1064
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:18,810
Will you get all those guys out of the other side there, please?

1065
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:20,910
What did you do, doctor?

1066
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,310
Central control processor on.

1067
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,570
Their central control is on, doctor.

1068
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:26,730
Good, good.

1069
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,950
Okay, you want to close the watertight doors here?

1070
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:29,830
Yeah.

1071
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,710
Oh, watch out for that squid, man.

1072
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,330
There's a prairie squid right by the door.

1073
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:33,690
Yeah.

1074
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,290
Speaking of which...

1075
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:40,570
And inject some of those collar soles, would you, into the retribution chamber?

1076
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:44,310
Primary and secondary circuit tests commencing now.

1077
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:45,950
Well, we really...

1078
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:45,990
Yes.

1079
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,950
Line two has a prayer request.

1080
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,210
Is that so, friends?

1081
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,230
Well, tell them to pray.

1082
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:53,210
I have to run away from anything because I don't believe in anything.

1083
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:55,550
What direction are you going?

1084
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:55,550


1085
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:55,550


1086
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:55,550


1087
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:55,550


1088
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:55,550


1089
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,030
I'm going to Sicily.

1090
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:58,050
Back the other way.

1091
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,730
Is that where you escaped from?

1092
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:03,330
The devil owes you money, friend.

1093
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:07,490
But Bob Dobbs is the bank where you can cash it in.

1094
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:10,130
We gotta burn out the banks of the devil.

1095
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:15,510
We gotta root him out, burn out the hate, burn out the radiation, burn out the fire.

1096
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:21,110
Standing around acting like you got wires of blood and anybody else but you ain't.

1097
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:23,030
Because I'm the one that has it, not you, me.

1098
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,150
What are you talking about?

1099
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:25,550
I'm the one that has it.

1100
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:26,410
I'm the one that has it.

1101
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,710
But I know things I ain't never learned.

1102
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,210
How I can see signs.

1103
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:35,250
It's something that just happens and I got to do some things sometimes.

1104
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,710
I got to do some things sometimes I don't even want to do.

1105
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,790
And sometimes inside me I can feel it.

1106
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:46,890
I can feel it pulling and tugging at me and pushing and I can feel my blood beating and

1107
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:48,550
I got to do this thing right now.

1108
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,570
It's wise blood.

1109
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,350
Ain't everybody has it.

1110
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,590
See it's a gift.

1111
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:57,090
It's a gift.

1112
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,090
Like a gift for the prophets.

1113
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:00,750
Now I ain't saying I'm a prophet.

1114
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:01,810
No, it ain't like that.

1115
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:02,590
But it's like that.

1116
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:04,750
You're crazy, boy.

1117
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,270
You get away from me and you stay away.

1118
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,450
I'm going where I'm going.

1119
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:11,890
I got a woman.

1120
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,170
I got a woman, see?

1121
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,750
And that's where I'm going, to visit her.

1122
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,390
He thinks if he keeps on insulting you that you'll go away.

1123
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:19,710
Whoa.

1124
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:21,430
Whoa.

1125
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,190
Scary as hell.

1126
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1127
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1128
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1129
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1130
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1131
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1132
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1133
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1134
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1135
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1136
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1137
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1138
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:24,330


1139
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:29,050
This is how I work.

1140
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:30,010
What?

1141
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,810
What the hell are you talking about?

1142
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:47,130
I'm a lot more amazing, right.

1143
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:49,990
Your ass.

1144
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:53,970
Whoa.

1145
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:53,970


1146
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:53,970


1147
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:53,970


1148
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:53,970


1149
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:53,970


1150
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:53,970


1151
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:53,990


1152
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:54,010
Whoa.

1153
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:54,050
Whoa.

1154
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:54,090
Whoa.

1155
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:54,130
Whoa.

1156
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:54,170
Whoa.

1157
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:54,210
Whoa.

1158
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:54,250
Whoa.

1159
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:54,290
Oh.

1160
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,570
Prepare to puke of a pretty paw.

1161
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:07,090
It's time to tune in to the Soak Genius.

1162
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,770
That's what that is.

1163
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,050
Oh, kill the airlock.

1164
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:13,670
Yeah, well.

1165
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:14,570
Okay.

1166
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:15,170
Okay.

1167
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,410
Friends, let me tell you something.

1168
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:21,430
First off, number one, cassette deck two is not working.

1169
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:25,950
And the ports on the starboard side are completely...

1170
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:26,610
That's okay.

1171
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:31,870
We're losing air fast, and we're going to have to try to keep up with it.

1172
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:35,270
Well, I'll open up this big blue cylinder of church air over here, Doctor.

1173
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:36,750
Ah, yes, have a look.

1174
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:40,690
Now I feel considerably better.

1175
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:42,970
Ah, yes.

1176
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:45,250
Now, here's this church air.

1177
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:45,670
Oh, yes.

1178
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,010
Oh, yes.

1179
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:48,090
Praise God.

1180
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:50,030
I feel that church air now.

1181
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:50,790
Yeah.

1182
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,170
Yeah.

1183
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:51,290
Yeah.

1184
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:51,650
Yeah.

1185
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:52,170
Feel it.

1186
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:55,670
Friends, can you feel it out there in the radio audience?

1187
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:56,730
I bet you can.

1188
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:57,550
I bet you can.

1189
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:58,010
Yeah.

1190
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,250
Reach out and feel it, friends.

1191
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:03,650
And if you can't reach down and feel it, then you're going to have...

1192
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:06,970
And then you probably don't even know what a prairie squid is.

1193
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:10,050
You probably don't even care what one tastes like.

1194
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:17,250
So, dear friends, once again, as we saw, we come to the end of this side of the show.

1195
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,370
Once again, you'll have to...

1196
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:20,150
Turn your show over.

1197
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,410
Turn your radio off.

1198
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:21,570
Turn your radio over.

1199
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:23,650
Flip it so that you can hear the rest.

1200
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:26,830
This is KNON 90.9 FM.

1201
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:31,590
The subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

1202
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:36,330
Oh, yeah.

1203
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:42,410
That's right.

1204
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:48,690
You are going to have to flip your entire radio, maybe your whole house over to hear the other

1205
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:49,430
half of the show.

1206
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,150
Next week...

1207
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:53,970
Coming back with the pledge drive special.

1208
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,570
And it will be a pledge drive special.

1209
00:55:55,670 --> 00:56:00,410
Even if you're a jerk that doesn't intend to send any money to the station, you probably

1210
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:01,450
ought to check it out.

1211
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:02,670
It's going to be...

1212
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:08,670
I mean, I sacrificed this show for that one.

1213
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:09,790
Let's put it that way.

1214
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:17,150
Do stay tuned in five, six minutes for American Music Party with Robert Wisdom.

1215
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:21,370
You know, this morning, there was a real interesting...

1216
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,790
I can listen to screaming in the background.

1217
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:26,250
I didn't know it was that bad.

1218
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:36,210
There was quite an interesting story in this morning's paper about can science separate

1219
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:40,930
neurological illusion from divine vision?

1220
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:43,090
Is this background music too loud for you all?

1221
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:43,510
Can you...

1222
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:43,750
Is it?

1223
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,230
I don't hear anybody complaining, so I'll just keep going.

1224
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,370
It says here that brainwaves...

1225
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:56,890
Brainwaves have indicated that ordinary people routinely fall into altered states of consciousness

1226
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:58,990
similar to mystical experiences.

1227
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:03,010
Now, most subgeniuses would not have to have a scientist tell them that.

1228
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,090
That's sort of the...

1229
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:09,770
I mean, they're born high, you might say, and it's only the conspiracy that brings them

1230
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:10,090
down.

1231
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,830
It also...

1232
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:16,350
They found that near-death experiences, you know, where you go through the tunnel of the

1233
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:20,730
birth canal into the blinding light of your new afterlife.

1234
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:21,590
And so forth.

1235
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:30,950
These all have been found to resemble drug-induced hallucinations, suggesting that the two states

1236
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,650
may have a common cause.

1237
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:38,470
Now, what's interesting in this thing is that it says 5% of Americans claim to have had

1238
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:44,730
a religious experience so powerful that they literally felt bathed in light like the Apostle

1239
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:44,970
Paul.

1240
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:49,990
But that's probably like 95% of subgeniuses.

1241
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,170
Now, of course, it's not always because of contact with Bob.

1242
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:58,790
It may just be because they, you know, put their finger in a light socket or something

1243
00:57:58,790 --> 00:57:59,330
like that.

1244
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:04,470
The same poll indicates that 42% of adult Americans claim to have had some form of,

1245
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:11,090
quote, contact, unquote, with souls of the dear departed, and 29% have had visions.

1246
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:19,470
And 75% of Americans believe in life after death, and 68% believe the afterlife is a

1247
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:19,910
paradise.

1248
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,170
Now, suckers!

1249
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:29,490
I mean, there are many afterlives, but they ain't gonna be paradises, friends, unless

1250
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:34,650
you donate that $20 to K&ON next week on the pledge drive.

1251
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:35,850
And that's what it's all about.

1252
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:40,290
That's what your life has been lived for up to this, up to next week.

1253
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:48,430
So, uh, skeptics have been puzzled by the power of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas.

1254
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:49,990
So...

1255
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:50,590
Ha ha ha!

1256
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:53,450
To induce mystical-like feelings.

1257
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:58,990
For example, the sense that one perceives truths too strange to express in words.

1258
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:01,710
Now, uh, uh, dot, dot, dot.

1259
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:03,690
Huh.

1260
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:11,170
That, that, I know of, I know of some, some subgenius, uh, these, these head-bashing

1261
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:13,470
parties where people would tell you the same thing.

1262
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:20,310
So it's a thin, thin line between, uh, religion and a, and a dangerous party, you know?

1263
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:21,170
Ha ha ha!

1264
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:25,230
We'll, we'll continue with that one, uh, next week, I think.

1265
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:29,650
Is that, that's a, it's sort of a frightening, I mean, they're trying to pull the rug out

1266
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:30,870
from under Bob, see, friends.

1267
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:33,250
They're trying to make you into atheists, is what they're trying to do.

1268
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:38,410
And, and, uh, that's okay, because you can always start from scratch, and you'll still

1269
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:42,470
come back to that same place, which is B-O-B.

1270
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:46,830
Which, if you turn those letters, write that in small letters, and turn them upside down,

1271
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:50,150
they spell 90, 909.

1272
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:55,890
Or 90.9, which is, which is K-N-O-N 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1273
00:59:56,070 --> 01:00:02,570
So, hang in there for Robert Wisdom's show, and some pretty stuff.

1274
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,290
Bob loves you.

1275
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:07,190
Bob loves you.

1276
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:10,530
Bob, Bob, Bob loves you, friend.

1277
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:16,790
And, and, you know, if you could just let go of those hang-ups that have kept you, that

1278
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:19,590
have, that have kept you tied down.

1279
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:20,950
Friends, you could just.

1280
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:25,250
Shackled by your own insecurities, was they might say, Reverend Stang, you know.

1281
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:28,230
Your ignorance, your pathetic ignorance.

1282
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,430
Your pathetic, pink ignorance is what it is.

1283
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:31,790
Yeah.

1284
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:36,830
Your ignorance of the subgenius P.O. box number, which we were about to forget to give.

1285
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:38,410
Oh, can we do that?

1286
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:39,350
You bet we can.

1287
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:40,050
We have to.

1288
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:41,250
Oh, well, in that case.

1289
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,830
Bob said we had to party.

1290
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,490
Yes, well, that box number.

1291
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:47,170
Why are you sitting there, listening to this radio show?

1292
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:48,730
Why aren't you out partying?

1293
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:49,570
Why aren't you?

1294
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:50,030
Bob said.

1295
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:50,650
You had to party.

1296
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:51,430
Party.

1297
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:52,010
Party.

1298
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:54,430
Bob said you had to party.

1299
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:55,830
Yeah, I had to party.

1300
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:56,690
You better party.

1301
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:59,230
You didn't say you might if you felt like it.

1302
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:00,430
Yes, indeed, friend.

1303
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:01,090
You said to get out there.

1304
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:01,730
Where's that right?

1305
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:02,550
Where's that dirt?

1306
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:03,870
Where's that party gun?

1307
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:05,910
We want Bob says to get out there and do it.

1308
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:07,150
Bob?

1309
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,590
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1310
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:15,590
It's time to open your heart, unzip your pants, close your mind, and bend over, because you're

1311
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:18,670
about to receive the word of Bob.

1312
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,070
Bob.

1313
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:24,090
Bob wisdom, that is.

1314
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:27,890
In answer to your second question, can Bob give you a job?

1315
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:33,430
First, well, why don't you go and just stand there like a damn nickel slug, or you gonna

1316
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:36,770
plus your plimper and righteous hargany, P-boy?

1317
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:40,590
Got weeny rivers and your fluter tubes, don't you?

1318
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:47,450
Join gumption's with the true and the seed brave, and pee for Bob, man, and send your

1319
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:47,830
jeans.

1320
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:55,170
Buy out the gland owners with what you earned with your skinny, peeling face of pain.
