00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello, mother. Hello, father. Here I am at the self-genius power of swag. Very entertaining.

2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,800
Let's go, girls.

3
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,200
I feel like a man. I feel like a man.

4
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,200
I feel like a man.

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,100
Thank Brother Dick. Use him. Use him.

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,620
We're going to hear now from Brother Bob.

7
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,080
I can't wait, Brother Bob. Brother Bob.

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,620
Bob.

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,720
Okay.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There we go. There we go.

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,980
We still watch the Muppet Show.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,360
Bob.

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,800
Snorting cocaine.

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,680
What was I thinking?

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,120
Smack me upside the head, because I need that.

16
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,140
Lust after.

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,580
Uh.

18
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,980
Terror. Terror.

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,560
Facial circumcision thing.

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,840
I met Joy online.

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,160
Um. Um.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,760
Ah. Um.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,920
Oh, man.

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,140
But. But.

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,840
Bob, I knew you'd be here.

26
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,220
And.

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,400
Pigman.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,140
Truth is fiction.

29
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,440
And this is Be Born It, Be Not.

30
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,680
If you have a sweet tooth that's hard to satisfy, you can be happy.

31
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,820
There's a pound of sugar.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,060
And a pound of sugar costs as much as solid gold toes.

33
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,640
They are at Le-not.

34
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,080
Oh.

35
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,800
Ah!

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,040
Thomas Schweiker of Swebisch Hall, Germany,

37
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,880
paid the equivalent of $250,000 for a single gangrenous chicken.

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,420
They are at Le-not.

39
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,680
In a moment I'll tell you about the man who paid a fortune for a solid gold chicken.

40
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:14,620
Sultan Malik-dain Jemal Najd Salih al-Ghazi-youb ruled Egypt from 1240 to 1249.

41
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,800
The monarch incurred the hatred of his wife, who decided to lick her husband.

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,660
and sanguineous sore with some highly corrosive substance.

43
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,700
Forty-eight hours later, he excelled in beautiful penmanship

44
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,860
in his purifying pit of fire.

45
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,440
Beloved, Lienot.

46
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,600
In a moment, I'll tell you about the single letter of the alphabet.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,300
A.

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,840
Two A's instead of the usual one A.

49
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,920
A. A.

50
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,580
Beloved, Lienot.

51
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,480
A. A.

52
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,440
Real estate, antiques, livestock, equipment, or estates.

53
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,360
Real estate, antiques, livestock, equipment, or estates.

54
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,980
There is an unlimited future concept.

55
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,640
No little or nothing.

56
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,120
No little or nothing.

57
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,220
Armed with a knowledge in your wrist.

58
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,200
The third alternative.

59
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,680
Potent picked many people.

60
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,500
Another phallus.

61
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,320
Another phallus.

62
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,140
Another phallus.

63
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,780
Another phallus.

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:18,880
Another phallus.

65
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,360
We have proven conclusively that in many instances.

66
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:22,880
A.

67
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,420
B.

68
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:23,760
C.

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,200
D.

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,720
E.

71
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,340
Stimulate.

72
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:25,620
F.

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:25,960
G.

74
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,240
G.

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,820
There is nothing.

76
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,320
There is nothing.

77
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,820
There is nothing.

78
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,440
There is nothing.

79
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,120
Nothing is left.

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,080
Nothing is left.

81
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,700
Nothing is.

82
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,220
Nothing is.

83
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,720
Nothing is.

84
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,140
Nothing is.

85
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,300
Time is of the S.

86
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,440
Time is of the S.

87
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,820
Now, in a state of hysteria, what do you do?

88
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,460
Real estate, antiques, livestock, equipment, or estates.

89
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,400
Real estate, antiques, livestock, equipment, or estates.

90
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:45,660
Illness.

91
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,280
What do you do?

92
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,260
Highly desirable.

93
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:47,880
Illness.

94
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,520
Let us forget.

95
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,080
For a moment.

96
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,140
Highly desirable.

97
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,880
Let us forget.

98
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,620
Let us forget.

99
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,540
Let us forget.

100
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,120
For a moment.

101
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,900
Let us forget.

102
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,620
Let us forget.

103
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,180
Now, in a state of hysteria.

104
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,460
As a subject of one of those experiments, I do see the connection there.

105
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,380
But, on another level, I don't see very many.

106
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,680
And Stang and I were talking about this just shortly on the way back.

107
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,860
About how the insane.

108
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,420
Well, I hate to vilify the man that we see.

109
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,540
But, certain people.

110
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:18,900
The insane.

111
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,220
The differently sane.

112
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,660
How the differently sane can compellingly, as many leaders do, who get money for doing this,

113
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,300
connect a bunch of dots that aren't even really within their path.

114
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,160
Anywhere near each other, yeah.

115
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,920
Yeah, right.

116
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,800
That aren't even maybe dots, too.

117
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,800
That's the one thing I envy in the truly mad.

118
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,560
Yeah.

119
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,300
And imagine if you had your facts in front of you.

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,960
You could probably conquer all the rest of the monkeys quite easily.

121
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,120
They'd all be, you know, carrying fruit and fish.

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,100
Were you?

123
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,100
Yes, my little monkeys.

124
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,300
I am your master now.

125
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,200
Hey, everybody, I want to let you know that, of course.

126
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,620
I've got care of you.

127
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,860
There's a force.

128
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,340
There's a force.

129
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,140
ATF.

130
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,760
FBI.

131
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,100
Good weapons.

132
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,780
Parents around the globe are learning how to drug their kids.

133
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,560
Roger that.

134
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,900
DrugYourKids.com.

135
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,260
That's DrugYourKids.com.

136
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,480
Stop.

137
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:18,680
Stop.

138
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,020
Stop.

139
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,220
Stop.

140
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:19,560
Stop.

141
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:19,760
Stop.

142
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:19,920
Stop.

143
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,720
The fun values.

144
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,960
Way back.

145
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,840
Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.

146
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,280
It did kind of grab me for the next few minutes, so.

147
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,340
I enjoyed it.

148
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,000
He is receiving, and we love you.

149
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,760
Dare to discipline.

150
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,080
It's a pleasure to attack all levels.

151
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,720
I believe in authority.

152
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,100
With an iron fist, slap across the child's mouth.

153
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,960
Slap across the child's butt.

154
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll mock authority.

155
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,080
Laugh at authority.

156
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,620
In your process of discipline on animals, and I was fascinated.

157
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,360
Yeah, yeah.

158
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,000
And that mother just growled.

159
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

160
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

161
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,900
I was fascinated.

162
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,140
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

163
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,160
branches

164
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

165
00:05:59,620 --> 00:05:59,900
Ha, ha.

166
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,180
Laugh at authority.

167
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,960
Oh, molding it.

168
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,080
Building in your values.

169
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,120
Oh, every mother.

170
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,080
No, it bothers me.

171
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,320
Every woman is being cheated and exploited and short-changed.

172
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,840
I, I, no family here.

173
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,480
Not an awful lot of friends.

174
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,860
Day in and day out.

175
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,500
Lonely.

176
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,840
Day in and day out.

177
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,960
With what is happening in your own career, is there something fresh and new coming?

178
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,460
Fisted.

injured yourself be a victim of homemade first-aid method immediately whoops whoops get acquainted

188
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,680
with your chair oh what's this no no no what's this oh go barging into

189
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:15,940
dark

190
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,120
closets ah defective electric defective electric put the strain on your back now that's pretty

191
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,140
sorry you have to take a beating like this persons are killed or injured every year by persons are

192
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:32,300
killed or injured every year by many of the recent genital wart outbreaks there are crystals or

193
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,860
diodes perhaps i don't know some sort of transmission resection devices in these various

194
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:45,260
genital warts so there you go for the cybernetic advancements and that's how it's passed and little

195
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,800
do they know

196
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,180
that as of right now broadcasting from high atop the concrete tower i know some colleges are supposed

197
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,740
to have ivory towers but this is csu we have a concrete tower the antenna on top our tower is

198
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:03,040
spreading mind control rays across across northeast ohio and right now i'm at the controls

199
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,080
i'm going to make my little monkeys dance with these mind control rays coming from the uh the

200
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,100
transmitter as a matter of fact you know a lot of people a lot of people think that a tinfoil hat

201
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,480
will keep them safe ha ha ha

202
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,440
tinfoil hats don't work anymore we changed the frequency years ago now the tinfoil hats will only

203
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:27,060
amplify the signal those of you who are in the know know exactly what you're going to put on your

204
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,880
head to keep yourself safe and you have to make sure you buy a few sizes bigger because as your

205
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,660
expands your head swells and your ears get bigger and push out the sides of the tinfoil which is

206
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,500
you know apparently such an archaic usage why don't they call them aluminum foil hats but yeah

207
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,560
it's not really tin

208
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:52,100
i mean it was perhaps in 1937 or something right i don't know i don't know whenever they had tin cans

209
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,880
but they haven't had that stuff for i think many years as far as you know i can wreck on

210
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,540
so um you know the whole thing might be a hoax it just sounds better to some neocon

211
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,340
oh now i'm getting all yeah never mind you know you know what kind of con we're talking about here

212
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:16,000
it ain't the kind of con they talk yeah the big con the scam of scams conspiracy that is not a scam

213
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:23,640
not even self-aware is so vastly huge and disparate and but somebody's making out on it

214
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,140
i am

215
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,040
stop it

216
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,420
stop it

217
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:40,420


218
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:40,640

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000


228
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000


229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000


230
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,520

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


237
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


238
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


239
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


240
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


241
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


242
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


243
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


244
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


245
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


246
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


247
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


248
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


249
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


250
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


251
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


252
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


253
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


254
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


255
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


256
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


257
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


258
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


259
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


260
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


261
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


262
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


263
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


264
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


265
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


266
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


267
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,920


268
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,160
come in

269
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,700
i can't help being anxious i devote my time to science

270
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,320
a stroke of luck

271
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,140
you're mad

272
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,360
the hermit will tell you before the night is done

273
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,800
you

274
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,320
you maybe didn't think pink Parlton

275
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,640
not just one

276
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:35,680
you probably will you

277
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,420
hurry stop

278
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,420


279
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,420


280
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,900
oh look so smooth

281
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,280
to girl

282
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,860
How very convenient.

283
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,380
Now she's coming for me.

284
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,680
We're seeing something not of this world.

285
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,980
In 1973, Michael went on a date blind.

286
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Michael was molested by the Christian God.

287
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,420
And we started dating.

288
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,120
I began beating him.

289
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,660
I was pushing him down to make him look small so I could look big.

290
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,700
That's what I would do.

291
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,920
Beating, you know, making myself feel good beating a child.

292
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,140
And I get down on my knees in my bedroom.

293
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,820
Well, I've been living a lie all my life.

294
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,280
And puking, puking.

295
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,800
And the hardest thing was, I got all done.

296
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,120
I like the new development in business and small.

297
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,080
Business ownership are these tinfoil hat roller blade places.

298
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,220
Where you can just go and skate to your heart's content with any size hat.

299
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,460
Without, you know, worrying about your ears getting too big.

300
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,860
And you just take on whatever signals they're playing.

301
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,760
But you can also pick up signals from way, way, way beyond that.

302
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,140
So, and pretty much it's everyone skates something night.

303
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,420
And I hope it continues.

304
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,780
Or at least stops.

305
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,020
Yeah, there's a Cleveland Roller Derby team now.

306
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,300
That's awesome.

307
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,260
I love roller derbying.

308
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,540
I love roller derbying.

309
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,240
And think of the earmuffs, man.

310
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:17,720
You can take all that aluminum wire stuff that pops out of computers after you've kicked them three or four times.

311
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,360
And put that in there.

312
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,000
And you've got an insulating vehicle that will probably get 30, 40 miles to a gallon.

313
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,700
I think.

314
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,720
What do you think, Doc?

315
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,820
He may be on to something.

316
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,840
I don't know.

317
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,920
It's like nook science.

318
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,260
You know, it doesn't always have to.

319
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,800
It doesn't always have to work immediately.

320
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:46,180
Sometimes, you know, you can take a little thread out of time and, you know, wind up back where you were before.

321
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,080
Hopefully.

322
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,240
Yeah.

323
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,860
Yeah.

324
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,840
I'm sorry.

325
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,840
How big is it?

326
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,640
How big is it?

327
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,060
It's big.

328
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,560
We're in visual range.

329
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,040
Put it up.

330
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,180
Look familiar?

331
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,820
No response, sir.

332
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,060
What the hell is that?

333
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,340
Weapons aren't charging, sir.

334
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,340
Torpedoes.

335
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:07,980
Go ahead.

336
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,740
Go ahead.

337
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,540
They can't penetrate their hull.

338
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,540
Hold it there.

339
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,540
Tilt up about 30 degrees.

340
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,720
Get closer.

341
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,720
Captain.

342
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,280
Look at this.

343
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,740
Look at that.

344
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,640
Who modified the atmosphere?

345
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,120
Trip.

346
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,820
It sounds like you were dreaming.

347
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,660
Take another trip.

348
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,400
It's like we're in the belly of the beast.

349
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,780
You see any stars?

350
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,600
Go ahead.

351
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,220
Yes, it's all very good.

352
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,600
You eat food.

353
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,080
Open your mind to new possibilities.

354
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,180
Just curious.

355
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,820
One of those beings appeared in sickbay a few minutes ago.

356
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,080
It entered me.

357
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,880
Would you mind taking off your clothing?

358
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,360
I'd like to learn more about your anatomy.

359
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,260
If we are to engage in mating, it would be easier if you disrobed.

360
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,140
Go ahead.

361
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,740
What is it like being a female?

362
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,240
Is it much different?

363
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,320
Humans don't like doing things without their consent.

364
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,760
Quickly, please.

365
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,440
Tuck her out.

366
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,220
Tuck her out.

367
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,020
Something wrong?

368
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,440
Did you have any luck priming the pumps?

369
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,760
Find out who's acting strange and have them confined to their quarters.

370
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,480
Start working on a way to figure out who's themselves and who's not.

371
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,240
Go ahead, sir.

372
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,340
I'm a little short.

373
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,060
I'm a little short.

374
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,940
No problem, sir.

375
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,780
I'm on it.

376
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,120
Why?

377
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,240
Trip.

378
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,780
I don't know how to repair the damage.

379
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,500
Your neural pathways are hyper-stimulated.

380
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,780
Everything will be all right.

381
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,440
We don't have time for this.

382
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,180
I'll guide you.

383
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,360
It's not coming off.

384
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,040
It'll come off.

385
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,340
You just need to use a little muscle.

386
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,920
Try using your foot.

387
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,500
Just use your own words.

388
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,640
Just use your own words.

389
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,980
I want to simply ask a question.

390
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,480
I don't understand.

391
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,580
What can I help you with?

392
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,800
Just use your own words.

393
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,400
What can I do?

394
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,100
I don't understand.

395
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,860
Damage information.

396
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,320
Just use your own words.

397
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,560
Repeat.

398
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,320
Just use your own words.

399
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,000
Weep weep weep weep.

400
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,620
What can I do?

401
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,120
Damage information.

402
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:42,860
Damage.

403
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,040
Repeat.

404
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,780
Say repeat to reach repeat.

405
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,860
Say repeat.

406
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,160
Just use your own words.

407
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,660
I don't understand.

408
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,220
I don't know.

409
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,520
Repeat.

410
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,180
Just use your own words.

411
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,760
I need some help.

412
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,660
You can say things like,

413
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,380
I want to get my

414
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,400
Just use your own words.

415
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,180
I need some help.

416
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,660
I don't understand.

417
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Just use your own words.

418
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,480
Damaged issues.

419
00:14:59,620 --> 00:14:59,920
Repeat.

420
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,040
Just use your own words.

421
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,900
Just use your own words.

422
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,640
I don't understand.

423
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,360
I don't know.

424
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,960
Lost, stolen, and damaged.

425
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,420
Lost, stolen, and damaged.

426
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:06,760
Repeat.

427
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,280
Repeat.

428
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,340
You know a girl from the city gave a knife?

429
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:09,740
Yeah.

430
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,300
I think they might have had fun.

431
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,240
You bet they did.

432
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,800
Oh, you mean they had to have some sort of sword down there.

433
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,800
I can't wait to look at this.

434
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,100
Well, there's no doubt about what it is.

435
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:18,960
More.

436
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,720
Syphilis.

437
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,400
More.

438
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,340
Syphilis.

439
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:22,800
More.

440
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,760
Syphilis.

441
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,160
More.

442
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,280
Syphilis.

443
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:25,960
More.

444
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,300
Sexual intercourse with an infected person.

445
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,800
You've probably got what we call sexual organs.

446
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,820
Destroy your brain.

447
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,660
I told you.

448
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,260
There was this one girl over in the city.

449
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,020
More.

450
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:48,860
Syphilis.

451
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,760
Syphilis.

452
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,340
From PR News in Washington, I'm making a comeback.

453
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,200
According to a police source, it was one of the bloodiest in recent weeks.

454
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,680
A Kentucky State Police dispatcher burst into flames,

455
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,020
prompting local authorities to close PR's reports.

456
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,240
The incident was a result of a police investigation.

457
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,020
The Israeli Daily Haret reports that a Syrian foreign ministry official called the report

458
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,340
absolutely baseless.

459
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,540
Police also said PR's bad.

460
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,020
On Wall Street 7-12-5-6-4-5-5-0-7.

461
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,420
This is PR News.

462
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,700
PR News.

463
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,420
PR News.

464
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,200
PR News.

465
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,740
Agriculture officials in California are still assessing the damage from several nights of

466
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,880
PR's sub-reports.

467
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,920
PR warnings remain in effect in the Central Valley.

468
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,120
Other officials say it's commonplace to infiltrate PR News.

469
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,220
In Washington.

470
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,840
The President's office said he was aware of the

471
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:39,840


472
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:39,840


473
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,400
He said, oh yeah, I've heard those subgenius defibles are pretty bad.

474
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,260
I've heard you go ahead and go to one of those.

475
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,360
Some nice girl will probably dose you with ecstasy.

476
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,500
I had to say, yes!

477
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,980
If you attend Texas Day, some nice girl might dose you with ecstasy!

478
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,760
It was an advertising slogan for us and for him it was an accusation.

479
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,360
Yeah, promises, promises.

480
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,220
I haven't seen a single person who says that.

481
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,220


482
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,220


483
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,220


484
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,220


485
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,100
And I'm not a nice girl again.

486
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,540
Well what's the use of being a witch if you don't use witchcraft, huh?

487
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,660
What use indeed, friends.

488
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,200
And this show has much by Norellcraft.

489
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,460
It's a very Norellian show for this is Hour of Slack number 1096.

490
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,580
Designed to drive you completely out of your mind.

491
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,200
Because it's the text day to the hour.

492
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,200


493
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,900
Tinfoil hat special.

494
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,580
We've had kind of a week of kooks on alt.slack, the subgenius forum.

495
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:52,220
And plus that crazy shooter, Cho-what's-his-name, just gives crazed armed mass murdering loners

496
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,960
a bad name.

497
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,420
Somebody on alt.slack said, anyway!

498
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,120
Anyway, friends, we have much that is Norellian and some recordings of a recent synesthesia

499
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,180
show from WCSB Cleveland with host Dr. Sinister and Lonesome Cowboy Dave discussing tinfoil

500
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,760
headwear.

501
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,920
And also, more previews of text day 2005, which is happening again in 2007.

502
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,860
In Texas, of course.

503
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,320
Yes, yes indeed, another subgenius festival at another clothing and sanity optional campground.

504
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,380
This time near Austin, which is where I'll be by the time anybody hears this.

505
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,360
Unless it's before May 5th.

506
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:36,380
In fact, here we hear the host of text day, Loke E. Coyote, on stage singing about Jesus.

507
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,520
Well, Jesus said, Mary, do you think we're compatible?

508
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,980
And they say, Pardes, you're a potty animal.

509
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,000
She was talking in tongues and she dug his technique.

510
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,500
He was a bearded, rubbing sandal wearing longer-pigging freak.

511
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,760
And he was a little bit of a

512
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:30,100
You're own chocolate Jesus Someone to melt in your mouth

513
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:37,180

And you can get more of him at norelpref.com.

534
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,160
And now back to Text Day.

535
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,140
Actually, the Text Day soundtrack with the great, groovy Neptune.

536
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,700
Text Day.

537
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,160
How come we doing this?

538
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,080
This is making me feel like I'm on drugs.

539
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,420
Mixed effective being on drugs.

540
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,940
You know what I'm saying?

541
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,900
And I am prepared to do drugs.

542
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,580
Right now, I'm hungry and I want to eat a plate.

543
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,460
Find me a brothel.

544
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,460
Have you got any smack?

545
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,500
Smack?

546
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,040
Horse.

547
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,260
Quick, push sky.

548
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,440
Skag, snuff, top crack.

549
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,760
Metadol, mandatory.

550
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,940
Pinkies, sad ass.

551
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,540
Monty Glory, nutmeg, blueberries, aspirin, egg ups, paracetamol.

552
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,860
Fixed my problem.

553
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,480
I am prepared for the work ahead.

554
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,140
Because I want drugs and alcohol.

555
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,780
Because I want another shot.

556
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,060
Because I want to party tonight.

557
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,460
My generation tested limits.

558
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,180
The last time we were this high.

559
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,200
We lost our way.

560
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,240
Fatality.

561
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:50,620
People.

562
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,080
Lifelong miseries and limitations of a chronic bad back.

563
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,080
Chronic, chronic.

564
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,560
The feet simply slide out from under.

565
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,900
Crashing down.

566
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,120
Slimy, oily, greasy material.

567
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,600
Balance is a critical factor.

568
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,460
Chronic.

569
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,020
Always involved.

570
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,540
Involves the possibility of tripping.

571
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,100
Vision is blocked.

572
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,200
Vulnerable position means a fall for sure.

573
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,120
Tripping, slipping, tripping.

574
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,680
Jump down, jump down, jump, jump.

575
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,380
Short cut, short cut.

576
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,100
Moving backwards.

577
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,300
They can produce heart stopping scares when they move just slightly.

578
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,280
When they move enough.

579
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,480
Pushing can lead to a painful fall.

580
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,700
Not many people are affected by it.

581
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,060
It always takes two hands.

582
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,020
Go up or down.

583
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,860
Go up or down.

584
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,760
Always remembered.

585
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,880
And a member that always hurts.

586
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,340
Be memorable.

587
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,400
No one.

588
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,640
No one.

589
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,060
Webb.

590
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,140
Best ever conquering.

591
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,140


592
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,140


593
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,140


594
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,140


595
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,040
The war.

596
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,280
The war.

597
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,640
The war.

598
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,500
I'm going to make.

599
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,080
The war.

600
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,360
The war.

601
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,000
The war.

602
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,440
The war.

603
00:24:59,600 --> 00:24:59,980
The war.

604
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,800
The war.

605
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,200
The war.

606
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,320
The war.

607
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,320


608
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,940
The war.

609
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,020
You feel like you're on drugs.

610
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,000
Just it mimics the effect of being on psychedelic drugs.

611
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,900
Maybe I am on psychedelic drugs.

612
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,540
Really?

613
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,040
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind,

614
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,160
if I listen to it once, like, gliders,

615
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,000
they're way to heaven.

616
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,280
Like, I just heard it.

617
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,700
I wake up worshiping the devil.

618
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,140
And it's true, listen.

619
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,840
I've got another bungalow for you.

620
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,280
Smoke that one up, dang.

621
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,760
Tag one for me.

622
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,920
What makes a man get high?

623
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,800
As red as an apple in his eye.

624
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,660
What makes his mouth turn dry?

625
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,120
Who's the black guy?

626
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,560
What's his name?

627
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,040
It was the marijuana.

628
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,200
Hookah, lookah, dinkity-doo.

629
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,260
Smoke up that load and have one for you.

630
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,180
Hookah, lookah, dinkity-doo-tee.

631
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,240
Then clear that one out and pack one for me.

632
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,720
But you think I'm a vlogger?

633
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,360
Playin' your cell?

634
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,540
But it sounded like-

635
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,200
I'd shoot him.

636
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,340
You're getting morbid.

637
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,940
Well, yes.

638
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,520
Well, yes.

639
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,220
Enormous styling.

640
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,040
I'm so excited.

641
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,680
Idiotic.

642
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,040
I, I'd, I'd, I, oh, oh, I wouldn't do that.

643
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,700
Good night.

644
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,660
Do you live around here?

645
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,960
Psychic consultant.

646
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:49,640
Oh.

647
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,320
Oh well.

648
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:50,860
Ssh.

649
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,480
Ssh.

650
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:51,880
Ssh.

651
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:51,920
Ssh.

652
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,260
Ssh.

653
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,000
You like the night?

654
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,760
Logical.

655
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,520
Yes.

656
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,400
Logical.

657
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,340
Yes.

658
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,440
How?

659
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,320
I can't tell you how I know these things, but it hardly matters, does it?

660
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,120
Om, om.

661
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,160
I've been trapped.

662
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,100
Right, right, right.

663
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,560
Darling, what's the matter?

664
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,200
That music.

665
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,200
Oh.

666
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,760
You know how hard it is.

667
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,400
Well.

668
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,700
Martin, it's lovely.

669
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,820
I think I was losing my mind.

670
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,800
Baby, baby.

671
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,900
His presence is so strong.

672
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,640
Let your mind be free and receptive.

673
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,240
I used to be a magician.

674
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,200
That's how I got into this racket.

675
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,800
They look in their crystals and see you coming.

676
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:41,760
Yes.

677
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,640
I mean, no.

678
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,780
I can feel your vibrations much more clearly now.

679
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,760
Are you excited?

680
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,900
No, no.

681
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,440
In many ways, you are more mature than she.

682
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,200
Darling.

683
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,740
Does this feel uncomfortable to you?

684
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,820
I, I, I think I'll have a cigarette.

685
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,360
May I?

686
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:56,920
Hmm.

687
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,580
No.

688
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,360
Do with this as you think best.

689
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,300
I trust you.

690
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,780
You know, somebody ought to do something about this high cost of living.

691
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,720
Fascinating.

692
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,440
Tie my hands behind my back.

693
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,200
Very tightly.

694
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:08,540
Thank you.

695
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,860
Now lock the cabinet.

696
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,160
Cock be logical.

697
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,280
Cock be logical.

698
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,600
Paul was dead, so.

699
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,940
Yes, I suppose it is strange.

700
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,320
Okay, let's go.

701
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,000
Sounds dangerously like work.

702
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,900
Baby, baby.

703
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,740
I live by it.

704
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,300
Feeding people's desire to escape the present.

705
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:35,580
I would like to remind you one and all that we have such a thing called the First Amendment.

706
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,480
First Amendment.

707
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,340
First Amendment.

708
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,360
First Amendment.

709
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,680
Freedom of speech.

710
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,700
Freedom of speech.

711
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,440
That means that freedom of speech does not mean freedom from speech.

712
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,800
Freedom of speech.

713
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,740
Freedom of speech.

714
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:53,760
Freedom of speech.

715
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:53,760


716
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:53,760


717
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:53,760


718
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:53,760


719
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,920
I am free to say what you want, no matter how stupid it is, my friends.

720
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,160
No matter how stupid it is, you can say it because you are free to stick your foot in

721
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,200
your mouth or any other part of your body for all I care.

722
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:14,640
Yes, you are free because you live in the great United States of America where we are

723
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:14,980
free.

724
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,360
Or so they would have you believe.

725
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,380
You're free.

726
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,420
You're free to do the Khan's bidding.

727
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,100
That's right.

728
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,720
But you're free to do the American's bidding.

729
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:23,720


730
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:23,720


731
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,640
You're free to line up at the bus stop.

732
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,560
You are free to go and cash your hard-earned check.

733
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,460
Maybe you even have free checking.

734
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,980
It's not going to save you.

735
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,540
Are you really free?

736
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,740
Are you free unless you can say what you want to say?

737
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,320
I'll tell you what I want to say.

738
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,180
I think the Bill of Rights is a beautiful thing, but they were missing one.

739
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,940
There.

740
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,060
Yeah.

741
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,320
They were missing one amendment in the first ten Bill of Rights,

742
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,960
and that is the freedom to do whatever you want with your body.

743
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:14,440
Last month, I e-filed the Subgenius Foundation Incorporated corporate taxes

744
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,400
to the good state of Ohio just on time.

745
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,140
Guys.

746
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,060
We're doing our part to make Ohio great.

747
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,220
Excellent.

748
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,440
Hey, shout out to all of you.

749
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:24,640
Shout out to all of you.

750
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,600
Princess Wee just handed me this piece of paper that says

751
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:34,380
military spends $520 billion, and that's where our income taxes are going.

752
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,120
How about that?

753
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,640
That's even bigger than it used to be.

754
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,680
The next biggest category of spending by the government is transportation,

755
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:47,080
which is $69 billion, as opposed to $520 billion.

756
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,120
What do they spend on Social Security and Medicare?

757
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,020
And agricultural subsidies.

758
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,720
I thought those were all in the $100 billion close range.

759
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,040
Let's see.

760
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,580
Actually, agriculture, $6 billion.

761
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,280
Really?

762
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,360
Social Security, $10 billion.

763
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,200
General Government, $16 billion.

764
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Yeah, but it's not even close to the $100 billion.

765
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,320
That's different than it used to be just a couple years ago.

766
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,800
What is that, like $100,000?

767
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,720
Does that military spending include Iraq?

768
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,680
No, actually, that does not include supplements to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

769
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,300
Afghanistan.

770
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,180
Foreign military aid?

771
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,860
It does not include.

772
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,060
Non-Department of Defense military spending?

773
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,840
If you add all those things up, it totals $1.1 trillion.

774
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,100
Yes.

775
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,440
About 50% of your 2006 income tax dollars.

776
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,280
Beautiful.

777
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,960
How much is going in that?

778
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,300
Education gets $61 billion.

779
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,860
And considering, okay.

780
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,260
How much goes in that?

781
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,880
I've got to say this because my husband is active duty military.

782
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,060
Okay.

783
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,300
Okay.

784
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,300


785
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,300


786
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,300


787
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,300


788
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,300


789
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,300


790
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,300


791
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:56,480
Majority of what is spent in the military does not go towards.

792
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,040
Towards what you think it would.

793
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:08,940
Does not go towards benefits as far as housing or medical.

794
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,960
I imagine eventually it goes to the CEOs of certain huge corporations.

795
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:16,960
Exactly.

796
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,700
The military, industrial.

797
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,220
Complex.

798
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,100
As President Eisenhower tried vainly to warn us about.

799
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,440
I mean, think about it.

800
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,040
In 1957.

801
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,480
I mean, if you guys heard about what they just found at Walter Reed.

802
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,720
Oh, that's kid stuff.

803
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,720
Peanuts.

804
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,440
It is.

805
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,420
It is.

806
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,140
Compared to the vast amount of waste going on.

807
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,360
Exactly.

808
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:49,080
And that is literally peanuts compared to the waste.

809
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,000
That's.

810
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,480
Well, that's the nature of a giant bureaucracy.

811
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,520
The bigger the bureaucracy, the more bureaucrats.

812
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:01,980
You guys remember the controversy about all the tax money being wasted on studying how

813
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,360
cows pass gas.

814
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,820
Well, I don't think there's any such thing.

815
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,660
You might be happy about that.

816
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:18,940
That was from Dr. Sinister's synesthesia show on WCSB Cleveland, which follows our Slack

817
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,300
on Twitter.

818
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:19,300


819
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,720
We're going to be talking about the WCSB Sunday Night Religious lineup.

820
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:28,060
Speaking of the government and the first president of the U.S., here is Loke E. Coyote

821
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,620
at Tech's Day with a song about George Washington.

822
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,200
First president, he was the nation's daddy.

823
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,760
He fought the British and he liked to roll a patty.

824
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,600
He smoked everybody out at Valley Forge.

825
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,220
Forget about the drug war.

826
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,760
Remember, gone to George.

827
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,900
Gone to George.

828
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,560
George.

829
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,900
Gone to George.

830
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,440
George.

831
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,620
Gone to George.

832
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,540
George.

833
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,480
And I am for terror.

834
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,700
And I am for terror.

835
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,160
To work ahead.

836
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,600
Gone to George.

837
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,120
George.

838
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,280
Gone to George.

839
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,080
George.

840
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,140
Gone to George.

841
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,540
George.

842
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,400
Gone to George.

843
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,880
He wrote down in his diary, forget the males that weep.

844
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,580
Get some female kind bud and roll a tasty spleef.

845
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:15,840
And if anybody ever tried to give him any grief, you twist another number and it inhales

846
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,360
to the chief.

847
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,760
Gone to George.

848
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,860
George.

849
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,420
Gone to George.

850
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,360
George.

851
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,460
Gone to George.

852
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,480
George.

853
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,540
Gone to Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-g-ge of the Ganja.

854
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:24,540


855
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,380
Gone to George.

856
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,680
Hank Modi's going to catch us in the retreat.

857
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:26,680


858
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:26,680


859
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,360
Gone to George.

860
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:27,940
George.

861
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,020
Gone to George.

862
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,020


863
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,360
George.

864
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,800
асс vivor.

865
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,080
Kilodge George.

866
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,920
Beauchamp George.

867
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,640
George.

868
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,120
George.

869
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,440
George of the Ganja.

870
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,300
Stone as he can be.

871
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,160
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

872
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,260
Hey, save some work for me.

873
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
George.

874
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,880
George, George, George of the Gunja

875
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,180
And I, and I, and I am, and I am

876
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,520
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

877
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,820
He's a friend of liberty

878
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,760
When he wanna get stoned he tokes up a bone

879
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,100
And he smokes and he tokes till his mind is blown

880
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,260
And if he don't wanna roll

881
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,040
He'll pack his silver bone

882
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,840
He'll throw the chocolate candies on the coals

883
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,740
This is George, George, George of the Gunja

884
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,720
Friend of liberty

885
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,140
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

886
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,840
George, Washington, D.C.

887
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,820
Loki, Coyote

888
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:22,000
And now, Dr. Agonfly on and at Text Day

889
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,720
We're all in stasis, you know

890
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,080
We've already been picked up by the Xists

891
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,800
We're in stasis all right now

892
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,140
And this is all hallucination

893
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,080
And we're on the spaceship

894
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,680
And we're already on the way

895
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,020
Or, or maybe X Day did happen

896
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,440
And it wasn't all it was cracked up to be

897
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,640
And we're just copper tops in some Xist

898
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:40,700
And we're just copper tops in some Xist

899
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,080
Matrix

900
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,040
Believing that we're at Text Day

901
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,060
Standing in some field and drinking beer

902
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,680
Huh?

903
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,620
Does it matter?

904
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,640
That's, in that case it doesn't matter

905
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,220
So that's a moot point

906
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,900
Who cares about that heresy?

907
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,440
Then there's the fact that this planet is not Earth

908
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,840
This is not Earth

909
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,000
This planet is Mars

910
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,140
And it sounds crazy, doesn't it

911
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,700
When somebody stands there and says

912
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,700
In World War II

913
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,620
They started this whole war just as a distraction

914
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,420
So that you wouldn't notice

915
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,860
That in one night they switched planets

916
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,180
Just like in that movie Dark City

917
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,220
Only with a whole planet happening

918
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,460
And they even have science fiction books

919
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,380
That explain exactly how they did it

920
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,660
They hide the secret in plain sight

921
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,720
If you noticed that everything seems to take a little too long

922
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,860
Everything's a little heavier than it should be

923
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,680
You don't feel well

924
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,340
You don't feel completely at home with most people

925
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,080
You feel kind of alienated

926
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,360
Like you're an alien

927
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,880
Like maybe you are from some other planet

928
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,600
Well maybe you are!

929
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,800
Maybe the conspiracy likes to take a beautiful planet

930
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,380
Like the former Mars

931
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,580
Which is the true Earth

932
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,960
Where, that we should have grown up on

933
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,900
Which was this beautiful paradise

934
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,380
Described accurately in the Edgar Rice Burroughs books

935
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,080
With centaurs and beautiful giant women

936
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,080
And excitement and monsters

937
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,300
Yes friends

938
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,820
And then the conspiracy comes with their jobs

939
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,620
Actually farming was the invention of the conspiracy

940
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,360
They come with their toil and jobs

941
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,000
And pretty soon a beautiful planet is rendered into this

942
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,200
Dried out, rust covered husk

943
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,800
With almost no atmosphere

944
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,600
And just boring rocks everywhere

945
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,180
A few little NASA robots rolling around on it

946
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,540
And that's it

947
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,880
And so they move us all to here

948
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,480
And start the process all over again

949
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,780
And by the time they wear this one out

950
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,300
The whole world is covered with McDonald's and Burger Kings

951
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,300
And Metroplex theaters

952
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,780
Then they'll just move us all by them

953
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,540
They'll have Mars back to its nice pristine form

954
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,020
So in other words

955
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,900
On July 5th, 1998

956
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,540
The X's did arrive on Earth

957
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,800
But this planet is not Earth

958
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,320
This planet is Mars!

959
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,520
That's known as the Onanian heresy

960
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:17,860
Dr. Onan Canobite developed the Onanian heresy

961
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,580
Well he also developed the whole sin of Onanism

962
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,680
To a fine art, my friends

963
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,620
And you know the only true artist is the Jackoff artist

964
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,840
Because that is the only artist who doesn't care about an audience

965
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,120
He's doing it just for the art itself

966
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,620
Just for himself or herself

967
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:50,200
So these guys here are going to try and fetch some action

968
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:55,300
If they'reesperming

969
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,480
So they will themself

970
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,100
But before that

971
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,240
They need some more action

972
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,340
That's what I am

973
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:58,680
And that is

974
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,780
Till the end of this world

975
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,200
A total water drop

976
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,620
Once and then a continuance

977
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,640
No the peace

978
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,440
The peace of the captain

979
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:04,920
Has been stunned

980
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,140
He's fireplace

981
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,820
And the CIA

982
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,380
You're committed treason while you're begging.

983
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,280
Weasel, I ain't no pleaser.

984
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,740
Try to be sensitive like Mr. Van Treason.

985
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,500
You go hummin' on, hummin' on like that.

986
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,180
He's losing.

987
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,580
No matter what you do, chances keep decreasing.

988
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,140
It's a whammy, famine, feast on famine.

989
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,900
Sometimes it's dry, sometimes it's jammin'.

990
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,220
Sometimes swimming upstream like a salmon.

991
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,380
Sometimes you ought to get your head examined.

992
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,120
Okay, so anyway, we're rolling the show up the street here.

993
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,000
We're looking in your windows to see if you're listening to us.

994
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,480
No.

995
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,220
Wake up!

996
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:39,960
Wee Willie Winky.

997
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,300
No.

998
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,900
Are all the chillin' in their beds?

999
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,260
For now it's eight o'clock.

1000
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,340
It is in France.

1001
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,460
Wee Willie Winky runs through the town,

1002
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,720
upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown,

1003
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,740
peeping through the keyhole,

1004
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,100
creeping by the lock.

1005
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,140
Are all the children in their beds?

1006
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,100
For now it's eight o'clock.

1007
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,660
Ye-he-he.

1008
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,700
Somebody call the cops.

1009
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:17,660
Okay, I'll be reading from an escape from the slack world by Ninslo.

1010
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,520
And I'll have to edit this in place.

1011
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:28,620
On Skilin' Kops.

1012
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,720
It was the only thing left of his body after thousands of attempts...

1013
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:33,960
Hey, the skeleton.

1014
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,860
The skeleton crew is here.

1015
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,320
And he wore it where his face would have been.

1016
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,240
If only he'd had it here.

1017
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,640
Well, they move rather elegantly in unison.

1018
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:47,140
The needle of pain from his last cell was the only thing he'd felt for 800 years.

1019
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,520
And very, very close up.

1020
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,260
And then very, very far away.

1021
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,740
And the more he thought about it, the more it hurt.

1022
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,720
The more it hurt, the more he liked it.

1023
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,120
Phylaean's screaming roused Ubro-Ain from his reverie.

1024
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,000
Gosh.

1025
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,100
The coffin-sized skeleton.

1026
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,880
The most control-

1027
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,680
I don't want to touch any of these things.

1028
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,320
I just think it hurts.

1029
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:18,900
From which all controls of the Ultiversal Muc-Killerator were controlled rang with a piercing nasal whine of highest transcriptivator of king pain.

1030
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,360
Go boop your beep.

1031
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,160
Hey.

1032
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,720
Phylaean shrilled to and about everything.

1033
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,900
Dr. Yowlmangler bobbed and nodded and began a fading string of platitudes.

1034
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,920
With Mel Falmer.

1035
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,040
Whose, whose version is that?

1036
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,760
Oh, it's, you know, it's one of these-

1037
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,480
It's Nins, it's Ninslo.

1038
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,120
Yeah.

1039
00:41:47,120 --> 00:42:01,360
It was so fapping, pitiful, tragic, and nauseating that Ubro-Ain thought, if only they hadn't busted Jesus 17 out of the Dimension L hell plate, everything would be perfect.

1040
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:02,880
Fantastic.

1041
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,460
Damn, everything was perfect.

1042
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,020
And always had been.

1043
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,740
And they all hated it.

1044
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,840
At least since the G-Giggle re-invasion.

1045
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,420
Hundreds of the Ulva-Veib twins were dead and for what?

1046
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,080
For a brain the size of God?

1047
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,360
A brain so big it couldn't even think of thinking?

1048
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,980
It was the irony of it that had gotten to him.

1049
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:32,140
If the Carbonary's Dimension Gate had only been a scalosecond faster or slower,

1050
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:38,760
the wart tubs of the Garduna-Kamora Combine would have found nothing but smoking bug shells.

1051
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,880
Ubro-Ain's plan to stop him.

1052
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,980
Well, yeah, your control rapidly diminished.

1053
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,240
If you'll recheck the triple-checks, double-checks again, everything had to be perfect.

1054
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,160
I'll get that Ivan Stang.

1055
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,100
There go all the old bobbies chasing after him and Johnson and Johnson and Hargo.

1056
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,540
He didn't actually start the religion.

1057
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,800
I want to make it clear that he didn't actually start the religion.

1058
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,240
That's true, you know.

1059
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,160
Hey, and I was there in New York.

1060
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,260
He didn't actually start the religion.

1061
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,720
He was just there when the religion was started around him.

1062
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:25,740
By people with interesting names, and I'm going to say it on the air, one of the holiest names there is,

1063
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,600
but before I say it, what station are we listening to?

1064
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,980
Well, that would be...

1065
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,380
The New York Times.

1066
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,440
Yeah, baby.

1067
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,200
On your radio dial is...

1068
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:35,800
Oh, baby.

1069
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,060
On certainly.

1070
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,260
Faithfully.

1071
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,080
Naturefully.

1072
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,680
Baby.

1073
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,280
Chico, California.

1074
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,380
Where the sun often shines, and the mangoes grow, and the mangroves grow.

1075
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:59,660
GG Jeeper Docs buzzed in the ultra glass box full of pure air.

1076
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:04,380
Man, the legendary drug so powerful it doesn't do anything at all.

1077
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:12,040
Two hundred inconceivably advanced entire alien races had been squashed like grapes,

1078
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:19,860
and their fluids refined into this one box full of N, in which Jeeper Docs hung vibrating, repeating,

1079
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,060
Let me eat that bone, Wilmer.

1080
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,740
I won't kill the girl thing again.

1081
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,380
Forty-three times the second as he had for the last thousand years.

1082
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:36,160
Jeeper Docs was of no conceivable help or use, but he was a good pal.

1083
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:47,160
Wave up! Wave up! Wave up! Wave up!

1084
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,420
Ow!

1085
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,380
I hear that people barely ache at saying that we're poor.

1086
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,440
Well, listen to me, I'll set you free, cause I have got the cure.

1087
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,580
You're hawking us, you're missing the bus, cause we ain't got no brain.

1088
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,920
Just find a mundane and fleece the brain, fleece the pinks instead, fleece the pangs.

1089
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,400
I hear the people barely ache at saying that we're poor.

1090
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:18,400


1091
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,980
Fleece the pinks, fleece the pinks, fleece the pinks.

1092
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,220
This planet is loaded with people like Jar Jar Binks.

1093
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,380
Cattle and sheep and monkeys and man some links.

1094
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,900
They'll give you money for something that tickles their kinks.

1095
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,060
Get them to pay for your food and your prop and your drinks.

1096
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:42,900
Fleece the pinks, fleece the pinks, fleece the pinks, fleece the pinks.

1097
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,720
You're wasting your time if you're gonna whine about all of the strike that you lack.

1098
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,940
Listen to Bob.

1099
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,020
There won't be a problem, you'll lead a life of slack.

1100
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,300
Pink's got the dough, but what do you know, a fool and his money soon part.

1101
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,640
You don't have to steal, just cut him a deal and that's when the party'll start.

1102
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,660
Fleece the pinks, fleece the pinks, fleece the pinks, fleece the pinks.

1103
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,840
Taxes are incorporated, profits are obscene.

1104
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,860
They gouge you on your cigarettes, your booze and gasoline.

1105
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,280
Television, radio and news and magazine.

1106
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,660
The conspiracy owns them all, they're part of the machine.

1107
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,120
They feed you entertainment like a dose of Thorazine.

1108
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,340
Pouring in your ears until there's nothing in between.

1109
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,780
It's time to turn the tables, guys, I'll tell you what I mean.

1110
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,120
The fastest might be paying, but their money's mighty green.

1111
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:35,900
Fleece the pinks, fleece the pinks, fleece the pinks, fleece who?

1112
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,860
Fleece the pinks!

1113
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,340
Right!

1114
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,180
I would never wanna live.

1115
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,260
I would never wanna give to someone who doesn't give.

1116
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,540
And I would never wanna hate.

1117
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,340
I would never wanna hate someone who doesn't hate.

1118
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,500
And I would never wanna hate.

1119
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,440
I would never wanna hate someone who doesn't hate.

1120
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,020
And I would never wanna love.

1121
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,760
I would never wanna love someone who doesn't love.

1122
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,500
It's not my way.

1123
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,860
It's not my way.

1124
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,740
You stop my waiting

1125
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,080
We've been drinking whiskey, scotch, and beer

1126
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,680
And we're meddling men, so we ain't got no fear

1127
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,740
Don't be a pussy, tell me it's dangerous

1128
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:21,080
Just shut your damn mouth, hold my beer, and watch this

1129
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,260
Loki, Coyote, and before that, Bright Shadow at Tex Day.

1130
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,560
And before that, the Philo reads Nenslow's short story

1131
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:36,320
from an old, stark-fist printed zine on KPFA Berkeley

1132
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,380
with Dr. Howe and puzzling evidence.

1133
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,960
And now, a launching and a Norell.

1134
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,860
Friends, what is religion all about

1135
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,640
but mindlessness?

1136
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,620
Fast repetitions of senseless activity.

1137
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,120
Let the launch begin.

1138
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,240
Yeah!

1139
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,520
Whoa!

1140
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,040
It's a multi-warhead!

1141
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,960
A multi-limbed, intercontinental ballistic...

1142
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,840
Oh, what a trajectory.

1143
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,500
And he is still smoking.

1144
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,340
I've been given a glimpse of...

1145
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,840
I couldn't believe...

1146
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,640
I don't care how big it is.

1147
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,360
We don't even have any spaceships.

1148
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,720
I don't care.

1149
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,740
I don't care if 96% of the population

1150
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,940
earns around 1% of all the money that's being earned.

1151
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,380
It's designed that way.

1152
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,880
Bad or feeling terrible.

1153
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,240
Wow, I feel really bad.

1154
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,660
That's what you're going to get more of.

1155
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,640
How bad it is.

1156
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:30,920
Look!

1157
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:31,760
How bad it is.

1158
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,780
All of the grim realities.

1159
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,780
Constantly stressful.

1160
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,380
Homophobic people.

1161
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,280
Negative angry people and negative.

1162
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,080
Negative angry people and negative.

1163
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,320
Craziness.

1164
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,380
You crazy.

1165
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,360
Frustration.

1166
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,060
Frustration.

1167
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:45,920
The worse you feel.

1168
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,340
Frustration.

1169
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:46,640


1170
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:46,640


1171
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:46,640


1172
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:46,640


1173
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,420
Rich or poor, get poor.

1174
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,160
It's all about...

1175
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,520
Rich get richer, poor get poorer.

1176
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,320
It's all about...

1177
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:51,860
Fantasy.

1178
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,120
Man, I would hate that.

1179
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:53,700
Delay.

1180
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,460
Second guess.

1181
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:55,340
Doubt.

1182
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,480
That's not who you are.

1183
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,920
Look, I don't have the car I want.

1184
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,880
I don't have the house I want.

1185
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,720
I don't have the health I want.

1186
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:00,620
I don't have the spouse I want.

1187
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:00,860
Look.

1188
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,520
Here, here.

1189
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:01,860
Woo!

1190
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:02,940
Do it!

1191
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,600
How bad?

1192
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,460
Bottom line.

1193
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,040
Bottom line.

1194
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:05,680
Bang the wind.

1195
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,340
Sweetheart, sweetheart.

1196
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,560
Rich people were people that had ripped everyone off.

1197
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,380
It would blow your...

1198
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,000
It would blow your...

1199
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:11,220
Money.

1200
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:11,780
Money.

1201
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,320
Money.

1202
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,060
More money.

1203
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:13,780
More money.

1204
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,320
I come to easily and frequently.

1205
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:16,900
Right?

1206
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:17,320
Right?

1207
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,340
Run out of stuff.

1208
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:18,820
Free.

1209
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,140
I can't do that.

1210
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:21,940
I'm not...

1211
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,160
I'm not...

1212
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,600
Oh, crap.

1213
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:26,820
You will live.

1214
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,300
You will live.

1215
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:27,840
See yourself.

1216
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,600
There is nothing.

1217
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,160
There is nothing.

1218
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:29,720
There is nothing.

1219
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:29,980
Nothing.

1220
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:30,340
Nothing.

1221
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:30,700
Nothing.

1222
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:30,960
Nothing.

1223
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:31,700
Only nothing.

1224
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,000
Nothing.

1225
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,900
Have fun with it.

1226
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,540
Does Bob really use rubber nipples for his knees?

1227
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,080
He has to.

1228
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,340
Rubber nipples.

1229
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,100
Climbing the corporate ladder.

1230
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,520
He was on his knees so much.

1231
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,140
Okay, this song is called Pray Little Polly.

1232
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,300
It's about little kids.

1233
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,260
I hate happy songs.

1234
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,300
I despise happy songs.

1235
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,340
This is too happy.

1236
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,620
I hate it.

1237
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:00,780
I hate.

1238
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,060
I hate it.

1239
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:02,800
I hate.

1240
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,920
I hate.

1241
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:08,920


1242
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:08,920


1243
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:08,920


1244
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:10,800


1245
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:11,140
I hate.

1246
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:11,720
I hate.

1247
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:11,960


1248
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:11,960


1249
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:11,960


1250
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,660
I hate.

1251
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:19,700
Gordon Gordon, that was, and the band Lesh Nailah in the background, live at Text Day.

1252
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:25,100
The band you're hearing in the background, for all my credits, is Amino Acids, the Amino

1253
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:31,520
Acids from theaminoacids.com, who will be playing at X Day, not to be confused with

1254
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,200
Text Day.

1255
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:40,000
This is the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius, reachable at P.O.

1256
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118, or subgenius.com.

1257
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:59,200
By the way, you're also all Universal Life Church ministers now, that's done.

1258
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,420
Hell, god damn it, I just gave away half the membership pack.

1259
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,140
But you don't have that Subgenius ministers card in your wallet!

1260
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,900
If that card is not in there, your name ain't.

1261
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,240
In the Book of Life, Judgment Day will come, the rupture will come, you'll be lifted up.

1262
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,380
Is His name in the Book of Life?

1263
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:17,760
Nay, Lord.

1264
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,420
Then cast Him into the lake of slacklessness.

1265
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:26,880
Put Him back on earth, friends, because earth is hell without Bob.

1266
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,240
If you don't have Bob in your life, you're in hell now!

1267
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,320
Quit worrying about the afterlife.

1268
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,220
What the hell are you worried about?

1269
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,280
You're in eternal hell.

1270
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,440
You have to get up and go to work in the morning on Monday, don't you?

1271
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:39,920
Yep.

1272
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,900
Case closed.

1273
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,620
You are in hell now!

1274
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,580
You are in hell now!

1275
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,800
If you don't have Bob in your pipe!

1276
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,920
Some people go, what's in that pipe Bob's smoking?

1277
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,400
He's had marijuana in his pipe.

1278
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,400
What were you guys on when you came up with that?

1279
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:03,200
What's in Bob's pipe is your mind, my friend.

1280
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:09,820
If you are strong enough, if your faith is true enough, and if you know that you

1281
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:16,240
must have slack, that doesn't mean you don't have slack and you must go out and get it.

1282
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,900
You must have slack to even be here.

1283
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:22,960
You must have slack to even think you know what a subgenius is.

1284
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,920
And it's true, you have it.

1285
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,500
You do have that slack.

1286
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:31,240
The greatest thing about it is Bob doesn't know what it is.

1287
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,320
I don't know what it is.

1288
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,320
The conspiracy doesn't know what your slack is.

1289
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,400
We can't take it away from you.

1290
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,320
And you can't sell it.

1291
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,440
But you can forget about it.

1292
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,520
And that's all we're here for.

1293
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,800
We're just here to provide a pep talk to remind you to remember your goddamn slack!

1294
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,960
Don't be a dumbass!

1295
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,320
Well, actually, Bob is the greatest dumbass of them all.

1296
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,220
Why do you think they call it subgenius?

1297
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,820
Bob is not smart.

1298
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,460
Bob is lucky!

1299
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,340
And he said, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

1300
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,300
And that sums it up. That's about it.

1301
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,000
Praise Bob!

1302
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,500
Help me somebody!

1303
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,460
Eee-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!

1304
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,140
I missed it!

1305
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,800
Robot fisting. Now I've seen everything.

1306
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:32,020
And anybody who doesn't like what we're doing here can kiss the crispy fried ass of Bob Lightyear.

1307
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,460
Well, I went to the subgenius thing and they were like breaking toys on the stage.

1308
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:40,660
Saying, praise Bob!

1309
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,520
It was beautiful, man! It was beautiful!

1310
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,460
I was saved!

1311
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,400
And this nice girl gave me this pill.

1312
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,680
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1313
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,040
The end.

1314
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,620
Truth is fiction.

1315
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,260
And this is...

1316
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,880
Be Born With Me Not.

1317
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,380
The musicians of ancient Greece had an unusual way of advertising their calling.

1318
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,540
They wore shoes when they walked.

1319
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,560
And moss collected from a graveyard.

1320
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,060
Be born with me not.

1321
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,480
In a moment I'll tell you an unusual story about a soldier who became a crab painter.

1322
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,960
He specialized in doves and toads for the next 63 years.

1323
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,140
Molaise's house on the island of Inishmury, Ireland, which was constructed from eyes collected from a graveyard,

1324
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,980
was built through the generosity of some personable crab looking for peace and quiet.

1325
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:43,100
Madame Lynn Stevens wields a stout toad, with which she drums a noisy tattoo on Stevens Lynn Stevens,

1326
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,100
wielding the toad by means of a hook fastened around the stump of his right arm.

1327
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,700
She also uses her vocal cords to good advantage.

1328
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,040
Custom requires each to shut up.

1329
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,920
Be born with me not.

1330
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,200
Be born with me not.

1331
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:05,060
From PR News in Washington, I'm being blamed on the bid to file papers to form an exploratory airstrike on a suspected university in Berlin,

1332
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,960
which U.S. officials say is a crime.

1333
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,340
The city is close to the border with North Korea and close to parts of the tribal Northeast

1334
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:15,340
and moved through the Midwest's nuclear states and into a tribal haven in St. Louis, St. Louis,

1335
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,760
setting the groundwork for the next round of lukewarm attacks next month.

1336
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,520
Thousands of pilgrims exploded at an average of more than 100 a day.

1337
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:31,220
At least 34,000 people blew out and destroyed parts of the white marble building dedicated to the infamous PR News.

1338
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:36,200
On Wall Street, 12-9-7-7-6-6-5-4-5-4-7,

1339
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,600
this is PR News.

1340
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,100
We do expect the majority of customers to be straggling by Wednesday evening.

1341
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,080
PR's bad.

1342
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:43,980
PR's bad.

1343
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,140
PR News is bad.

1344
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:45,500
PR.

1345
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:53,180
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has gone to Saudi Arabia seeking help in supporting the fragile PR News in Washington.

1346
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:59,560
Believe it or kill me and PR News by the great Fernanda Ndele, Lee Murr.

1347
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,500
Try to deal with real world problems.

1348
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,380
The ability of the algorithm to alter the world.

1349
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,160
The ability of the algorithm to alter the world.

1350

ages yes you know i and uh so much of these so-called new world order

1388
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:20,080
is that people keep trying to bring about they they look an awful lot like the old world order
