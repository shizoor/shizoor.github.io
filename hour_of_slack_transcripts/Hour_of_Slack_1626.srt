Mr. America, walk on by

Your schools that do not teach

Mr. America, walk on by

00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,300
The minds that won't be reached

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,360
Mr. America, try to hide

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,420
The emptiness that's you inside

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,020
But once you find that the way you lied

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,220
And all the corny tricks you tried

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,620
Will not forestall the rising tide

15
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,500

The hardware store philosophy

00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,040
That turns away

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,440

The product of your savage pride

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,240
The useful minds that it denied

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,600
The day you shrugged and stepped aside

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,120
You saw their clothes and then you cried

No matter how you do the math

It doesn't add up

71
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,900
It's all subtraction

72
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,520

No matter how it makes us feel inside

The world is learning how to divide

83
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,020
I believe our hearts can't hide

Separate, factor out the fun

115
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,500
We fall apart, it's a chain reaction

116
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,600
If we can count on everyone

117
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,640
See the sum, the satisfaction

118
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,580
I see a world that includes everyone

119
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,480

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,060
I know I just heard the words

127
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,060
I know you needed us

128
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,060


129
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,000
I know we make money

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,240
I know we're ready to do it

131
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,700
I know it's a good wave

132
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:38,700

134
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,000
But we'd better partner

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,660
You know we're not alone

136
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:46,060
You and I minute by minute

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,600
Don't say Mr. Obnio

142
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,320
We listen to every footnote

143
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,480
You don't want me

144
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,400
Thank you.

145
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,800
Thank you.

146
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,300
Thank you.

147
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,680
Thank you.

148
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,440
Thank you.

149
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,340
Thank you.

150
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Thank you.

151
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,100
Thank you.

152
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:17,440
Thank you.

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,600

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,700
Thank you.

156
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,140
Thank you.

157
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,260
Thank you.

158
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:55,660
Now watch while everybody on your street will take a turn to stomp and smash and bash and crash and slash and bust and burn.

159
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,800
And I'm watching and I'm waiting, hoping for the best.

160
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:07,260
Even think I'll go to praying every time I hear them saying that there's no way to delay that trouble coming every day.

161
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,120
No way to delay that trouble coming every day.

162
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,560
Well, you can cool it, you can heat it, cause baby I don't need it.

163
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,280
Take your TV tube and heat it, and all that phony stuff on sports and all the unconfirmed reports.

164
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,300
You know I'll watch that rotten box until my head begin to hurt.

165
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,360
From checking out the way the newsmen say they get the dirt.

166
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,140
Before the guys on channel so-and-so and further they'll say.

167
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,000
That any show they'll interrupt.

168
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,440
They'll bring you news if it comes up.

169
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,420
They say that if the place blows up, they will be the first to tell.

170
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,180
Cause the boys they got downtown are working hard and doing swift.

171
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,300
And if anybody gets the news before it hits the street.

172
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,280
They say that no one blabs it faster, their coverage can be beat.

173
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,220
And if another woman driver gets machine gunned from her seat.

174
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,100
They'll send some joker with a brownie and you'll see it all complete.

175
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,300
So I'm watching and I'm waiting, hoping for the best.

176
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,280
Even think I go to prayin', every time I hear them sayin'.

177
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,780
That there's no way to delay that trouble comin' every day.

178
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,720
No way to delay that trouble comin' every day.

179
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,200
Hey, you know something people.

180
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,100
I'm not black, but there's a whole lot of times I wish I could say I'm not white.

181
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,160
Well, I've seen the fires burnin'.

182
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,460
And I've seen the fires burnin'.

183
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,080
And the local people turnin'.

184
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,820
All the merchants and the shops who used to sell their brooms and mops.

185
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,840
And every other household item.

186
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,940
Watch a mob just turn and bite them.

187
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,520
And they say it served them right.

188
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,540
Because a few of them were white.

189
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,640
And it's the same across the nation.

190
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,160
Black and white discrimination.

191
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,680
And you can't understand me.

192
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,820
And all that other jazz they hand me.

193
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,360
And the papers and TV.

194
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,320
And all that mass stupidity that seems to grow more every day.

195
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,300
Each time you hear something we say.

196
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,400
You want to go.

197
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,500
And do your in.

198
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,340
Cause the color of your skin.

199
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,340
Just don't appeal to him.

200
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,420
No matter if it's black or white.

201
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,200
Because he's out for blood tonight.

202
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,340
Hey.

203
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:28,580
Hey.

204
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,440
Hey.

205
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,440
Hey.

206
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,560
Hey.

207
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,440
Hey.

208
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,120
Hey.

209
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,440
Hey.

210
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,080
Hey.

211
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,580
Hey.

212
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,400
Hey.

213
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,180
Hey.

214
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,400
Hey.

215
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,120
Hey.

216
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,620
Hey.

217
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,340
Hey.

218
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,620
Hey.

219
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,060
Hey.

220
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


221
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


222
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,240
Hey.

223
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,500
Hey.

224
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,760
Hey.

225
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,060
Hey.

226
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,280


227
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:58,880


228
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,180
Hey.

229
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,260


230
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,260


231
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,260


232
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,280


233
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,280


234
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,280


235
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,400
Yeah,

236
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,640
Yeah.

237
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:04,700
All right,

238
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:04,980
today,

239
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,840
ends the previous theme.

240
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:09,860


241
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,860
if that comes together here you start and I already know that bombo I got

242
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:10,860


243
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:10,880
I mean,

244
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:10,880


245
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,660
they put up a match in a match.

246
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:11,660


247
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,400
Hey.

248
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,820
In the eyes of all these people

249
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,660
Don't you know that this could start

250
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,620
On any street, in any town

251
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,580
In any state, if any clown

252
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,700
Decides that now's the time to fight

253
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
For some ideal he thinks is right

254
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,440
And if a million more agree

255
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,180
There ain't no great society

256
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,480
As it applies to you and me

257
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,460
Our country isn't free

258
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,560
And the law refused to see

259
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,380
If all that you can ever be

260
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,300
Is just a lousy janitor

261
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,540
Unless your uncle owns the store

262
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,360
You know that five and every four

263
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,440
Just won't amount to nothing more

264
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,580
So we'll watch the rats go across the floor

265
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,580
And make up songs about being bored

266
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,180
Blow your harmonica song

267
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,180
Yeah, Trouble Comin' Every Day

268
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,800
A timely song done in the late 60s, I think

269
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,940
That may have been Zappa's first album

270
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,060
Hungry Freaks

271
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,060
Which also was played

272
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,340
At the time of the war

273
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,760
At the very beginning of the show

274
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,740
The second song

275
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,580
The more modern sounding one

276
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,720
Was Our Number Is One

277
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,040
By Exposed Foreheads

278
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,540
Our new buddies

279
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,280
That we'll be seeing at the devotional

280
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,360
Oh, it's Fourth Reich Rising

281
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,200
That was our buddy Fat Man D

282
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,980
Reverend Fat Man D

283
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,180
And we heard an instrumental

284
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,680
From the Rudy Schwartz Project

285
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,920
Tango Lessons in a Fascist Whorehouse

286
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,320
And this is our buddy Fat Man D

287
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,180
And this might be Dave

288
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,260
It is

289
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,320
I interrupted you in the middle of a statement

290
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,560
Yeah, no, that's okay

291
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,440
You tried to call it a little early, I think

292
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,440
No, I just went upstairs

293
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,140
To obfuscate my

294
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,980
My pliandroses

295
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,080
And the nasal passage

296
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,940
Were completely, totally evacuated

297
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,820
By some kind of

298
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,360
Sunstream beauty

299
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,160
That nobody's ever heard of before

300
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,240
So that's where I'm at

301
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,180
I don't know if it's in Nebraska

302
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,020
Or any place you ever want to leave

303
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,700
Well, it's in Neighbor World, isn't it?

304
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,520
Isn't everything in Neighbor World?

305
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,300
Well, except for the

306
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,720
The things that escape

307
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,440
Yeah

308
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,760
Sometimes they escape in plain sight

309
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,880
Like, just like, you know

310
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,160
When you go to a senior home

311
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,440
And some old lady or old man

312
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,280
Will just stand up in the middle of a conversation

313
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,480
And start barking

314
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,420
Verciferously

315
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,300
As if, you know

316
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,980
They're very life-dependent on it

317
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,620
Perhaps it is

318
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,200
Or it does

319
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,180
It does

320
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,040
In some cases, I'm sure it does

321
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,060
Well, Dave, you getting ready for X-Day?

322
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,120
The subgenius holiday

323
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,740
And destruction of the known planet Earth?

324
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,840
How many years now

325
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,920
Have I told you I don't believe in it no more?

326
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,080
Oh, that doesn't matter

327
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,700
Whether you believe in it

328
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,440
Or whether I believe in it or not

329
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,500
It's coming

330
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,580
X-Day isn't coming

331
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,280
It's coming

332
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,640
Oh, X-Day is coming

333
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,240
But it doesn't mean we'll be riding away

334
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,280
On the pleasure ships of the isosceles triangle

335
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,100
Maybe not the way you're thinking of it

336
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,980
Yeah

337
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,200
I've got a book here that talks all about it

338
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,340
It's called

339
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:27,980
Revelation

340
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,300
Relevation

341
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,960
Elevation

342
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,760
Nexus

343
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,520
Plexus

344
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,060
Dexus

345
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,520
From Texas

346
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,500
Hey, that rhymes

347
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,060
No, this is our other out-of-print book

348
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,020
The, uh

349
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,200
The subgenius cyclopedia of slack

350
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,440
The Bobliagraphon

351
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,320
Oh, the Bobliagraphon

352
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:47,780
Right

353
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,620
More commonly known as Pat

354
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,600
But it says here

355
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,540
What will it be like on the escape vessels?

356
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,820
Peyton Place in outer space

357
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,700
No doubt once things settle down

358
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,600
You'll soon discover that your sex goddess

359
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,940
Can be anyone

360
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,660
From an old high school crush

361
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,740
To your most hated politician

362
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,240
That's pretty scary

363
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,120
Now, ready

364
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,920
Yeah, you wouldn't want to be having sex with Ronald

365
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,620
Uh, Tony

366
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,260
Now, ready to have sex with you

367
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,840
Or play checkers

368
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
If that's your preference

369
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,700
Usually

370
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,120
It's only a simulacra

371
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,240
Of those persons

372
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,960
Although

373
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,480
If the individuals in question

374
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,640
Are subgeniuses

375
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
It might really be them

376
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,180
Yep

377
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,000
More than likely would be

378
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,240
If you consider all the facts

379
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,860
And all the

380
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,100
All the tuna fish

381
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,220
That they had to go through

382
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,920
Each year

383
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,740
That they were up in Alaska

384
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,240
Doing all that work up there

385
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,000
And then they come back

386
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,700
And he's right when

387
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:39,900
He's right when

388
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,740
Jelly mongers

389
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,280
These hot sauce

390
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,760
And cold toast

391
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,500
Tuna fish

392
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,660
Artifactors

393
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,760
AM radio guys

394
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,940
All say that they're experts

395
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,020
On meteorology

396
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,760
And all the meteorological scientists

397
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,780
Are all hoaxers

398
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,200
And the one guy said

399
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
The reason why he knew

400
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,360
More than all these thousands

401
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,120
Of meteorological hoaxers

402
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,420
Was because he wanted to be a weatherman

403
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,960
When he was a junior in high school

404
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,660
And I figured

405
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,280
I am a right wing type of naturalist

406
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,640
All white type of person

407
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,460
I'm gonna listen to that guy

408
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,940
And do exactly what he says

409
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,340
Even if it requires

410
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,280
Marching around in a pair of softies

411
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,560
Or huggies

412
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,820
Or any of those other diapers

413
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,600
For old people

414
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,400
Oh so you don't believe me now

415
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,360
No it wasn't that

416
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,560
It was that I got a text

417
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,880
Right that's the first time

418
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,900
That's ever happened

419
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,600
I got a text in the middle of the show

420
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,920
And it was Dr. Sinister

421
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,300
Oops

422
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,060
I accidentally started to call him

423
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,960
I didn't mean to do that

424
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,400
Oh is that cool?

425
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,500
No it's terrible

426
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,400
I'm locked into Neighbor World now

427
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,220
Because I got that darn intelligent phone

428
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,220
Well can't you turn its eyes off

429
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,440
And just pretend it's somewhere else

430
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,200
Like neighboring Peru

431
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,880
Or Salacious Argo Way

432
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,240
I'm too dumb to control my smart phone

433
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,400
Yeah that's the problem I'm having

434
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,620
It's like I was talking to some people

435
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,740
About cost you know

436
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,860
I figured if I tried real hard

437
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,340
And saved up I could get something

438
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,360
But it costs a lot of money

439
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,060
To get those ones

440
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,200
With the real good video apps on them

441
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,180
And stuff like that there

442
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,080
No

443
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,720
Isn't it?

444
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,560
No it doesn't actually

445
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,340
I don't want to do advertisements

446
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,420
For those things

447
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,960
I don't want to do any advertisements

448
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,620
Sometimes they give you the phone

449
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,800
If you buy the plan

450
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,120
Don't you see?

451
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,800
You gotta buy into the big plan

452
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,760
The big big plan

453
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,540
Then you get a free

454
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,240
You know eyeball phone

455
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,860
Or whatever those things

456
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,400
You know

457
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:36,880
Yeah

458
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,080
I did the opposite

459
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,120
I bought the largest

460
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,980
Clunkiest of the phones

461
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,220
Most expensive too

462
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,480
And it was partly

463
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,240
Clunkiest in the middle

464
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,380
I want to be able to use it

465
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,400
Unlike most smart phones

466
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,700
Which are kind of small

467
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,880
I could use this as a weapon

468
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,820
Did you notice the other day

469
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,400
When we met in person

470
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,320
For the first time in a couple of years

471
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,020
That you reached for your pocket

472
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,460
Yeah

473
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,400
At first you were

474
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,040
I was like oh my god

475
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,440
I was ready to

476
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,760
Ready to whack you over the head

477
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,860
With you if you pulled anything

478
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,080
You just bopped it on the head

479
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,900
Like my mother in law says

480
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
There was nothing nearby to pull

481
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,440
So I just expected you

482
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,000
To show me how to use the darn

483
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,360
Darn

484
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,560
You'd kill yourself

485
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,980
For playing with this thing

486
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,340
I think I could go into

487
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,500
A chaotic spill wheel

488
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,420
Of swirling and

489
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,200
Conconventions

490
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
That wouldn't go on

491
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,360
Forever and ever

492
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,400
I just

493
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,540
I would feel so lonely

494
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,300
In deep space

495
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,540
Not just knowing

496
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,800
Just not knowing

497
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,900
That it not only had

498
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,020
A chance to kill me

499
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,740
I missed X day

500
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,220
But I missed Y day

501
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,060
And Z day

502
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,800
Which were

503
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:44,860
No

504
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,520
Come to

505
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,700
Now that you mention it

506
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,640
I haven't even

507
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,100
Thought about Y day

508
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,980
And Z day

509
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,560
No wonder we're having

510
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,840
So much trouble with X day

511
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,520
Maybe we should have

512
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,480
Just moved on

513
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,340
Yeah

514
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,380
Instead of waiting

515
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:56,840
For the

516
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,240
Instead of waiting

517
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,620
For the men from planet X

518
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,180
We could wait

519
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,860
For the

520
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,700
The men from planet Y

521
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,680
Or the Ys

522
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,420
Or the women from

523
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,720
The women from planet Y

524
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,600
The Amazon women

525
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,540
From planet Y

526
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,860
No they're from planet W

527
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,560
Because the women

528
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,440
Or because the number

529
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,340
Of Croatian artifacts

530
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,900
Not Croatian artifacts

531
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,720
I mean the

532
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,500
The you know

533
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:18,860
Actually

534
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,660
You know

535
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,740
Technically you're right

536
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,000
Because the Yakutism

537
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,220
The most evil

538
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,040
And destructive

539
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,180
Of all aliens

540
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,300
Are in fact

541
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,200
All female

542
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,600
Yeah

543
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,100
And they are some

544
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,260
Scary Shiva-like

545
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,020
Bee hatches

546
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,980
I'm just

547
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,140
I'm just plugging right along

548
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,840
Trying to figure out

549
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,960
What the hell you're talking about

550
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,420
Dave

551
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,400
I'm talking about

552
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,740
The doctrinal material

553
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,460
From book of the subgenius

554
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,100
Back

555
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,340
Written over

556
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,940
Over 300 years ago

557
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,360
I'm listening

558
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,320
But I'm

559
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,800
I'm not listening

560
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,460
I'm looking

561
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,980
I'm looking at a picture of

562
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,060
Subgeniuses spell out

563
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,500
The name

564
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,120
Bob

565
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,180
In butts

566
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,580
Readable

567
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,720
From outer space

568
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,300
And that actually happened

569
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,520
At one X day drill

570
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,040
The sad thing is

571
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,500
Our photo of it

572
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,660
You can't tell

573
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,760
They're spelling out Bob

574
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,520
Because we didn't have

575
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,320
A crane

576
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,160
Or a drone

577
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,040
In those days

578
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,960
Or even a ladder

579
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,660
I think it is on a ladder

580
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,640
But

581
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,160
Yeah it's like

582
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,020
Scaffolding

583
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,040
You see the butts

584
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,140
But you don't see Bob

585
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,120
And the cheeks are arguing

586
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,700
And we're waiting

587
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,820
To slap them down

588
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,200
But at least

589
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,360
They spelled Bob right

590
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,320
And they only need

591
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,380
One butt each

592
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,320
For the quote marks

593
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,100
On the upper left and right

594
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,740
Yeah

595
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,200
Because you always put

596
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,980
Quotes around Bob

597
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,960
To prove you're not a

598
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,360
You know

599
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,400
Just a pretender

600
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,160
But now

601
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,080
I forget the part

602
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,480
Where the quote marks would go

603
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,460
Do they go in the

604
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,180
So called

605
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,700
May I use the phrase

606
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:47,780
No

607
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,600
Oh here goes

608
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,420
Ass crack

609
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,060
No

610
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,760
No they are that

611
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:52,920
Crack

612
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,860
That's what separates

613
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,220
The two heads

614
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,160
Of the quote marks

615
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,380
That's what

616
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,380
That's what makes

617
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,680
Tuna fish so tasty

618
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,580
After all these

619
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,360
Palabras

620
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,200
Well I don't know

621
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,860
About the tuna fish

622
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,840
But that's why you only need

623
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,160
One butt for the quote marks

624
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,640
On Bob

625
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,680
But you need at least

626
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,340
Two butts

627
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:08,940
I think

628
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,940
Nine people

629
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,000
Just for the B

630
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,400
Yeah

631
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,860
You need five or so

632
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,480
For the O

633
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,280
And then you need

634
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,780
Another nine

635
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,540
For the other B

636
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,480
And that's about

637
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,560
That's about everybody

638
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,780
That comes to X-Day

639
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,940
That's a lot

640
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,820
That's a lot of people

641
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,720
To spell one small

642
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,520
Tiny word

643
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,340
Now we could do

644
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:24,960
But just think of it

645
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,760
As like a commercial

646
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,040
From the Uber mention

647
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,540
No no no no no no no no no no

648
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,460
That they're trying

649
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,440
To spread the message

650
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,380
By using your

651
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,540
Vile incendiary

652
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,560
Testosterone

653
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,320
And other Republican

654
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,820
Delights

655
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,400
That you

656
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,340
That you

657
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:38,340


658
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:38,340


659
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,060
Seem to just like

660
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,100
Toss off the grill

661
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,080
As if they were something

662
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,680
You know

663
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,880
To behold

664
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,520
No

665
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,700
Not me

666
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,160
No

667
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,180
Not you?

668
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,980
No I'm the guy

669
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,600
Taking pictures

670
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,300
Oh man I got the wrong

671
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,360
River and I don't stay

672
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,020
I'm just the guy

673
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,480
With the camera

674
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,560
I'm the one with the camera

675
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,660
I'm not the one that's

676
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,520
Well you know

677
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,660
I don't know

678
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:58,880
Yeah

679
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,180
You apparently know

680
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,660
And I don't want to know

681
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,080
To serve man

682
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,760
Ha ha

683
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,460
That is indeed

684
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,320
The job of old

685
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,600
Barbecue chef Bob

686
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,140
It says

687
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,340
Here

688
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,740
The exes saucers

689
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,760
Will come to collect

690
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,260
The faithful

691
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,760
And as the bobbies

692
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,140
Ascend the gravity

693
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,040
Elevators

694
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,260
Into the motherships

695
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,820
Some few will be

696
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,840
Separated out

697
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,400
By Bob

698
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,620
Chosen from among

699
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,360
The true believers

700
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,460
To become part of

701
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,760
The special sauce

702
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,780
He's preparing

703
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,700
Ha

704
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,100
Oh

705
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:28,920
Mm

706
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,500
Mm

707
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,600
The rest of the

708
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,380
I think that's one of the

709
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,240
Most delicious things

710
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,940
You ever wrote

711
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,520
Or ate

712
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,320
I didn't write

713
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,400
That's the word of Bob

714
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,480
The rest of the

715
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,220
Subgenie

716
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,500
It says here

717
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,040
Once they have ruptured

718
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,920
And become adjusted

719
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,200
To their new powers

720
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,600
Will have the option

721
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,800
Of creating their own

722
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,840
Love planets

723
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,520
Or wreaking vengeance

724
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,020
Upon the X-Day survivors

725
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,200
Remaining on Earth

726
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,780
Or both

727
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,600
Why not both?

728
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,080
No doubt

729
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,820
There'll be some amazing

730
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,060
Special effects

731
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,740
But in real life

732
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,880
The winepress of Jehovah

733
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,120
Will make the oceans

734
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,200
Turn red

735
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,660
While the can opener

736
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,600
Of Wotan

737
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,740
Looses plagues

738
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,460
Upon the sun

739
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,960
And the orange

740
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,480
Squeezer of Anubis

741
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,320
Squeezes forth

742
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,060
Foul demons

743
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,420
The vacuum cleaner

744
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,180
Of Moab

745
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,280
Shall sweep up

746
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,880
The unworthy

747
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,700
And the mulcher

748
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,820
Of Melchizedek

749
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,060
Shall make waste

750
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,460
Of their works

751
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,860
Melchizedek

752
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,100
I was always fond

753
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,600
Of that name

754
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,400
Melchizedek

755
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,020
What is it?

756
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,760
Melchizedek?

757
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,820
I think so

758
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,500
I've been

759
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,920
I sometimes call my wife

760
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,540
That to

761
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,740
To tease her

762
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,520
But doesn't that mean

763
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:34,960
One who

764
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,220
Who dishonors

765
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,020
The flatulence

766
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,460
Or something like that?

767
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:37,820
Some kind of

768
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,860
Real obscure passage

769
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,680
From the

770
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,480
Apocryphon

771
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,720
The bibliography

772
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,740
I don't know

773
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,300
The other ones

774
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:45,760
I like are

775
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,200
There's something scary

776
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,760
About it

777
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,100
Wouldn't you

778
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,680
Wouldn't you agree

779
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,220
That there's

780
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,120
It's a little scary

781
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,720
Sometimes

782
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,040
Who's the one

783
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,780
That comes before

784
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,240
Meshach and Abednego?

785
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,840
Shadrach

786
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,540
Shadrach

787
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,920
Meshach and Abednego

788
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,460
There we go

789
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,780
Now I feel right

790
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,680
I don't know who they are

791
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,880
But I know it feels good

792
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,600
To say that

793
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,060
Shadrach

794
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,300
Meshach and Abednego

795
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,300
You have to say it

796
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,680
Just that way

797
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,300
Those are biblical names

798
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,280
Of people who

799
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,540
Went to the same

800
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,500
Grocery store

801
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,320
Too often

802
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,800
And so the biblical

803
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,100
Scholars wrote about it

804
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,720
Now they're important

805
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,900
You know what I mean?

806
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,860
I know that

807
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,080
The great sage

808
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,420
Ronald Reagan

809
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,320
Once said

810
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,180
To the premier

811
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,880
Of Russia

812
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,020
You know

813
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,000
If aliens

814
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,880
From outer space

815
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,600
Ever invaded

816
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,780
All our nations

817
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,000
Would forget their differences

818
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,120
And band together

819
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,280
Of course

820
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,680
Even as he was saying that

821
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,640
Nancy's minions

822
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,260
Were making

823
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,200
Traitorous deals

824
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,120
Trying to sell out

825
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,560
The planet

826
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,440
To those punks

827
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,160
The so-called

828
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,680
Greys

829
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,620
But the greys

830
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,620
Are pipsqueaks

831
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,860
Our alien allies

832
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,880
Are like on two

833
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,300
Gods

834
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,840
Their spaceships

835
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,720
Do not crash

836
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,560
For they do not need

837
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,420
Spaceships

838
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,060
Any more than

839
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,300
Bob needs brains

840
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,320
Boy that's a powerful

841
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,940
Mouthful

842
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,760
And it bespeaks

843
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,380
The entire

844
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,120
Conundrum

845
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,160
That you're faced with

846
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,840
As the sacred scribe

847
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,060
Is to get the message out

848
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,720
All the same way

849
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,540
That Ronald Reagan

850
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,960
Was toying with

851
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,280
The adult mentality

852
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,500
You know

853
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,260
Like he had

854
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,980
Fine haircut

855
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,300
And nice

856
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,220
Well cut suit

857
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,160
With cuffs on it

858
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,060
And no frays

859
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,120
You know

860
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,760
The funny thing is

861
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,780
Reagan knew Bob

862
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,800
And was actually

863
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,200
In a band with him

864
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,420
With him and Philo

865
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,940
But he didn't tell Nancy

866
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,960
He somehow knew

867
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,020
That Nancy would put

868
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,760
The kibosh

869
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,740
On that action

870
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,720
Oh yeah

871
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,120
Of course

872
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,960
You know

873
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,140
She was a little bit

874
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,560
Old fashioned

875
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,720
And he was

876
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,760
One of the first

877
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,580
Republican leaders

878
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,800
To actually start

879
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,740
A punk band

880
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,260
A punk rock band

881
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,460
In the early 1970s

882
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,400
I think it was 73

883
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,520
He told his mom about it

884
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
But not his wife

885
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,620
Well that's the way

886
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,420
Things are when you're

887
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,000
In a punk band

888
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,740
And no one would

889
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,840
Listen to you man

890
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,060
Hey at the end of this show

891
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,100
I'm gonna play

892
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,160
I'm gonna play your song

893
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,420
Iodine 131

894
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,780
At the end of this show

895
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,180
You know I think that

896
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,260
That song should have

897
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,220
The part where I'm talking

898
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,920
About Chernobyl

899
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,600
Taken out

900
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,760
So it's more generic

901
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,140
And it should just

902
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,740
Go everywhere

903
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,820
Because they're trying

904
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,140
To do more nuclear stuff

905
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,700
Right now

906
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,200
And the Nuclear Energy

907
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,260
Commission is trying

908
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,960
To do away with some

909
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,060
Plants without making sure

910
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,660
They're safer

911
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,820
And all kinds of stuff

912
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,380
Like that

913
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,780
And it's very very strange

914
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,200
And it could be dangerous

915
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,680
I have two nephews

916
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,480
Who work at the

917
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,060
Comanche Peak Flower Power

918
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,840
Plant in North Texas

919
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,980
And they say it's

920
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,280
Perfectly safe

921
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,380
Nothing could go wrong

922
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,540
Well even our old friend

923
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,220
From the past

924
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,880
Chad Smith

925
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,760
Worked at Perry for a while

926
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,380
And he said

927
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,400
You know one of those things

928
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,180
That you look at

929
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,740
To make sure something

930
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,560
Is straight

931
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,580
And not like crooked

932
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,280
Or hanging down

933
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,760
Or low

934
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,480
It's like level

935
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,280
A bevel

936
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,540
Level

937
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,340
Yeah

938
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,060
He said they were

939
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,720
Building a whole bunch of stuff

940
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,940
On the exterior part

941
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,160
And they weren't even

942
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,900
Leveling stuff

943
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,740
They were just like

944
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,500
That's good enough

945
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,700
What year

946
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,740
What year was that?

947
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,660
That was I believe

948
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,720
In the 1970s

949
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,180
Yes

950
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,660
By the time the Comanche Peak plant

951
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,520
Was being built

952
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,840
Near Dallas

953
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,400
In Glen Rose in fact

954
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,020
It's in Glen Rose?

955
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,460
Yeah

956
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,740
My little baby sister

957
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,000
Was dating people

958
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,120
Who worked there

959
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,000
And she assures me

960
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,240
That that plant

961
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,580
Was built entirely

962
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,940
By people on quaaludes

963
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,060
All the time

964
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,140
Same with Perry

965
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,820
Because it was that same period of time

966
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,620
When everybody thought

967
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,400
A quaalude or ten

968
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,400
Would make a life more durable

969
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,360
I didn't know what they were

970
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,500
And I was

971
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:46,880
Me neither

972
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,280
I was trying to finish

973
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,600
The book of the subgenius

974
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,840
I was on a serious deadline

975
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,360
I had to drive across town

976
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,680
In my manual operated car

977
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,060
My Flintstones car

978
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,540
But I was having such bad leg cramps

979
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,580
From exhaustion and lack of sleep

980
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,900
That I needed something

981
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,140
To end the leg cramps

982
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,980
So that I could

983
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,220
Drive

984
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,680
Now imagine that

985
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,000
My friend goes

986
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,700
Well Valium would probably be

987
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,660
About right

988
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,120
But there's

989
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,040
I have this new thing

990
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,020
Called a quaalude

991
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,020
My friend said

992
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,920
They're not very strong

993
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,000
You should take two

994
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,460
I um

995
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,980
I woke up in jail

996
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,460
I woke up in jail that night

997
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,180
Perfect ending

998
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,700
Or beginning for the new story

999
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,200
Yeah

1000
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,420
And I was

1001
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,580
I was locked up with another

1002
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,960
A guy who'd been put in there

1003
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,900
For urinating in a parking lot

1004
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,740
Of a bar

1005
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:35,960
And I was like

1006
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,000
Oh my god

1007
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,620
And you thought he was Dobbs

1008
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,800
Or actually you thought

1009
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,660
He was an incarnation

1010
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,360
Of Gupta

1011
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,840
Gupta

1012
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,680
He would not shut up

1013
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,520
And I laid down there

1014
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,740
Trying to get warm

1015
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,280
You know

1016
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,040
Because they keep you

1017
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,160
Really cold in jail

1018
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,540
And they take your glasses away

1019
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,720
And I must say

1020
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,340
That night I spent in jail

1021
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,380
I heard some of the most

1022
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,660
Hilarious banter and talk

1023
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,360
By the denizens

1024
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,480
Of the other cells

1025
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,440
I couldn't see

1026
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:05,940
The guy was like

1027
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,780
The guy I was stuck with

1028
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,460
Was a jerk

1029
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,340
Wow I didn't know

1030
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,640
I heard some

1031
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,580
I couldn't sleep

1032
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,940
You can't sleep

1033
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,740
Because there's guys

1034
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,800
Just screaming jokes

1035
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,280
And stuff all night long

1036
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,060
That was in 1981 or 2

1037
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,160
And that was the last

1038
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,000
And only time

1039
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,820
I ever took one

1040
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,000
Of them kind pills Bob

1041
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,500
And speaking of which

1042
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,960
I found the original

1043
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,140
More of them kind pills

1044
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,820
Bob tape

1045
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,380
Tonight

1046
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,480
Wow

1047
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,420
On my desperate

1048
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,960
None of this means

1049
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,100
Anything to you necessarily

1050
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,920
But I found the original

1051
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,120
Well it sounds so official though

1052
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,360
Well there was

1053
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,220
There was this plaintiff

1054
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,740
Subgenius out there

1055
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,680
Real early

1056
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,420
Subgenius

1057
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,620
I'd love to take a plaintiff

1058
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:44,980
There

1059
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,020
Roberto de la Rosa

1060
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,980
He called himself

1061
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,340
And he sent us a letter

1062
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,620
Written in crayon

1063
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,340
That said

1064
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,020
More of them kind pills

1065
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,780
Bod

1066
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,020
He got the quotes on Bob

1067
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,880
But he didn't spell Bob right

1068
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,720
He spelled it Bod

1069
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,440
And we weren't sure

1070
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,640
Maybe he was trying to be deep

1071
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
Or mean something by that

1072
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,240
We just figured Bob

1073
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,600
Had hooked him on some kind of pills

1074
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,780
And he wanted a lot more

1075
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,540
And then we got a tape from him

1076
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,640
And you could hear him saying

1077
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,180
Bob

1078
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,340
Could I have a few more

1079
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,080
Of those pills

1080
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,400
Because the red trucks in Ohio

1081
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,400
And the little animals in the woods

1082
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,280
Well here's the sad thing

1083
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,000
Although Roberto de la Rosa

1084
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,920
Had another one of those pills

1085
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,240
He had another name

1086
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,100
And under that name

1087
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,320
He made some really great movies

1088
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,620
Including Invasion of the Aluminum People

1089
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,800
But he died

1090
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,980
Oh man

1091
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,320
Right after Aluminum People

1092
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,080
He went chaotic

1093
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,200
No

1094
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,520
Here's what's sad though

1095
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,260
He had just finished filming

1096
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,700
His first real feature

1097
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,640
The night he died

1098
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,980
He finished shooting

1099
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,400
Went home perfectly normal

1100
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,040
And died

1101
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,660
Had a heart attack

1102
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,880
Or some sort of other bad thing

1103
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,080
Yeah something

1104
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,040
You know nobody

1105
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,380
He's not the only old friend

1106
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,240
That that happened to

1107
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,080
But these things come around

1108
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,160
In a way

1109
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,760
His widow Sandy

1110
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,620
Had been at the honest to God

1111
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,460
Very first subgenius revival with him

1112
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,960
It was actually partly

1113
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,780
A Pink Boys band show

1114
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,420
None of us really were preaching yet

1115
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,700
But she heard about it early then

1116
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,860
And now 139 years later

1117
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,680
She's directing this documentary movie

1118
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,500
About the church

1119
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,520
And they're showing up tomorrow

1120
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,460
As you know

1121
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,400
Mainly to get a gander

1122
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,600
At the subgenius archives

1123
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,440
And get a handle

1124
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,920
On how to deal with the footage

1125
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,680
I heard they want to get a gander

1126
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,260
On more than your archives

1127
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,700
If you know what I mean

1128
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,700
Everybody's already done that

1129
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,340
But here's that

1130
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,280
There were two things

1131
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,940
That I was

1132
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,860
I really wanted to do

1133
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:05,860


1134
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:05,860


1135
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,280
I really wanted to find for him

1136
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,380
One

1137
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,200
Is the original

1138
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,300
True Dobbs head

1139
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,380
The one from which

1140
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:14,940
All

1141
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,360
All

1142
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,720
Other Bob portraits

1143
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,220
Are descendants

1144
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,760
This is a great great grandpappy

1145
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,540
Of all Dobbs heads

1146
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,180
I deliberately keep it

1147
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,620
In a hard to find place

1148
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,380
But I tried to find it

1149
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:28,720
And I did

1150
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,500
You confused yourself

1151
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,160
I did

1152
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,840
I found it

1153
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,820
And I touched it

1154
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,660
I touched it

1155
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,740
And then I spent about two hours

1156
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,580
Cleaning up

1157
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,140
A path

1158
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,740
To the oldest

1159
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,280
Most wretched

1160
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,020
Spider web covered

1161
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,460
Scorpion infested

1162
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,520
Recesses of my storage room

1163
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,840
Which really did take two hours

1164
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,740
Just to get a path clear

1165
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,840
To the oldest stuff in the back

1166
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,280
And then I started looking

1167
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,240
For the two

1168
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,540
Tapes

1169
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,700
Reel to reel tapes

1170
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,600
From Roberto de la Rosa

1171
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,580
Because his widow

1172
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,020
Asked me to find those

1173
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,560
And by golly

1174
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,200
I did

1175
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,140
Even though those were

1176
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,540
Among the very first items

1177
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,580
Mailed to us

1178
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,340
There they were

1179
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,900
Next to all the recordings

1180
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,500
Of my

1181
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,940
One and

1182
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,620
One and zero year old kids

1183
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,640
Trying to talk

1184
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:17,980
And

1185
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,460
Zero years old

1186
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,500
The very first

1187
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,280
Very first

1188
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,080
Terrible subgenius shows

1189
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,740
For all this

1190
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,700
Like from 1979

1191
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,560
1980

1192
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,720
I found it man

1193
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,500
I found it

1194
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,480
I actually put my hands

1195
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,700
On the Roberto de la Rosa tape

1196
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,420
So I'm going to be able

1197
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,320
To hand Sandy

1198
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,300
These two

1199
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:35,720
Two boxes

1200
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,500
Hand labeled

1201
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,440
By her late husband

1202
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:37,920
And say

1203
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,940
I found them

1204
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,360
I wasn't sure

1205
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,060
That I could

1206
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,680
So it was a big deal Dave

1207
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,320
It was a real

1208
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,160
Real big deal

1209
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,380
It's a real big deal man

1210
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,040
And I can feel

1211
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,660
What I can sense

1212
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,540
I feel in you brother

1213
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,900
I truly are

1214
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,000
Am not

1215
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,640
No I truly am

1216
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,500
I can understand that

1217
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,140
However it's a little bit depleted

1218
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,140
When I think of my own

1219
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,860
Personal existence

1220
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,840
Like who's going to want

1221
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,920
200 records

1222
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,220
From 200 years ago

1223
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,220
I'm not going to want

1224
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,960
Stuff like that

1225
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,900
Well you know Dave

1226
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,020
They say that

1227
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,380
A lot of people

1228
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,920
Lead lives of quiet desperation

1229
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,380
But we subgeniuses

1230
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,960
Choose to lead lives of

1231
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,700
Ear splitting desperation

1232
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,960
Yes

1233
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,320
We must have slack

1234
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,180
And instead we're getting

1235
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,200
Force fed a gross pablum

1236
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,400
Of false slack

1237
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,860
Ripped off every day

1238
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,660
And we're not going to

1239
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,920
Sit back and be polite

1240
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,060
While we're getting reamed

1241
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,440
Yeah man

1242
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,180
You said a mouthful again

1243
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,580
Once again

1244
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,200
You're full of many many many

1245
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,680
Contrite doubtful mouthfuls tonight

1246
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,360
Well I'm reading

1247
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,800
The power pack and power punch

1248
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,900
The truth of the gospel

1249
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,900
Of Norad and Starzak

1250
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,380
The both of them

1251
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:47,880
You know

1252
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,280
Working out in the same gym

1253
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,260
At the same time

1254
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,280
What a disgusting

1255
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,260
Ill feature

1256
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,480
Hey speaking of

1257
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,320
The end of the world

1258
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,560
And X day in 1998

1259
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,140
And that big party we throw

1260
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,940
In southern Ohio

1261
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,960
What

1262
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,520
Today is June 11th

1263
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,960
So that means it's like

1264
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,300
Way less than a month

1265
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,280
Before the end of the year

1266
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,380
And we're going to be

1267
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:05,380


1268
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,060
Where the X's are here

1269
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,420
And in fact I have to

1270
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,960
Haul all of our

1271
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,860
Swag and displays

1272
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,140
And the guy that we're

1273
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,700
Going to sacrifice

1274
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,140
And the Bob dummy

1275
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,640
All down to Athens area

1276
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,200
It's a five hour drive

1277
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,160
I've got to do that

1278
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,660
In about a week

1279
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,640
And leave the stuff there

1280
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,820
Then I have to drive back

1281
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,780
Then I have to pick up

1282
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,360
Dr. Hal

1283
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,260
And my mother in law

1284
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,160
And the dog

1285
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,660
And the pretty girl

1286
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,260
And drive back to Athens

1287
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,260


1288
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,260


1289
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,260


1290
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,260


1291
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,260


1292
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,260


1293
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,260


1294
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,260


1295
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,260


1296
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,940
And drive back to Wisteria

1297
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,940
And host the party

1298
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,280
Of at least ten people

1299
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,500
Plus some filmmakers

1300
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,900
Well you sound very happy to do so

1301
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,400
Especially some of the brain damage

1302
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,560
You suffered over the last few months

1303
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,960
And I certainly identify with you

1304
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,360
And I'm not apathetic

1305
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,540
In the least small barriers

1306
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,560
If I could help

1307
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,880
In any way I could help you

1308
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,740
I certainly would

1309
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,500
I'd even you know

1310
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,800
Like a GoFundMe situation

1311
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,240
Don't you have to repent Coach Mark?

1312
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:05,240


1313
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,020
It's a very delicate part of the brain

1314
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,020
Which is nearly impossible to operate on

1315
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,140
But I would still stand up in the smalls

1316
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,680
And wear my waistcoats for you

1317
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,980
Well wouldn't you have to repent

1318
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,840
Quit your job

1319
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,500
And slack off to do that?

1320
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,740
Oh that second part would be so sweet

1321
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,440
Those girls would love to have you

1322
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,360
On July 3rd and 4th

1323
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,740
Which are the two main days

1324
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,140
They're going to be trying to shoot people

1325
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,240
With their practice weapons

1326
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,040
They're disguised as cameras

1327
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,480
And everybody who goes to X Day

1328
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,440
Will probably end up being in the movie

1329
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,740
Unless they don't want to be

1330
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,760
In which case they should sit in the back

1331
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:48,880
You might have to form a release

1332
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,240
Or some sort of other kind of thing

1333
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,780
That could kill you possibly

1334
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,520
You know everybody does sign a release

1335
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,960
It's just built into the fine print

1336
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,820
Of walking through the gates

1337
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,540
You have signed a release that says

1338
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,940
If my grandma sees my

1339
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,240
Pregnant mother

1340
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:05,240


1341
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,820
Privates on the internet

1342
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,620
As a result of me being here

1343
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,280
That's my fault and not Reverend Stang's

1344
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,340
Well I think you should start a

1345
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,740
Facey campaign right now

1346
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,160
That will put all those rumors to rest

1347
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,360
And give them enough NyQuil

1348
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,400
That they don't wake up tomorrow

1349
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:22,980
You know what I'm saying?

1350
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,400
No no that's a Jonestown thing

1351
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,660
Just walk into a room and pull off

1352
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,520
Your tie and your shirt and your knuckles

1353
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,840
And just start slapping the waiters

1354
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,380
And waitresses

1355
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,220
And make obscure curses that nobody knows

1356
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,000
That really gets them going

1357
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,540
You know like

1358
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,380
And they can tell it's swearing

1359
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,720
Even though it's in Mixolydian

1360
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,820
Which is you know Harcourt and Brace 1992

1361
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,020
That's a long time ago you know

1362
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,680
Yeah nobody understands those big words anymore

1363
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,720
They don't even know you're cussing

1364
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,040
Yup

1365
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,000
You say words like exemplary

1366
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,660
Instead of awesome and they think

1367
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,660
Ooh he said something dirty I know that was dirty

1368
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,140
Right that's what the first thing that comes to their mind

1369
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,360
Is he's thinking about my orifice

1370
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,620
Or he sees

1371
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,200
Wanting me to her to think of

1372
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,240
Her orifices

1373
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,240
Well

1374
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,540
And I'm not you know I'm

1375
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,240
Sure Dave sure you're not

1376
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,320
Bigger than any other old fella

1377
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,220
I've been to the churchyard and seen my ancestors

1378
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,260
Laying in the coffins the way they used to do it

1379
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,980
Back in the days of

1380
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,840
Spanish influenza

1381
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,380
And pre-consternation

1382
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,260
Revelry

1383
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,380
A lot of it was due to that

1384
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,540
Well you know

1385
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:35,220
If you go to subgenius.com

1386
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,160
On the internet

1387
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,420
I think it's called

1388
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,660
And look at the

1389
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,760
Ancient events

1390
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,460
Of yore

1391
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,700
And the x-day drills

1392
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:47,940
Which this

1393
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,540
We've drilled for x-day 21 times

1394
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,240
And yet to hit oil

1395
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,080
Starting in 1996

1396
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,700
That was when the first drill was

1397
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,340
But man

1398
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,300
Every all the ladies took their shirts off

1399
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:02,980
At that one

1400
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,700
In 97

1401
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,780
98 and 99

1402
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,040
Which was

1403
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,880
2000 was triple x-day

1404
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,340
Oh

1405
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,680
Everybody would jump into the

1406
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:15,800
Baptismal pond

1407
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,040
In their skivvies

1408
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,980
Start naked

1409
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,780
And after those years

1410
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,820
You start to see fewer and fewer

1411
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,520
In fact you start seeing holes in the picture galleries

1412
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,300
Where one

1413
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,460
Lady or boy or another

1414
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,140
Wrote to me and said

1415
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,220
I hate for you to have to do this but my mom

1416
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,580
Is on the internet now

1417
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,660
And I don't want her to see my fat butt

1418
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,980
Running around naked with all those boys

1419
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,740
And I would take them down

1420
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,120
And I

1421
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,100
We're talking about this

1422
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,640
We were talking about this the other day

1423
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,700
The spread of the pocket phones

1424
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,360
With cameras

1425
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,620
Has ended most

1426
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,480
Fun nudity

1427
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,540
At those

1428
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,680
At those naked camp

1429
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,960
Or those clothing optional campgrounds

1430
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,100
That is a very very interesting observation

1431
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,940
And worthy of a full 1200

1432
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,420
Word article

1433
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,900
Has have smartphones

1434
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,240
Done away with nudity

1435
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,520
Or sky clad

1436
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,600
Yeah yeah

1437
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,920
Done away with a lot more than that

1438
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,820
The first couple of star woods I went to

1439
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,880
This is quite true

1440
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,060
More than once I had to step

1441
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,060
Over copulating

1442
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,080
Hippies in the middle of

1443
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,760
The trail heading for

1444
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,540
As I was trying to get to the bonfire

1445
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,440
Or whatever

1446
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,500
And that just

1447
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,620
You don't see that anymore

1448
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,340
Maybe they just hide now

1449
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,860
I wonder if burning man is that way

1450
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,740
When I went to burning man in 2001

1451
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,860
I saw people doing stuff

1452
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,580
In a phone booth

1453
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,500
In the middle of the desert

1454
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,160
Or they were

1455
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,920
Finishing up when I came along

1456
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,540
And

1457
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,200
But I

1458
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,680
It's like now there's cameras

1459
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:00,940
Everywhere

1460
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,760
And your grandma is one of the cops

1461
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:05,780
Yep

1462
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,380
I had sex at brushwood a couple times

1463
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,100
During days of

1464
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,680
Of

1465
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,260
X day and stuff

1466
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,920
Everybody did besides me

1467
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,220
Everybody did but me

1468
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,620
I never did

1469
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,320
Yes you did your wife would company you many times

1470
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,340
And still does

1471
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,380
And man I'm working

1472
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,500
I'm working at those things

1473
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,640
No you have

1474
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,000
You've taken too far too many things for vanity

1475
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,220
I don't want to talk about this

1476
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,180
You're making me uneasy

1477
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,740
I know it makes you nauseous

1478
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,760
And then we have to put up with everything that follows that

1479
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:41,740
Okay

1480
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,380
No it's getting too turned on

1481
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,000
I don't want to break the station

1482
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,580
Oh no man

1483
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,040
You've gone too far

1484
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,060
Now here's another thing

1485
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,540
That you and me have to

1486
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,140
Well now you've already done your work

1487
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,260
I have to finish it up

1488
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,760
We have to finish neighbor world

1489
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,420
I just have to go in and fix the spelling

1490
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,580
And some typing things here and there

1491
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,720
And that way we can have like

1492
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,340
We can

1493
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:11,160
We can sell out of the books at X day

1494
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,880
So I'm going to print at least ten of them

1495
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,640
Oh that would be wonderful

1496
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,220
It's a novel friends

1497
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,280
Listeners it's a novel by Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1498
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,780
And it's great

1499
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,340
It actually makes a lot more sense

1500
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,520
Than he does normally

1501
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,060
But yet it's kind of in that same

1502
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,120
Dave-ish style

1503
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,880
You'll see oh you'll see

1504
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,840
You'll see

1505
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,060
You'll see one of these days

1506
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,280
You look around and you'll see

1507
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:38,720
You'll see

1508
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,720
That sounds like the name of an Asiatic bear

1509
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,940
Somebody that Comrade Truton

1510
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,200
Or Mr. Poopin would

1511
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,740
You'll see

1512
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,800
My love bear

1513
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,660
You'll see

1514
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,660
Oh wait we're not supposed to talk about bears

1515
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,940
In the same show as X-Day

1516
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,880
Because there was that one person

1517
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,980
You know bears were invading the county I live in

1518
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,940
And they've eaten a bunch of

1519
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,520
And that was the front page of the newspaper

1520
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,300
Was a knocked over beehive

1521
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,440
So bears really do go after beehives

1522
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,800
So bears really do go after beehives

1523
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,060
To them it was like

1524
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,940
Oh man thanks a lot

1525
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,280
This is great

1526
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,220
And they yeah

1527
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,620
And they yeah

1528
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,800
Same reason why the bees

1529
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,440
Do all the

1530
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,560
Sanctified fruit

1531
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,720
After Mass and sometimes

1532
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,520
They eat different other particulates

1533
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,300
Are you really getting bears in Ashtabula again

1534
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,140
Are you really getting bears in Ashtabula again

1535
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:35,860
I think the bears here are going to think

1536
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,920
There's a bear alive in the neighborhood

1537
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,760
Let's not call the ODNR

1538
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,520
Let's kill the bear and show that we're brave hunters

1539
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,180
It's where they just had a

1540
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,180
A big scandal involving

1541
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,800
Processing deer meat

1542
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,180
Where the guy was doing this scam

1543
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,080
Where he was killing hundreds of deer

1544
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:53,900
And he wasn't hunting

1545
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,740
He was just killing all these deer

1546
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,400
Through a series of traps and other things like that

1547
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,940
And then he'd sell the smoked meat

1548
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,740
For different venison products

1549
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,920
In the area when you go to the gas station

1550
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,640
And get a slim jinky

1551
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,900
So he was a poacher

1552
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,640
He was a poacher

1553
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,320
That's what they called it in the newspaper

1554
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,140
I wish that guy lived in my neighborhood

1555
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,700
I seriously do

1556
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,180
I wish that guy would come and turn

1557
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,360
Most of the deer in my backyard

1558
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,640
Most of the deer in my backyard

1559
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,600
Into venison jerky

1560
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,140
Because they're eating everything

1561
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,360
Because they're eating everything

1562
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,620
And they're miserable

1563
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,440
They're wretched

1564
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,140
They're as bad as the subgeniuses in the winter

1565
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,300
They live in vacant lots and stuff

1566
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,100
I don't live in my yard most of the time

1567
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,580
The other day I was walking down the street

1568
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,900
With my giant hound dog

1569
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,400
Right in the middle of Taylor

1570
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,240
Well on the sidewalk of a busy highway

1571
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,240
Taylor, South Taylor Road

1572
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:54,600
And I noticed that there was a large reddish deer

1573
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,260
Strolling alongside me

1574
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,540
About three feet away

1575
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,800
And the dog didn't care

1576
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,580
And the deer didn't care

1577
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,980
And I thought what is going on here?

1578
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,880
Am I the only one in this?

1579
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,180
I didn't care

1580
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,440
Mammy said I had no more hair

1581
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

1582
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,980
I just don't know

1583
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,920
How could that be?

1584
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,500
It is very weird

1585
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,880
But I do know that Cleveland has had a deer problem

1586
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,000
For like about almost 30 years

1587
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
They used to have to send guys from the ODNR

1588
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,280
Out to the emerald necklace

1589
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,580
As they like to call it

1590
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,220
They don't have those guys anymore

1591
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,880
No they don't

1592
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,260
They gutted that

1593
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,920
They let them do as they please

1594
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,440
The dirty rotten deers

1595
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,700
The animal control has been gutted

1596
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,000
In the name of conservative freedom

1597
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,780
What else has been gutted?

1598
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,240
Well pretty much everything has been gutted

1599
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,760
Anything that involves cleaning up

1600
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,900
Or making things better

1601
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,880
Environmentally safer

1602
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,260
Has become gutted

1603
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,980
Even on the plus side

1604
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,780
The IRS doesn't have anywhere near enough people

1605
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,720
To audit me

1606
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,120
And I'm not saying that

1607
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,120


1608
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,280
Now that's true

1609
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,940
If you want to put them in that way

1610
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:09,700
I would take

1611
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:14,040
I would take a whole Ben Arthur feature

1612
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,100
Of folks and under folks

1613
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,400
To get to you

1614
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,180
Show your taxes

1615
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,820
That's what they were saying to me

1616
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,760
Oh boy

1617
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,880
Show your taxes

1618
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,720
And I was like okay

1619
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,540
I'll just unbuckle my pants

1620
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,460
Take a look at this

1621
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,920
My tax here buddy

1622
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,860
You like my big old tax?

1623
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,400
You have to say the chocolate cake was really great

1624
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,480
It was really great

1625
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,500
It really was

1626
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,320
So Dave

1627
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,980
I just want to be more believable

1628
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,200
I'm sorry

1629
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,600
Do you know that it's almost 10 o'clock?

1630
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,100
It's almost 10 o'clock

1631
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,780
Do you know where Manny and Pappy is?

1632
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,140
Pappy's in heaven

1633
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,880
Taking over Jesus' job

1634
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,760
He showed up there and said

1635
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,300
You did a good job Jesus

1636
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,000
Let me show you how a pro does it

1637
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,100
Well that's nice

1638
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:05,940
That's my father's service

1639
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,860
My father did not want anybody else

1640
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,560
To talk about God or Jesus

1641
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,080
He threw in one thing about his God

1642
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,500
At the very very end

1643
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,680
Of his own eulogy

1644
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,240
And then said nobody else is to say anything

1645
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,240
Well the preacher had to get up

1646
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,000
And go I just know you was meeting Jesus now

1647
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,420
And I told the preacher later

1648
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,080
I said I'm sure he is meeting Jesus

1649
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,160
And he's probably telling him what he did wrong

1650
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,620
That's my Pappy

1651
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,080
Don't be so sure preacher boy

1652
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,120
My Pappy's in heaven

1653
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:38,000
Even though my Pappy taught Bible studies

1654
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,200
In the Methodist church

1655
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,460
As could I if I wanted to

1656
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,740
He was an atheist

1657
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,860
And didn't believe in any of that stuff

1658
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,140
He just knew a lot about it

1659
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,420
So your father believed in aliens?

1660
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,980
Is that what you're saying?

1661
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,300
That he was a biblical scholar

1662
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,820
Who actually believed in aliens?

1663
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,200
No he was a biblical scholar

1664
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,980
Who didn't believe in much of anything

1665
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,380
Oh okay

1666
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:01,640
He said I was raised a secular

1667
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,220
You know junior scientist

1668
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,020
That was always my religion

1669
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,300
Yeah I had a little chemistry set

1670
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,100
I tried to make things blow up

1671
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,660
But they made them too safe

1672
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,420
You know they just get smoky and stinky

1673
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,560
Hey get this man

1674
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,240
I made a grasshopper invisible

1675
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,840
I was just randomly mixing chemicals

1676
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,400
Without writing down what it was

1677
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,440
I painted a grasshopper with it

1678
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,840
I turned around and the grasshopper

1679
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,700
Had totally gone invisible

1680
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,100
But I couldn't even remember the formula

1681
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,320
The grasshopper didn't jump away from you

1682
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,320
As you turned around?

1683
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,440
What?

1684
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,960
Oh no I was being very scientific about this

1685
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,040
Anyway speaking of science

1686
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,820
We have to play your song Dave

1687
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,240
My song?

1688
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:42,760
Yeah

1689
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,520
My song

1690
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,680
Iodine 131

1691
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,700
That love song

1692
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,500
It's a love song about chemicals

1693
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,380
And gutting the restrictions

1694
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,820
I know Iodine

1695
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:58,080
I heard somebody babbling on about iodine

1696
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,020
131 just the other day

1697
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,880
And I guess it's much worse than I portrayed in the song

1698
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,120
Of course you can't believe everything you see on the internet

1699
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:06,960
Or hear on the radio

1700
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,940
Or the television

1701
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,460
You can't believe anything

1702
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,680
Except what your buddies say on twitter

1703
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,100
Yeah 3x

1704
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:14,660
You can't believe that

1705
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,800
It has to pass your three levels of jawbone

1706
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,920
Okay anyway

1707
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,820
We have to go Dave

1708
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:21,520
It's the end of the show

1709
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,980
I'm going to fade you out and play your music

1710
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,860
Why don't I just go ahead and play the music now?

1711
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:28,620
I'm going to do a soft stroke

1712
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,920
My metabolism mom just sitting here

1713
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,280
Yeah I know what you're going to do

1714
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,000
You do not

1715
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:34,620
Yeah

1716
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,080
Continue

1717
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:39,340
Continue

1718
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,980
Well I said Chernobyl was so long ago

1719
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,960
Nothing to worry about

1720
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,540
And now I hear in the news

1721
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,800
These dumb guys in the Department of Energy

1722
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,840
And the Defense Department

1723
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,660
Are going to start building a bunch of Chernobyl's

1724
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,980
Across the United States

1725
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,440
And then I hear on the news that Chernobyl

1726
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:58,820
Is really over now

1727
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,900
All these people are dying

1728
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,840
It's all the pollution is getting into the water

1729
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,320
It's getting into the aquifers

1730
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,140
Everything goes

1731
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,480
It's all 121

1732
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,880
The distance between Kiev and Cleveland

1733
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,260
No man we're getting to

1734
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,200
Drill Lake Erie

1735
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,340
You know

1736
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,440
And then I started thinking

1737
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,320
How come my movements are getting so

1738
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,280
Drill-y

1739
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,140
The iodine

1740
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:28,720
131

1741
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,800
Has got my thyroid

1742
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,160
On the run

1743
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,220
And the Krypton

1744
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,620
85

1745
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,020
Is making it hard

1746
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,380
Just to stay alive

1747
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,200
But the iodine

1748
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,800
131

1749
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,520
The iodine

1750
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,840
131

1751
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,320
No more running to the metal planes

1752
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,140
No more boiling the mud

1753
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:54,740
Power powers in the power scene

1754
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,740
Shake the bony hand

1755
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,560
Smash the battlefield

1756
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:16,580
And pull the trigger

1757
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,460
The iodine

1758
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,100
131

1759
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,760
The iodine

1760
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,440
131

1761
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,480
The iodine

1762
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:25,480


1763
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:25,480


1764
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:25,480


1765
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,560
No more running to the metal planes

1766
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,080
No more blowing the mud

1767
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:28,080


1768
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:28,080


1769
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:28,080


1770
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,380
No more barefoot in the mud.

1771
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,060
Shake the bony hand of the poison man.

1772
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,540
Shake the bony hand of Jacob.

1773
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:38,700
Evacuate.

1774
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,220
Evacuate.

1775
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,380
Evacuate.

1776
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:42,720
Evacuate.

1777
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,320
Evacuate.

1778
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,280
So there's over 2 million known pollutants.

1779
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,340
That can cause cancer.

1780
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:50,860
Pancreatitis.

1781
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:51,920
Bad disease.

1782
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:52,760
Bad breathing.

1783
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,540
Gingeritis.

1784
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,960
Bad breath.

1785
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,140
Acne.

1786
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,240
What's the use?

1787
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,980
The iodine.

1788
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,560
A 1, 3, 1.

1789
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,920
Has got my thyroid on the run.

1790
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,100
And the krypton.

1791
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,080
A 8, 8, 5.

1792
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,120
Is making it hard just to stay alive.

1793
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,080
But the iodine.

1794
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,680
A 1, 3, 1.

1795
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,380
The iodine.

1796
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,980
A 1, 3, 1.

1797
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:23,100
No more running through the metal lanes.

1798
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,940
No more barefoot in the mud.

1799
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,760
Shake the bony hand of the poison man.

1800
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,140
Shake the bony hand of Jacob.

1801
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,200
No more running through the metal lanes.

1802
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,020
No more barefoot in the mud.

1803
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,900
Shake the bony hand of the poison man.

1804
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,360
Shake the bony hand of Jacob.

1805
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,620
Shake it!

1806
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,280
Shake it!

1807
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,160
Shake the bony hand of the poison man.

1808
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,660
Oh, almost forgot.

1809
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:07,100
Friends, that background music we were playing while Dave and I were on the air on the phone,

1810
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:16,580
that was Cyber Chump, which is a band of, I think, just two or three folks that is associated also with exposed foreheads.

1811
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:22,640
Cyber Chump, the construction of things, was the name of that particular album.

1812
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:23,700
Thank you.
