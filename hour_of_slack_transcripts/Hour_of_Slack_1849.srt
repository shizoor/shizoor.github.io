1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,500
Here, look.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,440
Yeah?

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,740
Just look around.

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,760
The smart money knows the truth.

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:09,900
Fucker.

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,720
I'm getting on the ground floor.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,100
The Soul Genius.

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,860
Power of Swag.

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,880
Have you looked at them?

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,020
Crooks, gangsters, bums, hobos, drunks, and I don't know what.

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,040
They are a little picturesque, aren't they?

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,640
But what kind of a society are you going to start with them?

13
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,580
Snobbish, are you?

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,000
To make a decent place, you need bums and alcoholics and criminals.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,520
Oh, well, I guess so.

17
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:49,920
The Bible prophecy is a very, very important subject for every Christian to study,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,980
to help you better understand current events, to put things in perspective,

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,320
and most importantly, to help you have that inner peace of knowing

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,560
that God...

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,120
God...

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,700
is on His throne and in control.

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,960
Uh, I'd like to go to the lake and...

24
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,020
And a month of peace will be introduced.

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,060
And people will have a number in their hand and in their forehead.

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,220
Someone with a lot of energy.

27
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:16,800
Uh-huh.

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,180
Yeah.

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,180
Okay, your code number once more?

30
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,840
237.

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,140
237, and you're calling from Dallas.

32
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,360
Okay, thank you.

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:23,980
Thank you.

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,520
Bye-bye.

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,020
Hi, you're on Hotline.

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,180
You can start...

37
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,220
Yes, my code number is...

38
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,100
Amen.

39
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,400
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,840
Praise the Lord.

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,880
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.

42
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,220
Amen.

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,680
They're going to get worse and worse.

44
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:50,780
Hey!

45
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,140
Hey!

46
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,380
Hey!

47
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:57,660


48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:57,680


49
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,340

00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,340

00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,340

00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,340

00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:58,800

00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:58,800


57
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:58,800


58
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,000
Hey!

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000


60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000


61
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000


62
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000


63
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000


64
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000


65
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,140
Hey!

66
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,140


67
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,220


68
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,240
Doctors warn.

69
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,400
It's going to be a sad time, amen, when Jesus comes back.

70
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,520
If we're not walking by the same rules and minding the same things.

71
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,340
So many people are confused about it and got their own theory about the way they see the Word of God.

72
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:14,840
But I...

73
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,480
All the signs point to serious health damage.

74
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,800
All the signs point to thousands and thousands and thousands of cancers and birth deformities and miscarriages and awful health problems.

75
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,560
Both sides will be destroyed regardless of who starts it.

76
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,840
The minute you have another war, there's not going to be any war left, I don't think.

77
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,860
Because we're going to blow one another to pieces.

78
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,220
Peace on earth.

79
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,420
Peace on earth.

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,940
Peace on earth.

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,120
P-O-E.

82
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,940
Purity of essence.

83
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,460
I give my vote for Jesus and I thank God for you and Brother Robinson.

84
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,100
Because in this day and time, we don't know what we're going to come to.

85
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,940
Are you familiar with the government prepared cancer maps?

86
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,060
There's not going to be anything left for the kids.

87
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,580
I mean, there's not going to be a world left.

88
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,740
And we're all going to end up digging our own holes.

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,060
And as soon as we dig them, they're going to fall in on us.

90
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,940
I don't think anybody would know what to do.

91
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,760
Even possibly the President.

92
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,440
So we're still going to be hiding this stuff underground.

93
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,260
I personally feel that the President of the United States is evading the issue of hazardous waste in America today.

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,920
I can't really play the guitar very well.

95
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,200
Or sing.

96
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,200


97
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,200


98
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,740

Reading pornhubs, terms of service, going for a drive.

Total disassociation, fully out your mind.

Googling derealization, hating what you find.

155

Bad on appearance.

156
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,280
Preparing summer air in early fall.

There it is again, that funny feeling.

Hey what can you say?

161
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,720
We were overdue.

162
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,700
But it will be over soon.

163
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,000

Hey what can you say?

I pulled that funny feeling by Bo Burnham off YouTube at the suggestion of Reverend Blackout.

182
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:35,580
Good suggestion because it fits perfectly into the theme of this hour of Slack number 1849,

183
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,120
The End of the World, also known as Subgenius Media Barrage at number four.

184
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,680
Some of our Media Barrage albums,

185
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,200
from the early 1980s, are on CD or streaming,

186
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,100
but Media Barrage number four stayed on tape since 1981

187
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,060
and is basically unheard by modern so-called audiences.

188
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,540
When this was edited on reel-to-reel tape, largely by me,

189
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,060
there were only about 273 known subgeniuses.

190
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,540
This episode will be a mix of the very old

191

with the just-finished,

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,400
because we have two more recent original songs coming up

193
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,580
that probably haven't been broadcast much before.

194
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,540
But let's plunge into the toxic radioactive swamp

195
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,160
that is our future,

196
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,180
as prophesied in Subgenius Media Barrage tape number four.

197
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,260
He's with Wonder Woman and her incredible powers of strength and agility.

198
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,700
At six, it's Kirk Spock and the crew of the Starship Enterprise.

199
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,720
The only cult they want to talk about is the Subgenius Foundation,

200
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,700
the Church of the Subgenius,

201
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,640
and the only reason they talk about it is for the money.

202
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,520
We're going to go to the phones right now.

203
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,900
Good evening, you're on KFJZ with Mr. Opinion and Dr. Philo Drummond

204
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,220
and the Reverend Arnold Stang, Ivan Stang.

205
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,300
I have a question for Mr. Drummond.

206
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,800
Yes, go ahead.

207
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,300
Are you Mr. Drummond?

208
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,900
That's right.

209
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,140
I'm calling from Dallas.

210
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,040
What's your question?

211
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,400
Well, do you work on spiritual problems or do you just work on wallets?

212
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,680
We will help you out.

213
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:14,680


214
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,600
We will help you out spiritually, of course.

215
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,520
It helps if we can have some financial assistance.

216
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,520
We sell $10 memberships.

217
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,300
And once you start getting our newsletter,

218
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,660
you start receiving lessons on how to conduct your life

219
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,880
in the most beneficial way for both you and us.

220
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:53,540
Perhaps you've been deceived by evangelists masquerading as angels of light.

221
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,480
He's gone, and the world is waiting for who?

222
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,380
Well, the world's not believers entirely.

223
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,840
They're waiting for the Antichrist.

224
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,520
They don't know they are.

225
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,260
But who's going to come in 10 days but the one who says to Israel,

226
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,300
you need protection?

227
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,600
As we said, have made the club and...

228
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,020
Hello?

229
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,660
Hi.

230
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,340
Hi.

231
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,580
May I speak to Reverend Stang?

232
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,360
Oh, yeah.

233
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,240
You got me?

234
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,540
Reverend Stang?

235
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,400
Right.

236
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:17,760
Yeah.

237
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,020
I called to ask, as far as your belief is concerned,

238
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,180
are you a Christian and do you believe in God and the Bible?

239
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,900
We believe in everything.

240
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,780
You do?

241
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,400
Mm-hmm.

242
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,620
The reason I asked is I was intrigued by what you brought out

243
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,120
about using the word conspiracy and I was wondering if you believed

244
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,680
in the fact that Jesus Christ is saved yesterday, today, and forever,

245
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,680
and do you believe that he still has a truth?

246
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:44,840
Do you believe that he's going to come back?

247
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:44,840


248
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:44,840


249
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,960
I mean, I think the truth pops in these last days and he did in Moses and Elijah.

250
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,640
Well, I'll tell you what.

251
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,320
We've been, in the course of our research, we've been getting a whole lot of stuff in

252
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
the mail about the Second Coming.

253
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,180
A lot of other cults are talking about the Second Coming and how Jesus is going to come

254
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,840
back or sometimes it goes by other names, that Christ is going to come back.

255
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,780
And the main thing that the Subgenius Foundation has to say about that is beware of cheap imitations.

256
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,320
There are a lot of false prophets running around right now and a lot of people that

257
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,300
are, in the next 20 or 30 years, there are going to be a lot of people trying to convince

258
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,640
you that they are Jesus back on earth.

259
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,260
Oh, yes.

260
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,500
I've, as a born-again Christian, I've seen that in the Spirit, too.

261
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,720
I know exactly what you're talking about.

262
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,600
I'll make a peace agreement with you.

263
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,400
The only reason America still stands is there's a remnant of Christians who are still praying

264
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,760
for a spiritual awakening in this world.

265
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,000
The Church of the Living God is preaching and believing and looking for the coming

266
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
of Jesus Christ.

267
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,160
There is a way out.

268
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,160
There is an escape route.

269
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,260
This world is destined for destruction.

270
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,460
It's doomed and it's damned according to the Word of God.

271
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,340
But Jesus is coming for a Church.

272
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,180
He's going to get His bride out of this world.

273
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Point one.

274
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,260
I am tonight.

275
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,100
I am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the United States.

276
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:26,780
Beginning this moment, this nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977.

277
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,220
Never.

278
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,080
Mangalore, he was a Mangalore.

279
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,660
One drama song too many.

280
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,360
It was flourishing long ago.

281
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,860
Now it's called Iran you know.

282
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,940
In our hearts and many more ways.

283
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,120
America, we're growing your way.

284
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,700
There are two ways to get to Tehran.

285
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,220
Sooner or later.

286
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,660
To get there sooner, fly Iran Air.

287
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,280
Only Iran Air flies from New York to Tehran non-stop.

288
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,680
You arrive in the afternoon in time for dinner and a good night's sleep.

289
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,140
You wake up refreshed.

290
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,520
On other airlines you arrive after dark, often much later.

291
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,040
Fly to Tehran the fastest way on Iran Air.

292
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,820
Try the urgent way to fly.

293
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,320
The best way is to see the sky.

294
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,160
Serving you in many more ways.

295
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,320
Iran Air is rolling your way.

296
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,840
Remember, you're only one stop from London, Paris or Tehran on Iran Air.

297
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,800
Do what I say.

298
00:14:40,140 --> 00:15:00,980
And you get there just once.

299
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,560
There is the other highway coming your way.

300
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:03,760
range trajectory.

301
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:03,760


302
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:03,760


303
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:03,760


304
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,100
Let's fly, let's fly, let's fly.

305
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,120
The plane is tracking down the moratorium.

306
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,600
This is깊

307
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,200
More proof that a cork really works.

308
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,180
Marvin L. Kosnowski, president of Kosnowski Corks, is proud of his corks.

309
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,640
I am proud of my corks.

310
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,800
Ask your friendly cork dealer for a file for today.

311
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,600
If you itch, you need soft and soothe.

312
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,080
Swimming, you know.

313
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,060
High temperature today, 100 degrees even.

314
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,880
That makes it the 63rd day this summer that we've been there.

315
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,000
Well, actually this year, because almost the entire...

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And if weather conditions had been different, the toxic cloud released might have blown over Manhattan.

317
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,660
And it's scary, it's damn scary, especially with the fact that I've got two kids.

318
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,660
If I normally die with these chemicals, what's it going to do?

319
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,220
Pyro XX helps keep you extra, extra dry.

320
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,060
Let your fears well up.

321
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,800
You have them.

322
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,120
Now do it.

323
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,120


324
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,660
Don't deny them their chance to claim your soul.

325
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,640
Know that within every man is a monster.

326
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:26,240
And this monster may create a monster.

327
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,200
A Frankenstein monster to bring your realistic world crashing down around you.

328
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,020
You say it can't.

329
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,560
Be true.

330
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,920
Be true.

331
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,900
There are some 50,000 nuclear weapons in the world today.

332
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,800
I think we really need nuclear weapons because Russia and everybody else has got them.

333
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:57,180
Jesus began to give to them the signs of his coming and the end of the age.

334
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:03,160
And one of the signs he referred to was the abomination of desolation that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet.

335
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,540
This hasn't taken place yet.

336
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,700
Just don't buy your doomsday theory.

337
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,700
Well, you better buy it.

338
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:18,400
We are in worse shape from the point of view of our military preparedness than we were on the 8th of December 1941, the day after the Pearl Harbor attack.

339
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,140
The Russians got the definite advantage on us right now.

340
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,400
We need to show more strength.

341
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,260
We got to catch up and get ahead of them or we're dead meat.

342
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:37,160
Exactly as Noah getting into the ark triggered the deluge that destroyed the earth in his day and that it's very highly possible that when this all takes place, that a great cataclysmic,

343
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,440
judgment will do that very thing.

344
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,580
And we do not know that it wouldn't happen in 1982, but we don't know what day it'll happen.

345
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:53,440
This article was referring, as I said, to the nine planets in our solar system, Mercury, Earth, Mars, Uranus, Pluto, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and Neptune.

346
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:59,360
When these are scheduled to be perfectly aligned in 1982, that these things perhaps can happen.

347
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:06,400
Many scientists with varying ideas of what could happen would have expressed their views that huge solar flares will take place.

348
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:12,660
Resulting that could be disruptions in the television and radio communication and a great deal more.

349
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,360
I see that I'm not going to have much time to go into this anymore today.

350
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,820
And so I'm going to carry it through tomorrow and try to bring it to a to a more clear climax.

351
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,860
But may I tell you that all of these are warnings to us to repent of our sins and to get ready for the coming of the Lord.

352
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:36,380
For we can see great and drastic things that are going to take place on the earth when Jesus comes and the judgments of God are being poured out upon a Christ rejecting man.

353
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:36,660
World.

354
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,060
But after we come through here and we purified through this plant here, it takes out some of the chemicals in the mud out of it.

355
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,900
But you can't drink.

356
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,820
We can't drink it.

357
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,640
No, well, you can drink it unless you hold your nose.

358
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,560
The ice to the sun to be meltdown.

359
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,940
Expected the week is going to be and to stop on it.

360
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:04,240
But I have no fear because London is round and I live by the river.

361
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,740
It.

362
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:05,940
It.

363
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,200
It.

364
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,360
It.

365
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


366
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


367
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


368
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


369
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


370
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


371
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


372
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


373
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


374
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


375
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


376
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


377
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


378
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


379
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


380
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


381
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


382
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


383
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


384
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


385
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


386
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


387
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,360


388
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,680
It's coming to you about the prelude to Armageddon and also some of the strange events that have been forecasted for 1982.

389
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,140
Some of the things that are coming in these last days.

390
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,940
Hey, you know, the future is a magnetic place.

391
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,120
Each year 100 billion are born into it.

392
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,740
Why, it seems all roads lead to tomorrow.

393
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,840
Why, just looking at the future isn't chatting.

394
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:35,200
I was the long conveyor belt where all inspiring holograms are as much a part of the experience of every man.

395
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,120
As for the.

396
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,940
the real trees, mountains and sunsets of the dark past.

397
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,900
It's thrilling to wander amidst these realistic 3D images,

398
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,180
and you'll certainly feel at home,

399
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,020
since the leaders here have chosen the architecture of the mediocritons of the middle class ages

400
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,780
as the most relaxing and appeasing of all art forms.

401
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,820
It could be the old world charm of suburbs and franchises,

402
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,860
or power plants and office buildings,

403
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,440
which might suddenly change to lovely forests and pastures.

404
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,280
But wherever you go, you're still amidst the clean, ever-changing holograms of the future,

405
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,720
made possible by the amazing hologram projectors

406
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,660
and the careful planning of the folks behind the scenes.

407
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,920
And it won't put a dent in your budget,

408
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,500
since holograms are produced in economical black and white.

409
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,340
You might even get to see a rare hologram eclipse

410
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,440
when your real surroundings become enjoyably apparent.

411
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,780
We are holidaying in technical difficulties.

412
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,120
Please do not...

413
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,360
You can't see it all.

414
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,240
You can't even be sure you're seeing any of it.

415
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,840
You and I are scientific men.

416
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,020
You can understand the wonder of what's happened.

417
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,020
Now just think.

418
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,820
Less than a month ago, Santa Mera was like any other town.

419
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,400
People with nothing but problems.

420
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Then out of the sky came a solution.

421
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,320
Seeds drifting through space for years took root in a farmer's field.

422
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,520
From the seeds came pods,

423
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,420
which have the power to reach the sky.

424
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,680
They reproduce themselves in the exact likeness of any form of life.

425
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,980
Your new bodies are growing in there.

426
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,840
They're taking you over.

427
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,240
Cell for cell.

428
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,720
Atom for atom.

429
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,560
There's no pain.

430
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,660
Suddenly, while you're asleep,

431
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,640
they'll absorb your minds,

432
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,840
your memories,

433
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,980
and you're reborn into an untroubled world.

434
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,900
Forever used to sleep.

435
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,080
Exactly.

436
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,900
What a world.

437
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,100
We're not the last humans left.

438
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,280
They'll destroy you.

439
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,880
Tomorrow you won't want them to.

440
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,260
Tomorrow you'll be one of us.

441
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,600
I don't want any part of you.

442
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,420
You're forgetting something, Miles.

443
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:47,480
What's that?

444
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,780
You have no choice.

445
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,520
And our children will live, Mr. Beale,

446
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,760
to see that...

447
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,420
...perfect life.

448
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,700
A perfect world...

449
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,340
...in which there's no war or famine,

450
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,020
oppression or brutality.

451
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,740
One vast and ecumenical holding company,

452
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,420
for whom all men will work to serve a common profit,

453
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,500
in which all men will hold a share of stock,

454
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,280
all necessities provided,

455
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,180
all anxiety,

456
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,440
all anxieties,

457
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,300
all boredom,

458
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,380
all boredom,

459
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:38,940
all boredom,

460
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:38,940


461
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,380
all boredom,

462
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,160
all amused.

463
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,460
The chemicals these factories create

464
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,440
are welcomed by our modern-day lifestyle.

465
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,860
The locals here complain

466
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,260
The locals here complain

467
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,180
The campers commit

468
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,400
The campers commit

469
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,280
to what along this coast

470
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,360
is perhaps the gravest possible crime.

471
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:50,780
is perhaps the gravest possible crime.

472
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,940
They don't spend enough money.

473
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,980
We're gonna make

474
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,260
We're gonna make

475
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:54,620
30

476
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:54,900
30

477
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,080
a mandatory retirement age.

478
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,140


479
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,620
And we're gonna set up rehabilitation camps,

480
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:00,740
And we're gonna set up rehabilitation camps,

481
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,160
Mercy centers in every state

482
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,680
and every state of the union.

483
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,020
Citizens will report to them

484
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,240
Citizens will report to them for five years,

485
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,360
VISTA bowl

486
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,780
And there,

487
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,140
Qin

488
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:25,880
are not gonna hurt you,

489
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
olor

490
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,760
They want drafters.

491
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,500
We'll draft them!

492
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,820
And some of them are really gonna dig it.

493
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,260
And that's gonna be the real mother-loving gas.

494
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,940
There's gonna be cats who wanna split from taxes, diners, clubs,

495
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,420
crazy birds, crazy wives, and crazy husbands.

496
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,800
Millions, troops.

497
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,420
But millions are gonna go willingly.

498
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,440
Ah, the funny sketch.

499
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,460
Thank you. Do you like that?

500
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,840
Yeah. No, but it was a funny sketch.

501
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,180
You talk about young people in America.

502
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,180
I don't recognize them. I don't think they exist.

503
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,480
I think your kind creates them.

504
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,140
You force them into little molds

505
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,960
and pop them out like little plastic figures off a production line.

506
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,880
You stuff them full of preconceived ideas,

507
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,660
praise them for turning out so well.

508
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,460
But they're not people, they're machines.

509
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,900
Then you wind them up like little tape recorders

510
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,140
and send them out into the world

511
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,400
to spread another generation of love.

512
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,320
This is the best of all possible worlds.

513
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,700
This is a recording.

514
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,100
Quiet, angels.

515
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,380
I'm gonna pass one more miracle.

516
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,320
And you gotta help me.

517
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,880
In case it's a new kind of miracle.

518
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,780
In my own image, let there be man.

519
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,840
Sure, we gave second thoughts to pacing over the earth, but...

520
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,900
Well, like cement's not very biodegradable.

521
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,400
Biodegradable.

522
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,180
And we had enough of it down already,

523
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,900
we figured we may as well go ahead and pave over the rest.

524
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,100
It's a lot easier than tearing all this up.

525
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,880
We could air condition and it got rid of the bugs.

526
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,320
I don't know, it's just a lot easier to keep things clean.

527
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,140
I mean, we got air conditioning,

528
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,740
toilet training for all our children.

529
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,000
We've got all the rocks we could chew on.

530
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,160
But you don't need nature for beauty.

531
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,240
The buildings here are inspiring monuments to our adaptable workers.

532
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,220
Such as the enchanting shopping metroplexes.

533
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,600
During Let's Go Shopping, a 20 minute break and a 20 hour workday,

534
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,480
humans compete to consume as much as possible.

535
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,620
And all it costs is time.

536
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,180
What husband could resist letting his wife have us free for free?

537
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,960
And there's sure no trouble deciding what you want.

538
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,720
Oh, don't buy me.

539
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,660
Nobody wants me.

540
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,680
I used to be popular, but not no more.

541
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,680
Hey, man, you wanna buy me?

542
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,800
All of that's been bought by all of you.

543
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,120
Besides, he only costs five minutes.

544
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,840
And when shopping time is up,

545
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,220
all the products you've just bought are flushed away down to the factories

546
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,280
to be recycled and back on the shelves by tomorrow.

547
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,060
It's even tattered looking inside.

548
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,800
Remember, no more people

549
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:44,800


550
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,480
You need not act like a brasile used to be.

551
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:51,500
Your socialUmber & I

552
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:51,520
areon your door.

553
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,560
Where you found this place?

554
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,140
Me l��도 .

555
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,700
Thank you.

556
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,020
Thank you.

557
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,520
Thank you.

558
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,420
Thank you.

559
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,860
Thank you.

560
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,600
Thank you.

561
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:33,900
Thank you.

562
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,120
Thank you.

563
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,040
It's even sadder on the inside.

564
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,720
A nice break from the old media barrage there by our young friend Reverend Negative

565
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,120
and the late, great Reverend Jones.

566
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:01,800
Just John, who boarded the Saucers last year, or earlier this year. Actually, I think Just John

567
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:09,700
started that piece and Reverend Negative added to it. I used several very weird and cool-sounded

568
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:18,920
pieces of Just John's music on my microbe porn videos of 2009 or so, which are on my YouTube

569
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:25,140
channel. He was fairly old, but his death seemed sudden. There's been a lot of that going around.

570
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:31,080
Anyway, on a cheerier note, back to Media Barrage number four.

571
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,640
You can take those records and run them backwards and you can hear Satan talking on there. So I want

572
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:48,740
you to realize that we're in a crooked and diverse nation. When I see and read and hear on the

573
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:48,900
internet, I see and hear on the internet, I see and hear on the internet, I see and hear on the

574
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:48,900


575
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:57,640
news that 65% of our teenage girls in school today become pregnant and the other just happen

576
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:05,880
not to get caught. Well, then I know we're in a crooked and diverse nation. The judgments of God

577
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,320
is going to fall upon this nation. An angel come and stood right over my head and I heard that

578
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:18,680
angel singing. There's a nation that stands in the judgment. There is a nation that has for

579
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:34,220
gotten God. Sin is the great. Sin is a space. It stands in disgrace. America has forgotten God.

580
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:44,260
If you love Bob, come with me. Yes, that was a wonderful number by our orchestra organist,

581
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,420
Raymond Price, here on the Bob Hour.

582
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,480
Yes, yes, ladies and gentlemen, we're glad to have you here.

583
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,800
My wife, Zelma.

584
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,780
Our dog, Snavely.

585
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,720
Did you tell him about Bob?

586
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,000
Okay, sit, sit down, everybody.

587
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,760
Can you hear me? Can you hear me out there?

588
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,760
Yeah, yeah, I think it's time for a song. Ladies and gentlemen, do you want to hear a song?

589
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,980
Cromp his ass. Kill him. Goon squad. Fucking know it normal, goddamn.

590
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,740
Well, we've done it. We've let loose the dogs of war.

591
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,520
I wonder how...

592
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,260
I better come and kill them or they'll destroy us.

593
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,480
Lobarighi grito llama cleebolson na.

594
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,160
Security Stalin!

595
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,820
These are site suicides wish they haven't been.

596
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:02,820


597
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:02,820


598
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,200
Youiiiii, stop.

599
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,680
Wait here.

600
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,140
We show them Canada Day, how nature points up the valley of red.

601
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,660
Godzilla!

602
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,540
You two act like it was the end of the world.

603
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,900
Well, it could be.

604
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,780
But we will return to enjoy your final moment.

605
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,020
Your commentator, Jonathan Mathias, with another bulletin.

606
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,260
And now, as the Sino-Russian border war continues to rapidly escalate,

607
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,540
U.S. authorities are beginning to question to what degree we will become involved

608
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,360
in what could swiftly grow into global conflict.

609
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,980
Abort firings! Abort firings!

610
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,700
Interception will fragment the Sili-carrying missiles.

611
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,880
Repeat, abort firings! Abort firings!

612
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,460
Interception will fragment the Sili-carrying missiles.

613
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,100
Tonight's presentation on the beach was, of course, fiction.

614
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,500
All Americans share the common desire

615
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,920
that a nuclear holocaust will never happen.

616
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,480
And certainly an alert, prepared America

617
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,420
is our greatest safeguard in a nuclear age.

618
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,960
I really don't know, because I don't know the situation

619
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,560
neither does the American people.

620
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,360
Our current policy is that we do not launch until we are under attack.

621
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,860
Now, the danger of that policy today is

622
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,080
the Soviets can deliver their missiles with such accuracy

623
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,780
that they'll be able to knock out in a matter of relatively few seconds

624
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,480
all of our ability to retaliate against the rest of the Soviet Union.

625
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,280
Soviet missiles.

626
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,420
Range two miles. Missile still deflecting.

627
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,980
Range one mile. Missile detonated.

628
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,900
Hold! Hold! Hold!

629
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,300
If a true alarm sounded, most of our defenses would be alerted

630
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,340
and within ten minutes, many of our jets would be in flight,

631
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,720
headed for their targets.

632
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,760
Yet under existing law, only the president could give the final order

633
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,800
to fire our nuclear warheads.

634
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,680
... airborne at the time.

635
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,180
As part of a special exercise we were holding called Operation Dropkick.

636
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:25,280
Now, it appears that the order called for the planes to attack their targets inside Russia

637
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,800
with an average load of 40 megatons each.

638
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,760
General Turgidson, I find this very difficult to understand.

639
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,500
I was under the impression that I was the only one in authority

640
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,600
to order the use of nuclear weapons.

641
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,280
That's right, sir.

642
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,900
You are the only person authorized to do so.

643
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,360
And although I, uh, hate to judge before all the facts are in,

644
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,120
it's beginning to look like General Ripper exceeded his authority.

645
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,560
My little 11-year-old child, I think his, uh, mentality is much more alert than this 16-year-old boy.

646
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,060
The point is, uh, stupidity is all around us, and, uh...

647
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,800
it's not worth getting upset about, you know.

648
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,920
It is not a thing a sane man would do.

649
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,960
The doomsday machine is designed to trigger itself automatically.

650
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,940
But surely you can disarm it somehow?

651
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,480
No. It is designed to explode if it's not destroyed. But they are not going to know that it's not destroyed.

652
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,520
if any attempt is ever made to un-trigger it automatically.

653
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,940
It's an obvious commie trick, Mr. President.

654
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,040
We're wasting valuable time.

655
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,240
Look at the big water.

656
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,640
We're getting ready to clobber.

657
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,380
Is money more important than people's lives?

658
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,680
And in their pursuit for private interests,

659
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,160
a lot of chemical companies will not accept legal

660
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,680
or even moral responsibility for the results of chemical waste pollution

661
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,040
until absolute proof shows that a specific chemical

662
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,140
from a specific plant caused a specific disease.

663
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,180
The treatment you receive when you do business with these industry giants,

664
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,960
it's frequently frustrating,

665
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,780
and to make matters worse, they don't seem to care.

666
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,000
You won't find this attitude at Bill King's Breco.

667
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,440
Well, I'll tell you what, everything I figure is a hazard.

668
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,440
It progresses as the years go on,

669
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,180
and eventually we'll never be able to control it.

670
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,140
If you take a look at those maps

671
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,460
that show concentrations of various forms of cancer,

672
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,860
that you can pick out the industrialized areas

673
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,120
of the world.

674
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,120
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

675
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,880
You've obviously never heard of Cabal Thorium-G.

676
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,300
No, what about it?

677
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,520
Cabal Thorium-G has a radioactive half-life of 93 years.

678
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,520
If you take, say, 50 H-bombs in the 100 megaton range

679
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,560
and jacket them with Cabal Thorium-G,

680
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,220
when they are exploded, they will produce a doomsday shroud,

681
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,000
a lethal cloud of radioactive...

682
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:45,820
activity which will encircle the Earth for 93 years.

683
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,920
What a load of crap.

684
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,720
No question, we have a problem.

685
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,860
We all know that.

686
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,440
But that doesn't mean that we ought to change the whole system we have,

687
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,940
find out where the problems are,

688
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,260
the character of the problems, and address them.

689
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,900
All I want is some help.

690
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,920
I don't want to be sitting out here and forgotten with poison water.

691
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,820
That's all I ask is for some help.

692
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,300
The state of Michigan says there's nothing wrong with it.

693
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,320
But EPA came out and said there is something wrong.

694
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,240
The Health Department of Michigan later sends me a letter saying,

695
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,940
it's all right, there's nothing wrong with your water, you can drink it.

696
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,660
And if you don't think that doesn't scare a mother to find out that a boy has

697
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,040
urinary tear blood, when you know he's only got one kidney,

698
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,800
believe me, I've had it.

699
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,740
I cried all the way to the doctor's office.

700
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,840
The American Heart Association has been working to help the children and adults with kidney problems.

701
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:38,840


702
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:38,840


703
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,540
And I'm heading every road.

704
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,440
There are new thoughts, ready and waiting to explode.

705
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:53,600
When tomorrow is today, the bells may toll for some,

706
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,460
but nothing can change the shape of things to come.

707
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,660
Certain changes have been taking place here,

708
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,560
such as the increase in the,

709
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,300
beatnik crowd,

710
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:20,580
and the increase of the drugs that's used and distributed by the beatniks.

711
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,940
One thing, friend,

712
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:26,460
that can save America, and that's change every person one at a time

713
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,680
by the power of Almighty God working in that corrupt heart.

714
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,900
The gates of hell was government.

715
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,700
Because in Bible times, government sat at the gates of the city.

716
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,100
Yes.

717
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,420
The Bible says the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.

718
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,400
There's no question about it.

719
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,040
We are going to see the most tremendous turn of events.

720
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,060
Not only in this nation, it's going to affect the whole world.

721
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,800
Peace, did Hitler say.

722
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,340
Next move, Czechoslovakia.

723
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,380
There are a few beatniks in Berkeley.

724
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,540
I'm sure from what you folks hear,

725
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,860
you would think that the population in Berkeley

726
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:14,840
is really becoming beatnik-like all the time.

727
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,000
Well, the percentage of them is increasing a bit.

728
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:27,900
But with this movie actor getting into the governor's chair,

729
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,480
Ronald Regan from Hollywood,

730
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,720
I think that he's going to tame them down a little bit.

731
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,840
May I close up?

732
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,700
We've got two minutes of silence on a personal note.

733
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,980
I was asked once in a press interview

734
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,340
what book I would choose if I were shipwrecked on an island

735
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,380
and could have only one book for the rest of my life.

736
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,100
I replied that I knew of only one book

737
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,020
that could be read and reread

738
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,840
and continue to be a challenge.

739
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,260
The Bible.

740
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,220
The Old and New Testaments.

741
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,520
I can only add to that, my friends,

742
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,340
that I continue to look to the scriptures today

743
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:15,400
day for fulfillment and for guidance. Indeed, it is an incontrovertible fact that all the complex

744
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:23,160
and horrendous questions confronting us at home and worldwide have their answer in that single book.

745
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:41,020
God gave us a purpose. God put us here for some reason. Everything that we do here is aimed at the next world or it ought not to be done.

746
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:51,100
You who are pastors who have been chosen by God Almighty to lead, we are talking about Christianizing America.

747
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:51,940
Amen.

748
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,140
We are talking about Christianizing America.

749
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,140


750
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,340
We are talking about simply spreading the gospel in a political context.

751
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:03,400
Rape is kind of like the weather. If it's inevitable, relax and enjoy it. Clayton Williams.

752
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:11,620
If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down. Todd Akin.

753
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,020
Rape victims should make the best of a bad situation.

754
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,740
Rick Santorum.

755
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,740
Even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape,

756
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,040
it is something that God intended to happen.

757
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,840
Richard Murdoch.

758
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,520
In the emergency room, they have what's called rape kits where a woman can get cleaned out.

759
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,180
Jodi Lobenberg.

760
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:38,080
If not for rape and incest, would there be any population left?

761
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,600
Steve King.

762
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,200
She was dressed like a 21-year-old prostitute.

763
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,060
Students should show up in proper attire.

764
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,720
Kathleen Pasadomo said this about an 11-year-old girl gang-raped in Texas.

765
00:42:53,080 --> 00:43:00,740
If a woman has the right to an abortion, why shouldn't a man be able to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman?

766
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,400
At least the rapist's pursuit of sexual freedom doesn't in most cases result in anyone's death.

767
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,000
Lawrence Lachman.

768
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,320
What is the value of that life, and is it subordinate to the value of its host body?

769
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,900
Jose Oliva.

770
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,420
My friend, God Almighty does not hear the prayer of a Jew,

771
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,720
for how in the world can God hear the prayer of a Jew?

772
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,100
The prayer of a man who says Jesus Christ is not the true Messiah.

773
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,240
It is blasphemous.

774
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,980
We need to bring the world to the foot of the cross.

775
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,020
And we have been dealing with and showing who these people were,

776
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:41,560
and telling you that they were representatives of all the 12 tribes of Israel

777
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:50,400
who were, without a question, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic,

778
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:51,100
uh,

779
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:51,720


780
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,800
kindred peoples.

781
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,400
Because that's the true Israel of the Bible.

782
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,840
That's who the true, true Israel of the Bible is.

783
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,420
I shall go down in history as the greatest German.

784
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:12,000
In your word, you have said all no-whites, meaning all non-whites, I suppose, are Satan's children.

785
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:16,680
You have said that they are devil worshipers who feed their children to crocodiles,

786
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,140
which makes you sound like a white Muslim.

787
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:26,460
Well, whatever it makes me sound like, sir, these things that I base the arguments upon the difference of race,

788
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,720
uh, is from a biblical standpoint.

789
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,660
They're not associated with him.

790
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,440
We like to think of ourselves as the, uh, the ultimate minority.

791
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,320
The subgeniuses. The, uh,

792
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,420
final organization.

793
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,960
The most understood minority.

794
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,480
They don't take us seriously, and rightfully so.

795
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,760
What happens if they cross us?

796
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,900
You know? Uh, maybe we pray or something.

797
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,720
But most often we don't know about it.

798
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,080
We'll learn this until the Lord himself comes back and rescues all of us.

799
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,320
All right, cut him off.

800
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,160
Leave him on.

801
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,460
Am I still on the air?

802
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,340
If this is how he wants to go out, this is how he goes.

803
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,460
I don't know how to say it, except that I just went out of bullshit.

804
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,200
Yeah. Uh, look, Mr. Schumacher's right here. Do you want to talk to him?

805
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,040
Bullshit is all the reasons we give for living.

806
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,860
And if we can't think of any reasons of our own, we always have the God bullshit.

807
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,680
Oh, my God.

808
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,620
We don't know about all this pointless pain, humiliation, and decay.

809
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:21,700
We don't know about all this pointless pain, humiliation, and decay.

810
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:21,700


811
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,860
So there better be someone somewhere who does know.

812
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,640
That's the God bullshit.

813
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,160
He's saying that life is bullshit, and it is.

814
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,300
So what are you screaming about?

815
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,760
Man is a noble creature that's flawed to his own world.

816
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,620
Who needs God?

817
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,020
Well, if there's anybody out there that can look around this demented slaughterhouse of a world we live in

818
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,620
and tell me that man is a noble creature...

819
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,520
Believe me, that man is full of bullshit.

820
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:44,580
Believe me, that man is full of bullshit.

821
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,040
What's so goddamn funny?

822
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,100
I can't help it, Herman. It's funny.

823
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,380
I don't have anything, thanks.

824
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,700
This is going out live today.

825
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,980
I don't have any chits.

826
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,060
Leave him on.

827
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,780
And I was married for 33 years of shrill, shrieking fraud.

828
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,080
Mr. Hackett's trying to get through to you.

829
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,760
Tell Mr. Hackett to go fuck himself.

830
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,300
So I don't have any bullshit left.

831
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,740
I just ran out of it, you see.

832
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:36,200
And they though he was fuckingels for every woman in Black Panther.

833
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,660
Those men are coming up for me.

834
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:38,660


835
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:38,660


836
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:38,660


837
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,260
So, do you know what...

838
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:39,760
What?

839
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,340
From do America wants to know.

840
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,540
You-

841
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,880
Who do you mean?

842
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,300
I frown.

843
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:58,320
For a lonely telecast

844
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,820
Scan the sky

845
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,360
Hail the stars

846
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,740
Hey nice try

847
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,180
It's too far

848
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,900
Take the best of what we are

849
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,800
Aim it at some distant star

850
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,360
Post a selfie to the void

851
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:51,200
Of the world that we destroyed

852
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,720
Endless night

853
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,260
No one hears

854
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,500
Flash of light

855
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,180
Disappears

856
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,520
Scan the sky

857
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,120
Hail the stars

858
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,280
Hey nice try

859
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,800
It's too far

860
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,160
Take the best of what we are

861
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,160


862
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,180
Endless night

863
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,660
No one hears

864
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,680
Flash of light

865
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,460
Disappears

866
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:14,220
The name of that song was

867
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,080
The Big Selfie

868
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,160
The Big Selfie

869
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,720
And it certainly depicts

870
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,300
The sense of hopelessness

871
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,100
Until X Day Comes

872
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,860
That was done by

873
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,360
David Morrison

874
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,480
Who occasionally sends me

875
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,860
Cool songs he's recorded

876
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,540
And this one was mixed

877
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,420
By the Rudy Schwartz Project

878
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,320
It sounds pretty rich

879
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,460
In my hearing aids

880
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,180
But now back to Media Barrage 4

881
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,340
Which includes cuts

882
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,840
From the first times

883
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,300
That Dr. Drummond and I

884
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,960
Were guests on Dallas radio shows

885
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,160
It's a dream

886
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,160


887
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,160


888
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,160


889
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,160


890
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,160


891
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,160


892
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,260
We are talking

893
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,280
With Reverend Ivan Stang

894
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,360
And the good Dr. Philo Drummond

895
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,640
From the Church of the Subgenius

896
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,600
And guys we've been getting

897
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,240
A lot of phone calls

898
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,820
That people do not think

899
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,880
You guys are real

900
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,040
Well we're dead serious

901
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,100
This is all too real George

902
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,420
It really is

903
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,460
I mean you have stacks

904
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,220
Of pamphlets here

905
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,540
Some incredible reading matter

906
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,400
That can be had at a song

907
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,620
We just want to emphasize

908
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,140
That if you call in

909
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:12,680
We'll give you the

910
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,740
Post office box number

911
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,680
And for a mere dollar

912
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,900
Something you would drop

913
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,680
Out of your pocket

914
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,340
And not even worry

915
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,100
About picking up

916
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,040
You can get more reading matter

917
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,320
Than you could read

918
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,340
In two days time

919
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,800
And even then

920
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,980
You wouldn't comprehend it all

921
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,180
Ten years from now

922
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:27,900
Our pamphlets

923
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,840
Will take the place

924
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,860
Of federal reserve currency

925
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,420
That might be

926
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,320
That might be

927
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,380
The way things have been going

928
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,960
You can get those pieces of paper

929
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,760
That Bob sends from P.O. Box

930
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,960
I'm going to read that number again

931
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,560
To you folks

932
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,380
P.O. Box

933
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,200
8-0-7

934
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,320
Glen Rose, Texas

935
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,120
76043

936
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,580
You can leave off the zip code

937
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,640
But send that dollar

938
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,340
That's right

939
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,440
And we'll return to you

940
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,760
This tiny, tiny

941
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,640
Little book

942
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,520
That we call it

943
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,080
It's called

944
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,040
The World Ends Tomorrow

945
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,940
And You May Die

946
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:04,900
And that donation

947
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,900
If I may say

948
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,000
Solely goes to cover

949
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,940
The cost of printing

950
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,040
And mailing

951
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,520
That's exactly right

952
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,760
We only use that dollar

953
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,920
To fight the conspiracy

954
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,660
With their own

955
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,060
With their own weapon

956
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:17,900
I mean we're fighting

957
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,740
Fire with fire

958
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,680
And that dollar

959
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,480
It's sure it's buying some paper

960
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,360
But it ain't the paper

961
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,960
That you're getting

962
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,040
It ain't the words you're reading

963
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:24,500
That's important

964
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,440
It's the feeling

965
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,320
It's the power

966
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,420
That comes out of Bob

967
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,360
You're here right now

968
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,720
For the power of a miracle

969
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,880
God drives that tumor out

970
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,880
For the power

971
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,960
For the power

972
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,760
For the power

973
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,200
For the power

974
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,040
For the power

975
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:42,420
For the power

976
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:42,660
For the power

977
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,040
For the power

978
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,660
For the power

979
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:43,660


980
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:43,660


981
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:43,660


982
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,600
We're on the air with

983
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,360
Uh...

984
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,340
Mr. Opinion

985
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,140
And the founders

986
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,520
Of the Subgenius Foundation

987
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,900
Well Mr. Opinion

988
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,440
Uh...

989
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,460
I want to talk to the founders

990
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,220
Yes

991
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,000
I think this is uh...

992
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,180
Uh...

993
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,080
This is terrific

994
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,120
Now this is what we need

995
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,280
Well thank you

996
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,280
Ma'am we feel that people out there

997
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,700
Have had about all they can stand

998
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,640
And it's up to us

999
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,420
To finally do something about it

1000
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,060
I think so

1001
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,080
And I have a billion dollars

1002
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,320
That I haven't been using

1003
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,240
And I thought maybe

1004
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,660
Now where do we want to go

1005
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,380
To uh...

1006
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,900
Establish all this

1007
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,580
Uh...

1008
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,260
Well with your billion dollars

1009
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,120
You can either buy

1010
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,540
A billion uh...

1011
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,760
Pamphlets from us

1012
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,380
Which you can

1013
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,640
You can also pick those up

1014
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,100
By the way

1015
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,400
At Earth Base Bookstore

1016
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,180
At Oak Lawn and Lemon

1017
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,160
And uh...

1018
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:33,820
At a place called

1019
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:34,520
Remember When

1020
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,280
Or you could uh...

1021
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,360
Also buy your own

1022
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,700
Church of the Subgenius

1023
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:39,000
Uh...

1024
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,080
Clench all your own

1025
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:40,880
And uh...

1026
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,620
Push your head up

1027
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,320
And out of the way

1028
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:44,660
And out of the way

1029
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,140
And out of the way

1030
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:45,220
And out of the way

1031
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:45,220


1032
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:45,220


1033
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,260
And out of the way

1034
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:47,260


1035
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:47,260


1036
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:47,260


1037
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:47,260


1038
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:47,260


1039
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,240
Well isn't it also true

1040
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,420
That the Klan has a

1041
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,800
Money making system

1042
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,100
Of a few people at the top

1043
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,100
And they make these people

1044
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,880
Buy these sheets

1045
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,800
And they're now more

1046
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,300
Of an elaborate robe

1047
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,320
And it's a pretty

1048
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:57,880
Money making scheme

1049
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,780
It is not true

1050
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,100
And I bet you can feel that warm

1051
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,420
That warm feeling

1052
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,620
Building up in your wallet

1053
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,340
Yeah

1054
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,180
Can you feel the Bob energy

1055
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,500
Coming through your wallet

1056
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,860
Yes it makes those

1057
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,680
Little dollars

1058
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,280
Gonna chop

1059
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,100
Jump right out of your back pocket

1060
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,440
And help Bob

1061
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,220
So I think uh...

1062
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:18,520
I think now that we've got a very large congregation here,

1063
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:22,600
we ought to go around and ask people just what Bob has done for you.

1064
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,280
I want you to think about what...

1065
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,000
Just make a quick testimonial, a short testimonial,

1066
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,780
about what Bob has done since he came into your life.

1067
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:30,900
Swami?

1068
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,180
Well...

1069
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:32,840
Oh, here we...

1070
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,540
No, I ain't coming, sir.

1071
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,020
Well, I had some impure thoughts this weekend.

1072
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,300
Oh, I understand.

1073
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,300
And, well, I soiled the bed sheets last night,

1074
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,340
and I think that Bob definitely had a hand in that somewhere.

1075
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,620
Oh, friends, Bob can make them dreams come true.

1076
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:52,820
Certainly.

1077
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1078
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:00,160
I think this is about the sickest, sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ

1079
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,820
since I've been listening to it.

1080
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:07,640
I am thoroughly ashamed of KFJZ right now.

1081
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,840
You know, I'm getting strong trance indications from this man

1082
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,560
that he was the...

1083
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,060
The...

1084
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,240
The high liar of Baghdad at one time.

1085
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,740
Adam, I'm not interested in you, I'm just...

1086
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,540
In your past life.

1087
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:23,440
I don't know what I think about this sick, sick, sick program

1088
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,560
that you're putting on here.

1089
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,720
Well, that's...

1090
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:25,960
Well...

1091
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,840
KFJZ as of now, this is terrible.

1092
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,020
You don't believe people should start their own cult if they want to?

1093
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:34,680
People.

1094
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,940
I mean, yeah, people, you know.

1095
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,100
But not this is the damnedest thing I've ever heard of.

1096
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,500
Welcome home, Arjo.

1097
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,360
Welcome home, son.

1098
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,700
I'm home.

1099
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,820
But where are the aluminum people?

1100
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,320
They're here, too.

1101
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,220
Here?

1102
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,180
Don't be afraid, son.

1103
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,480
They're a part of you now, and you're a part of them.

1104
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,220
But I'm all mixed up.

1105
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,760
It's part of the photonic-nervonic plan.

1106
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:01,840
Wow.

1107
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,360
Are you my real father?

1108
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,000
Am I your real father?

1109
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:08,700
Father?

1110
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1111
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1112
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:18,500
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1113
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:24,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1114
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:32,320
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1115
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,500
How would I describe the world of the future?

1116
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,800
Oh, it's safe.

1117
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,720
Complex, very complex, and...

1118
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,240
Well, it's imaginary. It's clean.

1119
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,480
Oh, and above all, it's funny.

1120
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:56,960
Well, sure, it has its drawbacks, but nobody's perfect.

1121
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,460
And so we bid fond farewell to the future,

1122
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:05,040
that romantic and cosmopolitan end of the rainbow.

1123
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,120
Like the wonderful pages of a storybook

1124
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,620
filled with the glorious living pictures of tomorrow.

1125
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,120
It's all we have to look forward to.

1126
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,720
And it probably has a place for you.

1127
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,800
Not so fast, Mr. Cameron.

1128
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,520
Don't leave yet.

1129
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,400
Look, we know we aren't fooling you.

1130
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,860
You people probably think this world looks real bad or something.

1131
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,700
Well, we're not fooling you.

1132
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,360
Well, you're probably laughing at us,

1133
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,660
because it's so obvious and exaggerated.

1134
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,740
Well, of course it is.

1135
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,780
See, that's what so Arkansane about it.

1136
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,160
We're laughing back at you.

1137
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,560
See, we're here in the future,

1138
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,720
and you, you're there in the past.

1139
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,000
And he who laughs last,

1140
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,980
laughs next.

1141
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,780
See you soon.

1142
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,200
Now, children, it's time for recess.

1143
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,500
Please roll up your sleeves.

1144
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,520
Hold it a minute, folks.

1145
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,440
Listen to Charlie Musk.

1146
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,040
I've been listening to that stuff.

1147
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:36,860
That's no good.

1148
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,360
That's bozo talk.

1149
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,980
If you want to know what the future's really like,

1150
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,400
put some money in Mr. D. Smith's pocket.

1151
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,080
Because he's got what it takes.

1152
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,860
And we're going to bring you the future just like it is.

1153
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,540
Because in the next show, I'm the hero.

1154
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,300
The future show is going to bring you Charlie Musk.

1155
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,640
And I know what it's all about.

1156
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,080
Because, brother, I've been around.

1157
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,500
My friend, it is not God and country.

1158
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,520
It's God!

1159
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:02,800
Yeah!

1160
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:05,140
Yeah!

1161
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:05,420


1162
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:05,680


1163
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:05,780


1164
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:05,880


1165
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:06,480


1166
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:06,680


1167
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,080
Yeah!

1168
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:07,280
Yeah!

1169
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:07,280


1170
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:07,580
Yeah!

1171
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:08,060


1172
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:09,820
Yeah!

1173
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,260
Yeah!

1174
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:35,720
Yeah!

1175
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,440
Yeah!

1176
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:37,480


1177
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:37,500


1178
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:37,500


1179
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:37,500


1180
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:37,500


1181
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:37,500


1182
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:37,500


1183
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:37,500


1184
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:37,500


1185
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:37,500


1186
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:37,500


1187
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:37,620


1188
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:37,620


1189
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:37,620


1190
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:37,620


1191
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:37,620


1192
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:37,640


1193
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:37,640


1194
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:37,640


1195
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:37,640


1196
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:37,640


1197
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:37,640


1198
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:37,640


1199
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:37,640


1200
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:37,660


1201
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:37,660


1202
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:37,660


1203
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:37,660


1204
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:37,660


1205
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,040
Yeah!

1206
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,040


1207
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,040


1208
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,040


1209
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,040


1210
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:41,640
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

1211
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:47,280
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

1212
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,540
Roberto de la Rosa is provided courtesy of Reverend David Boone.

1213
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:14,580
And there's Reverend Sterno Kekamer, Little Rock, Master of Men's Minds.

1214
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:23,420
Why, there's Reverend Doug Wellman again, who taught us how to use tape recorders.

1215
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,740
And there's Sterno again.

1216
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:33,140
Why, it's Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

1217
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,200
For miracles in your life.

1218
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,520
He can do it.

1219
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,880
And money, send us money.

1220
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,520
Reverend J.N. Hyperclete.

1221
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,980
And who could forget the fabulous paper boys.

1222
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,820
And St. Shep Webb provided an awful lot of the monster movies.

1223
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,840
Reverend Glenn Bray provided many of the stranger songs.

1224
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:57,260
The great Deacon Duveau, one of the co-sub-founders.

1225
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:01,560
Reverend Jim Erickson, the guy that sings all those songs.

1226
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,520
And that's Subgenius.

1227
