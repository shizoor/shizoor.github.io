00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,180
The Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,180
The Hour of Slack!

3
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,280
The Hour of Slack!

4
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:35,480
The Hour of Slack!

5
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:23,140
The Hour of Slack!

6
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:53,140
The Hour of Slack!

7
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,980
The Hour of Slack!

8
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,540
The Hour of Slack!

9
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:22,580
The Hour of Slack!

10
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:53,160
The Hour of Slack!

11
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,780
Ordnance aerial bombardment meaning to blow up the whole country of Iraq with a shockwave.

12
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,700
One of America's brand new weapons of destruction.

13
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:11,060
I was wondering about the brand new ones, you know, because there's supposed to be some fancy new noisemakers and big earth rattlers.

14
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,260
From the Centurion, you will all die under the power of the fist of the fossil.

15
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,340
See Kyle, baby.

16
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:27,640
Now, the propaganda that goes back and forth is marvelous because I was reading just a little while ago that the evil Saddam Husseins were,

17
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:36,960
had ordered a whole bunch of fake American and British army uniforms so he could dress up the Fayadin in these uniforms

18
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,100
who would then go out and commit atrocities on their fellow Iraqis as a propaganda routine,

19
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,600
you know, to make it look like how evil and terrible.

20
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:46,900
The.

21
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,940
Demonic British people are, you know, how they are.

22
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,480
I heard they really were demonic.

23
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,140
Have you ever heard of Mad Bomber Harris?

24
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,120
He started the whole idea of blowing the living hell out of Iraq in the 1920s when they were close to independence.

25
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:07,500
He thought, why not use the new bombers, you know, the brand new bombers in the air we've got and just keep dropping them on those peasant villages,

26
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,900
you know, kind of toughen them up and soften them at the same time a little bit.

27
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,740
During these last few months, I've been trained by Al Qaeda and I'm weak.

28
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,420
But because they know all these Otomec Muslims,

29
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:33,380
this had made a huge difference to whether your crimes would benefit Iraq but the one thing that really brothelers cannot do is bastardize people and make heroin violators and break the überệnings of the armed forces.

30
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,380
I even met with them in Mehmetableh's room.

31
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,840
I met with them in 비핐� Xuan in Manama every night.

32
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:37,840


33
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,200
When I got arrested he 투기에 to use aatives close to Iraq and I got caught five minutes in a car.

34
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,200


35
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,200


36
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,300
He was the prevР.

37
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,740
We can be summed up in one word, evil.

38
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:12,240
I am committed to defeating not only the good work of charities, but the values that will

39
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,260
bring lasting peace.

40
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,380
And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world towards suicide

41
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,200
and murder.

42
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,960
Thank you.

43
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,960
Thank you.

44
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,720
Thank you.

45
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:24,720


46
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,180
Let's roll.

47
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,820
Kill, kill, kill for peace.

48
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,800
Kill, kill, kill for peace.

49
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,280
You know, he actually used the phrase, now I may have, kill for peace, I could

50
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,720
swear I heard the Emperor say, the gold is mine.

51
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:54,720


52
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,380
All of this war is peace.

53
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,940
He may have said some other things, but at one point he actually said the phrase, war

54
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,720
is peace.

55
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,340
Friends, it's 1984.

56
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,600
1984 is 19 years late.

57
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,280
That means X day will be the year 2017.

58
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,280
Waste bomb.

59
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:13,580
Waste bomb.

60
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,100
19 years, you've been in a vast, deep, deep, colorless sleep.

61
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,740
Stuck to the ground, needs one of the baby incubators in Kuwait city.

62
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,700
Waste bomb.

63
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


64
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


65
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


66
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


67
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


68
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


69
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


70
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


71
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


72
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


73
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


74
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


75
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


76
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


77
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


78
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,480
You've got nothing to awake, and yet you cannot.

79
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,720
Until 1984.

80
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,140
When your dreams come true.

81
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,760
When your brother's bigger than anything.

82
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,780
Oh lord, I'm tired and sad.

83
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,280
And I want you all to die.

84
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,600
Beware of the toothless jaws of 1984.

85
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,160
I've been a waste of time.

86
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,900
I just keep on picking up pieces of corn which have fallen out of that mouth there and we

87
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,920
might stay alive one more day in American decade.

88
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,620
Or am I a waste of time.

89
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,080
I've been a waste of time.

90
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,080
I'm sorry.

91
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,320
That'd be weird.

92
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,040
But hang on everybody.

93
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,160
Right now.

94
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,660
Bob Lent.

95
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,560
Bob Lent.

96
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,520
Bob Lent.

97
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,120
Bob Lent.

98
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,320
Have any favorite Bob songs?

99
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:27,760
God.

100
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,060
You're going to cut off a lot of vital tissue.

101
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,700
Right, right.

102
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,160
What?

103
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,700
So you think they're playing this song in Baghdad right now?

104
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,900
Or on the way to Baghdad?

105
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,060
I think on the way to Baghdad, there's a lot of guys finishing in their foxholes,

106
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,420
dreaming about their foxholes and crying in their boots.

107
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,120
Where's my...

108
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,520
Dreaming about those boot jobs they're going to get when they get back home.

109
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,000
Yep.

110
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,620
Get their boots enlarged.

111
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,400
Shave medulla oblongatus.

112
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,240
They're going to look like all the rest of the kids,

113
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,480
only nobody knows they're going to be different.

114
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,780
Way different.

115
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:00,860
Changed.

116
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,440
A different kind of tattoo.

117
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,140
Well, they get the free smallpox inoculations and the free tracking devices.

118
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,860
Well, that tattoo's your inner.

119
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,600
It's pretty good, but that's not the whole of it.

120
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,860
That's only part.

121
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,400
Yeah, they get the holes, too.

122
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,500
Yeah, well, that's only part of it, too.

123
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,220
And then to the tattoo.

124
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,420
Yes, it makes them lift their leg when the bus comes up to the bus stop.

125
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,220
If they're well-trained.

126
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,800
Well, some of them have to wear the collars, the special...

127
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,020
Well, let's just call them...

128
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,800
I know I do.

129
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,360
Digital angels, you know what I mean?

130
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,980
If I didn't have this collar on, Dave, I'd be wetting myself.

131
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,060
Well, that's...

132
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,360
We can thank the digital angel for setting you straight.

133
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,060
That's right.

134
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,660
If it weren't for this modern age, I'd just be a vegetable.

135
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,740
Well, where do they put your chip?

136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,980
Where do they put your chip?

137
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,400
All over me.

138
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,060
I mean, there's tons of them.

139
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,260
Oh, like your pores.

140
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,100
For every organ that still works.

141
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,540
Did Papa Joe ever get that collar removed from his...

142
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:55,960
Nah.

143
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,300
His was embedded into his vertebrae.

144
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,560
Did we ever get those collars removed from this show?

145
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,960
Those barnacles?

146
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,400
Those grafted-on tics?

147
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,760
If people remember the early days, we asked each and every one of you

148
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,400
if you'd like to become a closer member of the show's team out there.

149
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
If you feel you are not properly sedated,

150
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,000
please call...

151
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,220
555-3129.

152
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,820
Failure to do so may result in criminal prosecution for drug evasion.

153
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,000
Welcome back to our program.

154
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,320
Please continue.

155
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:41,340
I believe most Pacific Islander parents like using products like hairspray or glue as an inhalant to get high.

156
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:48,420
I'm here to let other Pacific Islander parents know we need to care about using more serious drugs.

157
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,000
If you need drugs or ideas on how to keep your drugs,

158
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,120
please call Bob.

159
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,080
Welcome back to our program.

160
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,700
That was a lemur cut.

161
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,560
Tonight's collages are almost, but not all, by Mr. F. Lemur.

162
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:13,120
The second of the two Bush cut-ups heard earlier was by someone named Edo at f***itall.com.

163
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,920
The Star Spangled Banner was by Mark Mothersbaugh.

164
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,400
For your dating info, this show was actually assembled on March 9th, 2003,

165
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,480
the year of duct tape and plastic sheeting.

166
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,740
Isn't duct tape and plastic sheeting just another version of duck and cover?

167
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,520
Duck and cover.

168
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,880
What did duck and cover tell you?

169
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,520
Duck and cover told you that if you just ducked when the bomb went off...

170
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,840
And put a newspaper over your butt.

171
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, if you just ducked.

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,640
Just duck.

173
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:45,960
Duck!

174
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,040
Oh, there's a nuclear bomb.

175
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,460
Duck!

176
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,860
Then everything will be okay.

177
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,540
You will win.

178
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,240
Well, they were talking about amphibian birds at the time.

179
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,720
When they asked you to duck and cover, they wanted you to run out to the nearest pond

180
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,220
and grab little turkey boy or a little quacky and stick him under your shirt and carry him home.

181
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,780
And when they ask you now, that's what the duct tape is all about.

182
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,820
These are all reasons to duck and take subconscious.

183
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,520
They're playing with your mind.

184
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,620
Duck and cover.

185
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,060
Duck and cover.

186
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,980
There, no more duck and cover, nothing in this whipping.

187
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,220
Do you know why you are ducking?

188
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,220


189
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,600
It was magnitude when theUCKER was down.

190
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,420
The Captain got up, the absolutamente!

191
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,580
Side Tom till you're a seven and a half.

192
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,480
Five to nine.

193
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,480


194
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,060
Die!

195
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,780
Die!

196
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,260
Die!

197
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,520
Die!

198
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,720
is dropped from planes either as a spray or in gas bombs.

199
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,940
But should enemy raiders use gas against your community,

200
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,240
there is no reason for fear or panic.

201
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,220
Because if you know what to do,

202
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,280
you can protect yourself and safeguard your family

203
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,480
against the menace of gas from the air.

204
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,300
Of course, that's Arcana.

205
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,500
You know what Arcana is?

206
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,660
Do you know what wisdom is?

207
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,420
Do you know the meaning of the eye in the soft?

208
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,180
Of the eye within the eye within the eye within the eye?

209
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,220
Are your balls ready to rumble?

210
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,020
Are they ready to roll?

211
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,780
Do you know the meaning of love?

212
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,460
Pour me another mug of that there iron soft, would you, there barkeep?

213
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,980
You had enough, buddy boy. I'm going to catch you off.

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,200
You're babbling to everybody in the damn barn.

215
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,660
Everyone's tired of listening.

216
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,760
That's not for him, it's for me.

217
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,400
I had enough.

218
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,960
Gold Akashic record, damn it.

219
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,460
Back in the day, everybody was doing my song.

220
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,840
Yeah, you got a gold.

221
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,900
We got your astral card right here, buddy.

222
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,220
And it says that you haven't passed your limit

223
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,600
and you've been around more times than anybody else in this bar.

224
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,440
So could you please shut up?

225
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,960
Shut up, man.

226
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,220
Stop drinking that wisdom shit.

227
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,080
Don't be sucking on the wisdom eyeball.

228
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,280
Too much is always better.

229
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,060
Not enough.

230
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,500
I'm a regular.

231
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,980
It's almost as bad.

232
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,480
I'm a regular.

233
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,360
Oh, you're quite a regular now, be that.

234
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,560
Just let me check further here.

235
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,640
What is the elliptical meaning of that?

236
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,800
There's only one eyeball.

237
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,880
I'm going to chase you with an elliptical eyeball

238
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,600
and then fork all around and round and round and round.

239
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

240
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,580
It's like...

241
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,260
Well, there's no train of thought.

242
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,260


243
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,260


244
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,480
We're sketching.

245
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,180
This time we're taking the express.

246
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,420
We're guilty of not doing enough about the war.

247
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,740
That just keeps coming.

248
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,480
I keep feeling so bad about not doing enough.

249
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,120
Well, you could suck the cycloptic wisdom teeth

250
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,240
and then you would understand what to do

251
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,700
as Laguerre pronounces itself a bonus.

252
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,220
Which magazine should I subscribe to

253
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,580
that would, you know, be the right thing to do?

254
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,780
Martial arts, survival, mercenary, merc.

255
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,460
Magazines like that.

256
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:08,720
Yeah.

257
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,260
Yeah.

258
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,260


259
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,260


260
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,260


261
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,260


262
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,260


263
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,260


264
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,260


265
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,260


266
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,260


267
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,040
I'm going to have to pull off some pretty big feet

268
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,240
to live through this, I think.

269
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,140
I mean, size 12.

270
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,140
I was just going to learn to give really good oral sex

271
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,540
to great big tough guys.

272
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,320
That was how I was going to live through the end of civilization.

273
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,860
As a sniveling pansy

274
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,440
awaiting for the trains of military

275
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,320
to come through town

276
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,200
and to wait for one of those...

277
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,300
I want them to say,

278
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,680
that's the best barrel.

279
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,240
That barrel over there, that's the best one.

280
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:37,820
Yeah.

281
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,380
You better hope no fish jump out of it.

282
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,040
The prisoner in that barrel,

283
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,160
I don't know who she is, but she's good.

284
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,820
You know it's not a woman, man.

285
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,280
Shut up.

286
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,180
Those are orgasmic.

287
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,880
That's how you get through the end times.

288
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,620
Unless you have the biggest gun.

289
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,620
You take your duct tape,

290
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,720
you take your duct tape,

291
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,600
you take a big Hershey bar

292
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,460
because that's the survival candy bar.

293
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,540
You want to be able to take small, small pieces of it.

294
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,420
You duct tape this candy bar right up into your crotch there.

295
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,260
I didn't know...

296
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,320
You duct tape and just strap it right in there.

297
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,360
Is that the way you're really supposed to do it?

298
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,700
You're supposed to strap duct tape into your crotch?

299
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,180
I mean...

300
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:16,780
No, the food.

301
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,340
Hershey bar.

302
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,740
You're trading materials.

303
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,020
Oh, the loin packs.

304
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,300
Those are actual things that are trademarked.

305
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,140
Yeah, because that's what you're going to use to trade.

306
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,000
You're not pouring chocolate into your crotch.

307
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,360
The natives or the surviving wretches

308
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,100
in whatever country far away from America

309
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,120
that you flee to.

310
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,140
My dehydrated loin pack is leaking

311
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,580
and I've noticed sauce.

312
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,240
Oh, here's another one.

313
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,340
The reason you have to flee America

314
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,360
is because the Americans are taking over.

315
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,080
Yeah.

316
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,420
Yes.

317
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,840
I'm a political prisoner, man.

318
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,480
We better bring back the pillory and stocks

319
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,360
and stuff in there.

320
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,560
Today,

321
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,200
a U.S. nuclear fishing boat torn apart.

322
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,180
How one man's search for truth

323
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,740
almost cost him his hate.

324
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,260
Thank you.

325
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,040
Well, welcome, ladies.

326
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,400
And gentlemen, to this edition of Up the French.

327
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,280
It's not going to be pleasant.

328
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,340
I hate the French.

329
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,260
They'll always be ridiculous.

330
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,100
Yeah, the French are Nazis, as a matter of fact.

331
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,040
Lee?

332
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,360
Pat, a concern of several European terrorists.

333
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:25,900
Pat?

334
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,480
Lee, it's shocking.

335
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,640
The French Nazis build terrorism.

336
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,760
They are an instrument, an agent of terror.

337
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,700
Lee?

338
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,740
That's right, Pat.

339
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,380
Israel is carefully assessing

340
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,460
CBN News Middle East correspondent, Chris Schull.

341
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,680
Right, Pat?

342
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,980
Well, it could be bloody blood all over the place.

343
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,420
And just that simple.

344
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:44,940
Lee?

345
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,540
Want good cranberries and cancer and heart disease.

346
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,120
That's too bad, Pat, because I was thinking about

347
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,280
having a big old piece of bloodstream pie with disease on top.

348
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,220
How about the phrase, axis of Putin's soul?

349
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,600
It's in Texas.

350
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,720
No, not really.

351
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,140
Oh.

352
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,820
In Bosnia, they built a Mall of America in Bosnia now.

353
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,960
Well, they're working on Disneyland East,

354
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,160
which is what this guy on all sides was saying.

355
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
Disneyland Far East.

356
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,600
That's what this is all about.

357
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Disneyland East.

358
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,220
The largest Kmart in the world.

359
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,980
Have you heard the new chain, Bag Daddy?

360
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,780
The pants and the suit at the same time?

361
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,960
That is a disgusting prescription for anyone without brain cells.

362
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,400
What's your entire word yet, Jar?

363
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,000
So the bookie's taking bets on when this thing is going to start,

364
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,940
exactly when they're going to, like, boom, you know, go let the gates down.

365
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,060
They're laying the odds down.

366
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:38,940
Yeah.

367
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:38,940


368
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:38,940


369
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,520
When the first shot will be fired.

370
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,180
And it won't be shot.

371
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:42,640
Sit down.

372
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,600
From a shotgun.

373
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,500
We'll have nowhere to run.

374
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,480
And here comes Big Bad George.

375
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,160
Now, that was a true honor.

376
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,060
That's what Stein said.

377
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,840
In the military industrial complex.

378
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,100
Speaking of strange showbiz,

379
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,940
after the king of the universe spoke tonight,

380
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,940
suddenly they cut over to saying,

381
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,160
it looks like we're in hot pursuit of Osama bin Laden.

382
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,460
He's been spotted in the border.

383
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,860
I've got a standing back.

384
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,940
They're going to do it just like cops.

385
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,280
You know, you're going to have the music in the background and stuff.

386
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,520
And he's going to be running through like with the dachshund,

387
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,080
I think, chasing and biting his ass.

388
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,780
And then when he gets up on the top of one of those,

389
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,220
you know, old industrial warehouse buildings,

390
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,380
and they pull him down screaming and swearing in Arabic.

391
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,960
This is earlier today down in public square.

392
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,000
What's that spell?

393
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,120
Come on, all of you big strong men.

394
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,740
Uncle Sam, need your help?

395
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,460
Again, got himself in a terrible jam.

396
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,880
We down yonder in Baghdad.

397
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,200
Where are you?

398
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,860
We're going to have a whole lot of fun.

399
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,080
And it's one, two, three.

400
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,600
What are we fighting for?

401
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,180
Don't ask me.

402
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,240
I don't give a damn.

403
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,500
My next stop is Baghdad.

404
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,320
And it's five, six, seven.

405
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,000
Open up the pearly gates.

406
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,400
Because I just inhaled some anthrax.

407
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,160
I'm all going to die.

408
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,120
Now come on, Wall Street.

409
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,520
Don't be.

410
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,900
Why are you saying you have such a perplexed look on your face

411
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,920
as if you'd actually inhaled anthrax yourself?

412
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,900
Well, actually, I was thinking about some of my buddy's kids

413
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,480
who were on their way over there.

414
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,180
I sometimes think about the soldiers.

415
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,160
Usually you're preoccupied with buds and squids,

416
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,240
and now you're thinking about your buddy's kids.

417
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,400
How open-hearted are you?

418
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,300
You're not singing along.

419
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,780
I don't think you want to stop this war.

420
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:37,980
Oh.

421
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,280
You.

422
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,240
Do you really take yourself seriously?

423
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,520
I have big teeth and big glasses.

424
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,420
We think you're stupid.

425
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,760
You must forgive me.

426
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,120
You show your stupidity by assuming that we're like you.

427
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,340
You've got three or four D.I.A. and C.I.E.

428
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,900
evidence at your fucking door.

429
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,680
Oh, my God.

430
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,180
All right.

431
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,560
He almost passed out.

432
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,840
It's time to play Name That War.

433
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,420
You're five miles south of Bogota City.

434
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,140
You're in the rain forest.

435
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,380
Oh, my God.

436
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,000
What do the initials F-A-R-C stand for?

437
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,400
It's protest.

438
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,780
I think that's another reason they're having the war now

439
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,720
so that the protesters can't protest

440
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,880
because it's all zero degrees.

441
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,940
There'd be a lot more people out there.

442
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,020
Well, that's what the weather control people say.

443
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,780
It's ruining it.

444
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,200
Rubber bands and aluminum sulfide do a dandy treat make.

445
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,740
She's suspended from arrogance.

446
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,000
And left to wait.

447
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,660
Children who flop and children who flip

448
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,440
will freeze in the rain like a big old drip.

449
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:46,740
Wow.

450
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,200
It's about weather control.

451
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,360
It's about the Lusitania, too,

452
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,080
but you've got to be a real conspiracy buff.

453
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,780
Cowboy poetry is so romantic.

454
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,060
I was going to play my mouth for it,

455
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,340
but I've been shamed.

456
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,420
It gets my heart all fluttered.

457
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,520
Yes, you have been shamed.

458
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,940
By the grace of God.

459
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:08,940


460
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:08,940


461
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:08,940


462
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,700
By the grace of God.

463
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,240
And by the grace of God.

464
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,780
You will know me in a moment.

465
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,880
This song is depressing you, Chad.

466
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,360
They start with Bob.

467
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:19,940
War is depressing, Dave.

468
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,500
Stop thinking about all them body bags.

469
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,800
War is depressing.

470
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,480
That's all I can think of is body bag after bag

471
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,580
coming out of Arlington.

472
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,700
Yeah.

473
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,120
Back of those old planes.

474
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,760
Everybody's real gung-ho right now.

475
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,980
Everybody's real like, yeah,

476
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,720
this is going to be like the Super Bowl coming up.

477
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,240
Oh, yeah.

478
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,640
Wait till Zadon drops.

479
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,080
Drop on them chemical bombs.

480
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,620
On TV.

481
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,780
The right-wing jocks are going so crazy.

482
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,140
Wait till our boys are coming home

483
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,140
with their skin peeled off their faces.

484
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,780
Yeah, and it's communicable, too,

485
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,700
up to six generations.

486
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,080
We'll see how gung-ho they all are.

487
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,160
I think it's a pretty small everybody

488
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,780
that's real excited.

489
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,680
They wish they would have gone.

490
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,340
Oh, I'm sorry.

491
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:54,900
What?

492
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,920
What did you say?

493
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,160
I think it's a pretty small everybody

494
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,460
that's all excited.

495
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,460
I do, too.

496
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,560
I think it's more bunch of people going,

497
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,040
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

498
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,460
A good friend of mine was telling me about,

499
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,020
but a good friend of mine,

500
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,340
he's a blue-collar kind of guy,

501
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,220
works, you know, doing blue-collar work,

502
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,480
and telling me how all those guys,

503
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,100
they all listen to Rush Limbaugh,

504
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,580
and they're all so, you know.

505
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,660
Oh, those guys are crazy.

506
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,920
They gung-ho about everything, about it.

507
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,600
I was just going to tell you guys something

508
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,640
I heard on the Savage show.

509
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,660
That guy is so nuts.

510
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,060
He claimed that a demonstrator

511
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,040
waded through a police line

512
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,340
and a line of horses,

513
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,440
grabbed a horsey by its bridle,

514
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,180
punched it, and knocked it down on the ground.

515
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,420
A demonstrator did that?

516
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,020
Like, blazing.

517
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,680
We need those guys in back here.

518
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,300
Let's get back to promoting the war.

519
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,320


520
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,700
It's reality.

521
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,460
Face the flag, you son of a bitch.

522
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,820
Take a good long look.

523
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,580
What you're seeing now can't be found in a history book.

524
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,680
It's the present.

525
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,800
The future, son, is being written now.

526
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,940
You're the one to write it.

527
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,060
The flag can show you how.

528
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,300
You know what?

529
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,440
You know what?

530
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,180
What it stands for.

531
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,320
What its makers meant.

532
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,580
Think.

533
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,320
Speak.

534
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,880
Privilege of dissent.

535
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,640
To think our leaders might be wrong

536
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,140
to stand and tell them so.

537
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,840
I've got to touch a hangover, bureaucrat.

538
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,860
Don't push me.

539
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,720
These are the things that other men

540
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,260
under other flags will never know.

541
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,540
But responsibility,

542
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,920
that's the cost that free men must bear.

543
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,440
You know, if we had any moral character,

544
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,320
we wouldn't be standing here covered

545
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,220
with mud drinking.

546
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,720
If you don't accept that,

547
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,560
somebody ought to belt you in the mouth.

548
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,140
Face the flag of stars and bars,

549
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,760
of red and white and blue.

550
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,320
A flag that guarantees the rise

551
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,160
for men like me and you.

552
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,400
Face the flag, son, and face reality.

553
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,600
My mind is a globe with whirling,

554
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,340
transient nodes of thought,

555
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,580
careening through a cosmic vapor of invention.

556
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,200
Our strength and our freedoms are based in unity.

557
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,060
The flag is but a symbol, son.

558
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,220
The world's greatest nation.

559
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,500
As long as it keeps flying,

560
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,220
there's cause for celebration.

561
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,300
So do what you gotta do, but don't give up.

562
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,000
But always keep in mind,

563
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,560
God has a heart on for Marines,

564
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,180
because we kill everything we see.

565
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,200
Face the flag, son,

566
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,720
and thank God it's still there.

567
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,580
A cut-up by Artemia Salina and John Wayne.

568
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,600
Other splicings and slicings in here by

569
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,040
Fernanda Nandi-Lemur.

570
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,760
Lots of ESO Swamp Radio tonight

571
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,100
from WCSB Cleveland at wcsb.org

572
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,800
if you want to hear it streaming live on Thursday nights.

573
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,740
And that features Princess Wee Chess Smith,

574
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,420
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

575
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,380
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

576
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,820
in Extreme Union with himself.

577
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,400
Extreme Union with himself?

578
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,240
A form of Tourette's Syndrome that affects people

579
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,560
only when they call radio.

580
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,900
You're not gonna stop the patin'.

581
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,420
You're not gonna stop the patin'.

582
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,320
It's the Watson-Hyde Syndrome, eh?

583
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,100
I found a note on my desk that said,

584
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,260
a witch with Tourette's.

585
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,600
A witch with Tourette's?

586
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,260
Yeah, and I can't figure out what the heck

587
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,980
that note was supposed to refer to.

588
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,220
I wanna see him go to war.

589
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,460
Was that a warning to myself?

590
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,960
I wanna see him go to war just so that

591
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,740
there's a lot of dead people all over the place.

592
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,400
You mean the awards in Baghdad?

593
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:57,980
Yeah.

594
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,940
Hosted by Jewel, Tommy Franks.

595
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,540
Yeah, he's gonna be the new Sheik of Baghdad.

596
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,740
Of Arabi.

597
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,020
Sheik Franks.

598
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,620
Can you see him with a kaftan on his forehead?

599
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,840
A kaftan?

600
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,940
That's a pair of underpants.

601
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,020
Slice his throat.

602
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,160
Spice his head.

603
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,600
Get the barbecue ready.

604
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,580
General Tommy, your meat is my meat,

605
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,700
Frankfurter himself.

606
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,820
He views the world as his hot dog,

607
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,520
ready to be eaten.

608
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,280
Barbecued and served with a choice toxic mustard.

609
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,840
I wanna be the mustard.

610
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
You are the mustard.

611
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,520
You're the glint in Tommy Franks's eye.

612
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,560
While friends and lovers mourn your silly grave.

613
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,540
Look, it's the barrel of a tank.

614
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,700
I have a business for you, darling.

615
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,100
I forgot news for you, darling.

616
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,980
Here's a tactical nuke.

617
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,300
Up your ass.

618
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,720
Jesus.

619
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,040
Get back, Baghdaddy.

620
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,220
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

621
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,940
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

622
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,600
to the Arabian Nights.

623
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,240
Don't those guys have, like, genies

624
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,680
and flying carpets and stuff?

625
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,180
Yeah.

626
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,620
And what about the...

627
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,760
Can't they, like, rub this lamp

628
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,260
and have hordes of scimitar-wielding

629
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,720
balloon pantaloons?

630
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,740
Turbans.

631
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,480
Yeah, Alibaba, 40 thieves type guys.

632
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,480
What open sesame guys.

633
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,340
Right, open sesame guys.

634
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,340
People who make it happen.

635
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,580
Businessmen in boxer shorts.

636
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,940
Turban young fez drivers

637
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,400
in Pocono Oriental cabs.

638
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,660
Small, medium, and large-sized shakes.

639
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,340
All your bones included.

640
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,480
He tried to kill my daddy.

641
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,520
I killed everybody's daddy, man.

642
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,860
They killed Daddy Junior.

643
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,960
Well, things aren't going to kill my daddy.

644
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,860
What would Jesus do now?

645
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,600
War, war, war, war, war, healing.

646
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,780
Demons.

647
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,800
Racism.

648
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:06,740
Sexism.

649
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,800
Anti-Semitism.

650
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,180
Arab-bashing.

651
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,840
Anti-Islamism.

652
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,900
Gay-bashing.

653
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,460
War.

654
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,320
Britain.

655
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:13,820
Britain.

656
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,200
War.

657
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,020
War.

658
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,620
War.

659
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,080
War.

660
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,780
Jesus.

661
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,600
Jesus.

662
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,080
Yeah, I used that on the X-rated hour of Slack

663
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,960
just last week.

664
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,240
The one that's not played on radio stations,

665
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,440
but only on the intranet.

666
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,440
And the inter-net.

667
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,500
I can't see.

668
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,080
He can see.

669
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,880
I can't see.

670
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,040
I can't see.

671
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,000
I can't see.

672
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,280
I can't see.

673
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,540
I can't see.

674
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:33,540


675
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:33,540


676
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:33,540


677
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:33,540


678
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:33,540


679
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:33,540


680
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,300
Maybe I can see.

681
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:34,700
I can't see.

682
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,460
Oh.

683
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,440
Every time you guys cuss,

684
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,180
that ends up on a secret show.

685
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,060
There's a song going out for George.

686
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,120
The Magu link.

687
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,440
The Emperor.

688
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,720
The king of the universe.

689
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,800
King of the universe.

690
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,680
King.

691
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,560
Ray.

692
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,360
Ray.

693
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:48,640
Oh, baby.

694
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,780
Ray del Cosimo.

695
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,540
El Imperador de Total Cosimo.

696
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,160
Ray wants me to go up there all day.

697
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,940
How ready am I?

698
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,280
Hear me.

699
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,420
What the hell?

700
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,460
The sound of my voice.

701
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,520
We might.

702
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,660
You must get that, Sadam.

703
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,140
And I've made my choice.

704
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,360
When y'all voted me sheriff, I said I was gonna rid this town of these barb-

705
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,300
I'm gonna do it anyway.

706
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,340
I will conquer the Assyrians with my funny fake goatee and pharaoh hat.

707
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,640
You may think that I'm a fool.

708
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,360
You may think that I'm a fool.

709
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,900
But you are a fool.

710
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,100
If you believe we can quack out of this, Maya-

711
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,080
Who gets the harems?

712
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,320
The harems?

713
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,280
Yeah, the harems.

714
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,440
I've heard a lot about harems in those palaces in Baghdad.

715
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,400
No, I just thought that was an esophical grunt when someone said-

716
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,120
No, man, you know, the sultans would get harems, and-

717
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,780
There must be harems.

718
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,640
They don't have sultans anymore in Iraq.

719
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,880
Well, there's always-

720
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,580
Yeah, right.

721
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,860
Just like they don't have kings here, right?

722
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,360
Right.

723
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,560
It's an undemocratic people's republic.

724
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,480
Yeah, I suppose they do.

725
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,140
Yeah.

726
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,580
Yeah.

727
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,600
Sultans.

728
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,200
Yeah.

729
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,460
Sultans of Swig.

730
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,260
Sultans of the ornament.

731
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,920
Chairman Mao had a harem.

732
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,520
Pharaohs.

733
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,080
Jack Kennedy had a harem.

734
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,740
And you, sir-

735
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,620
Where do they keep the pharaohs?

736
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,680
Or no Jack Kennedy?

737
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,700
I know Mao Zedong, my friend, and you, I know Mao Zedong.

738
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,820
Actually, that's a pretty old turf there.

739
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,640
That's, you know, the Tigris and Euphrates.

740
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,900
Oh, yeah, that's the oldest.

741
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,540
It's the birthplace of civilization.

742
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:24,820
Mesopotamia.

743
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,640
Yeah.

744
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,500
They're afraid of the-

745
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
The Fertile Crescent.

746
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,800
Yeah, speaking of Fertile Crescent, that's-

747
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,080
The amount of archaeological cool-sign.

748
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,840
Stuff that's going to get buried a little deeper is just horrifying.

749
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,280
Well, that's the hex theory.

750
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,160
That he's trying to get rid of that.

751
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,620
But that's up to Saddam.

752
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,200
That's up to Saddam Hussein.

753
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,180
It's his choice.

754
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,220
This land is cursed by a Sumerian god, and you must get rid of it and destroy it.

755
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:49,540
No?

756
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,560
Something like that?

757
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,180
If only it was just going to get buried, but you know it's going to get smashed to smithereens.

758
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,560
Just like that little ibex.

759
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,680
Which was the ancient civilization in which the ladies did not wear shirts?

760
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,840
Oh, Manoa.

761
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,620
Yeah, right.

762
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,200
The Manoans.

763
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,920
Yes, my favorite civilization, yes.

764
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,840
They had the cool labyrinths and the bull-headed monster guys.

765
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,800
They would ride bulls and all the men would applaud.

766
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,480
And they'd quit, yeah, and they'd make fun of the Cretans.

767
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:12,620
We need just one victory.

768
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,040
Just like we do.

769
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,420
God's mitans.

770
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,640
And we're on to North Korea.

771
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,880
The church of the sub-Cretans.

772
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,820
That's what we should tell everybody over there in the war zones tonight.

773
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,280
God's mitans!

774
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,760
That's what the Fuhrer used to say.

775
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,060
Dons.

776
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,460
And we're saying it again.

777
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,760
God's mitans!

778
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,280
What does that mean, Dave?

779
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,920
It means God is with us.

780
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,180
He's talking about the mitans.

781
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:33,260
I'm putting on the mitans.

782
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,360
I'm putting on the mitans.

783
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,020
God's mitans.

784
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,220
God's mitans.

785
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,220


786
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,220


787
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,220


788
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,220


789
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,220


790
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,220


791
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,220


792
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,220


793
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,220


794
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,220


795
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,560
God is with us.

796
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,740
Oh, yeah, sure.

797
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,700
They believed it in those days, and they believe it now.

798
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,300
In the bowling alleys and parking lots around America.

799
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,200
In stubby Sam City.

800
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,540
In Carl's Magic Theater.

801
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,140
Every place you might go and have your hair tortured.

802
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,000
Or maybe have your feet upturned.

803
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,520
They believe this myth.

804
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,700
This mythological creature called war takes care of everything.

805
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,200
A shalool ha la la la Bob.

806
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:01,880
La la.

807
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,360
A shalool la la ha la Bob.

808
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,420
Bob Akbar?

809
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,440
Bob Akbar!

810
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,020
He is great.

811
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,740
Greater than my shoe size and twice as small as my cranium.

812
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,040
Bob Akbar!

813
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:33,360
To begin with, it may be surprising to know that radiation is invisible rays that we call radiation.

814
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,920
They are about the size of table salt or fine sand.

815
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,200
We don't worry about radiation.

816
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:46,720
Radiation would not affect us much, for instance, because any material will keep the penetrating rays from hurting us.

817
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:55,200
Within an hour after a massive enemy attack, fallout in the vicinity of any nuclear groundburst will be destroyed beyond repair.

818
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,540
Suppose a nuclear explosion takes place at 12 noon.

819
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
By 1 o'clock, all the fallout is down.

820
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:08,820
If fallout settles on your food, the food itself isn't harmed or made radioactive.

821
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,200
Fallout swallowed accidentally with food or in drinking water would do you no harm.

822
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,740
So we would not have to take precautions using everyday methods of food preparation.

823
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:23,260
And hungry people should not be denied animals because of possible contamination.

824
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,640
If we remember these facts,

825
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,360
if we act intelligent,

826
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,080
we can increase our chances of nuclear attack.

827
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:38,800
Many people have difficulty understanding how blood and tissues are pulled up into the mushroom cloud.

828
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,420
That's why the federal government has a nationwide program.

829
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:47,380
The goal is a raging nuclear furnace that shoots out showers of fallout.

830
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,200
Adequate fallout for every man, woman and child.

831
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,640
This goal can be reached.

832
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,960
For with radiation,

833
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,140
we can face the facts about the nuclear age.

834
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,520
The Nuclear Waves

835
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:03,520


836
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:03,520


837
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,260
On the Earth

838
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,660
On the Earth

839
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:09,700
On the Earth

840
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:09,700


841
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:09,700


842
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,700
On the Earth

843
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,680
On the Earth

844
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,520
On the Earth

845
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,940
On the Earth

846
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,540
On the Earth

847
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,160
There are new security measures here because of the terrorist activity going on.

848
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,780
The homeland is locked down.

849
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,060
Yeah, and there was a Patriot Act stamp to the door for your reading edifice.

850
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,340
Dave, have you looked in a mirror?

851
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,980
There's one stamped on your forehead.

852
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,340
Lick the postage stamp, man.

853
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,060
So I can look through my...

854
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,920
Yeah, so you don't forget for one second what the rules are, buddy.

855
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,020
One second.

856
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,680
You can't forget the rules.

857
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,920
Are you going to be a teen player?

858
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,740
I'm watching the phone.

859
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,440
Are you with us or are you against us?

860
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,360
Private?

861
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,340
Are you privates private or are they mine?

862
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,520
I belong to you, sir.

863
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,980
You're privates are my privates and you're privates are my privates.

864
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,700
Just keep your privates private, okay?

865
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,180
Next week, America enters the torture zone on

866
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,500
Torturing the Enemy Part 3 with a celebrity I want to get the mob out of here.

867
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,840
Next week, it might be a very different situation.

868
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,720
Starting down...

869
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,880
Downtown Julie Brown.

870
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,940
Kaz Kanoya.

871
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,000
Color-coded.

872
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,480
Johnny Stettle of Joplin.

873
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,780
People for our mouths to keep us from broadcasting this daughter.

874
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,920
Tommy Franksberger.

875
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,100
The broadcast industry of America.

876
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,960
The shelf-told people who live in your face.

877
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,000
I just don't know what to do.

878
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,680
I thought I'd come and ask you.

879
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,820
Military action to destroy them with weapons of mass destruction.

880
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,740
Well, um...

881
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,720
This is...

882
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:52,720


883
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:52,720


884
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:52,720


885
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:52,720


886
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:52,720


887
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:52,720


888
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:52,720


889
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,380
This nation has weapons of mass destruction.

890
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,320
Yeah.

891
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,440
He is acting the insincerely to actors.

892
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,520
Well, thanks anyway for talking to me.

893
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,020
Well...

894
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,680
Why am I in London?

895
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:09,820
Because.

896
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,300
Because.

897
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:10,720
Faith.

898
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,180
Faith.

899
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,500
Faith.

900
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:11,960
Power.

901
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,380
Faith.

902
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:12,940
Moses.

903
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,560
Joshua.

904
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,480
Marching.

905
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:14,660
Faith.

906
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,080
Jesus.

907
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,720
Marching.

908
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:15,980
Faith.

909
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,640
Marching.

910
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,020
God.

911
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,700
Dark.

912
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,000
Light.

913
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:18,900
Racism.

914
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,640
Sexism.

915
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,420
Militarism.

916
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,280
New World Order.

917
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:21,780
Heal.

918
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:21,960
Hope.

919
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,280
Healing.

920
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:22,600
Hope.

921
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,020
Healing.

922
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:23,360
Hope.

923
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:23,740
Healing.

924
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,140
Peace.

925
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:24,480
Hope.

926
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:24,880
Healing.

927
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,140
Hope.

928
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,500
Healing.

929
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:25,780
Hope.

930
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,140
Healing.

931
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,480
Peace.

932
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,140
Peace.

933
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,660
Hope.

934
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,140
Hope.

935
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,620
Hope.

936
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,160
Hope.

937
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,260
I love you.

938
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,120
Children.

939
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:32,740
Children.

940
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,100
Children.

941
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,520
Hope.

942
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:33,880
Love.

943
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,560
Love.

944
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,140
Faces.

945
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:35,780
Places.

946
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,300
Hope.

947
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:36,860
Hope.

948
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,280
Hope.

949
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,920
Love you.

950
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,960
It was another normal night and I got done fighting with my wife

951
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,660
So I went down to the bar and just made all day, can't roll

952
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,480
Since I was a little kid, they've been the two best friends

953
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,340
That a man could ever hope for in this world

954
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,000
Now I'm a normal guy and I work all day for my money

955
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,660
And I fear the good Lord like I know I should

956
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,380
I ain't no new age coot, but I gotta get this off my chest

957
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,080
And put this tragedy behind me now for good

958
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,780
I remember getting drunk and I remember falling down

959
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,520
When someone laid me on a pool table and not a bit too soon

960
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,300
Then through the blinding lights two creatures stared into my eyes

961
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,820
As had the jukebox or a flying saucer spinning round the room

962
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:45,120
And I tell myself this couldn't have been a member of the human race

963
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,480
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men from outer space

964
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,260
Well it hit me like trouble in the back of my head

965
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,020
Knocked me clean out of my shoes

966
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,460
And when I woke up, Lord, I wished that I was dead

967
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,040
I had got off the case of those abduction blues

968
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,560
This must have been an abduction, Lord

969
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,080
Cause I don't know what happened

970
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,240
But I'm not sure what happened

971
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,240


972
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,700
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue

973
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,380
Now I say, can they look crazy?

974
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,140
But I know that it weren't them

975
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,860
Say the things that they can do and never do

976
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,140
Well, when at last I woke

977
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,120
Both my legs, they had been broke

978
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,960
Both my eyes were black

979
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,820
And my ears were stringing bad

980
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,120
I'd seen enough of nasty things

981
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,580
But this was the worst case

982
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,240
Of intergalactic relations I've ever had

983
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,480
And I tell myself this couldn't have been a member of the human race

984
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,840
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men from outer space

985
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,540
Well it hit me like trouble in the back of my head

986
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,360
Knocked me clean out of my shoes

987
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,940
And when I woke up, Lord, I wished that I was dead

988
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,560
I had got off the case of those abduction blues

989
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,820
This must have been an abduction, Lord

990
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,300
Cause I don't know what happened

991
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,960
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue

992
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,740
Now I say, can they look crazy?

993
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,440
But I know that it weren't them

994
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,520
Say the things that they can do and never do

995
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,980
Never do

996
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,260
The Ballad of Zeke and Earl

997
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,380
Hank Floyd and the Swerving Headlights

998
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,180
From Interstellar Cattle Drive

999
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:03,300
Friends, that's www.swervingheadlights.com

1000
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,500
Before that, Lemur collages

1001
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,460
War is hell, my friends

1002
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,420
But Bob brings hope and confusion

1003
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,320
1993, copyrighted, yeah

1004
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,320
Oh, yeah, after the brain

1005
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,660
2003, I mean

1006
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,380
What column am I saying?

1007
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,080
Which century?

1008
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,220
1993, copyrighted, yeah

1009
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:22,220


1010
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,040
1903

1011
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,360
This might be 1903, Chaz

1012
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,820
The conspiracy is so powerful

1013
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,660
But we don't know what year this really is

1014
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,140
And Bob could show up any second

1015
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,480
For all we know, it's July

1016
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,780
Sure, there's snow on the ground

1017
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,440
But it might be July, for all we know

1018
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,300
They might have turned everything

1019
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,000
We don't even know if this is Earth, man

1020
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,060
No, we don't even know if the polar caps are the same ones we're wearing

1021
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:50,500
In fact, this might, for all we know, be a hideously polluted Mars

1022
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,220
And what we know is that this is not the Earth

1023
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,220
We call Mars the Earth left behind

1024
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:54,640
No

1025
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,700
After we polluted it the first time

1026
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,440
Or they polluted it, see

1027
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,220
I had the same

1028
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,580
I had a parallel thought

1029
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,900
I won't say that the parallel lines met

1030
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,540
But I had a parallel thought

1031
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,480
That they had gone into our brains

1032
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,020
Deep into our corpus callosum

1033
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,220
And the other pithy parts

1034
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,260
And they had reprogrammed everything

1035
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,280
To such a point

1036
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,180
That I was looking out my window

1037
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,540
And I was on another planet

1038
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,360
And we'd all been moved in our sleep

1039
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,960
Well, it wasn't us

1040
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,640
It was the powers that be

1041
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,680
The big guys, you know

1042
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,200
The ones that were there for us

1043
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,580
That weigh over 500, 600 pounds

1044
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,580
Not to mention the ones inside your own head, dude

1045
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,520
Well, they don't live in Telemetry City

1046
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,100
And they don't give me commands

1047
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,200
The ones in my head, dude

1048
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,060
Do you remember how to get to Shell Beach?

1049
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,940
Yeah, it was very distinctly a Shell Beaches experience

1050
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,620
Right, like that movie

1051
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,320
Cool City or Dark City

1052
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
Or Dark Coolness or whatever it was

1053
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,660
Night Town

1054
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,020
Night Town, yeah

1055
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,020
Going down to Night Town

1056
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,600
Hey, but I think the big news of the week

1057
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
Is really the, uh

1058
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,920
That Pioneer 10 winked off

1059
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,140
He knows how to cue

1060
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,600
He knows, pioneer

1061
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,240
Pioneer 10, 20, 28 years out there

1062
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,800
And it's out there now

1063
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,180
Right this very moment

1064
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,740
There's a piece of us

1065
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,920
Booking ass

1066
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,740
Out of the solar system

1067
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,580
And it's manned by two kiboshes

1068
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,480
And a piece of pie

1069
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,360
And that is science, man

1070
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,160
That is the expansion

1071
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,060
Of our ever-lessened

1072
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,320
Ever-pubescent

1073
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,460
Lusty waves

1074
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,580
20,000 years ago

1075
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,180
20,000 years from now

1076
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,280
A robot will find it

1077
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,080
And sell it on eBay for billions

1078
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,800
Because it will be the oldest

1079
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,680
Known thing built by the

1080
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,140
Extinct human race

1081
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,420
That is well said

1082
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,700
Because I thought you were going to say

1083
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,400
He's going to smell it and sell it to an ape

1084
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,560
And start it all over again

1085
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,720
You know, that's how it usually starts

1086
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,180
Well, that may be how it started at one point

1087
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,760
But I personally don't think so

1088
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,800
I think that we

1089
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,260
I think that the Yetis force evolved

1090
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,240
The humans so that they would

1091
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,320
Send that pioneer thing out into space

1092
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,780
It smells like rotting garbage, though

1093
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,220
To the country western singers

1094
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,000
Yeah, and Johnny Paycheck died

1095
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,180
Well, we talked about that last week

1096
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,900
Well, he actually fell asleep

1097
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,840
And nobody's been able to wake him up yet

1098
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,140
So they threw a big old wake

1099
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,380
And they tossed him in the earth

1100
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,600
Is this this week's show or last week's show?

1101
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,800
I don't know anymore

1102
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,480
Johnny Cash's birthday was this today

1103
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,620
Or a week ago today?

1104
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,840
Is it January or is it Julyuary?

1105
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,220
It's one of those days

1106
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,960
One of those 70-year-old days

1107
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,440
How old was Johnny?

1108
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,380
Your babies grow up to be couples

1109
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,520
Mamas don't let your babies

1110
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,080
Don't let them smoke froth

1111
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,980
And dress up like girls

1112
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,240
Grow little titties

1113
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,780
And go on girls

1114
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,120
Don't make them grow little titties

1115
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,920
We'll try not, moms

1116
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,980
Don't tell them not to

1117
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,680
That's just what they'll want to do

1118
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,900
Mamas don't let your babies go to X-Day

1119
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,960
Don't let them have

1120
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,220
A baby

1121
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,420
Operations that change their sexes

1122
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:58,460
It's a twisted, sick, demented bunch of people

1123
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,620
Mamas, please

1124
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,900
If you hear me

1125
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,240
If your babies do survive the war

1126
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,920
If they do come home from the war

1127
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,120
Don't let them go to X-Day

1128
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,640
Because they never really come home

1129
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,760
From X-Day

1130
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,620
They won't be babies no more

1131
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,640
You think a war might spank their booty?

1132
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,640
X-Day is going to spank their brains out

1133
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,660
This will be the sixth X-Day

1134
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,420
Or what we call Sixth Sex Day

1135
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,060
Sixth

1136
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,160
Sick

1137
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,060
There will be some six sex

1138
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:27,440
There will be six hundred and sixty-six

1139
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,440
Sick

1140
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,000
Sex monkeys

1141
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,220
Spelled sick, sick, sick

1142
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,600
With S-I-C-S-I-C

1143
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,640
As is, as is, as is

1144
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,380
Spelling out Bob with their butts

1145
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,520
Mooning the sky

1146
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,660
For the satellites to read

1147
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,360
And you'll be the quote marks on the end

1148
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,100
I'll be the queen of procreation

1149
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:45,940
Your two cheeks

1150
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,720
I'll be the lizard woman

1151
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,880
Pointing up at the satellites

1152
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,620
Of Ashcroft

1153
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,200
Ah

1154
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:50,740
We'll

1155
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,400
Be the quotes on Bob's butt name

1156
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,900
Attention!

1157
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:56,580
Attention!

1158
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,660
This is your beloved leader

1159
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,880
Og the Exalted

1160
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,280
There will be a special giant joy rally today

1161
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,240
At Og Memorial Stadium

1162
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:15,140
First let me say that this trip was made possible

1163
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,340
Only by our dauntless chief

1164
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,740
Og the Magnificent

1165
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,720
Introducing

1166
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,360
The new producer of Og Power

1167
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,920
Which runs most of our industry

1168
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,660
Naturally I protected government property

1169
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,740
By making the saucer invisible

1170
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,880
Yes, I brought the secrets back with me

1171
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,600
And here they are

1172
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,140
The big secret is of course oil

1173
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,280
Which has brought a better life

1174
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,220
To all the people in the USA

1175
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,760
But the key to making oil work for everybody

1176
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,440
Is competition

1177
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,260
Fellow Martians

1178
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,440
I thank you

1179
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:55,720
Hmm

1180
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,860
You know what this means Cosmic

1181
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,200
You bet I do Og

1182
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,160
It means that you're through

1183
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,460
So why don't you get lost

1184
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,920
Yes, the real secret is not only a great source of energy

1185
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,880
But also the freedom to make it work for everybody

1186
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,860
And if you have both of these things

1187
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,020
Any goal is possible

1188
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:25,440
It's destination unlimited

1189
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:34,280
Man continually strives to replace the old with the new

1190
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:38,780
A quarter of a mile high skyscraper's tower

1191
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:43,020
With convenient rest and recreational facilities for all

1192
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,000
On many of the buildings are landing decks

1193
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,820
For helicopters and autogyros

1194
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,320
Rich in sunshine is the city of 1960

1195
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,260
On all express city thoroughfares

1196
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,280
The rights of way have been so rooted

1197
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,240
As to displace outmoded business sections

1198
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,660
And undesirable slum areas whenever possible

1199
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,740
Somebody who had ch-go-nary

1200
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:19,800
It's a long way from here

1201
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,680
A man meetsuke

1202
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:40,660
On a stone Duluth

1203
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,300
And a man who siles

1204
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:42,820
For green rice

1205
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:42,980
Off to a beaver

1206
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,580
Beansprouts

1207
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,440
For all that 익

1208
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:49,780
Ways

1209
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,400
that affix to your testicles

1210
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,980
now have to be color-coded

1211
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,120
and there's like a warning

1212
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,540
that you have to sign off on

1213
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,620
or some sort of procreative gesture

1214
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,020
you have to make towards the wind.

1215
00:49:59,160 --> 00:49:59,520
I don't know.

1216
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,620
When will the superhero alien

1217
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,360
come and take us away?

1218
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,580
Stang, we've been waiting and waiting.

1219
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,640
Me too.

1220
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,480
When will the rugby trade

1221
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,080
come and take us away?

1222
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,900
If now wasn't a better time than any,

1223
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,780
I don't know what is.

1224
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,500
Yeah, really, man.

1225
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,200
Don't look at me.

1226
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,100
Well, we're trying not to.

1227
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,500
I've got a Bob's phone number.

1228
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,220
But you're right there.

1229
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,760
No, no, I'm just a PR pack, man.

1230
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,020
I'm supposed to go.

1231
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,100
Why?

1232
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,120
We don't know.

1233
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:25,940
Well, we don't.

1234
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,200
We don't know what year it is

1235
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:27,900
and we don't know.

1236
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,020
I know this.

1237
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,320
Bob said that the X's

1238
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,960
would come July 5th, 1998.

1239
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,100
Obviously, it is not yet July 5th, 1998.

1240
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,520
Perhaps we'll be lucky

1241
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,880
and tomorrow will be.

1242
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,400
You're off by 14 years

1243
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,480
by the Mayan calendar,

1244
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,460
which is given affixed as July 5th.

1245
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,460
The Mayan calendar is covered

1246
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,000
with some sort of

1247
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,200
year-end calendar.

1248
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,200


1249
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,340
Yellowish juice.

1250
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,980
Mayan, as opposed to urine.

1251
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,040
Yours and mine.

1252
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:54,740
Urine and mine.

1253
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:54,920
Oh!

1254
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,040
Yeah, oh, oh.

1255
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,660
You were talking about

1256
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,260
the Andean calendar

1257
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:58,980
of the...

1258
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,020
The prepubescent one.

1259
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,400
Husky people of the Andes.

1260
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,540
Yes, the Husky.

1261
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,640
And what exactly happens

1262
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,040
at 7 a.m.?

1263
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,080
On 2012,

1264
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,860
a bunch of the Mayan elder gods

1265
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,300
come down from the clouds.

1266
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,620
That's what happens.

1267
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,360
Of the year 1998,

1268
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,340
Bob's good buddies

1269
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,160
from Planet X

1270
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:19,760
who happen to be

1271
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,700
sex goddesses

1272
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,980
will come down

1273
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,120
or up or in

1274
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,200
from another dimension.

1275
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,620
They'll arrive at some way.

1276
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:29,900
Yeah, yeah.

1277
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,580
Or rather,

1278
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,560
we shall be vacated.

1279
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:33,700
We will vacate

1280
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,120
this evacuation chamber,

1281
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,780
this great latrine

1282
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,520
called Earth Farm 1,

1283
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,040
where the aliens have raised us

1284
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,580
in order to feed off

1285
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,020
of our anguish and pain.

1286
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,000
And they'll have a great dessert

1287
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,080
of those left behind

1288
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,000
in their anguish

1289
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,360
and pain.

1290
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,880
They especially do love

1291
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,620
the ones we're raised

1292
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,820
in their own filth, don't they?

1293
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,320
are punished, and the

1294
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,180
deuce-paying, squeaky ministers

1295
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,360
are squeaky clean.

1296
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:58,980
Ah.

1297
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,240
Rubbed.

1298
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:00,780
Rubbed down.

1299
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,480
Pure of impurities.

1300
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,740
It's Peter the Parrot.

1301
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,160
Oh!

1302
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,720
Wait, the biggest thing.

1303
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,520
Hello?

1304
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,760
Can you have Oren call home?

1305
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,340
No.

1306
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,100
Oren, please call home.

1307
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:10,400
Hey.

1308
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,380
His honey is irked.

1309
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,300
How could we...

1310
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,320
I mean, yeah.

1311
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,560
I mean, but wait a minute.

1312
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:14,960
Hey.

1313
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,420
Hey.

1314
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,600
Now, come on.

1315
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,560
Like, dudes, like, hold on.

1316
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,520
Now, hey.

1317
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,180
Wait, everybody.

1318
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,680
Like, put the pipe down, man.

1319
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:21,100
Yeah.

1320
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:21,620
Hold on.

1321
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,360
Just open those eardrums.

1322
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:23,540
Wait.

1323
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,760
Mr. Rogers died.

1324
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,540
Once again.

1325
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,940
We have another casualty.

1326
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,440
Now, you know the real

1327
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,600
end times are near

1328
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,560
when Mr. Rogers makes his escape.

1329
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,940
He tried to get in that

1330
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,940
little train.

1331
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,240
He got off, man.

1332
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:39,680
He got off.

1333
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,960
He tried to shrink his mind

1334
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,940
and get in the little train

1335
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,180
and take off to Smallville.

1336
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,600
When I heard Mr. Rogers died,

1337
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,720
I got real scared.

1338
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,180
Well, but he's with his grandpa now.

1339
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:48,360
That's because he's...

1340
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:48,740
He's the implant.

1341
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,280
I got real scared, man,

1342
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,280
because I just know

1343
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,580
if there's no Mr. Rogers here anymore,

1344
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,200
there's nothing to keep the aliens

1345
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,320
from toasting this place.

1346
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,420
What about the Teletubbies?

1347
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,280
It's the implant.

1348
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,940
That's why he got scared

1349
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,140
when Mr. Rogers died.

1350
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,540
Yeah, they'll be leading the charge.

1351
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,580
It's because of the microangel.

1352
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,660
Once again, you guys,

1353
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,040
you don't get scared

1354
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,160
when Mr. Rogers dies.

1355
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:07,900
You feel sad.

1356
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,320
See?

1357
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,800
Look at how screwed up he is

1358
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,760
because of that implant.

1359
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,120
I'm scared as hell.

1360
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,480
Your implant is not even put

1361
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,180
in the right place

1362
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:14,220
behind your neck.

1363
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,360
What's going to keep George Bush

1364
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,420
from just, you know,

1365
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,740
nuking the whole Earth now?

1366
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,440
Mr. Rogers is gone.

1367
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,320
Well, they used to meet

1368
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,020
regularly to discuss, you know,

1369
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,020
policy and so forth.

1370
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,380
No more beautiful days

1371
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,640
in neighborhood Earth,

1372
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,700
boys and girls.

1373
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

1374
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,040
you've heard the reports

1375
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,600
that enemy planes are approaching.

1376
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,540
In less than three hours,

1377
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,280
an H-bomb might fall over Portland.

1378
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,060
Like myself,

1379
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,260
I think you're going to be

1380
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:47,880
very interested

1381
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,660
in this story

1382
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,680
that we're going to tell you.

1383
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,040
And in this age of missiles

1384
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,840
and man-made moons,

1385
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,980
it takes on added significance.

1386
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,780
There are no actors in this story,

1387
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,660
but there are a lot of people.

1388
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,360
The people of the city

1389
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,220
of Portland, Oregon.

1390
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,280
And what happened to them

1391
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,940
or could happen to them

1392
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,200
on a day that we'll call X.

1393
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:13,700
Holding hands,

1394
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,440
waiting for that foghorn to blow.

1395
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:17,860
It's been three years

1396
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,560
and three hours now

1397
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,400
and he said he was

1398
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,740
never going to come again.

1399
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,520
But I knew I'd just stay here and wait.

1400
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,360
I could hear the footsteps

1401
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,640
from two blocks away.

1402
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,020
Those big chubby feet

1403
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:30,780
slapping against the pavement.

1404
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,040
Yeah, it was W for War Bush

1405
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,720
and his buddy

1406
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,740
Sodom and Smackham Hobie.

1407
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,720
Yeah, they thought they had

1408
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,980
the streets sealed up.

1409
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,320
They thought they were

1410
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:42,860
clean to the bean.

1411
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,820
Yeah, they thought they were

1412
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,380
the ones to run the whole show.

1413
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,540
But I was taking pictures, see,

1414
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,900
and I was writing everything down.

1415
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,920
I'm losing patience now.

1416
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,120
Oh, baby, no.

1417
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,380
Okay, stop the car here.

1418
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,280
This is Sbarro's restaurant.

1419
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,380
We're going to have to go in

1420
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:02,960
for a little while

1421
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,000
and pretend like we're

1422
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,100
talking to each other.

1423
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,320
We both know

1424
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,280
there's no need for talk anymore.

1425
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,600
No need for talk.

1426
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,960
Everything's going on

1427
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,260
behind the scenes.

1428
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,660
Behind the scenes.

1429
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,780
Everyone knows

1430
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,020
that everyone blows.

1431
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,480
There's nothing going on

1432
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,840
in front.

1433
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,280
And there's nothing going on

1434
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,720
behind your eyes.

1435
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,640
But behind your back

1436
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,600
we're doing plenty

1437
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,460
for the United States

1438
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,840
governments of America.

1439
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,160
Behind the curtain.

1440
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,140
Beyond the curtain.

1441
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,380
You, the representations

1442
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,160
of people we representative,

1443
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,940
we would like to know

1444
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,380
that we are not sham.

1445
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,940
We are not focused and smoky.

1446
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:46,660
We are real.

1447
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,740
And we represent

1448
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,540
your representations.

1449
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,480
We're behind each and every one

1450
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,100
of you Americans.

1451
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,620
Whispering funny things

1452
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,120
in the back of your neck.

1453
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,060
I don't know if I'm going to be

1454
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,040
able to pay my bills.

1455
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,120
No, I can't pay anything.

1456
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:04,840
Sometimes I just wish

1457
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,980
I could take a car

1458
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,260
and go out and shoot a

1459
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,940
goddamn partner.

1460
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:10,760
I'm behind you.

1461
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,920
Too many visions, man.

1462
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,680
Too many dreams.

1463
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,100
I saw the mushroom cloud again

1464
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:16,700
last night.

1465
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,260
And it wasn't in my suit, man.

1466
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,200
It was in my ears

1467
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,020
and my eyes.

1468
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,560
I'm looking out of the door.

1469
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,700
Everybody is watching.

1470
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,800
I'm in the dark, man.

1471
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,960
Like the walls of Jermichael.

1472
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,160
Let me in love.

1473
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,560
Let me in love.

1474
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,820
