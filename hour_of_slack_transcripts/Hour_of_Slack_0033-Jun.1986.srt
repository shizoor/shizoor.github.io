1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:17,020
Ah, yes dear friends, this is in fact Hour of Slack number 1141, which is a rerun of

2
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:27,620
Hour of Slack number 33 from early July of 1986, when I had just returned from six weeks

3
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:35,780
in China and Japan on a missionary trip. Yeah, that's it. And this was probably the last

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:43,840
show with Reverend Buck Naked as a co-host, because after he ran the show for the six

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,400
weeks that I was gone, when I returned to the station, the managers told me that it

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:56,280
was either Buck goes or all of Hour of Slack goes. And so went Buck. Anyway, to repeat,

7
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,340
friends, the material...

8
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,420
The material in this show is from when I was working for Reverend Mickey Grant on the film

9
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:12,920
China Run. I left China exactly three years before the Tiananmen Square Massacre, by the

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:20,480
way. Exactly three years. While I was there, the Chernobyl Russian nuclear reactor meltdown

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,160
happened, which made things even more interesting. But now let us continue back into the year

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,940
of 1980.

13
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,340
1986.

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,100
It's true, man. I just got a taste. But it was a thrill, baby, you really wake up

15
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:45,020
when getting up and you're treading that tightrope of danger. International intrigue.

16
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:53,540
Oh, I don't think you gotta get down any cooking.

17
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:53,780
I'm haunted by nature...

18
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:53,780


19
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,760
Damn radio!

20
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm sitting here watching TV in China,

21
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,120
and I'll tell you, we've been making these jokes

22
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,660
about how it's been 1984 since 1953 for a long time,

23
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,500
and I'm almost ashamed of myself

24
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,920
for making those kind of jokes about the U.S. now

25
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,600
because I didn't really know how true it was here.

26
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,700
And it has been 1984 since 1953 here.

27
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,160
Repent! Quit your job! Slack off!

28
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,880
Driven to the brink of false sanity

29
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,340
by the conspiracy's false reality,

30
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,180
and the pressure of a crumbling world,

31
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,760
then this may be for you.

32
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,440
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

33
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,740
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

34
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,840
Welcome, dear friends.

35
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,380
Yes.

36
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,140
Welcome, dear friends.

37
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,180


38
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,660
Welcome, dear friends.

39
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,200
Yes.

40
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,280
Welcome, dear friends,

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,860
to the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

42
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,440
With reverence, I will stand and pass the bag naked.

43
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,980
This is your announcer,

44
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,240
please hold.

45
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,460
Please hold.

46
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,120
Yes.

47
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,480
Yes.

48
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,240
Yes.

49
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,320
Praise Bob, dear friends.

50
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,460
Come on, send your pledges in.

51
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:31,960
You made your commitment.

52
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,560
Now follow through.

53
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,200
Thank you very much.

54
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,020
.

55
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,020


56
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,020
.

57
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,480
Yeah.

58
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,280
Yeah.

59
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,500
Yeah.

60
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,220
Well, welcome back, friends.

61
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,600
And...

62
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,200
I've got a couple of special guests with me.

63
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,640
I'm Pastor Buck Naked, your announcer.

64
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,700
And here with me in the studio, I've got the Spider Deacon, Jim,

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,440
and Reverend Ivan Stang.

66
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,520
Ah, yes, dear friends.

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,820
Back from the missionary trip to Red China.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,040
I'm back, and I'm Buddhaful.

69
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:14,980
.

70
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,880
Praise Buddha.

71
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,020
Ah, yes, friends.

72
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,960
Praise Buddha.

73
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,880
Back from mighty...

74
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:20,960
Praise Buddha.

75
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,400
We're back once again from mighty...

76
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,580
How come I'm making up my mind?

77
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,400
I'm mighty Red Chinese music here.

78
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm gonna stick this in this other receptacle.

79
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,640
And get this booger going.

80
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
Ah, yes.

81
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:34,680
.

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,380
Oh, listen to that, friends.

83
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,940
Beautiful tune given to me by a taxi driver in Beijing.

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:44,660
Ah.

85
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,800
Them were the days.

86
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,860
Leaving the Friendship Hotel in China.

87
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,560
Friends, I must say that Bob guided our hands while we were on a trip to China.

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:55,560


89
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:55,560


90
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:55,560


91
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:03,620
He was instrumental in us getting the great shipment of Habba Frop Zipulops out of Tibet.

92
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:10,520
Friends, you think it's easy getting that Frop out of Tibet, but, you know, China is

93
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,020
the only way to get in there now.

94
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:19,420
We had to get 10,000 copies of the book of the subgenius smuggled into China and 10,000

95
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,500
tons of Habba Frop Zipulops out of Lhasa and through customs.

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,560
And, friends, we're going to have a great time.

97
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:25,560


98
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:25,560


99
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,480
Friends, it's espionage.

100
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,680
It was dangerous work.

101
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,980
At times, we ministers had to pretend we were brain surgeons.

102
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,660
We had to pretend we were filmmakers, prisoners of war.

103
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,720
And, you know, compared to all that tightrope of danger, it's mighty dull to be back here

104
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,240
in Dallas.

105
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,840
Don't you agree, bud?

106
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,700
Yeah, pretty much.

107
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,260
I haven't been out of the country since the last time I was in Malaysia.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,440
They're doing good in Malaysia.

109
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,440
We ran into several students from there.

110
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:55,540
I'm glad you're here.

111
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,380
Some of the new zombies that have come out of Dobbs Town, the slack camps.

112
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,920
Friends, it was hard to leave China.

113
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,880
We had such a successful voyage there.

114
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,380
That vast, vast world of strange people.

115
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,060
And that's what's so great about them.

116
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,820
They're so strange.

117
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,300
I saw a good old DDT agent back there in Malaysia.

118
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,900
Speaking of strange.

119
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,780
Yeah, he was.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,520
I saw him.

121
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,240
He had a good operation.

122
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,380
He came through.

123
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,280
He had his operation.

124
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,340
He's doing better now.

125
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,340
Well, they heal up.

126
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,540
They heal up.

127
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:25,540


128
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,020
After a while, I'll have a scar on my head next time you see me.

129
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,800
Buck, as a matter of fact, made a special deal.

130
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:39,080
But yes, I'm full of sea slug, eel, octopus, ox tail dinners, live baby mice.

131
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,060
That's the best one.

132
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,120
We couldn't afford the monkey brain.

133
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,380
You know, they eat monkey brain live.

134
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,900
The monkey's head is stuck through a hole in the table and he's sitting there in utmost

135
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,780
terror and they take the cleaver and hack the top of his head off.

136
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,520
Then everybody takes the cleaver off.

137
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:55,520


138
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,420
Then everybody takes their chopsticks and goes at that still thinking brain.

139
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,160
I mean, they don't even do it with the electric saw like they do in Malaysia?

140
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,920
No, no, no.

141
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,700
This is restaurants.

142
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,520
These aren't people.

143
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,140
These are monkeys.

144
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,220
In Malaysia, it's people.

145
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,140
So you have to be a lot more careful when you're sucking down some brain, sucking some

146
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,820
soul down.

147
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,340
Damn good old brains.

148
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,220
Brain full.

149
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,720
But friends, you know, most Chinese, a quarter of the world, a billion people, they don't

150
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,700
even know about Bob.

151
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,720
Or they didn't until we were there.

152
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,000
But now, friends, there are five devout subgeni, including our new announcer with that you

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,860
heard a little earlier, Dr. Li Li Jing, the pope of all China.

154
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,660
And we hope to get here on the show at some point.

155
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,980
The high priestess of all Asia, Li Yang.

156
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,820
You'll like Li Yang.

157
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,700
But yes, friends, these are some of the top folks in China, and that's all it really takes

158
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,680
to spread the virus of our belief system throughout the world.

159
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:54,680


160
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:54,680


161
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,500
We're still very busy, we're only at mere one billion people.

162
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,480
So our new gang of four or five subgeniuses will be listening to this tape on Voice of

163
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,480
America on their shortwave.

164
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,820
So hello to Zhang Ping and Zhang Laoshi.

165
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,400
You like them too, buck.

166
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,060
We've got the best kind of missionaries out there.

167
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,160
We tried to get some signals out to the subgenius faithful in the States, but I believe we were

168
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,600
being scrambled by the Russians.

169
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,060
Yeah.

170
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,240
Yeah.

171
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:21,540


172
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:21,640
Yeah.

173
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,180
experiment that we helped conduct out there.

174
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,620
So how's it been going here Buck? I understand we've had an incredible new type of crank collar.

175
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,880
Yes, Mr. PP is our sort of remote

176
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,000
co-host now. He's been, we officially installed him. He sort of installed himself over the last month or two.

177
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,960
They tend to do that, you know after a while. Well, you know, we had to replace Ronald, let's put it that way.

178
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,960
I'll get it.

179
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,340
You'll get it.

180
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,940
Okay. Well,

181
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:07,060
you know friends, the Chinese, most of them are actually not communists we found out. They're mere, like you or me,

182
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,620
they're not dupes. They're mere victims of that hideous conspiracy that covers the globe.

183
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,740
And I'm afraid one thing I learned there is that the the conspiracy has a much tighter grip on

184
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,480
China than it does on the US. I probably should have known that already.

185
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,280
But you know you get about

186
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,680
8,000 miles out of China,

187
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,720
out of town Buck, and you start to realize just how much slack you actually had.

188
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,640
I'd be put into a work camp for doing this show for one night in China.

189
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,480
And you wouldn't last five minutes. Oh, I don't know. I'm sneakier than you think. But look, we also brought

190
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,440
we've also brought our missionary here, a Christian missionary named Mr. Jim Ryan, and he's here with us too.

191
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,340
Awesome.

192
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,560
So how have you been doing trying to Christianize the masses out there?

193
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:54,720
Jim?

194
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,940
Pastor Buck, I've had some problems.

195
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,240
The first of all, they keep throwing bottles at me, and I've been throwing them back at them.

196
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,180
And they just do not understand the word of Bob there.

197
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,660
Occasionally they break.

198
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,120
But what about the word of Christ?

199
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,480
Like I was talking to you on the phone a little while ago, Stang.

200
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,780
And you were telling me that the Chinese are getting pretty mad at the Christian missionaries.

201
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,500
Could you tell me anything about this at all?

202
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,500
That's, to me, the most interesting part of this interview.

203
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:31,840
Well, as I understand it, actually, the Chinese are very suspicious of particularly Christian missionaries

204
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,420
because they've done so much spy work for the Goh Men Dong over the years

205
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,080
and the Japanese and all the other people that ever invaded China,

206
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,140
and not to mention you, me, and all of our listeners.

207
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,200
So there's some suspicion now.

208
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,080
It's not true that there's no church allowed in China.

209
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:57,320
In fact, on our secret camera, we have film of a Catholic Chinese church.

210
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,080
The only difference is they can't obey the Pope of Rome.

211
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:06,060
They have to obey the Pope of China, who never has been one until our visit there.

212
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,500
The Italians are real upset about this, I hear.

213
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,240
Oh, absolutely.

214
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:09,960
I keep hearing that.

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,700
Of course.

216
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,640
I'm just wondering why we don't get anything on Cassette 1 up there.

217
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,880
Everything says, oh, don't worry about Cassette 1.

218
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,580
It's just a maniac.

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,060
Anyway, this is Cassette 2.

220
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,380
Okay.

221
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,460
Well, Cassette.

222
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,560
Well, friends, I understand.

223
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,980
You were doing something a couple of weeks ago about,

224
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,800
is Reverend Tsang really in China or is this a fake?

225
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,300
And somebody called up and said that they saw me downtown.

226
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,040
Well, you know, we like to keep things sort of under our hat on the hour of Slack Radio Ministry,

227
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,640
and when we send one of our people abroad,

228
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,180
we're not going to tell you until he comes back because, well, look what happened to Sternow.

229
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,400
Look what happened to Sternow.

230
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,920
As a matter of fact.

231
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,520
Well, look, friends, there's all sorts of ways you can, you go off for a little while,

232
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,300
and, well, if you say the wrong thing in some of these countries,

233
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,120
there's an operation they can do with like almost just a fingernail file under the eyelid

234
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,320
without damaging the optic nerve.

235
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,680
They can actually give you a prefrontal lobotomy.

236
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,340
And I met a couple of students from Nairobi who, by the way, were into Dr. Maka Doody, I might add.

237
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:14,800
They knew him?

238
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,980
Yes, in Nairobi.

239
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,460
They knew the subgenius, St. Dr. Maka Doody.

240
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:18,820
Wow.

241
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,340
You were in Nairobi?

242
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,860
No.

243
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,820
I was in the Friendship Bar of the Friendship Hotel in Beijing,

244
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,820
but that place is full of African students.

245
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,240
They're only allowed foreigners, right?

246
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,740
No, no, no.

247
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,320
We had Chinese friends eating in there with us and so forth.

248
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,700
No kidding.

249
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,140
Okay.

250
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,480
Oh, yeah.

251
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,000
It's open, man.

252
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,120
It's real open.

253
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,880
As long as you're a foreigner, you can almost do as you please if you can get the permits.

254
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,140
Now, if you're Chinese, that's a little different.

255
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,160
If you don't get into college with the best grades in your high school, well, then they'll give you a job.

256
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,440
And once you're in that job,

257
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,220
they keep you in that job.

258
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,940
You can't quit.

259
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,340
Right. Of course.

260
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,180
And you can't be fired either.

261
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,880
So you're going to get paid no matter what kind of a job you do.

262
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,800
So, friends, you're wondering what the hour of slack is all about.

263
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,500
Yeah.

264
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,360
Yeah.

265
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,620
Well, you can tell we've really gone communist since God Almighty.

266
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,160
Well, I'll tell you what.

267
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,760
Talking about missionaries, this is a tape I just discovered on the way over here.

268
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,980
Don't turn it on yet.

269
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,040
This is the way you turn people on to Bob.

270
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,760
Now, see, this is a different kind of religion.

271
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,380
We don't have to be that hard sell.

272
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,520
We choose to be.

273
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,420
But we don't have to be that hard sell.

274
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,880
We have to be.

275
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,400
Now, when I left China, we had a good start.

276
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,200
There's a billion people there to be translated into the word of Bob physically and spiritually.

277
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,200
How's the work going to translate the pamphlet over there?

278
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,860
It's moving along.

279
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,540
We got the right people to do it.

280
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,120
I'll tell you that.

281
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,660
They just can't be caught at it.

282
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,680
You see, it's –

283
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, really?

284
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,660
It is tough.

285
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,940
So they can't mail it back to you?

286
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,820
Yeah, they can.

287
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,440
They just have to be real careful about it.

288
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,420
But this was getting – I got into an elevator going up to the room here.

289
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,420
And the elevator was –

290
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:50,580
This is a flight attendant lady.

291
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:50,580


292
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,880
Asked me who the man on my shirt was.

293
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,980
Hopefully we will...

294
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,600
See, friends, she knew.

295
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,260
She understands.

296
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,760
I told her let's meet...

297
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:13,920
Ni hao.

298
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,040
See, that means praise Bob in China.

299
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,640
And they say that all the time.

300
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,360
That's the way they say hello.

301
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,720
It sort of means praise Bob.

302
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,220
They just don't, most of them don't know who Bob is.

303
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,820
But, oh, they will, friends.

304
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,160
They know about the pills that Bob takes, though, over there.

305
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,820
Yes, they do.

306
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,300
And I can't believe we've only got one tape deck.

307
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,080
I can't do a show in here with one mere tape deck.

308
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,960
Now I'm saying house rules.

309
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,120
You can't complain about the equipment.

310
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,120
But, let's see.

311
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,580
For those who don't believe that, in China,

312
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,080
who don't believe there's a country there,

313
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,920
we did make some satellite recordings.

314
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,660
We couldn't get them over here because, well, they do things to you

315
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,960
if they find out what you're really doing.

316
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,340
One thing we've discovered is that you can't believe

317
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,480
what anybody says about themselves over there.

318
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,680
At one point, we were actually told by one of the translators

319
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,660
that there was a camera and a microphone in our room at the hotel.

320
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,000
I kid you not.

321
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,100
And you didn't notice it?

322
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,640
After all the cameras and microphones you have in your house?

323
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,820
Well, we took the place apart.

324
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,860
And they've got the finest little cameras.

325
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,660
I brought it with me.

326
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,100
In fact, that's what I recorded most of my rants all week on.

327
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,340
On my stolen communist spy cameras and recorders.

328
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,060
It was wonderful.

329
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,060
But, friends, you know, they need slack in China,

330
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,620
just like we do here, like everybody does.

331
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,200
But they don't have it.

332
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,740
And there's no explanation for that.

333
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,280
You just...

334
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,620
There's no explanation for that.

335
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,120
There's no explanation.

336
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,920
That's a thing you've got to remember, friends.

337
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,200
There's no explanation.

338
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,800
There's a black hole out of our window.

339
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,620
There's no light.

340
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,160
And there's no explanation.

341
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,480
There's only one thing you can do, friends.

342
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,060
Look out the window.

343
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,500
And that's trust in Bob.

344
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,760
Look out the window.

345
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,440
There's no light.

346
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,840
You can't see anything.

347
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,500
It's a blackout all over the whole neighborhood.

348
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,000
What happened?

349
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,660
Except for right here.

350
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,360
Right here, friends.

351
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,520
You've got to trust Bob in the dark.

352
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,240
If you could, there'd be no war, no crime, no open-ditch latrines.

353
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,380
You'd have to squat over like in some third-world country,

354
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,060
like Japan.

355
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,000
You'd be able to sit on the finest raised porcelain thrones

356
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,140
and pedestals with suction foe friends.

357
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,880
The Chinese love Bob.

358
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,120
They just don't know yet.

359
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,600
And when we were going through customs saying goodbye to Li Li Jing and Li Yan

360
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,400
and these wonderful new popes and priestesses,

361
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,420
they were chanting Bob and slack.

362
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,640
That's the truth.

363
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,440
They were.

364
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,240
They were indeed.

365
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,720
Well, the Chinese can really chant.

366
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,300
I mean, compared to an American.

367
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,160
Well, they've been...

368
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,960
They haven't been...

369
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,240
They don't have the...

370
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:55,100
I could call it the patience to really chant Bob the way they can in the East.

371
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,960
That's the one thing that's so spiritually strong about our friends in the Orient.

372
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,200
Uh-huh.

373
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,680
And the underground Chinese subgenius resistance.

374
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,660
You know, friends, someday, if those people, if our friends in China can do what Mao did,

375
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,340
all the Chinese people will be praising Bob and burning all the books that aren't about Bob

376
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,220
and beating and criticizing all the people that aren't into Bob.

377
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,080
And, oh, don't it bless your heart?

378
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,300
It's hard to think about that, friends.

379
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:18,840
Oh.

380
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,180
Because someday, you know, someday that's going to happen here in the U.S.

381
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,780
Oh, yeah.

382
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,680
This country, friends, it's going to happen here.

383
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,980
This country's going to get back to Bob.

384
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,400
I can see that uprise.

385
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,540
I can see it in my mind.

386
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,560
I can see an uprise in all of the country right now.

387
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,000
If they can do it in Red China, they can do it here, friends.

388
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,360
They're going to love Bob forever because they have to love Bob.

389
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,420
And that's the way it's going to be in the U.S.

390
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,100
You're going to love Bob, my friend, because you have to love Bob.

391
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
And if you don't, I will just...

392
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,520
You'll be sent to the...

393
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,060
Yeah.

394
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,360
Subgenius Slack Farm where you can dig ditches and carry baskets full of dirt on your shoulders

395
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,460
and push water buffalo around.

396
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,900
And until you're reeducated and you remember what slack really means,

397
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,100
you'll be ready to praise Bob then, won't you?

398
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,060
Oh, yeah.

399
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,300
I know you will.

400
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,960
But it was pretty amazing.

401
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,900
Friends, let's go to a little bit of taped live report from that strange country

402
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,880
while Buck tries to find out who is listening on our telephone.

403
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,060
Oh, by the way...

404
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:24,580
My friend, Professor Mickey Granta, who is the co-host sometime of this last month's show in China,

405
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,800
he was one time calling somebody on the telephone there.

406
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,360
Yeah.

407
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,980
And he heard his own voice from the day before,

408
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,040
a conversation the day before being played back on the phone

409
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,980
because somebody hit play instead of record somewhere in the phone company building in Beijing.

410
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,500
Yeah, that's been happening to me around here, too.

411
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,320
Oh, yeah?

412
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,660
Yeah.

413
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,540
I've been getting all kinds of weird things on our phone

414
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,540
because, see, we put our phone number on the air once.

415
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,960
Not me, but my buddies, my roommates.

416
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,500
Put our phone number on the air for their crazy projects.

417
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,860
Oh, Buck, that was me.

418
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,060
Well, as a result, you know, anyway, our phone's been tapped ever since.

419
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,260
Oh, yes.

420
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,720
And then now they'll know...

421
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,980
Can you imagine having to sit through my arguments with my girlfriend?

422
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,020
God.

423
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,400
If you're in the FBI...

424
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,960
I know.

425
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,840
Those FBI guys, one minute they'll be praising Bob

426
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,120
and the next minute they'll be cussing you out.

427
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,160
Oh, no.

428
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,720
Hating Buck.

429
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,400
Praise Bob and hate Buck, friends.

430
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,260
Oh, no, they're fighting again.

431
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,600
They're fighting again.

432
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,120
Oh, no.

433
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,840
We want to know how much more.

434
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,700
I just need...

435
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,300
I need to...

436
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,320
In America, before we spend money, we need to know how much.

437
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,820
So I'm hoping later there's not some deal I don't know about.

438
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,340
When we do business, we're responsible for the money.

439
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,240
And so before we have work done, we have to ask the price.

440
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,440
That's how our system works.

441
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,540
That's how it works.

442
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,240
That's how our minds work.

443
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,780
Are we?

444
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:47,860
Yeah.

445
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,580
We don't...

446
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,640
Oh, yes, friends.

447
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,280
And for some reason, this music, which sounds uncannily like Devo,

448
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,680
I was hearing this in the first night I was there in China.

449
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,160
The taxi driver was playing this bizarre thing.

450
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,640
Oh, yes, friends.

451
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,060
They listen to...

452
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,380
They don't get rock and roll.

453
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,640
They don't get rock and roll.

454
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,240
They don't get much in China.

455
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,060
They really don't.

456
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,460
It's sad.

457
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:54,140
They do get Hong Kong love songs, which is real radical for them.

458
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,180
They get...

459
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:03,560
And Taiwan rock and roll, which is like warmed over versions of current hits in America done

460
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,360
by Taiwanese bands sung in strange accents.

461
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,260
Like, girls just want to have fun.

462
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,440
They do, don't they?

463
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,320
The Chinese just want to have fun, too.

464
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:15,680
I...

465
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,680
At points, I was reading that they're not into the squirting universe in China.

466
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:27,560
They don't believe in getting sexy beyond marriage.

467
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,580
And I thought, well, gee, that's real moral, but it can't be true.

468
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,480
That must be a bunch of government propaganda.

469
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,440
It is.

470
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,460
It is, friends.

471
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,040
It is.

472
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,780
And that's...

473
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,240
I was so glad to hear that you can't suppress...

474
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,140
Of course, you can suppress having babies.

475
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,080
They have forced abortions in China.

476
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,660
If you have more than two kids...

477
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,380
If you have more than two kids, then that's it, boy.

478
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,440
You can go over to the scraper.

479
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,640
That's life control.

480
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,060
Yeah.

481
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,720
But see, that's why we were able to work on brain transplant experiments there.

482
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,360
That's called urethral day scraper.

483
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,080
Hey, man, that's crude.

484
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,160
That's not a...

485
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,240
That's bad, Buck.

486
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,080
I don't care.

487
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,840
It's easy to remember because it rhymes.

488
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,680
That's right.

489
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,860
See, I want to be...

490
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,320
I want to point out how atrocious this really is, okay?

491
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,060
But it's...

492
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,560
So...

493
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,100
So...

494
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,240
So I make it worse so that you can understand it out there.

495
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,360
I'm trying to shock you.

496
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,220
I'm trying to get you angry.

497
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,460
I'm trying to make you react.

498
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:22,900
Yeah.

499
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,680
It's all part of the satire, folks.

500
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,600
The diseases you get from listening to this show, that's just part of the satire.

501
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,200
So, like, don't worry about it.

502
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,040
The lawsuits the station gets, that's just part of the joke.

503
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,620
That's part of this big satire, see?

504
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,140
But as I was saying, you know, abortion is like...

505
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,920
It is murder, as Bob said, but it's murder in self-defense.

506
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,320
In China, they don't look at it that way.

507
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,620
It's murder against population growth.

508
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:56,100
But, see, that gives doctors like us an unending supply of donors of fetus brain tissue,

509
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,160
which, if you've been reading your Time magazine,

510
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,440
you'll know that's the only way to even work towards brain transplants,

511
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,260
is working on brain grafts using fetus brain tissue.

512
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,420
And in China, you've got donors, you've got no insurance problems,

513
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,420
and you've got no crippled people or mentally ill people

514
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,240
because they kill them.

515
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,360
And you don't have too many troublemakers like us

516
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,180
because they put them in the work camp right outside of town.

517
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,280
Not forever, not like they used to, you know.

518
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,640
They had that big revolution there to get rid of the horrors of feudalism,

519
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,500
and they ended up with something just as bad.

520
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,920
But, you know, it's a cultural thing.

521
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,660
I mean, Bob will be doing that to the United States.

522
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,700
And you're laughing.

523
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,200
You're thinking,

524
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,580
Oh, yeah.

525
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,940
Yeah, the U.S. couldn't.

526
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,960
We couldn't have a cultural revolution like China did.

527
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,940
No, Bob would never do that to us, would he, Bob?

528
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,680
Not the real Bob, my friends, but not the real Bob.

529
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,980
Well, there's a good Bob, there's a bad Bob,

530
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,620
and then there's a yellow Bob, and there's a white Bob.

531
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,500
And then there's doctors.

532
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,340
There's doctors.

533
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,280
There's a way to get rid of the horrors of feudalism.

534
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,600
Please, Bob.

535
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,880
Hello, my friends.

536
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,880
This is your Chinese correspondent for the Hour of Slang.

537
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,800
Li Liqing speaking to you from Beijing.

538
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,920
And this is the Chinese subgenius report.

539
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,900
Hello.

540
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,200


541
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:38,320


542
00:25:38,340 --> 00:26:08,320
I don't know.

543
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:37,540
I don't know.

544
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:38,700
I don't know.

545
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:18,600
I don't know.

546
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,100
I don't know.

547
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:08,420
I'm sorry.

548
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:08,860
I'm sorry.

549
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,580
It's me, Buck.

550
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,440
I screwed it up.

551
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:11,760
I know.

552
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,480
I whip myself every night after realizing what I've done to the show.

553
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,140
Oh, no.

554
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,380
You ruined it, Buck.

555
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,120
No, no.

556
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,160
When the spirit gets a hold of me, I don't know what I'm doing.

557
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,380
I can tell.

558
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,560
I'm truly glad.

559
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,300
We haven't stung.

560
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,880
We can absolve him just as long as he stays away for a while.

561
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,640
How can you say such a thing?

562
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,700
I thought all of us.

563
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,860
You didn't hear my show stung.

564
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,340
Yeah, that's true.

565
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,080
I haven't heard any.

566
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,800
I haven't heard any of Buck's shows.

567
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,480
We don't get, I mean, like I said, the Russians were scrambling the signal there in China.

568
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,520
Well, are you going to be back for a while now?

569
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,440
Apparently so.

570
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,360
Good.

571
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,480
Jeez, thanks.

572
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,200
I'll tell you, did you like Dr. Chaos any better?

573
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,140
Oh, I'm just so glad you're back, Reverend.

574
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,480
Okay, well, I'll be leaving the station in about half an hour.

575
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,940
So, you know, if any gladness, I'd be very glad to see myself.

576
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,980
Just before we go.

577
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,120
No, I'm just kidding.

578
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:20,180
I left three wives in China, two in Japan, and I got at least 37 here in the U.S.

579
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,100
And the payments are really good.

580
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,960
You're a master of swag, I can tell.

581
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,660
They all are good cooks.

582
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,920
The problem is they're also all feisty.

583
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,160
That's the problem with these subgenius girls.

584
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,500
It's like as soon as I walk out of here, they're going to be waiting for me with rolling pins.

585
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,540
Gotta get to what they're frying.

586
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:37,920
Yeah.

587
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,000
Or their new, well, anyway.

588
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,900
Hair curlers.

589
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,640
Oh, dear sister, I'm, well, who is this calling, by the way?

590
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,400
Oh, this is Joy.

591
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,340
It is, isn't it?

592
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,040
Oh, my.

593
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,660
Joy and Bob.

594
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,300
It makes me want to play some hymns.

595
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,660
It makes me want to play a cart.

596
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,780
Oh, yeah, that's true.

597
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,900
We do have to play the cart.

598
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,600
Well.

599
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,860
It is our obligation to the station.

600
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,100
Anyway, welcome back.

601
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,740
Well, thank you very much.

602
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,580
Okay, well, I hope I get some love calls after that.

603
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,140
Yeah.

604
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,040
Yeah, any.

605
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,340
Nice.

606
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,820
Yeah, let's have some buck love.

607
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,020
He's been saying hi, girls, as a sort of a trademark for six months now.

608
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,560
Well, I haven't even been able to say it lately.

609
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,740
All I can say is ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

610
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,160
I never know that.

611
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:20,700
Okay.

612
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,300
It takes a while.

613
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:21,860
It never does.

614
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,820
Yeah, we're going to get back to the Chinese report here pretty quick.

615
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,300
Okay, thank you.

616
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,060
Let's put on this next call and see if I got a call here.

617
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:33,380
Oh, I can tell she's touching her laugh right now with that thought of Bob.

618
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,140
Hello, our Slack.

619
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,040
Hello, my friend.

620
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,540
How are you?

621
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,320
Oh, it's Mr. Beepy.

622
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,000
This is him.

623
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,660
Okay.

624
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,520
Hello.

625
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:38,840
Mr. Beepy.

626
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,360
Yes, sir.

627
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,280
Did you hear my Mr. Beepy impression when we started the show tonight?

628
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,720
It was a shock to my system.

629
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,340
It was a shock to his system.

630
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,520
I couldn't believe it.

631
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,780
I don't understand why you make fun of me.

632
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,640
Make fun?

633
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,080
Heck, that's a tribute, dude.

634
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,840
That's a tribute to you.

635
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,120
Yeah, since I walked in the door here, everybody's been saying, wait until you hear Mr. Beepy.

636
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,500
I mean, dude, you've got a following out here.

637
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,120
What do those initials stand for?

638
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,160
Don't say it over the air.

639
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,200
Don't say it over the air.

640
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,660
Don't say it over the air.

641
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,040
Just remember this thing.

642
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,000
He's got more than one.

643
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,020
He's got more than one.

644
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,940
Listen, your reputation was reaching us all the way in Shanghai earlier in the month.

645
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,160
I was standing there.

646
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,180
They know about me over there.

647
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:20,880
Huh?

648
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,280
They know about me over there.

649
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:22,920
Oh, yes, they do.

650
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,960
In fact, on May Day, the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, they were drawing mustaches

651
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,340
over the mustache on Karl Marx and putting your picture up.

652
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,580
A giant phallic symbol?

653
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,400
Yes.

654
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,060
I tell you, they're getting into Slack.

655
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,780
They're getting into Slack over there.

656
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,720
Praise Bob.

657
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,880
I cannot believe it.

658
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,680
Yeah, yeah.

659
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,440
America is such a wonderful place, and I praise Bob for it.

660
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,520
Where are you from?

661
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,000
Where am I from?

662
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,000
You sound like a local Texas guy.

663
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,740
Where I am?

664
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,080
Oh.

665
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,300
Oh, yeah.

666
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,360
Okay, I've got another tape of him.

667
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,320
Oh, you got to meet someone else, too?

668
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,220
Yes, yes.

669
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,520
I have another tape of you.

670
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,880
Would you like to come over sometime?

671
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,660
No.

672
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,400
Why not?

673
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,100
No, no.

674
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,280
Why not?

675
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:04,700
No.

676
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,340
I could show you my collection of you-know-whats.

677
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,460
Yeah, that's exactly why I don't want to meet you.

678
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,620
I do know what.

679
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,480
With that.

680
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,220
We've got that same collection, pal.

681
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,300
Look, I know.

682
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,780
Look.

683
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,320
We need to.

684
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,760
We're going to surprise you with a tape of yourself.

685
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,880
I didn't even know I had this.

686
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,400
Thank you.

687
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,220
I want to hear it right now.

688
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,740
Okay, this imposter here.

689
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,060
Let me see if I can get Professor Lee Lee Jang out of the box.

690
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,400
I'm waiting.

691
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,200
Time is of the essence.

692
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,520
No, no.

693
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,880
Not upside down.

694
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,560
Okay, now this imposter.

695
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,180
He goes by the name of E-Yah-da-Dee-Shee-I, and he's speaking in trance.

696
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,240
And this is a message I think we should all pay attention to.

697
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,120
Okay, go ahead.

698
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:47,500
Play it.

699
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,800
Oh, well, we have to take you off.

700
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,320
I have said this before, and I say it again.

701
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,920
Let us suppose the peoples that are coming here from others' past,

702
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,200
let us suppose they are spiders.

703
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,080
Ah!

704
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,980
They have come.

705
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,040
They have come to save you.

706
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,000
Yes, to eat.

707
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:20,280
Always be very suspicious about everyone who comes to save you,

708
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,840
because he is saving you for himself, and you cannot tell what for.

709
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,020
Save yourself, and you will be safe.

710
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,140
How do you do this?

711
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,060
By educating yourself.

712
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,360
You can't tell yourself as to what is.

713
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,860
Get out of the child mind.

714
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,920
Get into adulthood.

715
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:56,760
This means you will have to be responsible for your dream.

716
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,360
If you are not willing to be responsible, just do that.

717
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,220
Well, friends, you see, that was unbelievable.

718
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,340
I think that is the same individual who has been calling this show.

719
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,140
This tape says it is Iyadadi Shiite, the entity.

720
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,200
The tape is called You Are the Dreamer.

721
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,640
And this man, this is a tape of a man, a man like you or me,

722
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,480
who goes into a trance and makes these pronouncements,

723
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,020
which you can barely understand on only one channel, about the aliens.

724
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,640
And what he was basically saying on there is that the aliens want to eat you,

725
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:38,020
but you want to be used by them because you love authority so much.

726
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,160
And he has got a point there, you know.

727
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:41,500
Yeah.

728
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,120
I have got another caller right here and I will just patch this fellow in.

729
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,460
I need another tape deck, man.

730
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,240
There is no media barrage hellish background noise going on.

731
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,380
I have got a...

732
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:54,780
I am going to...

733
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,120
Hello, caller?

734
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,220
Hello?

735
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:57,980
Hello.

736
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,960
Yeah, go ahead and say that again.

737
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:06,580
The sound of the salute, the tone, can you tell me what frequency it is?

738
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,100
Yeah, yeah.

739
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,060
It drives my cat.

740
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,440
It drives my cat crazy.

741
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,480
It is a very...

742
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,700
Actually, a very...

743
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:21,200
It is a combination of a 27 and a half over about a thousand point three.

744
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,580
No, you do not understand.

745
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,320
So 440 is standard, okay?

746
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:24,700
Yeah.

747
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,700
I have two cats, you see.

748
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,460
They both go crazy when they hear it.

749
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,940
Like this?

750
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

751
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,300
What have we done to them?

752
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,900
That is exactly what they do.

753
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,740
How do they look?

754
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:37,880
How do they look?

755
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,700
Do they do that?

756
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:41,580
No.

757
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:41,780
They are...

758
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,800
I finally got some background noise.

759
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,080
No, but they are learning.

760
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,540
They are learning to do this?

761
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,980
Well, thanks for sharing that with us.

762
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,200
Yeah.

763
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:47,900
That is wonderful.

764
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,360
Well, those...

765
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,320
See, they are...

766
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,440
What this salute does to cats is a shame, and that is why the Chinese think we are a

767
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,660
bunch of dog people, man.

768
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,400
They think we are...

769
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,440
We are...

770
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
Yeah, yeah.

771
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,480
Death, death.

772
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,660
The Chinese think that we are like...

773
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,060
Like just these clumsy, big, bad, ill-mannered, you know, dogs.

774
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,060


775
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,060


776
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,060


777
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,060


778
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,060


779
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,000
Quasi-retarded, culturally deprived idiots.

780
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,220
But we are not as bad.

781
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,380
They do not think us Caucasians and black people are nearly as bad as the Chinese minorities

782
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,420
who are like the Tibetans and Mongolians.

783
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,520
And it is like...

784
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,540
It is like a hideous cartoon of the U.S. in the 50s.

785
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:32,980
The Mongolians and Tibetans and Chinese minorities have to sleep in their own hotels.

786
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,440
They drink out of their own water fountains, and they have to sit at the back of the bus.

787
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,320
No way.

788
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:38,920
Really?

789
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,740
It is just like the U.S. before Bob.

790
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:47,340
But friends, if China is like America before Bob arrived, I want you to know that last

791
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,340
week Bob arrived in China.

792
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:56,360
So we have got a firm toenail hold on mainland China, friend, an unholy alliance between

793
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,940
slack and communism.

794
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,000
Praise Bob.

795
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,620
Oh, yeah.

796
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,580
So the conspiracy is everywhere.

797
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,280
Did that...

798
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,440
Was Mao the same way?

799
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,280
I mean, did he approve of putting everybody in the...

800
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,420
Back in the 60s?

801
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:07,480
Back in the 60s.

802
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:07,480


803
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:07,480


804
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:07,480


805
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,220
And they kept putting it in the bus and all that?

806
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:08,980
Oh, yeah.

807
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,800
This is all...

808
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,080
I mean everybody...

809
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,620
All us workers are equal, Bob.

810
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,720
You know...

811
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,380
Except for the minorities.

812
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:23,940
The dumbest, most ill-informed Chinese worker is equal to the richest party member, who

813
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,480
has...

814
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,500
Who gets paid real highly and can buy all sorts of products, the other ones can't.

815
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:33,020
It is just that some party members Are more equal than some ordinary citizens.

816
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,020
That is kind of like from...

817
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,260
Yeah, kind of like.

818
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,300
You could say.

819
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:35,780
Yeah.

820
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,900
to give you an idea.

821
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,880
Now, the funny thing is I talked to a lot of

822
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,280
old hipster radical types who said,

823
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,540
oh, yeah, Reverend Stang, I've been to China.

824
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,420
I was with a radical tour group.

825
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,200
They showed us the ideal commune.

826
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,180
They showed us the rich peasants.

827
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,620
That's like, it's utopia.

828
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,580
There's no crime.

829
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,380
There's no rape, they said.

830
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:57,780
Right.

831
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,100
But that's like judging the United States from Disneyland.

832
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,760
That's exactly what it is.

833
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,760
That's exactly what it is.

834
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,200
And we were there for a month working,

835
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,280
alongside the workers.

836
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,860
I mean, we were workers, too.

837
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,720
And after about a month,

838
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,360
they start to tell you what they really think.

839
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,580
And friends, oh, they need slack.

840
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,140
They need bong.

841
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,980
Stang, while you were gone.

842
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,920
Maybe not bong, but at least they need bong.

843
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,900
One of the greatest American basketball players

844
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,120
is named Akeem Olajuwon.

845
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:24,620
Yeah.

846
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,840
He went to, well, he's pretty big.

847
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,420
He's not that big.

848
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,720
He's about 6'9".

849
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,660
Although they listed him at 7'0",

850
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,600
because he just plays over everybody's head anyway, okay?

851
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,660
He's from Nigeria, okay?

852
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:34,880
Uh-huh.

853
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:35,720
So.

854
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,860
So, anyway, when they went there with Clyde Drexler

855
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,020
from the University of Houston,

856
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,160
they went to Disneyland in California.

857
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:46,540
And so Clyde Drexler starts talking to a Goofy,

858
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,160
you know, one of the Goofys at Disneyland.

859
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,940
You know, the dog, right?

860
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,620
And Akeem Olajuwon comes up to him and says,

861
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,100
who is this dog and why did he speak to you?

862
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,180
Yeah.

863
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,860
Why did he speak to you, friend?

864
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,520
You see, in China, Goofy would end up in somebody's stew pot.

865
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,880
That's right.

866
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,540
You know, along with Muffy and Fluffy and all the other house pets,

867
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,620
because they can't afford to be keeping a frozen goblin animal around.

868
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,500
Mickey for dessert chocolate covered for us.

869
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,040
Yeah.

870
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,920
No, they quit eating rats.

871
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,280
There was a big rat problem for a while, about 10 years ago,

872
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,620
and the government started sending out on the early morning news show

873
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,220
that everyone in the country listens to on loudspeakers,

874
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,580
because you can't turn them off.

875
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,420
They said, they gave them rat recipes and how you could eat rats,

876
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,540
but the rats were so full of DDT

877
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,940
that everybody started getting sick from the rats.

878
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,140
So then they had to do another propaganda campaign

879
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,620
to make people quit eating rats.

880
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,180
Yeah.

881
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah.

882
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,800
I heard that they, what did they do?

883
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,900
They got rid of some kind of animal

884
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,180
by just getting everybody after them out there.

885
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,140
What was it?

886
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,220
Now, which?

887
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,720
What animals did they get rid of in China?

888
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,560
Birds.

889
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,700
Oh, really?

890
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,480
Yeah, birds.

891
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,320
They used a lot of DDT and got rid of all the insects, see?

892
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,140
They thought that was a real modernistic move for the five-year plan.

893
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,640
Well, the birds didn't have anything to eat,

894
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,140
so the birds are all gone and the insects came back,

895
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,420
because they got their immunity up by a few generations down,

896
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,080
and no birds to eat them.

897
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:24,200
So you've got to use really strong DDT in China these days.

898
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,540
Maybe they'll have to borrow a little stuff from the Soviet Union, from the Ukraine.

899
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,380
Oh, yeah.

900
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,340
Yeah, they are.

901
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:29,920
They do.

902
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,820
They borrow from both.

903
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,640
And by the way, America made a big arms sale to China just about three weeks ago,

904
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,760
and they were real friendly to us after that.

905
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,680
I bet you out there hardly even heard about it.

906
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,300
No.

907
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,560
As a matter of fact, you probably didn't hear about the joint air maneuvers.

908
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:50,320
You probably didn't know about how we know what was on the, what happened there.

909
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,220
Joint air maneuvers.

910
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,100
Hey, get this, Buck.

911
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,280
I was sitting in the bar at the Friendship Hotel,

912
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,440
and these French and German scientists, this hotel is full of scientists that live there,

913
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,420
these guys are behind me looking at satellite photographs.

914
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,100
The Romanian journalist for Radio BG,

915
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,540
he says, oh, those are US spy satellite pictures from Chernobyl.

916
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,920
And they sure indeed were.

917
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,920
You could see it.

918
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,240
You could almost see people down there like little ants.

919
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,900
And that's why we got this report here.

920
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,020
They're intercepting it?

921
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,960
They're intercepting them?

922
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,260
Yeah.

923
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,620
They're intercepting them in China?

924
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,100
Yes.

925
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,940
The Romanians are?

926
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,440
Oh, no, no.

927
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,960
These French and German guys did.

928
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,900
And the Romanian just overheard what they were saying.

929
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,360
In France and Germany, right?

930
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:30,680
Oh, yeah.

931
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,040
Okay.

932
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,220
Yeah.

933
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:31,580
Okay.

934
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,880
But here's how we do it, friends.

935
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,700
This is a report from Beijing that Professor Mishel,

936
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:35,700


937
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,260
Mickey Garanta, and I did about that very self-same subject matter

938
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,660
of how they get those pictures.

939
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,140
Speaking for the hour of slack in Dallas, Texas,

940
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,540
but I'm speaking tonight from Beijing in the People's Republic of China

941
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:55,340
with super espionage expert, Dr. Mickey Garanta.

942
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:01,820
And, Dr. Grant, would you explain to me once again just exactly what kind of,

943
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,580
just exactly what sort of,

944
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,200
I've got to check the tab.

945
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,680
How you got there.

946
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:05,680


947
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:05,680


948
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:05,680


949
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:05,680


950
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:05,680


951
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,480
How you got those, how did you get...

952
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,280
Just a second.

953
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,300
I'm looking for some bugs.

954
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,440
And the Chernobyl explosion.

955
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,180
Is this on?

956
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,580
Is this on?

957
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:18,500
How did you get your information regarding the radiation spread from the Chernobyl,

958
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,040
let's call it the small accident that our friends, the UGWO rounds had?

959
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,480
KH-11.

960
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,880
KH-11.

961
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,460
The KH-11?

962
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,340
KH-11 satellites.

963
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,740
We've got to deal now with the Chinese.

964
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,200
With the KH-11s, they released photo devices.

965
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,680
What?

966
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,040
They're the ones that they shoot down and the balloon pops up.

967
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,160
The C-131 comes along and it picks up those suckers.

968
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,900
Okay, they've got homing devices on the film that's dropped from the orbiting satellite.

969
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,080
On the pouch.

970
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,320
Now, what do our Chinese friends have to do with those?

971
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,140
They allow us to fly our C-131s over their territory

972
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,600
because some of these in the southern part of Russia,

973
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,400
since we lost our good buddy in Iran,

974
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,780
some of these, some of these, they float down this direction.

975
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,800
And that's one of the big things we've got going with the Chinese.

976
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,660
Oh, that's a good one.

977
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,860
That's why we're training them to fly up there and catch them.

978
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,060
Well, we do more than that.

979
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,440
We've had joint air maneuvers.

980
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,980
We had the first joint air maneuvers in 1984 with the Chinese Air Force

981
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,140
and the U.S. Air Force.

982
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,980
That was in October 1984.

983
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,140
Now, how come we didn't hear about this in general release of news in the U.S.?

984
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,280
A lot of reporters, AP reporters, in fact, some others I know,

985
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,780
they were aware of it, but this was kind of killed back in the U.S.

986
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,280
This wasn't the sort of thing to put on at that time.

987
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,340
So, you know.

988
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,920
Not exactly prime time material, eh?

989
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,740
Well, you know, what can I say?

990
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:45,440
One morning there were about five generals with stars on the Great Wall.

991
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,960
What can I say?

992
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,160
Yeah.

993
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:55,120
Why in the world would George Bush, former head CIA, be the first ambassador to China?

994
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,660
Think about it.

995
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,880
Think about it.

996
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,000
Think about it.

997
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,600
That's the hard part, sir.

998
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,320
There's only one hard part.

999
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:03,920
There's only one hard part.

1000
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
Praise God.

1001
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,900
Oh, yes, my friend.

1002
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,180
It's true.

1003
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,900
Yes, that's true.

1004
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,960
We're right here in red communist times.

1005
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,840
Let's go talk to some folks out here and just put this on here

1006
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,000
and let these folks out here, let them listen to this.

1007
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,300
We're going to go talk to some.

1008
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,220
What a pung-yo-yow Fiji.

1009
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,920
That's what I mean, Fiji.

1010
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,640
Fiji?

1011
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,180
Yeah.

1012
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:32,920
Shenzai-tai.

1013
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,300
Shenzai-tai.

1014
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,300


1015
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,300


1016
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,300


1017
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,300


1018
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,240
I'm saying my friend wants a prostitute.

1019
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,620
Tai-meo-tai-tai.

1020
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,360
In-we-wo-tao-dao-me-ko-sa-tai-tai.

1021
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,280
Tai-meo-tai-tai.

1022
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:46,420
His wife in America is not here, and he needs a Chinese tai-tai or wife.

1023
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,020
Tai-meo-tai-tai.

1024
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,560
In-we-wo-tao-dao-me-ko-sa-tai-tai.

1025
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,480
Tai-meo-tai-tai.

1026
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,580
Tai-meo-tai-tai.

1027
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:53,580


1028
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,480
Tai-meo-tai-tai.

1029
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,320
Tai-meo-tai-tai.

1030
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,760
Just so that they know the truth.

1031
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,300
That was Chinese in an elevator.

1032
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,300
That was the 10th.

1033
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,820
10 people at an elevator on top of a hotel.

1034
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,380
We won't say which hotel.

1035
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,580
No, we can't.

1036
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:10,800
Oh, sir.

1037
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,420
We couldn't pronounce it either.

1038
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,520
That would be revealing too much because we just met another CIA guy in the bar.

1039
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,620
That's exactly right.

1040
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,140
And he would hear this broadcast.

1041
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,120
Oh, word.

1042
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:20,520
And he would know.

1043
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,040
Who done it?

1044
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,880
Friends, they listen to the hour of slack, and I do mean they.

1045
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,060
You know what I mean.

1046
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:27,500
Them.

1047
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,800
Hey, oh, and we hate them, don't we?

1048
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,240
We don't necessarily hate them.

1049
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:31,940
I'm one of them.

1050
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,440
We need to.

1051
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,160
Yeah, we got to have.

1052
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:39,700
Would you go into a little more detail on exactly how these spy satellites work that our government is keeping over?

1053
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:45,540
For instance, how we know that the population of Kiev is being evacuated at this moment?

1054
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,160
Our biggest problem, everybody thinks we got satellite over all of Russia, and that ain't true.

1055
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,820
We watch skis, teach military areas in specific places.

1056
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,640
We can't watch all of Russia.

1057
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,780
So, man, a whole bunch of time passed.

1058
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,980
There was some radiation detected in Sweden.

1059
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,300
These guys pay all attention to that kind of stuff.

1060
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,560
And the moment they said that, we started looking.

1061
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,840
We studied the wind.

1062
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,940
We studied everything.

1063
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,040
And we finally fucking.

1064
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:09,760
Whoops.

1065
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:10,220
Excuse me.

1066
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:16,680
We finally discovered that that wind was coming from this particular area down there in that part of Russia.

1067
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,920
And immediately we sent the appropriate satellite vehicles.

1068
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,600
Guided satellite vehicles.

1069
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,100
All these are guided, man.

1070
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,840
These K-11s, they got, they got, they got all kinds of ramble type jets.

1071
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,380
Like a video game.

1072
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,360
Just about.

1073
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:32,960
Just about.

1074
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,140
Just about.

1075
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,380
In fact, the control looks real similar.

1076
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,480
Have you ever operated one of those?

1077
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,440
You want to do that one day?

1078
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,180
I'd love to.

1079
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,900
Oh, we can get you to do that.

1080
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:41,340
Oh, yeah.

1081
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,220
From here in Beijing?

1082
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,400
No, you can't do it from here in Beijing.

1083
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,260
You have to go to Tokyo or back.

1084
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:46,660
Or Houston.

1085
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,380
Yeah, Houston.

1086
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:48,560
Yeah.

1087
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,860
That's near, that's near the bottom.

1088
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,220
Jet Propulsion Lab is the main place.

1089
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,520
You can do it from Washington, too.

1090
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,000
The president likes to do that sometimes.

1091
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,280
He likes to take hold of the joystick and move those suckers around.

1092
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,660
You'd not believe what you can see.

1093
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,300
But anyway, that's how all that happened.

1094
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:02,600
You know.

1095
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:07,140
I understand you can see down the premier, the front of the premier's blouse in Moscow.

1096
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,700
Well, it depends on the cleavage.

1097
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:09,220
Yeah.

1098
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,340
That's the bottom line.

1099
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,700
It depends on the cleavage.

1100
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,220
Most of them, most of them Ruskies got some damn big old.

1101
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,700
Well, it depends on cloud cover.

1102
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,560
They just get lucky.

1103
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:45,640
Well, they don't get that crazy hard.

1104
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,620
And it's year two...

1105
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:46,620


1106
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,000
So.

1107
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,000


1108
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,000


1109
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:58,640
It's fiddling.

1110
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:00,740


1111
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:00,740


1112
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:00,740


1113
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,360
I think I'm getting a little tired of it.

1114
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,840
out. That's too bad because well, actually, we can get a live

1115
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,660
traffic report from Beijing because Dr. Garanta is going

1116
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:14,080
back there. He's gonna be with us now. Wonderful. Huh? Where is

1117
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:19,320
that? Is she? Oh, we had a caller with a message in Chinese

1118
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,540
from Bob she claims. They all say what has happened here?

1119
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:31,400
Oh, is that you? Hello, Mr. PP. We were looking for a way.

1120
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,340
There's a girl supposed to be called that we were gonna put

1121
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:37,460
on next. I don't know what happened to her. She could call

1122
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:42,060
back if she's listening, but I don't know how how that

1123
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:48,700
happened. Yeah, that's right. Okay, Bob. Bob said four things

1124
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,840
to you in Chinese, right? You say you have a message from Bob?

1125
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,200
Yeah.

1126
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,320
Okay, well,

1127
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,520
let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's

1128
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,660
spit them out. Okay, first, you said, I flung down.

1129
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,400
Whoa. I flung down. Amazing. Amazing. No, listen, listen,

1130
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,100
listen. And then he said, one hung low. Okay. Uh-huh. Those

1131
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,060
are famous book authors. No, no, no, no. And then he said,

1132
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:14,380
we're in the Fungi. Uh-huh. That's an Indian tribe. Okay,

1133
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,180
what what else was it? We're in the Fungi? Yeah. Well, it's

1134
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:23,160
actually derived from the Fugawi tribe. Oh, really? Right. The

1135
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:23,500
first one is from the Fungi tribe. Oh, really? Right. The

1136
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,520
first two were are authors of books respectively titled

1137
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,800
Brown Spots on the Wall and I can't remember the other one,

1138
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,940
but that's the I don't think that was Bob. I think that was

1139
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:40,280
perhaps the one whose name we must not say. He who has no

1140
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,040
name. He who was in heavy rotation for the last three

1141
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,940
weeks. Yeah. Well, tell me some more about the birds because

1142
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,600
like I've got a bird here and I've had problems with her

1143
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,480
before. Well, first, you may be eating DDT. For kill all the

1144
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:58,380
insects and the birds will die. Okay. That noble experiment was

1145
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,860
tried by our comrades in the Far East and it worked

1146
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,060
wonderfully. So, if you have lots of roaches, the bird ought

1147
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:10,340
to be okay. Anyway, now, a word from your station, the voice of

1148
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:17,360
the people, K and Owen and this is called Dallas PD. That's

1149
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,960
excellent. That's excellent. That was really pretty good.

1150
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,480
Okay. I'll pull it out and stick it in here. Okay.

1151
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,100
Again. Forgive me.

1152
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,880
No one can tell you how to lead your life but please be

1153
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,800
informed the last couple of weekends, the Dallas Police

1154
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,180
Department has been running a campaign of apparent

1155
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,180
intimidation in the Deep Harlem area. Please be advised that the

1156
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,460
slightest violation of law can get you into a lot of trouble.

1157
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:17,240
Do not sell out. Please go and see all the shows but be

1158
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,240
extremely careful what you do on the sidewalks and in public

1159
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,100
and have all of your papers in order.

1160
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,160
Do not let them win in this battle of wills.

1161
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,420
Ah yes, dear friends.

1162
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,440
Listen to that beautiful sound. I'm gonna switch over to

1163
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:03,600
another sound here. Ah yes, friend. You know, friends, the

1164
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,640
conspiracy is everywhere, especially in China and the

1165
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,640
Chinese can get in a lot more. Oh, the conspiracy just walked

1166
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,940
through the door in the form of Norm Ward. The pink boys are

1167
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,260
back. No, that's cruel. That's no, we've been having a feud

1168
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,540
staying. You don't know about that. Oh, okay. So, this is my

1169
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:21,840
number.

1170
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:31,500
Oh, yes, friends. Now, see. Conspiracy is everywhere. As I

1171
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,500
was saying, those poor Chinese people can get in a lot more

1172
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,200
trouble than you and me for carrying their book of the

1173
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:43,320
subgenius in public. I'm afraid sometimes for my friends and in

1174
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,700
China. I can imagine Li Jing getting caught and going,

1175
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,180
are you Li Jing? You read the foreigners pornography about

1176
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,820
this man, Bob.

1177
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,200
You have a choice now. Li Jing either denounce this Bob and

1178
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,140
Confucius or we will send you to the work camps with bamboo

1179
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,480
shoots in your eye and I would say and Buck would say Li Jing

1180
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,000
whatever you do, denounce Bob. If Bob walks in, kill him. Don't

1181
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,020
let him do that to you. Cuz friends, not all religions call

1182
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,840
for martyrs. Only Bobbies. The pathetic Bobbies should be

1183
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,320
martyrs in this church and Li Jing, our Chinese subgenius

1184
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,300
friends. You're not Bobbies. So, it's your duty,

1185
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:27,820
to renounce to Bob, your duty to Bob to renounce Bob. If not

1186
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:31,400
doing so, would get you in trouble and then you're free to

1187
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,300
continue to secretly subvert Red China and bring them around

1188
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,900
to slack and why thousands of yuan will be coming Bob's way

1189
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,140
soon. Everything half-price friends to Chinese subgeniuses

1190
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:49,340
not counting Taiwan or Hong Kong. Half-priced. So, just

1191
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,480
remember folks, Bob is a man, not a god.

1192
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,960
God would never understand what how the party keeps you

1193
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,800
enslaved or how your job keeps you in the slave.

1194
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:06,900
Army. So, friends, before we sign off, I have to tell you,

1195
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,720
I'm gonna be doing a marathon run. I am, I, Reverend Stang,

1196
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,480
am gonna run 2,000 miles along the Great Wall of China on a

1197
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,980
pogo stick and I'm gonna be carrying 10,000 copies of the

1198
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,040
book of the subgenius to hand out to those needy Chinese,

1199
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,280
spiritually starved Chinese.

1200
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:27,820
And $100 will put a book of the subgenius in the hand of a

1201
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:32,180
Chinaman because friends, those China people need Bob and maybe,

1202
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,380
I don't know, maybe you need Bob. Maybe you need to be saved

1203
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:39,860
by saved by a Chinese who's already been turned on to Bob.

1204
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,040
So, from now on, I want our Chinese American friends to

1205
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,720
know that you're not forgotten and we're gonna be bringing you

1206
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,340
a Chinese language couple of minutes of slack every couple

1207
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,820
of weeks here. In the meantime,

1208
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:59,620
friends, all we can say is, Bob loves you. We're gonna have to

1209
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,860
sign off here. Hang on for Monday morning.

1210
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,760
And we'll be the Monday morning cornerbacks, friends.

1211
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,540
They're using that shock treatment again.

1212
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:21,660
Friends, I need, Bob gave me my shock treatment. I've got that

1213
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,880
Bob blindfold on.

1214
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,980
And friends remember to send your tithe and your offering,

1215
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:30,560
love offerings to the church of the subgenius.

1216
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,280
And do you have that mailing address, friends? Do you have that

1217
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,700
mailing address for information, free information from the church?

1218
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:46,360
Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214 for your free information pack.

1219
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:53,280
Church of the subgenius, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1220
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,860
214 USA.

1221
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,960
USA, friends. God bless America.

1222
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:06,080
Praise Bob, friends. We're gonna let Dr. Onan Kanabot's lovely music carry us to the end.

1223
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:06,760
Ah, yes.

1224
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:11,480
You'll just remember to send those prayer blankets. We need those blankets and

1225
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:16,640
contraceptives for the children in the home for slackless children. Ah, yes. Praise Bob.

1226
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,240
Help me, Lord of Bob.

1227
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:18,960
Praise somebody.

1228
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:18,960


1229

1252
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,660
Yes, friends, this was a rerun of an hour of slack,

1253
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:06,860
number 33, in fact, from July 1986, recorded in Dallas, Texas.

1254
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:12,260
Nothing in this old recording relates to anything that exists now.

1255
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:17,980

Franken-Budweiser

1261
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,500
Watchin' Bob on TV

1262
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,540
Swallowing red men

1263
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,840
The day my coon dog died

1264
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,620
Reading the pamphlet

The day that Uncle

1273
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:24,660
Good kick

1274
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,080
By a mule

1275
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,600
I was with Cousin Junior

1276
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,120
I was with Cousin Junior

1277
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,200
But the N.A. backfired

1278
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:36,460
But the N.A. backfired

1279
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,540

1281
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:42,600

00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:45,860
I was plastered
