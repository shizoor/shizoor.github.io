1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Inventory 2101, go off again.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,820
What happened?

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,040
Someone set up us to bomb.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,280
We get signal.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,240
What?

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,680
Main screen turn on.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:15,900
It's you.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,420
How are you gentlemen?

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,500
All your base are belong to us.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,720
You are on the way to destruction.

11
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,000
What you say?

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,940
You have no chance to survive, make your time.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,520
Ha ha ha.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,960
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,520
Sponsored by the church of all of the subgenius.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,360
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,620
is specially designed only to be played

18
00:00:59,620 --> 00:00:59,980
on the subgenius radio ministry.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
On radio station.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,200
And only in the city of...

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,820
Don't grit.

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,240
Okay, grit.

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,380
Don't grit.

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:11,660
Ah!

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,100
And speaking of which,

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,380
I'm hearing a clicking and a clacking sound.

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,720
I'm not.

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,560
Who gives a...

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,920
That means it's not going on to the tape.

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,680
And all I care about is the tape.

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,840
I don't care about the listeners, the audience,

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,920
screw them.

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,020
I...

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,240
All I care about is the tape that no one ever listens to.

35
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,460
You've actually physically tried to screw the audience.

36
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,860
For years and years,

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,460
it's been like one of your main back-of-your-mind type fantasy dreams

38
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,620
is to literally screw everybody in your audience.

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,280
Well, it's to pay them back for all the slack I've vampirized off of them.

40
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,300
Every time they listen,

41
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,520
I feel the power.

42
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,780
And they're granting a certain amount of power over their minds to us.

43
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,100
Listen to it.

44
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,360
To us.

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,380
Don't do it on your chest.

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,800
Just waiting for the sun to go down.

47
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,180
It's better in a bar.

48
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,500
A vampire sucks blood.

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,100
When you're up on stage and all the stunning eyes are looking at you,

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,500
you suck off your energy.

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,440
Yeah.

52
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,160
No, no, not just the money.

53
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,880
And the green blood comes out of you.

54
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,800
Just the soul, man.

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,040
Your life essence is here.

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,120
The soul is real.

57
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,640
And a sip of the sweet wine of another soul

58
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,300
is enough to make you puke sometimes.

59
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:28,980
Sip.

60
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,280
Of the wine.

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,480
Sip.

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,480


63
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,480


64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,880
Of the wine.

65
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,240
To suck of the meat of the soul of the believer.

66
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:47,380
This is the appetite of the religious holy man, you know, preacher.

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,120
This is the right of the people.

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,980
And the rock star.

69
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,380
This is the weak.

70
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,280
And the polluted.

71
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,660
They're all vampires.

72
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,380
They're slack vampires.

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,080
They're slack vampires.

74
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,240
They suck.

75
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,600
This is your tax break.

76
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,480
We're going to cook up for you.

77
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,400
It's going to make every American so damn happy.

78
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,220
Just to eat.

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,380
We're going to open up the Alaska River.

80
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,720
We're going to make every American so damn happy.

81
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,240
They're getting our life's blood.

82
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,560
What about the Americans who hardly ever have a sight of that?

83
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,800
They spread out cheese,

84
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,560
a nickel,

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,080
roughly thin pieces of white bread,

86
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,380
and pass them out amongst themselves in portals.

87
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,380
Ladies and gentlemen,

88
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,720
schizophrenic tales of broken dreams.

89
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,660
You hear like your brain is falling apart.

90
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,580
Like the structure in there is all breaking down.

91
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,940
Your mind goes in a million distractions.

92
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,620
It gets through racing and racing.

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,380
I feel real young and helpless.

94
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,520
I feel like a little tiny girl again.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,880
The world seems frightening and scary.

96
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,260
Everybody that I see,

97
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,440
they're out to get me.

98
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,480
I'm not afraid to be a little girl again.

99
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,600
I'm not afraid to be a little girl again.

100
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,220
You're thinking,

101
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,300
cracks!

102
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,860
Then you feel very irritated.

103
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,700
Very agitated.

104
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,860
When I get sick,

105
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,320
I don't want to be touched.

106
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,700
I don't want to be

107
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,420
tampered with.

108
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,180
They put you in restraints.

109
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,240
It feels like everything is closing in.

110
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,460
Like they're getting you.

111
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,040
People come around.

112
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,980
They say,

113
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,560
you gotta talk.

114
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,940
You gotta talk.

115
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,120
So you can get better.

116
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,120
But I can't talk.

117
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,840
I can't!

118
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,300
I was a loner.

119
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,200
I wasn't in the social clique.

120
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,220
I wasn't like the other kids.

121
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,040
They seemed to relate to each other.

122
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,040
I got so different

123
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,700
from everybody else.

124
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,040
I seem to come from a different place.

125
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,720
Society blames me.

126
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,680
They put me down.

127
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,920
But I want you.

128
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,760
All to know.

129
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,980
I did not choose to be this way.

130
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,580
It happened to me!

131
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,420
I was so scared.

132
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,900
I was so scared.

133
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,560
I remember saying,

134
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,660
it's such a big world out there.

135
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,300
But I'm not ready for it.

136
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,040
I don't belong in it.

137
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,960
It looks like I'm okay, but I'm not.

138
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,820
I wish somebody would help me.

139
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,340
Everything just came shattering down.

140
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,540
I was just crazy.

141
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,260
Everything was crazy.

142
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,780
Like falling all apart.

143
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,520
I remember!

144
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,080


145
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,320
Chewing meat!

146
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,820
Like a plant.

147
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,420
Just estava para لي��브 자증 아무것도!

148
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,900
Like I was eating junk food!

149
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,220
Their long car is justian traffic!

150
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,500
Like, I just don't know where to go!

151
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,260
Rude!

152
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,820
Just, just like Mario,

153
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,260
I obvi qu'à l' cameraman,

154
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,700
I knew that I was a Taiwanese,

155
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,740
The thing is, you never know when you're gonna change.

156
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,680
You're doing well, and then the sickness just comes on you.

157
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,460
Then you're not you anymore.

158
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,460
Some other voices are inside you.

159
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,060
It goes like a machine, a computer.

160
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,940
The messages go in and out and come out sounding.

161
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,320
Just like the input.

162
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,480
But it's not you.

163
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,160
Some people get better.

164
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,840
Some don't.

165
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,780
Some people get better.

166
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
Some don't.

167
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,320
Some people get better.

168
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,660
Some don't!

169
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,780
Woo!

170
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:22,840
performance

171
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,420

178
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,520
Thank you.

179
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,720
Thank you.

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,080
Thank you.

181

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,140
Thank you.

193
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,460
Thank you.

194
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,940
Thank you.

195
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,900
Thank you.

196
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,060
Thank you.

197
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,820
Thank you.

198
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,600
Thank you.

199
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,420
Thank you.

200
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,620
Thank you.

201
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,460
The ones are dancing.

202
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,340
The little fat hairy ones are dancing.

203
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,160
The ones dressed as nuns are dancing.

204
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,980
The ones with a strap on are dancing.

205
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,500
Well, season's begun.

206
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,320
I was out at Brushwood last weekend.

207
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,640
Oh, I bet it's beautiful out there.

208
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,760
When does the ground get carpeted with apples?

209
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,140
I guess that's the end of it.

210
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,820
That's the end of it.

211
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,460
That's in fall.

212
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,580
Man, it's so weird.

213
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,620
It's like everywhere you step, you're crunching tiny little wild apples,

214
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,440
and it all smells like apples.

215
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,500
They scream really loud.

216
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,580
And you take them home and skin them alive.

217
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,140
Well, some of those apples are little teeny tiny people.

218
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,760
They conceal their heads that way.

219
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,400
They're actually little small brains encapsulated.

220
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,140
And those pectin-laden apples that are so delicious to it.

221
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,560
Chaz takes those apples home and makes Yankee Wanky Apple Jack sometimes, don't you, Chaz?

222
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,860
I've never done anything like that.

223
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,440
Yes, you have.

224
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,260
You said you used to squish it between your toes like a mammoth kazoon used to do,

225
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,440
and you'd jump around and sing songs.

226
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,620
It's Friday the 13th.

227
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,820
Well, it always is.

228
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,920
You know what I mean?

229
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,040
Oh, no!

230
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,500
Oh, no!

231
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,640
What a terrible epithet to hurl at someone.

232
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,400
It's Friday the 13th, man.

233
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,980
You're telling them you're going to have bad luck.

234
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,780
If you go down into your basement and Bob's sleeping down there,

235
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,880
that means you're going to have real bad luck.

236
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,820
What if Bob was one of us?

237
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,620
What if Bob was concealed in a pecan pie,

238
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,200
and as we opened that delightful, juicy pecan pie,

239
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,160
he became one of us?

240
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,080
He had a moonlighting job doing that,

241
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,040
where he would hide inside of a giant pecan pie,

242
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,800
or different kinds of pies,

243
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,600
and they'd cart him out at business women's luncheons,

244
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,740
and Bob would jump out,

245
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,260
and strip.

246
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,680
Well, then if God was one of us,

247
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,340
then Bob would be something entirely different.

248
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,120
Bob is a man.

249
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,400
He is only a man.

250
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,380
And God is...

251
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,380
You could say God is one of us,

252
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,580
because Bob is God.

253
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,020
But we are not.

254
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,820
But Bob is not one of us.

255
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,520
We are not.

256
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,420
If God was one of me,

257
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,740
I'd feel all...

258
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,820
white power.

259
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,860
You need something to power that mighty anus.

260
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,720
The guy actually...

261
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:30,720


262
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:30,720


263
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,320
I thought he was going to say some subgenius-like thing.

264
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,860
No, it was a colonoscopy.

265
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,920
A colonoscopy from one of the curious...

266
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,640
It was way underneath the underworld.

267
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,120
I know.

268
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,740
That's funny.

269
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,980
Sip him down to Cincinnati.

270
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,140
Let him get a job in the police department.

271
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,900
I'm into white power,

272
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,220
and black power,

273
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,360
and all shades in between.

274
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,360
I like different colors.

275
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,680
I think color is very powerful.

276
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,940
I'm into subgenius power,

277
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,960
as opposed to human power.

278
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,360
Right.

279
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,080
I mean...

280
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,700
Subgenius power.

281
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:00,700


282
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:00,700


283
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,380
Subgeniuses can come in any...

284
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:02,660
Are you into pink power, though?

285
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,220
I'm into pink...

286
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,220


287
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,900
Are you into pink power, though?

288
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,220
Oh, yeah.

289
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,400
No.

290
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,460
I'm into pink...

291
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,760
I believe in slavery, Chaz.

292
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,420
I'll come out and say that.

293
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:10,860
I believe that slavery...

294
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,600
That the pink should be slaves?

295
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,540
Well, they are.

296
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,460
...is cool.

297
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,220
Exactly.

298
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,660
So they are.

299
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,020
Of course, they are.

300
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,440
You've got it.

301
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,320
You hit it on the head.

302
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,460
They're already slaves.

303
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,660
To the conspiracy.

304
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,880
The problem is...

305
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,160
Exactly.

306
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,240
They're slaves to the wrong people,

307
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,840
to the conspiracy instead of us.

308
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,260
Right.

309
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,400
If they're going to be slaves,

310
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,640
you know,

311
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,540
I think they'd enjoy

312
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,520
what we put them to work,

313
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:30,960
doing more than...

314
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,080
I think you're going to love slavery

315
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,900
if you become a love slave

316
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,660
of the Church of the Subgenius.

317
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,640
Well, they also have to...

318
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,240
I think you're going to love

319
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,160
your long, long term

320
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
as a love slave

321
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,000
for the Church of the Subgenius.

322
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,360
They'll build pyramids

323
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,400
in the daytime

324
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,300
and be love slaves at night.

325
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,220
And they'll have to take

326
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,600
microscopic bricks

327
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,520
to make these mighty

328
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,280
3,000-foot-high pyramids.

329
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,620
Hey, what's wrong

330
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,620
with that racial collar?

331
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,520
He didn't say filthy

332
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,200
s*** at all.

333
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,060
It's fine.

334
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,800
I do, do, do.

335
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,800
It's clean.

336
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,240
Yeah.

337
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah.

338
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,400
Parma calling in.

339
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,300
I thought it was...

340
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,320
I think it's just

341
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,960
one of the guys

342
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,420
who had the medulla oblongata

343
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,320
beat out of him.

344
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,320
And that happens sometimes.

345
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,360
Sometimes they'll strap you

346
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,960
so hard.

347
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,020
Isn't that right, Chaz,

348
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,540
when you're going to

349
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,180
denizen school

350
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,020
in your little tiny baby?

351
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,160
Well, what's really funny

352
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,940
is how...

353
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,740
They'll just strap

354
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,460
the back of your neck

355
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,020
until your medulla oblongata

356
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,400
falls off.

357
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,100
are going to be left behind.

358
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,540
You know,

359
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,940
and they won't be around.

360
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,740
They'll be extinct.

361
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,680
Well, some of us

362
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,640
already consider them

363
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,660
They sure won't like it

364
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,760
on the escape vessels

365
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,320
of the sex goddesses.

366
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,520
No.

367
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,020
No, no.

368
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,160
There's many different

369
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,360
feuds of women.

370
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,720
Because what they most fear...

371
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:34,740
They're going to be

372
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
kind of freaked out.

373
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,220
What they most fear

374
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,220
will come true

375
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,240
as well as what

376
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,540
they most desire,

377
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:40,980
you see.

378
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,920
Reverend Ding Dong

379
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,880
is going to bend them

380
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,660
over a log.

381
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,040
I think it's something

382
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,640
like that, right?

383
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,460
Right.

384
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,940
They desire the reach around,

385
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,880
but they're afraid

386
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,180
of what goes with

387
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,000
the reach around.

388
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,100
That guy with the...

389
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,240
They're going to have

390
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,720
to take both.

391
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,060
Oh, come on.

392
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,760
We know that's like

393
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,200
a homoerotic cover.

394
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,720
Those guys that call in

395
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,280
and say that

396
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,440
stuff,

397
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,800
you know what

398
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,540
they really want.

399
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,840
Just picture them,

400
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,360
you know, like...

401
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:04,980
Well, you notice

402
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,540
their girlfriends

403
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,780
don't call in.

404
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,420
Right.

405
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,100
Did you ever notice

406
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,280
one of those skinhead rallies?

407
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,120
There's always like

408
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,400
90 fat guys

409
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,240
with like breasts

410
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,820
like women

411
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,640
and stuff like that

412
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,320
and shaved heads

413
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,920
banging into each other,

414
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,020
screaming words

415
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,980
that come from Africa.

416
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,140
It's sad when

417
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,760
all fat white men

418
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,840
with little teeny

419
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,880
tiny penises

420
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,300
call up.

421
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:23,860
And large breasts.

422
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,700
Don't forget.

423
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,520
And large breasts

424
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,440
and tiny little teeny penises

425
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:27,560
call up.

426
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,820
Hey, now some big fat guys

427
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,100
with tiny little peckers,

428
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,520
they're cool.

429
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,540
Sure, sure.

430
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,820
Hey, man, I mean,

431
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,780
you know, we're not prejudiced

432
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,720
here or anywhere else.

433
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,040
No, man,

434
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,260
our eyes are wide open.

435
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,460
And that's why

436
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,240
the tears are running

437
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,600
down the sides

438
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,260
of our heads

439
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,680
before you hate them.

440
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,360
You whiff them

441
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
and then hate them.

442
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:46,740
Hey, can I air

443
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,480
my exit wound?

444
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,320
Or forgive them

445
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,120
or rip them off as...

446
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,220
Hey, put me on hold

447
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,820
so I can listen

448
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,640
to the show, could you?

449
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,100
Okay.

450
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:53,600
Okay.

451
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,900
Would you like to have

452
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,300
your exit wound cleaned,

453
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,320
licked clean,

454
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,260
licked clean

455
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,860
like a little dog

456
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,480
or do it?

457
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,020
Do it.

458
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
Because our server's down.

459
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,940
Oh, really?

460
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,100
I wanted to listen

461
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,480
to the show

462
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,700
by putting them on hold

463
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,920
because our server's down

464
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,660
and you can't hear it

465
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,080
on the internet.

466
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,880
So he's actually

467
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,040
from a parahoot

468
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,440
time.

469
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,320
From that windstorm

470
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,080
we had today.

471
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,620
He's from

472
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,760
Flagelandspilk,

473
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:16,900
New York.

474
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,500
Hey, I want to talk

475
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,420
about my car accident.

476
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,560
Okay.

477
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,400
I think he already did.

478
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,280
He explained what happened

479
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,220
and how he arrived

480
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,320
where he is today.

481
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,580
He's already explained

482
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,860
how he got rear-ended.

483
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,880
He's a muttered

484
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,740
chimpanzee

485
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,540
with a wrap around

486
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,280
with a clan

487
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,360
dressed...

488
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,620
Yeah, I just...

489
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:33,920
I don't know.

490
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,140
I'm trying.

491
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,060
I got the image of a guy

492
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,940
with one of those

493
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,000
clan uniforms on

494
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,820
giving him the old...

495
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,920
Isn't there more

496
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,060
and more dung...

497
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,000
There's more...

498
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,640
There's more and more

499
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,120
dung flinging going on.

500
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,940
The apes are

501
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,060
fleshless.

502
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,140
That...

503
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,980
You should ask

504
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,040
what sort of

505
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,400
psychic

506
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,540
laxatives are

507
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,460
in the air, Chaz.

508
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,500
And taking the stick

509
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,540
and banging the stick

510
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,120
into the ground.

511
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,400
Yeah.

512
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,380
That's the question

513
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,300
you must ask, boys.

514
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,340
Some kind of cosmic

515
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,260
wave is passing.

516
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,540
What happens...

517
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,620
It's a laxative

518
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,480
for these violent apes

519
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,100
of some kind.

520
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,880
It's some sort of

521
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,080
migratory laxative

522
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,260
that, like a bird,

523
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,300
invades their consciousness

524
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,040
and makes it...

525
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,800
I mean, that's like

526
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,960
little kid poo-poo stuff,

527
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,240
you know,

528
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:13,780
when you want to start

529
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,660
banging things around,

530
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,080
you know,

531
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,580
and getting mean.

532
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,040
As my grandpa

533
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,960
dimples on a stink

534
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,720
Can I get in on

535
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,020
a sewing circle?

536
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,780
What?

537
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,060
Sure.

538
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:22,840
Can I get in on

539
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,420
a sewing circle?

540
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,600
Sure, if you're ornery enough

541
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,180
and we can pull

542
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,920
your eyeballs out.

543
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,180
Why would you want

544
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,580
to do that?

545
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,280
Because...

546
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,380
Because you have no eyes.

547
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,060
You see with your mind.

548
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,720
You can't look

549
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,640
at your own eye.

550
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,820
What you gonna do?

551
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,120
Pull your left eye out,

552
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,520
turn around,

553
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,460
and that's what

554
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,140
we're gonna do

555
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,060
to the pink boys

556
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,900
on X-Day.

557
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,780
You're gonna say,

558
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,820
look at yourself, man,

559
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,160
and we'll pull out

560
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,060
the left eye

561
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,820
just gently enough

562
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,460
without severing

563
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,260
the optic nerve

564
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,500
so that it can

565
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,260
sort of see

566
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,320
the other eye.

567
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,140
Take a good look, boy.

568
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,680
Take out the nostril

569
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,740
and place it

570
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,600
very, very,

571
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,260
very, very

572
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,520
far.

573
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,340
Accept him.

574
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,180
Party.

575
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,540
Ah!

576
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:08,860
What?

577
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,320
You're not recording,

578
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:12,780
are you?

579
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,280
What happened?

580
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,480
All right, back it up.

581
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,660
Let's back that ass up.

582
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,860
Uh-oh, rip.

583
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,600
Ooh.

584
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,800
Ooh.

585
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,360
Ooh.

586
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,200
Ooh.

587
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:36,700
Ooh.

588
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,360
Ooh.

589
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,440
Oh.

590
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,640
Ooh.

591
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,920
Uh-oh, rip.

592
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,280
Uh-oh, rip.

593
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:04,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

594
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:49,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

595
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,100
We're at a booze and now we're shooting.

596
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,120
That ain't professional.

597
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,700
That ain't professional.

598
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:09,440
We're playing shows and we're having rehearsed.

599
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:15,840
Been drinking all day and it just makes it worse.

600
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,920
Remember the chorus but forgot the last verse.

601

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,080


614
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,360
Roger's only 31.

615
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,560
He got Alzheimer's disease.

616
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,920
That ain't professional.

617
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,080
That ain't professional.

618
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,020
That ain't professional.

619
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,080
I ain't that punk.

620
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,300
I had me down from his little brother.

621
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,640
All his plans go halfway to his feet.

622
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,060
That ain't professional.

623
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,820
That ain't professional.

624
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,820
That ain't professional.

625
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:26,880
No, no.

626
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,680
Rick Charles is all right.

627
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,560
He passed his face down drunk and passed out the street.

628
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,340
That ain't professional.

629
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,820
That ain't professional.

630
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,940
No, no.

631
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,060


632
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,500
No, no.

633
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:48,540
We're playing shows and we're having rehearsed.

634
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,780
Been drinking all day and it just makes it worse.

635

00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,040
We didn't do it one more time.

657
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,840
Friends, we've been listening to

658
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Morning 40 Federation,

659
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,400
a group

660
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,280
from New Orleans, I think,

661
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,360
released by Tequito

662
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,260
Records, which you can reach at

663
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,000
PMB number

664
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,380
432

665
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,000
828 Royal

666
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,920

667
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,940
Louisiana,

668
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:33,740
70116.

669
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,120
And friends, we've also been hearing,

670
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,000
of course, some Radio Patapo

671
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,360
from Amsterdam

672
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,060
with Pope Black and Lord Yeti

673
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,920
and so forth.

674
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
And Mickey Finn

675
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,680
and the Pope

676
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,900
of all Northern Europe,

677
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,220
Phil Monty, and the

678
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,800
Einstein Secret Orchestra with

679
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,500
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

680
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,340
and host Professor

681
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,540
Chaz Smith, of course, from

682
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,680
WCSB in Cleveland,

683
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,180
the marvelous, marvelous

684
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,680
home. And that

685
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,840
is more.

686
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,180
Yeah,

687
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,440
was she or was Dean Moriarty

688
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,200
God is in every sparrow

689
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,520
plummeting to the ground.

690
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,940
Well put.

691
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,340
Well put.

692
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,000
Or is that old?

693
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,380
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that before.

694
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,960
Is that old or something?

695
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,320
It's a cross reference.

696
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,320
It's James Jones.

697
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,540
God Junior.

698
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,600
God Junior.

699
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,620
God sees every

700
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:30,920
sparrow.

701
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,520
I was just going to ask you about

702
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,540
the Easter theme.

703
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,880
I am kind of a

704
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,360
thematic Easter thing.

705
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,120
Do you believe in the classical

706
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,440
that God and Jesus is the same

707
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,400
guy? Or do you believe that

708
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,660
God is Jesus is God's

709
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,400
kid? And therefore,

710
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,240
but then see, it wouldn't.

711
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,300
I don't believe in any separation between

712
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,540
God and any atom in the universe.

713
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,520
And so therefore, it's a moot

714
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,460
point. Why are you asking me? I might as

715
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,580
well be a secular humanist, rationalist

716
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,520
subgenius for all

717
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,480
the difference it would make.

718
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,280
I'm actually a totally

719
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,040
mystical,

720
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,960
mystical, cosmic minded philosopher.

721
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,780
I think evil came in.

722
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,940
I think the evil started when they let

723
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,300
them stink in the tomb too long.

724
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,720
Yeah, well, evil started. No, I think evil started when

725
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,460
because we're

726
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,000
the remnants of a burned

727
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,720
out star.

728
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,200
An older star blew up.

729
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,300
We're ruminants like the

730
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:23,540
carpet part.

731
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,900
We came out of that.

732
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,700
Maybe in that explosion

733
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,600
something went wrong.

734
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,720
I think evil was intended about the

735
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,920
same time as time.

736
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,420
Any explosion, something goes wrong, doesn't it?

737
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,300
I mean, your thumb goes wrong.

738
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,460
As soon as something started to happen, some things were good and some of the things were evil.

739
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,360
There's your yin and yang and your potatoes

740
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,440
right in your thumb.

741
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,300
You know, when you said it was, is that where evil started

742
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,300
with the, any explosion, something can go wrong.

743
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,160
So perhaps if it was like

744
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,320
Jali and like you guys were claiming

745
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,160
that you could hit the wall with your, with your

746
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,400
sperm a couple hours ago, remember when you were bragging

747
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,220
about that? Yeah. God probably

748
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,080
thought he could shoot his seeds

749
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,380
across the entire, you know, it's a big place.

750
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,220
Well, that's called the Milky Way.

751
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,820
Well, that's not the Milky Way.

752
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,380
The fact that it created this beautiful world that we live in

753
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,660
is the good part. And the fact that it created

754
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,400
this hideous world that we live in

755
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,200
is the evil part.

756
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,080
Hmm.

757
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,600
Baby.

758
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,560
You know,

759
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,520
they say the beauty's

760
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,540
only skin deep.

761
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,240
But I know that's not true.

762
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,380
And my advice

763
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,740
is to look

764
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,720
deep within yourself.

765
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,460
And there you'll find

766
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,040
deep down a love

767
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,920
that's true.

768
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,220
Hey, I'm looking deep inside for

769
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,680
Hey, I'll tell you what, right?

770
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,620
Talking about looking deep down, right?

771
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,820
My very, very sexy lady friend

772
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,100
Foxy Fiona called around

773
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,340
to see me the other day, right?

774
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,960
She was having a bit of trouble with her tooth

775
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,060
and asked me if I'd take her to the dentist

776
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,500
in me soft top Bedford Rascal.

777
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,900
Well, our dentist is another very

778
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,940
sexy lady friend of mine called

779
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,840
Jackie. I tell you what,

780
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,500
last time I was sat in her chair,

781
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,620
I told her if she was going to get mine out,

782
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,520
she'd have to give it a really good pull, you know?

783
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,920
I mean, not only was it a big one,

784
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,320
you know, sticking out in front,

785
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,540
but it'd been throbbing like mad all day.

786
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,780
I just couldn't wait for her to grip it firmly

787
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,760
and, you know, yank it until I felt

788
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,720
some relief. Well, I tell you what,

789
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,300
she had no trouble sorting it out.

790
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,360
Before I knew it, I was up, you know,

791
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,800
out of the chair. Mind you, not only

792
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,880
did she rid me of the tooth, it also

793
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,480
cost me 85 quid.

794
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,240
That's the trouble of going private.

795
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,940
Cost you a bomb, doesn't it? Like most dentists,

796
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,580
Jackie's patients are split between

797
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,820
NHS and private. And I've been

798
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,740
told, when it comes down to it,

799
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,780
Jackie appears to be more attentive

800
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,920
to her privates.

801
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,520
Anyway, as it turned out, Foxy Fiona

802
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,940
wasn't going for an extraction.

803
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,720
She was going to see if Jackie could fill

804
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,920
her big cavity. Well, when we got

805
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,780
there, Jackie said she'd be more than happy

806
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,160
to take a look at it straight away.

807
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,760
Well, after asking Foxy Fiona

808
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,560
to lie back and open wide,

809
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,800
sexy Jackie probed round with

810
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,600
a finger for about a minute, before

811
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,380
inserting a big buzzing tool.

812
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,260
Hey, I tell you what, right?

813
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,460
I've never seen such a big dentist drill like it

814
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,600
in my life. Anyway, at the end

815
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
of the day, I suppose it was just what

816
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,680
Foxy Fiona needed. And, you know,

817
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,520
she seemed to be relieved. But you must

818
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,540
keep your teeth clean. Preventative

819
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,540
stuff, you see. In fact, I've just

820
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,440
nipped out to get the wife a new toothbrush

821
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,500
from the chemists. You see, for the

822
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
past six months, she's been sticking

823
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
me big pink one in her mouth twice a day.

824
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,460
Once in the morning, once last thing

825
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,480
at night. Not that I mind it, of course.

826
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,580
But it meant that I used to have to give the

827
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,340
old thing a good clean, you know, before I could

828
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,480
stick it in my own mouth. Anyway,

829
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,500
she also told me to get her some

830
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,300
toothpaste and all, as she also

831
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,460
used to use mine. I mean, the

832
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,320
last time she had mine out in the bathroom,

833
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,460
she squeezed it so hard, a big

834
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,520
white stream shot out the end of it and covered

835
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,340
the mirror. Not only that, it

836
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,520
completely stained the carpet and left

837
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,080
a big blob on me tartan slippers.

838
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,260
You know, the ones that sexy Sam

839
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,860
got me for my birthday.

840
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,160
Took me ages to clean up the mess

841
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,280
I tell you. Still, I tell you what,

842
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,740
at least she does brush her teeth.

843
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,060
Not like Fat Larry's Mrs. Lorna.

844
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,460
She neglected us for years

845
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,440
and now has ended up with a set of

846
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,360
dentures. I tell you what, that

847
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,460
woman has got the biggest pair I have ever

848
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,380
seen in my life. She took them out

849
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,460
once and plunked them in me hand. Wait a

850
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,480
ton they did. I tell you what, I've

851
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,480
got a big gob, but there was no way I

852
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,480
could fit them in. Having said

853
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,320
all that, even without them in,

854
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,060
she still looks very attractive.

855
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,300
Mind you, that's when she has her mouth closed.

856
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,620
Fat Larry said, if she ever parts

857
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,340
her lips, all you can see

858
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,600
is a big mass of pink flesh.

859
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,960
All glistening and wet.

860
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,440
I'm not kidding, she has a set of gums like

861
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,440
you wouldn't believe. Anyway, I got

862
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,540
Fat Harriet a toothbrush and some

863
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,160
toothpaste from the chemists.

864
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,600
Oh, and some dental floss. I mean, I know

865
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,320
she's never used it before, but I'm sure

866
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,380
she'll soon get used to pulling off a good length

867
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,260
and doing the business with it, you know,

868
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,220
in her mouth.

869
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,400
So that's just anecdotal about tooth

870
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,500
stuff, really, you know. Hey, I tell you,

871
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,360
what, I'm glad that tambourine

872
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,120
stopped, aren't you?

873
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,300
Looking deep

874
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:10,700
inside.

875
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,560
Ah, yes,

876
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,340
friends, Fat Harry White from

877
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,240
his album, Whom Baby,

878
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,440
on the Anxious Records.

879
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,220
Thanks so much to the

880
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,340
Pope Phil Monty in England

881
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,180
for turning us on to that praise.

882
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,140
Isn't it terrible? Yeah, um,

883
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,380
so do you guys realize that today

884
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,500
is not only Friday the 13th, but

885
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,520
um... Okay, now the guy's talking

886
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,400
Japanese, right?

887
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,820
Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

888
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,940
Were you saying something in Japanese? Like,

889
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,220
I don't know, like, yeah, this guy,

890
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,340
this guy? Yeah, I was just saying

891
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,360
that today is both, uh, the first

892
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,500
Friday the 13th of the new millennium

893
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,560
and Good Friday. Any comments

894
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,240
on that, anyone? Oh, of course.

895
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,320
You know, we can comment up to watch it.

896
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,120
Of course it is. It's 2,000 years ago.

897
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,420
It happened. Come here,

898
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,480
Bray. What happened? What? Come on, baby.

899
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,220
It's insufficient. It really happened.

900
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,480
Do you really believe it happened?

901
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,900
Don't you really get the idea that all of each

902
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,280
being crucified every day of the last 2,000

903
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,300
years? Yeah. I mean, every Friday.

904
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,540
That was probably a Friday the 13th.

905
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,380
He just cried every time.

906
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,100
Every night that the humans sit

907
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,060
and watch TV all night long,

908
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,180
they're like at self-crucifixion.

909
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,240
That's like putting a knife in Mary's

910
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,120
heart. It's like, you know, other Mary's

911
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,120
heart. You make the virgin cry every time.

912
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,120
Every night that you watch that

913
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,980
hit that survivor show,

914
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,460
Jesus cries.

915
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,040
Jesus weeps.

916
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,340
You should be out there.

917
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,280
You should be out in the field.

918
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:37,920
You should be on that island yourself.

919
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,260
You should be the one floating in that lake.

920
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,180
Building that cross. Crucifying yourself.

921
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,080
Get on up there on Good Friday and get those

922
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,320
nails out and that hammer and pound it home, baby.

923
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,160
I mean, come on. Do your bit.

924
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,260
You're weak. You're weak.

925
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,120
You've got to nail yourself

926
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,100
up on that cross. And how are you

927
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,060
going to get the other hand in after you've done

928
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,040
the first hand? But, boy, do we have

929
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,000
a great deal on crosses for you for this

930
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,580
coming Good Friday coming up tomorrow.

931
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,120
Actually, today. It's actually today.

932
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,100
Well, I really like this lumber

933
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,980
is absolutely porous and will

934
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,900
not stain any of your articles or

935
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,360
deniments. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

936
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,620
That's Jesus at subgenius.com.

937
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,860
If you want to know about

938
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,560
salvation or your $275,

939
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:20,820
it's

940
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,780
Jesus at subgenius.com.

941
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,100
It's not

942
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,140
ESO radio.

943
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,440
And it's not

944
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,020
revered

945
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,660
at the hour of black.

946
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,860
And it ain't loans from Calvary.

947
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,400
It's all by himself, brother.

948
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,820
It's you.

949
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,280
It's you and me.

950
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,780
It's between you and Bob.

951
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,980
You don't need to hear a media area

952
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,640
of a preacher.

953
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:45,880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

954
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,840
You don't need a preacher. You just need Bob.

955
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,080
You don't need Reverend Stanton.

956
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:52,920
You don't need

957
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,680
Karen Schilling.

958
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,900
You don't need the back.

959
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,720
You don't need the evidence.

960
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,840
You don't need that antidote.

961
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,780
You only need one thing. That's Bob.

962
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,640
And a little frog, probably.

963
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,880
And, uh...

964
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,500
When God

965
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,180
come back on

966
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,820
a happy Easter's day

967
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,860
and it carries

968
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,760
a lace around the flowers

969
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,520
and everybody pukes on his

970
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,120
head.

971
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,680
I love you, boy.

972
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,000
And I'm gonna date you, Bucky, woman.

973
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,860
I'm going down.

974
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,480
All right, man.

975
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,640
He's going down.

976
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,400
If the last 50 years

977
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,640
made such a change,

978
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,900
just imagine the New York of 1980

979
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,800
when everyone has a number

980
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,360
instead of a name

981
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,620
and the government tells you

982
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,720
whom you should marry.

983
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,860
Let him that hath understanding

984
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,640
count the number of the beast.

985
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,700
For it is the number of a man.

986
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,680
Number of a man.

987
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,040
His number is

988
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,560
six hundred

989
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,000
threescore

990
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,360
and six.

991
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:02,880
Nodding.

992
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:03,740
Nodding.

993
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:04,820
Nodding.

994
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,400
Nodding.

995
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,140
Nodding.

996
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:06,760
Nodding.

997
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:07,880
Nodding.

998
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:08,640
Nodding.

999
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,120
Nodding.

1000
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,400
Nodding.

1001
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:13,420
Nodding.

1002
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:13,420


1003
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:13,420


1004
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:13,420


1005
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:13,420


1006
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:13,420


1007
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,620
Can we do the stations of the cross now?

1008
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,040
Okay, ready?

1009
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,300
Um, what is it...

1010
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,380
Hap, heep.

1011
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,000
Hap, heep, heep.

1012
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:21,920
Gotta get in line

1013
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,700
if you're gonna do them.

1014
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,340
Remember, every time you gene inflict,

1015
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,320
you wanna flip of a little prayer

1016
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,480
this way or that way, okay?

1017
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,880
This way.

1018
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,840
Let's pray this way. Let's pray that way.

1019
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,920
Get down on your knees and bend over.

1020
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,460
Jesus has his face wiped by the women.

1021
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,880
Jesus has his nose flexed by the man next door.

1022
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,520
Is that what Jesus was doing under them women?

1023
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,780
Jesus flares his nostrils.

1024
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,940
Jesus cries out in pain,

1025
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,840
Why don't you leave me alone?

1026
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,020
Come on, Chaz, we've only got seven more to go, or twelve, or whatever.

1027
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,500
I'm sorry.

1028
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,000
Jesus pulls his hat down tight over his eyes.

1029
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,360
Jesus forgives the Sagittarians for plummeting his mothbroughs.

1030
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,440
Jesus falls for the nineteenth time.

1031
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:26,820
Ow!

1032
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,560
That's blasphemous, you guys.

1033
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:37,880
Jesus takes the thorn of crowns and uses it as a fetish device on Mary Magdalene.

1034
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,760
I am so glad I wasn't raised religious.

1035
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:48,280
Jesus prepares the onion dip before receiving Golgotha.

1036
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,120
You know, I didn't get any of that.

1037
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,560
I took some serious S&M ass-whippin' from them nuns.

1038
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,920
I can say anything I want.

1039
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,720
Yeah, you know, it's funny, uh...

1040
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,920
Chaz went to serious, serious school.

1041
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,240
I was in college.

1042
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,540
People are always there saying,

1043
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,340
Reverend Stang, what religion burned your brain?

1044
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,940
You must really hate some religion.

1045
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,680
Was the nuns wrapping your hands with those rulers, or what?

1046
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,680
It's like, no, my family didn't really particularly go to church or anything.

1047
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,380
We were...

1048
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,720
You're a rationalist family.

1049
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:13,820
Sort of, yeah.

1050
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:19,240
Actually, my dad is like a lay preacher and knows more about the Bible than most preachers do.

1051
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:19,900
So those guys just have to lay down all the time?

1052
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,460
For that matter, I know more about the Bible than most Christians do.

1053
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,340
But I...

1054
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:24,760
That...

1055
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,520
You know, I never did go...

1056
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:32,060
Know much about those rituals of the Catholics or the Presb...

1057
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,160
Actually, the Presbyterians have some...

1058
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,860
Are, you know, kind of lively.

1059
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,560
Do they have rituals?

1060
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,700
What are their rituals?

1061
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,000
I just...

1062
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,600
The tonguers are my favorite, of course.

1063
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:39,940
The what-ers?

1064
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,240
The tonguers.

1065
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,800
Those are the ones that speak in tongues.

1066
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,540
Oh, the tonguers.

1067
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,640
There are many different types of tonguers.

1068
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,680
That's what the other Christian nuts, who aren't quite as crazy as the tonguers, call

1069
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,400
the tonguers.

1070
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,920
Those are the folks who put the pits in the cream cheese?

1071
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:53,920


1072
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,080
I heard a guy tell me about the tonguers.

1073
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:56,600
He was going...

1074
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,560
They're just crazy.

1075
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,960
He just suddenly started talking these nonsense.

1076
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,120
They're going to go to hell.

1077
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,940
You know, they're going to have to answer to God for that.

1078
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,080
And then he told me about Jamaicans.

1079
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,460
He goes, I was going to answer to Jamaica.

1080
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,800
That is what those men do.

1081
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,720
They put cow dung in their hair.

1082
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,240
They put cow dung in their hair.

1083
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,240
And they said to me, they're going to have to answer to God for that.

1084
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,840
I just see these Jamaican guys standing in front of God.

1085
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,400
Chad, don't you think that's kind of strange?

1086
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,320
Explaining the cow dung in their hair.

1087
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,060
And then the...

1088
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:23,900
And God's going to answer to God for that.

1089
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,120
And God goes, cool.

1090
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,900
Yeah, I think God would love a Rastaman.

1091
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,760
And then God would go, you know what?

1092
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,960
I already knew that because I'm you and that cow dung.

1093
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,400
I thought...

1094
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,080
I thought John was a Rastaman.

1095
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,200
And they'll go, man, that's what I was hoping.

1096
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,080
I was hoping that there was an answer, that it was true and good and right.

1097
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,740
And you are me and you are the cow dung.

1098
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,020
And we're all one and we're all together.

1099
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:44,780
Praise God.

1100
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:52,800
I think I'd like to live in a world where that cow dung can not only talk and not only

1101
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,880
make distinctions in the game, but also make people laugh.

1102
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:53,880


1103
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:53,880


1104
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:53,880


1105
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:53,880


1106
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:53,880


1107
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:53,880


1108
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:53,880


1109
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,580
I mean, I completely accepted that 그리고에 대한 재능을 about my 음악 and my

1110
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:02,580


1111
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:02,660
I'll chat you later.

1112
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,800
很 bribe you to write your own notes on tip texture.

1113
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,560
let you to let you know.

1114
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:06,880
Because we can sit for a week.

1115
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


1116
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,120
Because I want my 3d head to get better, like Jingles got you all because you know that

1117
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:17,700
as USB, be ready to play by the end of Wednesday.

1118
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:17,820
Choke off the

1119
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:17,820


1120
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,040
Oh, nice.

1121
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:19,040


1122
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:19,420
...

1123
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,200
Now,

1124
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:23,740
i

1125
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,440
Concentration at the end of the tip of your nose and to your navel for approximately five minutes.

1126
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:33,780
While looking at your watch, making sure to count slowly, breathing through your ears.

1127
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:34,860
One.

1128
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,660
Breathe out through your eyes.

1129
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,900
In through your ears.

1130
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,880
Out through your eyes.

1131
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,940
Now everything you've heard you will smell and you will see everything you've heard after you smell it.

1132
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:56,680
Now when the navel is calmed, think of the navel as the entire center of the universe.

1133
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:16,700
I would like to transplant a few of you wonderful people I've met here on earth in my short brief stay in your world.

1134
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,600
The Christ, a cowboy friend of mine.

1135
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:27,520
We played wood chips together and stocked ourselves full of the latest stockings and cooperated.

1136
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,440
That's the key word here.

1137
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,180
Cooperation.

1138
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,740
And you, I remember you the day they nailed you to the solar helix.

1139
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:43,920
Did you know that if abortion had been legal in Bob's day, that Bob would not have been born?

1140
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:44,920
Is this true?

1141
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,160
Did you know that Bob is an abortion survivor?

1142
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,160
He was Bob as an infant.

1143
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,060
He survived an abortion.

1144
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:57,220
He was his mom, bless her sweet virgin heart, Jane Dobbs.

1145
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:04,220
Jane McBride Dobbs was giving birth to this child, which she did not, for various reasons,

1146
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:08,180
and having nothing to do with a Mayan dad, did not want.

1147
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,760
She did not want the child, Bob.

1148
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,740
Believe it or not.

1149
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,580
Don't you think you should leave sleeping jizz live?

1150
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,780
She attempted to have an abortion of the child, Bob, but they could not get him out.

1151
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,920
Bob loved the womb so much.

1152
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,060
They could not.

1153
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,400
The forceps of the abortionist doctor could not yank the fetus, Bob, out.

1154
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,880
They ripped and tore at him.

1155
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,040
A tornado came, finally.

1156
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:35,680
A Kansas, well, I didn't want to say what state this was in, but the state where Bob was born in.

1157
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:42,620
A giant twister came and yanked the baby Bob out of the womb of Jane Dobbs.

1158
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,360
And that was the only way that Bob was finally aborted.

1159
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,760
And yet, he still lived on.

1160
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,380
The tiny, preemie fetus, Bob.

1161
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:56,240
Bob, with his rudimentary pipe, whining there in that Kansas wheat field, yet lived.

1162
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:02,680
And when Jane saw him, she wept and cried and knew that she had done a wrong thing to try to have an abortion.

1163
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:06,700
And she decided to raise him, since he couldn't be killed, obviously, anyway.

1164
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:14,180
And held him, cradled in that wheat field with blood pouring from between her legs as the tornado went away.

1165
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,160
So Bob survived that abortion attempt.

1166
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,020
But you just remember that if abortion...

1167
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:25,640
It would have been legal back in 1929, and Bob wouldn't be with us today.

1168
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,760
Well, tell us, in that wheat field, what did Bob live off of?

1169
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,900
And what did he...

1170
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:31,340
Call him a call.

1171
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,420
Yeah, what did he...

1172
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,360
What happened there?

1173
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,720
Well, then his mom loved him.

1174
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:40,340
Once he was born, of course, when she saw him, she instantly fell under his charismatic sway.

1175
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,500
And babied him and spoiled him and loved him.

1176
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,440
I mean, he was a preemie, I guess, of like six weeks old.

1177
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,940
So he's probably about that long.

1178
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,260
They say that a...

1179
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,800
Fetus has no soul.

1180
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,260
But Bob, at that age, did.

1181
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,780
He even had a tiny pipe.

1182
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,000
He was just a cluster of cells with a little pipe.

1183
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,660
Yes, but he...

1184
00:52:59,660 --> 00:52:59,920
And a soul.

1185
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,140
Well, or whatever passes first.

1186
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:02,920
But no brain.

1187
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,020
He never did develop a brain.

1188
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:11,140
As far as we know, during the autopsy, the first autopsy, showed no sign of a brain at all.

1189
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:16,000
There was a root-like network from the pipe going back up into the cranium.

1190
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,960
But there was no actual brain.

1191
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,420
No fluid, nothing.

1192
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,540
There was a brain once for two weeks, and he never gave it back.

1193
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,760
Well, you know...

1194
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,660
Now, normally, Bob doesn't keep all your brain.

1195
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,300
He gives mostly, usually...

1196
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,100
He may be...

1197
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,840
You may get it back yet.

1198
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:32,420
Yeah.

1199
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,040
Pope Monty, you may get your brain back yet someday.

1200
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,560
And you may be sorry that you ever wished for it back from Bob.

1201
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,460
Who knows what it's seen?

1202
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,060
It has seen things.

1203
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,700
Things I'm scared to even think about right now.

1204
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:47,380
It's good, Joe.

1205
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,060
I can't think.

1206
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,280
Because I never got my brain back.

1207
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,520
Bob, he's still got your brain.

1208
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,380
He's still got my brain!

1209
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,600
If he put it back, he'd probably go insane after what he's done with it.

1210
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,460
It's immortality.

1211
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,520
It was a price more costly than death.

1212
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,280
Time control can only go awry.

1213
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:13,280
And then May 12th coming up next month, just like a month from now, just about there,

1214
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,300
ESO Reverend Adam saying, Princess We Are Dull, is she going to rant?

1215
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:18,940
No.

1216
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,360
That poster is...

1217
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:24,680
It's by Reverend Gio, and I think he was just, you know, assuming that...

1218
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:24,980
Okay.

1219
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,980
Since she was around and she's so famous and beautiful and everything, they need to advertise her.

1220
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,620
She rarely does...

1221
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,620
Yeah, that's...

1222
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:40,540
They did a bunch of techno stuff that is on the lovely Bob Song CDs, and they're going to do a little bit of...

1223
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:45,020
Well, if ESO doesn't start rehearsing soon, we're going to sound probably good.

1224
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,100
I was around when Jesus Christ had his moment.

1225
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,580
Let's just get off the air and go smoke dope in the parking lot.

1226
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,080
I'm for that.

1227
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,720
Except now they're going to be out there wanting some.

1228
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,020
Everybody, let's go over to Moe's.

1229
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,240
Yeah, let's go to Moe's.

1230
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,700
All right, all you listeners out there.

1231
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,740
Let's go do some ohms at Moe's.

1232
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:16,540
Yeah, all you listeners out there want to meet us up for a beer, we're going to go head over to Moe's right after we get off the air here.

1233
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,420
So, we'll see you there.

1234
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,240
Exactly.

1235
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,240
And alcohol again.

1236
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,520
Let's go.

1237
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,360
Come on over to my joint.

1238
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:26,640
Let's go.

1239
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,440
So, we're going to do Sympathy at the Divival.

1240
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,640
All right.

1241
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:40,800
We'll have the biggest Dobbs head in the world and Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing Sympathy for the Devil in front of the Dobbs head painted by Jesus.

1242
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,900
With the blood of virgins splitting all over the stage.

1243
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:49,480
And we'll be chopping the heads off Christians to the beat.

1244
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:49,820
Please.

1245
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,060
Please.

1246
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,140
Please.

1247
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:04,720
Please.

1248
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,140
Please.

1249
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,460
Please.

1250
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:09,980
Please.

1251
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:10,860
Please.

1252
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:11,920
Please.

1253
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:12,300
Please.

1254
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:12,340
Please.

1255
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,260
Please.

1256
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:13,400


1257
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:13,480


1258
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:13,480


1259
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:13,820
Please.

1260
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,060
Please.

1261
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:14,460
Please.

1262
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:14,820
Please.

1263
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,100
Please.

1264
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:18,520
Please.

1265
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,800
Please.

1266
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,840
It was you and me.

1267
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,640
Let me please introduce myself.

1268
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,580
I'm the man of wealth and taste.

1269
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,160
I ain't trash for troubadours.

1270
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,340
Who can kill the boys?

1271
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1272
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,580
Crazy Bob Bob.

1273
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,580
Sending you $30.

1274
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:51,320
Sending your $30 right now to the mailing address.

1275
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:58,580
Post Office Box 140306.

1276
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,460
Dallas, Texas, USA.

1277
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:12,820
Send in your money or this shall be the sound of alien spacecraft bombing your house.

1278
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,140
Crazy Bob.

1279
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,260
Am I still entitled to salvation?

1280
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,040
You're still entitled to suffering.

1281
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,960
Well, or triple your money back, right?

1282
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,240
I mean, well, did you pay your $30?

1283
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:33,680
Yeah.

1284
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,480
It's pretty simple.

1285
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:37,200
If you put your $30 in, you get $90 back if you didn't.

1286
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,160
Now think about it.

1287
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:43,900
If you're not saved and you want to be saved with triple your money back guarantee

1288
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,140
and be able to come out to Brushwood and party with the cool guys,

1289
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:47,140


1290
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:47,440
You're not going to be able to do that.

1291
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:47,440


1292
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:47,440


1293
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,060
Coolest people.

1294
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:54,060
You have to, what, dial up a little envelope there to P.O. Box.

1295
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:59,000
Friend, all you got to do is just look at the sub site on the web.

1296
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,600
Oh, www.subgenius.com.

1297
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,320
Or just say, just to peel back your skull.

1298
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:08,340
We're not trying to get money out of radio listeners on this college station.

1299
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:16,700
All you need to do, shut up, Dave, is write P.O. Box 140306.

1300
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:20,600
That's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1301
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,200
Go, Dave, go!

1302
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:21,580
No.

1303
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,620
I ruined it.

1304
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

1305
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,460
No, I was just talking about you.

1306
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,240
I had to do the P.O. Box and I was imitating Chaz.

1307
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,220
It's so funny when Chaz goes, shut up, Dave.

1308
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:34,600
I think it's one of the funniest things I ever hear.

1309
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,860
I wait to hear that all the time.

1310
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,360
Well, look at my hair.

1311
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,180
People are talking over each other.

1312
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,160
You can't hear either one.

1313
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,140
What can I do to make up for it, Dave?

1314
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,300
Let me talk for the next 10 minutes.

1315
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:46,680
No, wait a minute.

1316
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:46,980
You guys.

1317
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:47,400
All right.

1318
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:47,680
Okay.

1319
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:48,140
All right.

1320
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:48,940
We'll just give it to you.

1321
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,920
No, he just said, what can I do to make up for it?

1322
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:51,700
Okay.

1323
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,300
Turn off his mic, too.

1324
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:54,340
Now, turn off my mic.

1325
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:54,960
Oh, here.

1326
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,100
Okay, turn off my mic.

1327
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,680
Now, isn't that better?

1328
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:10,660
Than what?

1329
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,160
Man.

1330
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,300
It's like...

1331
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,720
Bergman knew how to use silence.

1332
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,080
I bought it there.

1333
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:21,860
Sign theater.

1334
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,760
My cheekbones hurt.
