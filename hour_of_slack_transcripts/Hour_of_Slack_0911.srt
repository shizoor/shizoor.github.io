1
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,160
Who owns this house?

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,500
Who dwells in here?

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,440
Who lives here?

4
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,420
And how long have they been here?

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:57,140
Who lives here?

6
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,760
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,500
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

8
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,360
The subgenius.

9
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,960
Our subgenius.

10
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,680
Ah, yes, dear friends, a fine tune there.

11
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,940
Happy Lizards by Helpo Puey.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:49,340
And this Hour of Slack number 9-11, actually, yes it is, is a rerun of Hour of Slack number 530.

13
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:58,580
Recorded in the early 90s at WCSB Cleveland on Chaz Smith's show, ESO Radio, with lonesome cowboy Dave.

14
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,480
But also with...

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,640
The full Einstein secret orchestra actually in the studio playing along live as we sort of jammed all in one gigantic horrible take.

16
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,160
And so, and so, dear friends, here it is.

17
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,320
Hour of Slack

18
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,680
Hour of Slack

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,380
Hour of Slack

20
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,360
Hour of Slack

21
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,500
Night

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,820
Step into the sun, step into the light

23
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,660
Ooh

24
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:40,560
Keep straight ahead for the most glorious place on the face of the earth, farthest ground

25
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,500
Hold on to your breath, hold on to your heart, hold on to your hope

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,500
March up to the gate and build it up

27
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,020
deeply

28
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,180
hustle here and hustle there

29
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,340
New York City's vape

30
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,340


31
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,340


32
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,340


33
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,340


34
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,180
The place where they said, hey, babe, go take a walk on the wild side.

35
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,920
I said, hey, Joe, go take a walk on the wild side.

36
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,340
Hi, honey.

37
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,860
Hello.

38
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,640
Hello.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,060
Hello.

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,800
Hello.

41
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,080
Hello.

42
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,500
My name is Chaz.

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,440
And we are Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

44
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,880
And that's what you were just listening to was Einstein's Secret Orchestra performing for you.

45
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,040
That was last week's show.

46
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,920
Let's put last week's show away and create a whole new show just for you.

47
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,020
I think we should put this guy over here on the turntable where he belongs.

48
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,740
Oh, he didn't want to do that.

49
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,900
Okay, there he is.

50
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,340
Breakdown.

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,720
Well, by the time you get this communicated, it'll be too late.

52
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,660
The pigs are outside the door.

53
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,160
What I want to know is who speaks for Earth.

54
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,220
Hey, here's Moansome Cowboy Dave.

55
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,440
Michelle down in the other studio on that box there.

56
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,380
I'm sitting here with a keyboard.

57
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,260
And Dave's got his guitar.

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,120
And Lisa Lisa is over there.

59
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,560
And?

60
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,640
The Reverend Ivan Stang.

61
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,480
Standing right behind me.

62
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,600
And that's a dangerous proposition, boys and girls.

63
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,160
Praise God.

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,700
Praise you, Princess Lisa.

65
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,880
The KY Jelly is ready to go.

66
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,520
And everyone is standing around in line.

67
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,120
Look, they fell for it again.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,220
They're back again.

69
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,480
Told you they'd do it.

70
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,580
And they always fall for it every time.

71
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,760
Always will again and again.

72
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,860
Thought you could get away, did you?

73
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,020
Look at it.

74
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,840
He doesn't even remember, does he?

75
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,480
No, no, no.

76
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,940
Just let him guess.

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,840
Or just let him drift in and out of realities for a while.

78
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,500
Who speaks for Earth?

79
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,200
Who sells for Earth?

80
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,880
And who will buy Earth?

81
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,300
Who will buy the Earth?

82
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:34,300


83
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,740
Here's one for Mother.

84
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,040
You are about to discover a part of yourself that you have never dared dream might exist.

85
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:52,640
This show will be a personal experience between you and the man with the pipe.

86
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,060
You are about to rip open a yawning chassis.

87
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,040
in what you thought was your personality.

88
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,740
You will stand on the brink of a hole

89
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,840
deep within yourself.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,500
A pit, a pit, and a stinky pit,

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,860
and then the very deepest, blackest part of the pit

92
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,160
that is your mind.

93
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,100
You will discover...

94
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,480
Bob.

95
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,800
Bob.

96
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,260
But first, let's step back out into the real world.

97
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,920
The real world.

98
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,460
The real world.

99
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,580
Now that you have achieved trance state,

100
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,820
come with us.

101
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,100
Come and travel in the astral planes as we seek

102
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,280
that which is dark.

103
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,580
But first, you must pull loose from your own body.

104
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,680
Yes, it's easy.

105
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,520
Just a little tug.

106
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,080
Close your eyes.

107
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,680
Float upward and give your soul a little tug.

108
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,760
You see?

109
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,040
You are free.

110
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,040
You're free.

111
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,340
You never thought you are so.

112
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,900
A little tug.

113
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,660
You never thought.

114
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,100
It would be so easy, did you?

115
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,100
Then let's go upwards.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,880
Let's float.

117
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,420
Upwards.

118
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,100
To get perspective.

119
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,900
Upwards.

120
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,660
Higher.

121
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,260
Towards heaven.

122
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,040
But we'll stop here in face, in space, first.

123
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,660
Just past the Earth's atmosphere.

124
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,940
You see?

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,800
We can go anywhere instantly this way.

126
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,860
And it was all so easy, right within humanity's grasp.

127
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,620
All alone.

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,720
And you know the secret.

129
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:55,780
You know the secret.

130
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,820
Really.

131
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,300
You can go anywhere.

132
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,460
Let's try something new.

133
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,720
Oh, it's beautiful down here.

134
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,700
We could just float along and watch the fish.

135
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,000
Or...

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,640
Roll on up on the party system.

137
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,660
Come on in for the best in town.

138
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,520
Take your pick and the pie is fine.

139
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,380
Lay your bets on the side of the...

140
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,500
Or...

141
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:53,780
I can plunge you into this trench in the middle of this blistering hell planet and

142
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,100
send you to sit in change in this ditch forever.

143
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,000
Just waiting, waiting, until the ticks come again.

144
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,480
Yes, just waiting, the giant ticks.

145
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,320
Here they come again.

146
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,760
I better start shooting.

147
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,400
Don't look.

148
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,840
Let me look.

149
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,100
Oh, keep shooting.

150
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,860
You could shoot another one and another.

151
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,760
Oh, you'll never kill them all.

152
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
Keep shooting.

153
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,780
Keep shooting.

154
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,900
Just keep shooting.

155
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,760
Oh, they're coming in.

156
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


157
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


158
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


159
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


160
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


161
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


162
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


163
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


164
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


165
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


166
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


167
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


168
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


169
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:23,760


170
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,280
See, just like your job back at home, ain't it, boy?

171
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,660
Yep.

172
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,340
You just can't get away.

173
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,160
You can't get away from them tics, my friends.

174
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,260
So join them.

175
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,120
My mother never answered one of my prayers.

176
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,300
I made obeisances.

177
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,540
Well, you paid Obias and today, but did you pay money?

178
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,880
Actual cash, green, and gravel.

179
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,060
Think about it, boys.

180
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,140
Don't wait till everyone in your neighborhood's got the bomb.

181
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,980
Nuke them.

182
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,740
Now at Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse.

183
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,680
Hi, friends.

184
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,200
I'm Hiroshima Schwartz of Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse,

185
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,320
home of the Mini-Mag, the Pocket Thunder,

186
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,760
the baby neutrino that leaves their apartments intact,

187
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,980
and many other fine, low-range, low-rad nukes.

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,760
These teeny-tiny warheads actually fit in your wallets.

189
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,260
You can buy them at the

190
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,880
And what's on special this week at Hiroshima Schwartz?

191
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,660
It's the giant X-Day Drill Sale.

192
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,700
Now until the wee-wee hours of July 6, 1996,

193
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,860
we are literally giving away tons and tons of useless and useful weapons.

194
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,340
It's the Werner Von Braumeister Party Special

195
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,760
that blows away 50 party pinks at a time, leaving the party intact.

196
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,960
Disguised as a four-gallon keg, that first draft really packs a wallop.

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,760
But for paid sub-GT,

198
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,240
it's the smart prairie squid face-seeking special.

199
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,540
I'm sorry, I always get that wrong.

200
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,980
It reads your mind and literally knows where to send the warby.

201
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,040
Finally, now till X-Day, bloodier than any golf pro,

202
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,320
it's the exploding head of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

203
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,240
When the pipe lights, it's armed.

204
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,100
When launched, it zaps up to 100.

205
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,320
That's 100 useless bobbies at a time.

206
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,040
Friends, don't wait till it's too late.

207
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,640
Everyone will soon have the bomb.

208
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,660
Nuke them now, from now till X-Day and beyond.

209
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,940
We are literally...

210
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,080
Blowing off the competition!

211
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,380
Hiroshima...

212
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,860
Hiroshima Schwartz's X-Day End of the World Sale.

213
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,700
Till a mob sent you and received 23% off.

214
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,520
Batteries 92.

215
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,420
Some assembly required.

216
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,600
You know, I've been eating alien smegma pie for almost 50 years.

217
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,660
Since those first shoster crashes near Rosberg.

218
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,580
Well, my sons grew up on it.

219
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,360
His sons too.

220
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,300
Here in Wilburville, it's...

221
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,880
Wilburville, it's as natural as pie.

222
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,300
But many folks don't know about alien smegma pie.

223
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,220
Things kind of changed since we landed on the moon.

224
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,120
Some things, we didn't even go.

225
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,300
Some folks believe in things called graze.

226
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Gramps, did you eat your pie today?

227
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,940
It's my daughter, always worrying.

228
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,740
Hey Gramps, when are we gonna go to the nude dancer's and worry in a massage parlor?

229
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:21,980
Phew.

230
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,700
And that grandson of mine always keeps me running.

231
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,020
Then, forget our little appointment.

232
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,840
Oh, nice and tidy.

233
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,940
I've been staying in a sack with Grandma for a long time, thanks to alien smegma pie.

234
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,660
All I know is alien smegma pie is made of a cheesy wax from alien genitalia.

235
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,920
It's made me sexually active again.

236
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,120
And it tastes great.

237
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,340
That's all I know.

238
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,480
Building a new race in this life is hard.

239
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,960
And nothing gets easier.

240
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,940
Because it is hard as alien smegma pie.

241
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,120
Alien smegma pie, the taste that's out of this world.

242
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,760
Alien smegma pie, the taste that's out of this world.

243
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,460
Bob loves me and I love Bob.

244
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,320
He hates you.

245
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,860
He hates you.

246
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,560
I love Bob and Bob loves me.

247
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,740
No, he hates you, Dave.

248
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,880
He hates you.

249
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,820
Bob hates you.

250
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,000
J.R. Bob Dobbs has answered all of my prayers.

251
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,860
He even told me go and fling myself down the stairs.

252
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,540
I did it on a lot, but now I'm glad.

253
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,740
Bob loves me and I love Bob.

254
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,460
He hates you.

255
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,380
You may love Bob, but Bob hates you, Dave.

256
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,640
He makes you fling yourself down the stairs for fun.

257
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,600
I love Bob and Bob loves me.

258
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,940
We're sweet and slimy just like little bees on a tree.

259
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,780
He calls me on Valentine's Day and I'm sending flowers and chocolate.

260
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,040
And he loves me anyway.

261
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,800
I said it.

262
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,780
Bob loves me and I love Bob.

263
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,100
He hates you, Dave.

264
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,620
What could be more pure?

265
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,300
It's the purest form of love anyone could imagine.

266
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,800
He answers all my letters.

267
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,180
He calls me up and leaves messages.

268
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,880
He's on my phone.

269
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,060
He's always with me.

270
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,140
He's always with me.

271
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,900
The computer does all of that, Dave.

272
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,840
He hates you and I love Bob.

273
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,740
Don't be a sucker.

274
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,100
J.R. Bob Dobbs, I love Bob.

275
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,760
Bob loves everyone except you, Dave.

276
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,640
He loves me and I love Bob.

277
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:44,360
Because you were so stupid as to believe him when he said he loved you that first time.

278
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,700
He tells that to all the people.

279
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:46,980
He's a good boy.

280
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,480
He believes in you.

281
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,440
Bob loves me.

282
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,640
It's not a torture catapult.

283
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,640
It's pure and beautiful and shivering.

284
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,220
Bob loves me.

285
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,820
Stop.

286
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,340
Stop.

287
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,840
Stop.

288
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,100
Stop.

289
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,320
You don't love me.

290
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,800
This is what Bob meant when he said, pull the wool over your own eyes.

291
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,740
I can't see anything.

292
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,940
Oh, I'm going blind.

293
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,500
I'm going blind.

294
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,300
But you can still see Bob in your mind's eye, can't you, Dave?

295
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,600
My mind.

296
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
You never stop seeing Bob.

297
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,680


298
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,680


299
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,680


300
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,680


301
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,680


302
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,940
You never stop seeing Bob in your mind's eye, such as it is.

303
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,540
My mind?

304
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,480
What there is of it.

305
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,180
What?

306
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,620
What?

307
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,540
Your mind.

308
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,780
Your mind is no longer your friend.

309
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,240
I'm a physical person.

310
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,200
I'm in love.

311
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,920
I'm in lust.

312
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,100
I'm in love with Bob and I don't care what you say.

313
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,860
I love Bob and Bob loves me.

314
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,380
Bob does love a fool.

315
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,360
That's true.

316
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:46,520
Bob loves the fools of this world and truly the king of fools is lonesome.

317
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:46,660
I love Bob.

318
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:46,660


319
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:46,660


320
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:46,660


321
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:46,660


322
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:46,660


323
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:46,660


324
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:46,660


325
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:46,660


326
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:46,660


327
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:46,660


328
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,380
He's like Power Cow Boy Dave.

329
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,860
Now performing the greatest guitar solo in the universe.

330
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,220
Rock out, baby.

331
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,720
I'm playing Dave.

332
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,500
You know I don't hear the music.

333
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,200
But, oh, thank you.

334
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,840
I can't hear me.

335
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,420
No.

336
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,020
What do you mean?

337
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,360
Which one?

338
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,440
I thought that was all on streams.

339
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,800
And you see, friends, you'll see how the love of Bob has freed Dave

340
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,640
from that ponderous nightmare.

341
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:16,640


342
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:16,640


343
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,460
real life around him.

344
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,740
He pays no attention to

345
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,940
what other people might think of him.

346
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
Sure, they think he's a

347
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,960
fool, an idiot, a bad person.

348
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,660
He's like a half-janger.

349
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,040
I'm blue value.

350
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,440
Watch him. He's happy.

351
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,780
You can hear the simple

352
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,860
happiness in his voice.

353
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,640
He's a form of existence.

354
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,660
I can't express how happy I am

355
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
when I think about it.

356
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,580
Don't think about it. You won't be so

357
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,840
happy if you stop and think about it.

358
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,600
Now, will you, Dave?

359
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,360
Why are my pants all wet and what's wrong with me?

360
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,640
How come I can't close

361
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,660
my mouth or open my eyes?

362
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,660
Why doesn't Bob ever call

363
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,060
a writer, answer my letters,

364
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,820
or leave anything on my

365
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,660
message machine?

366
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,960
You're not losing your faith

367
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,700
now, are you, Dave? That would be a

368
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,580
great sin, a grievous sin

369
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,120
indeed.

370
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,880
To lose one's faith.

371
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,680
To lose one's faith in Bob.

372
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,880
He has no faith in Bob.

373
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,380
Bob has no faith. He has no faith.

374
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,280
Meaning he only has a head.

375
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,080
He cannot have a faith in a head.

376
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,100
It's what the god Janus

377
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,360
had two faces on his head.

378
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,820
Neither one of them were looking at the same thing

379
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,540
at the same time.

380
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,120
And Bob can see you out of each one of those

381
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,680
dots on his face like

382
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,760
multifaceted eyes of the mighty

383
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,520
insect.

384
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,620
The mightiest insect.

385
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,700
Boing, boing, boing.

386
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,440
The mightiest insect

387
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,660
is the Dobson fly.

388
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,780
A tiny pea-like

389
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,560
into a

390
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,420
magnificent, magnificent

391
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,780
brain.

392
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,880
The sucking bugs

393
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,520
of the

394
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,480
amazing northern Ohio

395
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,380
area include

396
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,860
among the order

397
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,540
Hemptera. I said

398
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,160
the order Hemptera.

399
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,540
The sucking bugs.

400
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,440
The bugs who suck things

401
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,380
through pipes.

402
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,960
Such as the water scorpion.

403
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,380
And the rantrofusia.

404
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,140
And the giant

405
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,140
water bug. Did you ever see that movie?

406
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,480
The giant water bug?

407
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,860
That was great. The giant water boatman

408
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,680
was the sequel.

409
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,220
These are lovely and interesting

410
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,860
insects of the northern Ohio

411
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,000
swamp areas.

412
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,320
But aside from

413
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,080
the pleasant

414
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,020
happy-go-lucky order Hemptera,

415
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,200
one also finds

416
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,340
the order Neuroptera,

417
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,200
which includes

418
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,500
in the sinister

419
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,400
family Corridale

420
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,300
Day. Do you hear

421
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,540
the significance of that? Corridale

422
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,900
Day?

423
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,780
Salvador Dolly Day?

424
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,260
We find a creature, yes, a

425
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,780
living actual bug

426
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,240
of the northern Ohio swamp area.

427
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,120
It's called the Dobson fly.

428
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,540
The Dobson fly?

429
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,080
The Dobson fly, which is, you can go

430
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,520
see the Dobson fly, which is, you can go see the Dobson fly.

431
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,320
It's a stuffed mounted example

432
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
of this hideous, vicious beast

433
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,540
in the Cleveland Natural History Museum.

434
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,040
The Dobson fly,

435
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,220
while surrounded

436
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,760
by lovely butterflies

437
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,580
and not too alien-looking dragonflies,

438
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,080
you'll notice that the

439
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,400
Dobson fly has the head

440
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,180
of a vicious red

441
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,300
ant with hideous

442
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,660
clicking mandibles

443
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,360
and the body, a body

444
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,280
that resembles the tail of a

445
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,260
rattlesnake.

446
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,980
Horrible flapping

447
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,240
leathery wings.

448
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,960
Yes, the Dobson fly.

449
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,200
This is not

450
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,660
some biological

451
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,920
freak that we're making up. I'm afraid

452
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,940
there are thousands of Dobson fly

453
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,180
larvae. Now, they are

454
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,120
in their season, their 50-year season.

455
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,780
It was in the 40s.

456
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,100
In the 1940s was the

457
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,180
last time the Dobson fly cycle

458
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,320
reached its peak.

459
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,440
And thousands died.

460
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,980
As these pincher-like beaks of billions

461
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,340
of Dobson flies

462
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,100
attacked the suburbs

463
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,960
of Cleveland.

464
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,620
Oh, the days of Velikovsky.

465
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,980
I thought it was Wassily Kambusky.

466
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,780
And every time you

467
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,500
swatted a Dobson fly,

468
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,900
a million eggs would squirt

469
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,420
out of its ruptured abdomen.

470
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,700
Each egg

471
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,800
hatching into another million

472
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,100
Dobson flies.

473
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,280
And each time you tried to squash

474
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,300
one of those, it would

475
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,560
hatch another million.

476
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,400
Evolution has no plan.

477
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,140
You see, friends, man

478
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,020
likes to think himself

479
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,120
the grandest thing in all of

480
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,280
God's great creation. But indeed,

481
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,380
no, it is the great

482
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,700
order of the insectoride.

483
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,440
The great brain

484
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,200
of all collective insect

485
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,320
hives and tribes is

486
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,180
a billion times smarter than

487
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,720
any single ego-centered

488
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,760
human brain.

489
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,280
Certainly,

490
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:13,660
certainly,

491
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,920
one Dobson fly or one

492
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,320
tick may possess

493
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,120
a rudimentary brain,

494
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,380
but they can communicate by radio

495
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,600
with each other. And the millions

496
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,280
of each species, each

497
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,480
forms a great brain of that species.

498
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,000
And those brains

499
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,840
get together to form brains.

500
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,000
And let's face it, you're outsmarted,

501
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,640
Mr. Earth Boy, Mr. Human,

502
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,740
Mr. Two-Legged, Mr. Tool-Using

503
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,640
Primate, Mr. Thinks-He's-So-Big-Time-Smarty-Pants.

504
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,960
But you know, if you

505
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,880
took that human back into

506
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,720
the early Devonian

507
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,020
period, even here in the

508
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,680
lovely northern Ohio

509
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,900
area, you would find that

510
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,640
there was no Devo.

511
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,900
No Devo?

512
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,800
No Devo. There was, but

513
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,760
because there was a slimy ocean

514
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,780
covering the northern Ohio

515
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,780
plains. A filthy,

516
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,160
sewer-like,

517
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,960
shallow, but murky, muddy,

518
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,280
disgusting,

519
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,960
smelly ocean.

520
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,900
And in the

521
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,420
depths of these foul,

522
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,880
murky puddles, there

523
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,980
grew such creatures

524
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,600
as the

525
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,880
Dunkelosteus.

526
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,180
Yes, the Dunkelosteus.

527
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,980
And friends, I hate to tell you this,

528
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,000
but there is a, it's true that

529
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,880
there was an ancient plant

530
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,740
discovered, fossil

531
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,900
of this plant, and they named it,

532
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,600
yes, the Cleveland

533
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,840
Dodendron

534
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:43,940
Ohioensis.

535
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,940
4-4-1-1-0-E-S.

536
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,480
No, seriously, the Cleveland

537
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,340
Dendrodron

538
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,000
Ohioensis.

539
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,640
That was

540
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,120
merely, however, just a tube-like

541
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,740
plant with teeth and

542
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,840
thousands of eyes.

543
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,060
From Club Moss.

544
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,600
I mean, Club Moss was a great place back then.

545
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,860
I saw Devo at Club Moss in the Devonian

546
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:07,980
period.

547
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,460
Einstein Secret Orchestra, ESO Radio,

548
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,180
Boys and Girls, Ivan Stang,

549
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,020
in the house.

550
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,020
Now, as usual,

551
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
speaking of the

552
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,100
all themes of the insect kingdom,

553
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,840
we notice that through these

554
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,540
over-exaggerated sense of smell

555
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,540
that they also keep in a form

556
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,540
of ESP, extrasensory

557
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,240
contact with each and every

558
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,380
other member of their community.

559
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,380
And as we notice here, if I

560
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,020
expose one of these insects

561
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,460
to this molasses, all of the rest

562
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,580
of the insects will begin to come

563
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,240
within the air, even if they have been

564
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,600
exposed, or have been held

565
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,100
in this container, and

566
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,220
are incapable of actually smelling

567
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,420
the molasses. As soon as they're

568
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,020
released, they all begin exploding

569
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,620
because some of them have distillate charges

570
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,040
in the back of the vacuum.

571
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,980
Some of them have even approached

572
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,300
300 feet in length,

573
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,240
and some of them are well

574
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,140
over 2,000 pounds.

575
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,360
And I see them in my

576
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,880
dreams.

577
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,560
I keep on thinking of what's going on.

578
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,940
One of them was with Harry

579
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,460
that night when they went over

580
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,080
the edge.

581
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,720
These phobias can be

582
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,180
confident.

583
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,640
No, but those insects

584
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,580
were there the night

585
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,360
Harry went over the edge.

586
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,500
And how can we surmise that from this

587
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,420
incident, the head of J.R. Bob

588
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,220
Dobbs did emerge into the

589
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,560
lustrous as a numinous being?

590
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,380
I don't know, but you can

591
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,520
find out by coming to the X-Day

592
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,460
Drill in Brushwood,

00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,560
every year from now to X-Day,

596
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,540
that's right Ivan, that's right.

597
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,140
Remember to call for free

598
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,880
information about the amazing

599
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,560
X-Day Drill. Yes, it's like

600
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
the legendary Dockstock

601
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,440
Gala. That's right Ivan, that's right Ivan.

602
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,740
You'll see the most

603
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,540
hated preachers of the subgenius

604
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,740
church. You'll camp out on a lovely,

605
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,260
fully developed campground surrounded by

606
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,440
geeks you'd rather not ever spend much time with.

607
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:39,560
by geeks you'd rather not ever spend much time with.

608
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:39,560


609
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,920
But by God, you'll know more about the church of the subgenius

610
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,560
because you'll be able to see the church of the subgenius.

611
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,520
Because friends, you will have practiced

612
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,620
for that fatal day,

613
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,500
that glorious day,

614
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,700
X-Day. Yes, only two years

615
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,200
from now in 1998, the

616
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,460
sex goddesses from

617
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,580
Planet X shall come.

618
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,460
And rupture up the

619
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,040
news paying fully

620
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
Dobbs approved subgenius

621
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,300
ministers. That's right Ivan. All

622
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,480
4,000 of us, and destroy

623
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,740
the rest of the planet. That's right Ivan.

624
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,220
Well, not destroy it, but

625
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,300
turn it back into the stinking swamp.

626
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:13,560


627
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:13,560


628
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,240
filth that it was before the filthy humans came along

629
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,400
and muddied everything up. But friends, you can come along and muddy everything up.

630
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,900
You can wallow in the filth.

631
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,760
You can dance all night.

632
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,980
You can pull your clothes off and county law doesn't care.

633
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,360
Because we are having the first

634
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,760
X-Day drill this July 5th

635
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,620

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,800
Sunday! Sunday!

637
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,120
You'll see the pill.

638
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,180
You'll see the bleeding head

639
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,620
of Arnold Palmer.

640
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,540
It lives. It bleeds.

641
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,380
It bleeds for you.

642
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,700
If you don't vomit your money back.

643
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,640
Friends, you will see things

644
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,040
you wouldn't dare believe.

645
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,020
Things you never wanted to believe and

646
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,860
things you wish you never saw.

647
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,340
That's right Ivan. Yetis will be

648
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,820
copulating in the bushes.

649
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,540

650
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,560
from the little pond.

651
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,160
The crazed

652
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,320
pagan drummers will drum all night long

653
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,460
and keep you from sleeping.

654
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,100
Mosquitoes the size of Dobson's

655
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,400
flies will devour you, but you aren't

656
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:13,920
going to care.

657
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,140
You won't care because you spent your money

658
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,120
and came to the X-Day drill.

659
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,180

Tossing you around

680
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,460
It's like a giant funhouse

681
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,460
Yes, it's insane, it's crazy

682
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,600

Or will you be down in the room?

752
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,640
You can hold up anything you want.

753
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,500
Will you be burning?

754
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,980
In this thing?

755
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,020
It's the perfect pleasure.

756
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,960
Perfect pain.

757
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,340
Which will it be?

758
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,820
It's up to you to choose.

759
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,200
Bob gives you free will.

760
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,580
But you can't feel anything until you sign on the dotted line.

761
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,580
And the next day is coming, so you better move fast, because where will you be on next day?

762
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,040
I've got plenty of time to spend my $30 on that bomb ministership.

763
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,520
I've got plenty of time.

764
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,580
That's two more years for next day.

765
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,140
Why am I in any kind of hurry?

766
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,040
There couldn't possibly have been some kind of a misprint in the book of the subgenius.

767
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:21,520
I mean, just because that first edition from McGraw-Hill actually did say that next day was on July 5th, 1996.

768
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,140
Well, they changed it after that.

769
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,440
I'm sure that, I mean, it looked like a mistake.

770
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,220
Probably it was a mistake.

771
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,080
I don't think I really have to spend that $30 quite yet.

772
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,760
Because that probably was just, it's probably not that the world's going to end.

773
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,060
In this year, 1996.

774
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,540
Probably not.

775
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,500
I could probably afford to take that risk.

776
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,260
I mean, I've got that $30.

777
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,420
That's not a problem.

778
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,300
But there's this Hootie and the Blowfish CD I wanted to get.

779
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:57,720
And, well, you know, I wanted to go to this movie about water spouts.

780
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,480
And, well, I just, I just, you know, I mean, Bob will wait on me.

781
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,480
I mean, Bob's a patient man.

782
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,500
He ain't a wrathful God now, is he?

783
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,900
I've heard Bob will love the subgeniuses even if they never spin anymore.

784
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,240
A patient man? A patient man?

785
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,120
Man, he ain't no patient.

786
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,280
Bob is the doctor.

787
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,880
He ain't no patient man.

788
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:29,700
Bob is the surgeon who will excise the filthy, rotting tumor that is America.

789
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,420
That is modern America today.

790
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,120
Yes.

791
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:44,200
My fellow rebellious citizens and untaxed payers and militia members, all the citizens of courts, we must come together.

792
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,500
We must come together.

793
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,300
Quick, they're coming.

794
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,800
They're trying to stop me from speaking.

795
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:55,260
All of us religious nuts and crazy, bright-winged maniacs, we must band together against the man because, oh, wait, they're coming.

796
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,160
I've got to get my message out.

797
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,120
The last true hope is 55603.

798
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,720
Call 55603.

799
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,400
Here they come.

800
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:06,820
No, no.

801
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,760
I'm not going to tell you how it's going to be.

802
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,360
I won't give your love to me.

803
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,120
You're not allowed.

804
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,640
You're not allowed.

805
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:31,820


806
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,860
I'm going to go down one day.

807
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm going to tell you nothing at all.

808
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,980
I won't tell you nothing at all.

809
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,260
Hey!

810
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,800
Hey!

811
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:03,800


812
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:03,800


813
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,380
Oh.

814
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,440
Hey!

815
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,280
Oh.

816
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,560
I got a cold crusade for a neck tie.

817
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,540
I got me a church by the roadside.

818
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,280
I laid out a rattlesnake hide

819
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,500
Bob is gonna ask you

820
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,700
Who do you love?

821
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,460
Bob is gonna ask you

822
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,660
Who do you love?

823
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,540
Who do you love?

824
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,620
Who do you love?

825
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,100
Who do you love?

826
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,440
Oh, I tried to look at what the darkness was

827
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,420
You love me, got me around

828
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:13,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

829
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

830
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

831
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

832
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,740
Hey!

833
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:31,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh anywhere

834
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,340
I'm not that invite e

835
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,860
Not that I don't care

836
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:40,860


837
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,260
Oh, fot the time I was

838
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,680
But, it's just like

839
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:42,920
That I never saw

840
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,560
You following me

841
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,440
Oh, I who know

842
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,960
Obased on each other

843
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,340
You know I'm story

844
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,720
I fade away, I fade away, I fade away.

845
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,900
Bob's love fades like one missing dewdrop.

846
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,600
It's gone, man.

847
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,580
He hates you.

848
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,340
He hates you, man.

849
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:06,800
Give it up.

850
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,340
Give it up.

851
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,520
He don't love you, man.

852
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,700
Bob never loved you in your whole life, man.

853
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,260
He don't care one thing about you, dude.

854
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,440
You got to get it right, brother.

855
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,740
Your head's screwed on the wrong man.

856
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,860
Bob don't love you.

857
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,000
He hates you, man.

858
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,240
You understand the meaning of the word?

859
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,160
He hates you.

860
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,320
Ask yourself, are you worthy?

861
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,560
Are you really even worthy of his hate?

862
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,120
To me?

863
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,940
Am I worthy of Bob's hate?

864
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,980
Of course I'm worthy of Bob's hate.

865
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,200
Everybody hates me.

866
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,520
I'm one of the most hated men ever to walk the earth.

867
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,980
There's no reason why I dare on Bob Dobbs, the old hate master.

868
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,840
He wouldn't want to give me a few stabs at the old pole and eyeball.

869
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,720
I'm afraid you flatter yourself, Dave.

870
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,680
It's a form of love, Dave.

871
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,940
He beats you up because he loves you.

872
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,520
It's like a heavy thing.

873
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,100
You know, it's like a tough love.

874
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,720
You know what I mean?

875
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,500
Watch your pulse with that.

876
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,200
But you know, Dobbs did love Dave.

877
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,460
And there have always been Daves.

878
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:09,520
Yes, for thousands, even millions and millions of years, there have been Daves.

879
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,300
Lonesome cowboy Daves.

880
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,120
Generally ignored by science for obvious reasons.

881
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:22,140
But this month only in Cleveland Natural History Museum, there is, in fact, a new one.

882
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,140


883
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,140


884
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,140


885
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,140


886
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,140


887
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,120
A display.

888
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,760
A rather large exhibit called Cleveland Before Bob.

889
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:35,860
In which one may actually see fossils of the ancient peoples.

890
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,760
The precursors to the modern day.

891
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,940
The day that we unfortunately know now.

892
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:50,460
There have been, for instance, there's quite a wonderful set of artifacts that were raised up from the P-Dog site.

893
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,620
There.

894
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,900
That prove that even the early Davonians were tool using.

895
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,840
Not quite at the level of primates.

896
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,820
We're getting a finger all the way up here.

897
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:08,700
They had an unusual, there were an unusually large number of stone pot shards.

898
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:14,120
As well as, oddly enough, many pot sherds found at this dig.

899
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,300
Obviously pots were used, overused, probably.

900
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:21,300
Abused.

901
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,140
The abused, yes.

902
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,960
The abused pots.

903
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,620
They were broken all over the place.

904
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,520
Old clones.

905
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:32,140
However, we do know that the ancient Daves had a sex life of some kind.

906
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,340
As we can see.

907
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:41,520
I see in this a fairly well honed fluted point.

908
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,320
Carved from stone.

909
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,980
And notice here.

910
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,680
The wooden foreshaft.

911
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,540
One dot.

912
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,280
Of the ancient Daves.

913
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,280
One dot sounds like some huge.

914
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,540
Contained quite a wide groove.

915
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,320
So you could take that wooden foreshaft.

916
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,660
The ancient Dave, them old Dave men.

917
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:05,460
The old Dave men could take that wooden foreshaft with such a wide groove.

918
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
And the fluted point of it.

919
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,020
See now nowadays, modern days, it's not even made of wood.

920
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,440
It's just limp like an old Dosh rag, wash rag.

921
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,980
It's still got the fluted point.

922
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,260
But, you know, it ain't nearly as sharp as they used to.

923
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:26,600
Because the ancient, strangely enough, the Neanderthal Daves actually had a larger cranial capacity.

924
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,660
Than the modern homo-davian.

925
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,200
You see here, slide three.

926
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,700
Ugly creature.

927
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,640
But, yet, strangely enough, still our ancestors.

928
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,840
Well, yours maybe.

929
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,140
Friends, we poised on edge of evolution.

930
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,080
As we stand together here today.

931
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,040
A vast historic moment.

932
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,900
With brain much bigger.

933
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,400
And less to follow.

934
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,340
Must be one in the unknown to follow.

935
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,660
But even with its larger brain.

936
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,700
The ancient Dave men were able to build nothing but crude pipes.

937
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,980
There are thousands of varieties of pipes.

938
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,740
Shattered pipes found in the ancient settlement.

939
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:16,240
In which they smoked what, as far as we can tell, wild plant materials.

940
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,940
Including dogwood.

941
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,180
The bark of the dogwood.

942
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,480
Which was quite strong.

943
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,140
Quite a bit stronger than the bite of the dogwood.

944
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,040
Although it did have a good bite to it.

945
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,760
If he made you a dog stick, dogwood stick.

946
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,360
Rolled you up, run up some dogwood.

947
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,060
That does have a bite to it.

948
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,460
Has a hell of a bite to it.

949
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,960
Man, brain too big to do.

950
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,460
Come on dogwood.

951
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,000
However, the ancient Dave men had a natural enemy.

952
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,940
The mammothous primigenius.

953
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,840
Oh my god, here they come.

954
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,940
The primigenius, which is Greek for primitive subgenius.

955
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,980
I run a group far more intelligent than the modern subgenius.

956
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,100
I want to play all the old records.

957
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,660
As proved by the fact that you're listening to this show at all right now.

958
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,340
I'm gonna smoke all the props.

959
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,960
Here they come.

960
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,720
Unfortunately, the largest display in the museum showing the Dave men.

961
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,860
Is the items of unknown function.

962
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,740
A carefully carved and intricate.

963
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,860
Decorated bone and ivory fragments.

964
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,820
Which, the uses of which have yet to be discovered.

965
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,920
They seem to be senseless, randomly created.

966
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:37,080
Perhaps some scientists suspect they may have been used to dislodge unwanted objects from obscure body parts.

967
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,820
And orifices.

968
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:43,520
The early Dave men possessed more orifices than the modern Dave.

969
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,800
And made copious use of them.

970
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,780
Since the era of the Father Man miles down.

971
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,340
That is correct, why not.

972
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,960
Because if I know, something special about that field in question.

973
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,460
I don't know what he did there.

974
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,880
Or everything it consists...

975
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,040
Ofimmer will be more or less important than all either.

976
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,060
But there have been more orifices available, too.

977
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:03,740
And moth effoney, of which two have been gloves.

978
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,200
It could be tasteful feral.

979
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,200


980
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,200


981
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:14,800
Whether it be aIchád for black陳 Facebook and JIvehVSMS.

982
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,200
The dames buried their dead.

983
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,260
Infant dames, fetus skeletons have been found,

984
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:30,400
which show the signs of having been ritually slaughtered by their parents for the delicacy.

985
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:37,140
The one item of diet that we know that the ancient dave men enjoyed was fetus nads.

986
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,480
We don't quite know how to put that, but certainly a serious delicacy.

987
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:50,360
Those things would go for $14.95 an ounce at least nowadays, you know, down at the Piggly Wiggly.

988
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,020
You can't hardly get fetus nads.

989
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,960
But the ancient dave men were able to harvest these from their...

990
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,300
Time, time now. Time to go out and harvest.

991
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,980
And harvest? What was it we were harvesting?

992
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,180
This was during the dawn of agriculture.

993
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:11,140
And these ancient dave men were, in fact, what we call...

994
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,040
Skull farmers.

995
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,280
Ah, there they are. Three hundred of them.

996
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Just waiting to be locked.

997
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,340
The women stay in the campground, mating with the men from rival tribes,

998
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:34,760
as the daves were out in the fields harvesting the skulls and the heads.

999
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,500
They tried to grow heads, but generally they were sold.

1000
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,460
It's such bad news.

1001
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,380
They told the skilled farmers that they were able to only grow skulls,

1002
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,200
or else they'd forget to pluck their heads until they become skulls.

1003
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,500
Ah, it is white. It is gleaming. It is ready to lop.

1004
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,300
Ah, now what do we do afterwards?

1005
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,940
We drink, we drink, we carve out the skull and we drink.

1006
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:03,860
And boy, these are big skulls, because we have such big brains, but hard to drink heads.

1007
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,720
In a vain attempt to gain the intelligence of the mighty mammoth,

1008
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,460
the dave would drink the brains of the mammoth.

1009
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:22,020
To gain the courage of the mighty, uh, cow, and its craftiness and speed,

1010
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,640
the ancient dave men would drink the brains of the cows,

1011
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,720
or rather suck them up through crude stone pipes.

1012
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,600
Now remember, son, when you drink cow, you're imbued with all power of cow.

1013
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,140
Strength, beauty, speed, fast, quick, small, tiny, little.

1014
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,420
Ah, shut up.

1015
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,160
This is what is known as sympathetic magic.

1016
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:52,400
Obviously, today, in today's modern world, we know better than to fall for simple superstitions.

1017
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,700
I drank that genius's urine just for a taste of brilliance.

1018
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,480
That's true. There is the one exception.

1019
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,460
Sympathetic magic does still work in the Church of the Subgenius.

1020
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,800
If you will but drink of the fluids of fog, you will gain...

1021
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,440
The wisdom of Bob.

1022
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,360
His, his great intellectual acuity will be yours.

1023
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,360
And you all know how smart Bob is.

1024
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,900
He's from the Church of the Subgum Guys at Subgenius.

1025
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,200
They're like all geniuses or something, right?

1026
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,580
Isn't that what they're trying to say or something?

1027
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,060
And, and Bob's this smart guy.

1028
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:37,240
And so if you kill Bob and drink of him, it is an eat of his body, then you'll be as smart.

1029
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,160
Nay! Nay, it's a lie, friends.

1030
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:39,820
You can Bob.

1031
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,080
From the land of the Ambulance.

1032
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,360
Bob is not smart nor, nor intelligent, but only lucky.

1033
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:53,860
So you don't drink of his brain, you drink of his other fluids until you have gained some of his luck.

1034
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,360
Drink his tiny fluids for good luck.

1035
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,300
Wear it on your head for good luck.

1036
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,520
His armpits sweat.

1037
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,800
His armpits sweat on fat, too.

1038
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,860
If you can stand in front of Bob when he sneezes, you will be able to gain the viruses of Bob.

1039
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,420
He knew this is most precious.

1040
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,780
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1041
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,860
If you clean up Bob's bathroom after he is finished in there, and I think you know what I mean.

1042
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,180
Hey, I just came to clean up.

1043
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,520
No, no, I wouldn't want to do anything like that.

1044
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,480
Just trying to fix the plumbing.

1045
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,500
You will gain his sales acumen.

1046
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,380
I will own the plumbing business around the rest of the world.

1047
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,380
I will control the plumbing enterprise of the planet.

1048
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,000
It's true, folks.

1049
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,080
You, too, could be just like the modern lonesome cowboy Dave.

1050
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,480
This paragon of manhood and manly beauty.

1051
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:53,060
This confident and stalwart stud and cool guy.

1052
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,440
All you have to do is to know Dave is to know Bob.

1053
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:03,860
And to know Bob, you merely must call the secret number.

1054
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,920
Yes, this is a secret.

1055
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,400
Don't tell anybody. Turn your radio down. Get your pencil out.

1056
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,000
Call this number.

1057
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,560
60338.

1058
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,780
Go ahead, kids. Give it a try.

1059
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,840
What if you got to lose a little time, maybe?

1060
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,900
You did sign the application.

1061
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:33,080
Kids, don't forget to get your special Bob Dom's decoder ring that explodes in your face for only $49.95.

1062
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:33,900
Call now.

1063
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:47,060
And get a nice, shining XS watch that works.

1064
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,420
Just listen to Bob's recital as he decides to grab Bob and onions in a minute.

1065
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,240
Give it a try.

1066
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,880
Yeah, I will, dad.

1067
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,960
I don't care if it's get to the bottom in 10 minutes.

1068
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,100
I'm going to get the change of my life everything to enter Jim's north-west and he is setting a finger finger.

1069
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,880
I'll give Brady the ball, and give Bob the ball, my child.

1070
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:05,900
Hey, I want the speeding-up double to me!

1071
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:05,900


1072
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,580
Baby, is it you?

1073
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,700
As a boy, I dream of angels

1074
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,160
As a boy, I dream of angels

1075
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,200
Little darling, tell me why

1076
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,080
I get so cold looking in your eyes

1077
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,360
Is it you?

1078
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,320
Baby, is it you?

1079
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,280
As a boy, I dream of angels

1080
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,700
As a boy, I dream of angels

1081
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:08,900
Baby, is it you?

1082
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,920
Little baby, leather in place

1083
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,360
Take a minute to outer space

1084
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,800
Is it you?

1085
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,780
Baby, is it you?

1086
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,760
As a boy, I dream of angels

1087
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,740
Baby, is it you?

1088
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,260
Baby, is it you?

1089
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,080
Henry?

1090
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,140
Yeah?

1091
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,300
Lou?

1092
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:13,720
Show me now, somewhere, somewhere, somehow is it

1093
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,040
Oh baby is it you

1094
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,240
I look for a dreamer angel

1095
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:35,540
I look for a dreamer angel

1096
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:45,120
I look for a dreamer angel

1097
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,860
Who speaks for Earth?

1098
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:04,840
Earth.

1099
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,540
Who smells for Earth?

1100
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,760
Who flies in the face of authority for Earth?

1101
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,880
Why is none of it in the webinars?

1102
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,520
Who's paying the rent on Earth?

1103
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,620
That's the question.

1104
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,960
Who's gonna take care of this bill?

1105
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,040
Who's paying?

1106
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,540
It's passed by the pretty piggy.

1107
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,040
Well.

1108
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,440
Who will stand for Earth?

1109
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,080
I don't know.

1110
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:29,700
Maybe me.

1111
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,540
Maybe you.

1112
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,140
Maybe nobody.

1113
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,620
Is that a dog?

1114
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:46,980
It's really the same song.

1115
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,280
No, really, down at the Cleveland Natural History Museum.

1116
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,800
Have you been down there lately, Dave?

1117
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,520
I had a dream I went there.

1118
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,860
No, no, I mean, did you know that they actually had the jawbone of a yeti?

1119
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,040
Who had the jawbone of a yeti?

1120
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,960
Your proud city.

1121
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,720
That's worth quite a lot of money.

1122
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:19,920
They call it gigantopithecus, which is, of course, a scientifically inaccurate name.

1123
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,200
It should be referred to as gigantanthropus.

1124
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,420
Gigantanthropus?

1125
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,220
It's more a primitive man than just merely some giant.

1126
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:26,220


1127
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,280
Gigantanthropus is an animal.

1128
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:27,720
Gigantopithecus.

1129
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,200
He's a misanthropist.

1130
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,700
An animal.

1131
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:31,860
An animalistic thing.

1132
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,880
But this is, yes, indeed, the jawbone of an ancient yeti.

1133
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,320
And how could you know such a thing?

1134
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,640
Well, it says so right there on the display.

1135
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,840
It's the jawbone of an ancient giant yeti?

1136
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,140
Yes.

1137
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,140
It is about a foot and a half long.

1138
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,520
Looks like it weighs about seven or eight pounds at least.

1139
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:49,540
You lie like dirt.

1140
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,980
No, I don't.

1141
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,260
There's a skeleton of a gorilla not far away.

1142
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,040
That's conceivable.

1143
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,200
It's a skeleton of a gorilla.

1144
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:56,200


1145
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:56,200


1146
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:56,200


1147
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:56,200


1148
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:56,820
It's a skeleton of a gorilla.

1149
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,100
It's a skeleton of a gorilla.

1150
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:57,140


1151
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:02,920
Even with its massive lower mandible, it is merely but less than half the size of the

1152
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,380
gigantanthropus, the prehistoric yeti.

1153
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,520
I would agree.

1154
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,720
We call it prehistoric.

1155
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:14,720
Of course, the yetis were keeping records long, 80 million years before humans knew

1156
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,020
how to pick their noses.

1157
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,080
Well, I would agree with a yeti.

1158
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,020
And it was a gigantopithecus.

1159
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,280
It broke his misanthropicus erectus.

1160
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,680
And she was cute too.

1161
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,500
She was awful hairy.

1162
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,180
She was beautiful.

1163
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:26,180


1164
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:26,180


1165
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:26,180


1166
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:26,180


1167
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:26,180


1168
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:26,180


1169
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,740
She was the hairiest woman I ever saw.

1170
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,280
But she was big, wasn't she?

1171
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,460
Yes, and there was something so fragrant about her feet.

1172
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:32,940
Musky.

1173
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,220
Musky, that's too old.

1174
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,960
Get a whiff of that yeti's.

1175
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,460
Max, Max, Max.

1176
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,280
Oh, yes, musky's a natural.

1177
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:40,540
Thanks, Alan.

1178
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,800
I don't know what I'm just thinking about.

1179
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,140
That makes you feel manly.

1180
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,060
Big old yeti girls.

1181
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:45,980
Yes, sir.

1182
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,040
Okay, keep off her leg.

1183
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,740
Are you man enough for the she yeti?

1184
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,700
Are you man enough for one of her legs?

1185
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,500
Are you a she yeti?

1186
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,160
Yes, sir.

1187
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1188
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1189
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1190
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1191
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1192
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1193
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,060
You could ride on that leg, boy.

1194
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:04,540
You could grab you a tight hold on that mane she's got growing down that leg and ride.

1195
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,200
I tried to ride her in my dreams.

1196
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,420
I tried to ride her off into the sunset singing my Yahoo final darn year song.

1197
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:17,040
But it seems to me every time I begin to mouth the love of young whatever you might

1198
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,380
name the lady, I seem to...

1199
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,220
She asked him her name and in a back room voice she said...

1200
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:23,540
Wanda.

1201
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:25,780
Wanda.

1202
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,140
Wanda.

1203
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1204
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1205
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1206
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1207
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1208
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1209
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1210
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1211
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1212
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1213
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1214
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1215
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1216
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1217
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1218
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1219
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1220
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1221
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


1222
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:27,380
Wanda?

1223
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:27,740
Wanda.

1224
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:27,740


1225
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:27,740


1226
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:27,740


1227
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:27,740


1228
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:27,740


1229
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:27,740


1230
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:27,740


1231
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:27,740


1232
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:27,740


1233
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:27,740


1234
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,980
The she yeti.

1235
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,100
Oh my god.

1236
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,900
Wanda of the jungle!

1237
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,640
Wanda of the Himalayas!

1238
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,700
When I took a walk around in the park, she held my hand, she crossed my wrist.

1239
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,360
I went out running and she caught me, just like that man!

1240
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,020
It ain't no fun when a woman can out run, he ain't tackling me at the same time.

1241
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,640
There I was laying on the ground in Central Park and birds twittering around and screaming

1242
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,040
in pain.

1243
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,960
And this huge, huge female yeti is here trying to have her way with me.

1244
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,120
Wanda does not even think about the time when she could run.

1245
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,840
Dallas. Deep

1246
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,780
Wanda. Wanda does

1247
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,620
sing. Behind

1248
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,240
the grill. Wanda.

1249
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,200
Behind

1250
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,320
Wanda's dream behind.

1251
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,580
Wanda likes schoolgirl

1252
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,900
uniforms. Yeah, man.

1253
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,940
Did you see the latest issue

1254
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,240
of Yeti? Big Yeti.

1255
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,840
I think it was Big Yeti, September

1256
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,360
B-Y-Y-S-A.

1257
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,300
Yeah, there was

1258
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,980
some spread you there. I couldn't believe.

1259
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,140
In fact, it was one of the largest magazines

1260
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,020
I ever bought. We had to get a guy

1261
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,080
who had, well, he had a Volvo wagon, and we

1262
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,260
loaded up three or four of them, and it took half an hour

1263
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,160
just to get them in the back. Oh, yeah, the fold

1264
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,000
out in the middle is like 30 yards

1265
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,160
long. Yeah, we was going to wallpaper that national

1266
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,860
over on the top of the hill there with

1267
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,260
oh, Mr. Repercussion

1268
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:41,840
had lips.

1269
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,620
Oh, those human

1270
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,960
stroke books might show some

1271
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,100
pink. But you won't be

1272
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,240
seeing no pink in Big Yeti

1273
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,460
magazine.

1274
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,040
It is kind of

1275
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,600
expensive. They're like $8.95.

1276
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,020
It's specialty material. And if you've

1277
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,300
seen the Yeti binaries

1278
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,200
on the news,

1279
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,020
on the internet,

1280
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,720
you can get you some. Boy, there's some

1281
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,200
pictures out there. It takes about

1282
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,220
30 days to download.

1283
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,780
They're so big.

1284
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,300
They're such big.

1285
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,700
Big Yeti.

1286
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,940
Come out, Harry.

1287
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,460
Because the

1288
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,660
true women of the Yeti

1289
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,340
race over the Big

1290
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,080
Old Harry.

1291
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,200
Oh, powerful.

1292
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,900
And they could pick us

1293
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,140
men up by our parts and

1294
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,160
swing us around their heads. And we

1295
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,300
loved it. Oh, it hurt. Yes, it

1296
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,660
hurt, but we loved it because

1297
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,240
they were disciplining us, you see.

1298
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,180
We had discipline in those days.

1299
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,660
The big women,

1300
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,760
the bigger and hairy

1301
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,900
women taught us discipline.

1302
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,300
And we thanked them for it.

1303
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,960
Yes, we got down on our knees and we

1304
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,920
worshipped them. We were polite

1305
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,940
to a woman in those days.

1306
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,820
And I languished in my

1307
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,380
dish. When we exploited a woman,

1308
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,200
we cleaned with respect for the woman.

1309
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,620
When we

1310
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,460
When we

1311
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,280
When we dissipated a race of

1312
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,020
gigantic Yetis,

1313
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,160
we did it out of respect

1314
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,240
and discipline.

1315
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,840
We did it on time.

1316
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,040
Not like these slackers of today.

1317
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,900
Yes, in the first moment.

1318
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,760
In the old days, the very

1319
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,720
Yeti women were on time.

1320
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,880
Always on time.

1321
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,160
The blood runs thin.

1322
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,560
They have fluoride in their blood.

1323
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,360
They are not like the Yetis of yesteryear.

1324
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,420
The yester-Yeti.

1325
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:42,180
But I must interrupt with this important message, friends, on how to get to the real X-Day in western New York State.

1326

Friends in the background, this is D.K. Jones,

1336

and this is the great instrumental

1337
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,140
Kurosaki, Christ Bob.
