1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
The Self-Genius Power of Slack

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,500
I don't care. I don't care!

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,980
Bob?

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:19,240
Well, dear friends, we're live on location in the studio again, in Amsterdam.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:26,380
And specifically, a lot of this show tonight, Hour of Slack number 975,

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,220
is taken from Radio Patepeu in Amsterdam,

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,200
a show done on Lord Yeti's show, done on November 23rd, 2004.

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,740
And we'll also hear some National Cynical Network material from Phineas Narco,

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,960
plus live recordings from the anti-American ranting,

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,620
and the defivals in London, Amsterdam, and Hamburg,

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,920
with Pope David Lee Black, Pope Mickey Finn, and others.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:04,740
Friends, we're also soaking in the wondrous collages of Mr. Fernandin and Elie Mer,

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,620
and we've got some old KPFA Self-Genius show recordings, this time with lies.

14
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,740
But first, Radio Patepeu.

15
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,220
You know, more people are killed by hippos every year than by car crashes.

16
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,140
You probably didn't know that, but it's a strange fact.

17
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,100
And more people are actually abducted by UFOs than are killed in airplane crashes.

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,960
That's a scientific fact.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,400
Another factoid brought to you by the Church of the Self-Genius.

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,940
Yes, I'm afraid that's the religious broadcast you're hearing this time.

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,940
I guess it could have been some fancier church.

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,780
Oh yeah, there's fancier.

23
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,140
I've noticed some of these old-fashioned churches around here have nice big buildings.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,720
Yes, they have some fancy buildings.

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,420
The cathedrals, some of them are hundreds of years old.

26
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,520
And we subgeniuses, what do we have?

27
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,120
The public trash can behind the McDonald's.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,280
But my friends, we'll preach on,

29
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,220
from that public trash can behind the McDonald's.

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,460
Giant trash can.

31
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,220
That is our temporary home here in Amsterdam.

32
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,000
We'll preach that we'll slap.

33
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,980
Because we don't need this fancy.

34
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,500
We don't need money for slack, no.

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,620
We need money to prove to Bob that we love him so that he won't punish us.

36
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,000
So, we ask you to give.

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,800
Give of your slack.

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,520
For now, that's all you have to do.

39
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,660
Give till it hurts.

40
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,160
Give till it hurts.

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,220
And that's a sexual act.

42
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,620
That's a sexual feeling, you know, when you let that money slide out of your hand.

43
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,280
It's like when you really let go, baby.

44
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,040
That's right.

45
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,760
Bob said,

46
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,680
Spend your money.

47
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,220
You do not buy from Bob.

48
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,680
Spend on Bob.

49
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,600
Splurge, splurge, splurge.

50
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,280
Spend on Bob.

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,120
Spend on Bob.

52
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,720
That's a romantic bit.

53
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,480
For the lovers out there.

54
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,760
In the prairies.

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,920
If there are any prairie squid lovers.

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:37,020
I understand that there's, the government is trying to make laws against the love of

57
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,380
land squid or land mollusk of any kind.

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,080
Even in a famously liberal Holland.

59
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,260
It's an interesting thing to see.

60
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,260


61
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,260


62
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,260


63
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,640
We hear talk of bestiality being outlawed.

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,980
I just can't believe what this world is coming to.

65
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,680
To be an American and hear Germans saying,

66
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,520
we're very worried about fascism in America.

67
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,460
So you think you're worried, buddy.

68
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,420
Three weeks ago, what was it, just two weeks ago,

69
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,840
they had that election, and we immediately left the country.

70
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,160
It's that simple.

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,680
They had the election, we woke up the next day,

72
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,160
Bush won, just as I thought, just as Bob predicted.

73
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,600
He said, Bob said, it's going to be a bummer, man.

74
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,200
He said that a long time ago, Bob did,

75
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,360
and that prophecy rings so true today.

76
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,340
That's by this, by these stripes, we know Bob is right.

77
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,800
He said, quote, it's going to be a bummer, man, unquote.

78
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,920
Now tell me that it did not come true.

79
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,180
Yeah, I'll show you a miracle.

80
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,500
If you don't believe that's real, then that's a miracle.

81
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,020
Really, what is the government's role?

82
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,640
You've told me several times what it shouldn't do.

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,640
How about national defense?

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,600
Yeah, I consider this national defense, pal.

85
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,140
Our families are under attack from people like you with these lyrics.

86
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,780
John, you don't have to buy them.

87
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,720
Mr. Zavala.

88
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
Could I make a statement about national defense?

89
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:09,520
Yeah.

90
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,120
The biggest threat to America today is not communism.

91
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,020
It's moving America toward a fascist theocracy.

92
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:15,860
Yeah.

93
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,080
Yeah.

94
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


95
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


96
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


97
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


98
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


99
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


100
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


101
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


102
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


103
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,820
Everything that's happened during the Reagan administration is steering us right down that pipe.

104
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,940
Oh, Mr. Zavala, do you really think?

105
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,780
I mean, all kidding aside, in this country,

106
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,220
with the permissiveness that we are moving toward a fascist theocracy, anything goes.

107
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:32,760
You bet we are.

108
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,500
I mean, do you think things like this would ever have been permitted?

109
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,920
Give me that famous smile again.

110
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,380
When we were kids, you're about my age.

111
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:40,940
I'm 45.

112
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,180
Well, I'm 55.

113
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,880
Do you think when I was a kid that they would permit songs like that,

114
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,440
to be sold?

115
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,180
I mean, permissiveness is the game.

116
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,420
I mean, you're not really serious if you're saying we're going toward a fascist theocracy.

117
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,380
That's right, we are.

118
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,000
Wait a minute.

119
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,560
In what way?

120
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,580
Give me one example.

121
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,380
Wait, wait, wait.

122
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,260
One example.

123
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,200
One example of a fascist theocracy.

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,380
When you have a government that prefers a certain moral code derived from a certain religion,

125
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,300
and that moral code turns into legislation to suit one certain religious point of view,

126
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,820
and if that code happens,

127
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,960
and that code happens to be very, very right-wing,

128
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,760
almost toward the till of the Hun...

129
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,920
Well, then you are an anarchist.

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,560
Every form of civil government is based on some kind of morality, Frank.

131
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,320
Morality in terms of behavior, not in terms of theology.

132
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,280
Well, of course.

133
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,720
But look, I mean, I couldn't believe in your hearing.

134
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,440
John, John, you're hurting me.

135
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,560
Okay, wait a minute, gentlemen.

136
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,160
We have to take a break now.

137
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,160
From PR News in Washington, I'm planning to attack people who've charged sexual abuse

138
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,180
by Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Alawi,

139
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,860
during the 9-11 attack.

140
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,860
The 9-11 terrorist attacks combined with a further attack on 500 healthy people

141
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,740
looking for three Iraqis who were allegedly planning to attack New York City's police commissioner

142
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,240
in Dad Bag, indicating that more people looking for radioactive wastes actually found PR News.

143
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,460
Mr. President, Congress can't afford to be threatened.

144
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,800
The United States, in its formative years, never chose the free access of information of their citizenry.

145
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,940
The founding fathers of this great nation of ours knew the value of repressive measures,

146
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,180
such as the censorship of published materials to protect the government from their citizens.

147
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,380
As Jefferson once commented,

148
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,420
when the people know only what the government wants them to know, all is safe.

149
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,000
Let me be clear if I can here.

150
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,800
The legislation that I've submitted today for inclusion in the record isn't about protecting freedom of press.

151
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,300
Instead, Mr. President, this legislation is used as a tool for propaganda,

152
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,840
whereby nothing could get published without the government's consent.

153
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,820
It's a war, really. It's a slow-motion war between the humans and the subgeniuses.

154
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:57,480
And we admit, inventing the humans 80 million years ago in fabled Mutantis was our worst mistake.

155
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,800
And now they outnumber us zillions to one.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,460
And we're forced to disguise our beautiful religion as a joke.

157
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,400
Oh yeah, people say, oh I've heard it, Bob, praise Bob, church is subgenius.

158
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,820
That's a real funny joke.

159
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:19,320
Well, is it any bigger a joke than the headlines in today's newspaper?

160
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,960
Is it a funnier joke than your life?

161
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:32,040
No, the conspiracy is bigger than Republicans and Democrats or whatever.

162
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,820
It's an attitude, simply. It's the attitude of distrust.

163
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,580
And they're not clever. They don't even know that it's a conspiracy.

164
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,460
They're...

165
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:51,640
And yet, these cow-like, sheep-like followers, yet they can destroy the world!

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,120
So Bob has come along to make sure that the world is destroyed properly,

167
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,300
and not in some silly, useless manner.

168
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,240
Friends, the humans, they have bad words for us.

169
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,560
So, you know, they call us names, bad names, Bobbies and so forth.

170
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,200
We have even more words for them.

171
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,860
The Pink Boys, the Barbies and Kins, the Mediocratons, the Cage Dwellers, and so forth.

172
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,340
Friends, what they are is false prophets.

173
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,700
Sheep in wolves' clothing, as they say.

174
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:33,400
And consequently, we find this world that seems like it's all going to hell in a handbasket.

175
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:41,020
With overpopulation, cancer everywhere, diseases, poisons, class war, and so forth.

176
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:46,980
And you think how bad it is in the news and the media.

177
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,700
Think what they're not telling you!

178
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,360
And that's where the wonderful prophecies of Bob come in.

179
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,500
Friends, the worst part of the conspiracy is that they make you actually want to work.

180
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:11,000
Now, some of our rival cults insist that things like this,

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,680
like pornography, are destroying the family.

182
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,700
BOOM!

183
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,340
Friends, I'll tell you what is destroying the family.

184
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,920
It's 9 to 5 jobs!

185
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,380
Where dad has to get up, and mom, and get up in the morning,

186
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,660
kiss their kid hello and goodbye, and go off to work.

187
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,280
The kid is sent to some school to watch a scarecrow for a while.

188
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,880
And then they come home and kiss the kid good hello and goodnight, and that's it!

189
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,900
And that's jobs that are destroying the family!

190
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,940
Friends, not pornography!

191
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,100
BOOM!

192
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,220
Bob says stop working and get back to wanking!

193
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,020
BOOM!

194
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,200
But you know, we all say, well, I'm free!

195
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,560
You don't have to preach here preaching to the saved, Reverend Stang.

196
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,780
I know all about the conspiracy.

197
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,760
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

198
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,960
Why, I don't, there's no conspiracy.

199
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,780
I don't have one of those jobs.

200
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,220
I'm an art bum.

201
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,040
You know, I kind of gob by on life.

202
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,420
But friends, you must never forget the conspiracy is always,

203
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,800
you can forget them.

204
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,480
But they won't forget you.

205
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,420
No, sir.

206
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,320
They're always, they get in your head!

207
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,100
You, we all have it, the conspiracy inside of our heads.

208
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,080
That's the part we have.

209
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,480
We hate that hate.

210
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,360
You know, we're full of hate.

211
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,840
And hate is a wonderful motivator.

212
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,240
If you hate enough, you can really love Bob.

213
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,880
In fact, you know, we're not so different from most religions.

214
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:40,380
It's not that people love Bob or Jesus or Muhammad all that much.

215
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,840
It's that they love the idea of everyone else burning in hell!

216
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,320
Ah, yes!

217
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,900
You know, that us versus them thing.

218
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:57,900
And J.R. Bob Dobbs, a wise, mindless, automatic spouting fellow that he is,

219
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,960
recognized that fact.

220
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,460
He was, he realized that if you act like a dumb shit,

221
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,060
they'll treat you as an equal.

222
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,520
Woo!

223
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,800
And so we, in our, we, you know, people come to me and they say,

224
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,380
Reverend Stang, how should I fight the conspiracy?

225
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,960
Oh, I hate that, uh, boss.

226
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,500
I hate my parents.

227
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,700
They're assholes.

228
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,560
I hate the president.

229
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,600
I hate the premier.

230
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,500
I hate the queen.

231
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:25,900
Whatever.

232
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,260
Uh, friends, you can't beat the conspiracy.

233
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,760
There's millions of them.

234
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
You can only make yourself stronger.

235
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,640
The conspiracy has, between all of them,

236
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,540
they have at least 100,000 nuclear weapons.

237
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,740
And the Church of the Subgenius?

238
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,260
We've only got five.

239
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,860
And we don't even know where one of them is.

240
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,140
Disneyland, maybe.

241
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,360
It's, uh, we'll, we'll find out.

242
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,660
But yet we dare to fight them anyway!

243
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,460
That's because we know it's always the lost causes

244
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,440
are the only ones worth fighting for,

245
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,020
as Jimmy Stewart said in one of those old Hollywood movies.

246
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,240
Excuse me.

247
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,140
What?

248
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,520
Money is to burn.

249
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,420
Oh, no, not again!

250
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,360
And theatergoers and audience alike said money was to burn.

251
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,640
Rated PG.

252
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,940
Now it's time for the Poot Awardees from the Subgenius.

253
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,700
Johnny Horizon, get involved with America.

254
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,780
We have some questions we'd like you to think about

255
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,140
as you sleep through the show.

256
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,800
Why didn't JFK have time to draw his own gun?

257
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,720
Where did Jackie hide her weapon?

258
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,560
Why didn't Connelly stay out of the way like he was supposed to?

259
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,740
How many gunmen were there?

260
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,120
And how many Oswalds?

261
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,220
Well, I don't know if we'll ever know.

262
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,820
How many Oswald doubles are still alive?

263
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,380
And where do they live?

264
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,260
Frankly, I don't know if the American public is interested in this.

265
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,500
Where was the assassination really filmed?

266
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,800
And who played the part of the actor president?

267
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,240
I think they'll all be anxious to get back to their television programs.

268
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,340
Is Paul dead?

269
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,400
September 12th, 1964.

270
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,660
Yeah, that was Pearl Harbor Day.

271
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,500
Yeah, well, read my lips, damn it.

272
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,180
Well, it's kind of hard to do.

273
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,120
This is radio.

274
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,480
Maybe you could put your lips to your radio a little bit closer.

275
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,140
Well, then I might see a thousand points of light, though.

276
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,660
Maybe you should put your lips to the back of your radio.

277
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,600
Yeah, right to the cord, that cord that leads out of it.

278
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,040
That's it.

279
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,080


280
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,200
That's fake blue lettering on your lips.

281
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,200
It's hard to read.

282
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:27,420
And it's an imposition on the American public to try to ask us to read that fake tattooing

283
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,120
on your lips, even if it is lit up by a thousand points of light.

284
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,200
Thank you very much.

285
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,540
That's a thousand pints of light.

286
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,540
And the thousand pints or quarts of AIDS-contaminated blood washed up on an Atlantic beach the other

287
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,220
day, causing a bleaching of the beach and a corralling of the car.

288
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,980
Yes, a naval station was full of lint and had to be cleaned, according to some sources

289
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,180
present at the site.

290
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:57,500
Yes, who could ever forget that terrible Pearl Harbor Day when President Bush shot President

291
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:03,740
Quayle in a fight to the finish for the championship title of President of the United States.

292
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,680
Tell us if you think that you'd like to be in the 60s again.

293
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,540
We can probably arrange that before the end of the show.

294
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,460
Obviously, we've never left the 60s here at the show.

295
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,100
I'm scared by whatever's happening here.

296
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,740
Our distinctive ax marks of the immortal Brazilian rubber planters are in such short supply that

297
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,360
an advance application in your name is already reserved for you.

298
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,720
To protect your investment, none will be made.

299
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,700
Yeah, just a call at 848-445.

300
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,280
Registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles.

301
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:28,740
Perfect.

302
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,080
A dazzling proposition.

303
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:30,820
We will sue you.

304
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,000
You will agree.

305
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,720
If you do not, we're a 560-piece company.

306
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:33,720


307
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,800
The opening date will be on September 5th.

308
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,300
Bill and Audrey Skinner's audiburgh caramel work which is available every year during

309
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,300


310
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,840
Bill and Audrey Skinner's edition of The Planet of Belguld.

311
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,680
For Bob and Davidท skalos, on the Tr 만든 Musical сокian es encont planteinデف bullied

312
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,720
staffing her family at the United States Embassy in March 2015.

313
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,300
...assassination with a video camera...

314
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,480
Barba, if somebody wants to shoot me from a dirigible with a bazooka,

315
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,380
nobody can stop it, so why worry about it?

316
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,720
What on earth is he talking about?

317
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,740
I don't... I don't... I don't understand.

318
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,660
Neither do I.

319
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,920
By the way, what are... what are they saying about me?

320
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,080
This is a little song I wrote.

321
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,820
You might want to sing it note for note.

322
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,620
Don't worry.

323
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,460
Be happy.

324
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,180
In every life we have some trouble.

325
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,000
When you worry, you make it double.

326
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,620
Don't worry.

327
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,480
Be happy.

328
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,740
Don't worry. Be happy now.

329
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,380
Don't worry.

330
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,060
Be happy.

331
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,480
Don't worry. Be happy.

332
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,280
Don't worry.

333
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,980
Be happy.

334
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,500
Don't worry. Be happy.

335
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,060
Ain't got no place to lay your head.

336
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,760
Somebody came and took your bed.

337
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,540
Don't worry.

338
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,360
Be happy.

339
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,100
The landlord say your rent is late.

340
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,700
He may have to litigate.

341
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,520
Don't worry.

342
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Be happy.

343
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,560
Look at me, I'm happy.

344
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,180
Don't worry.

345
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
Be happy.

346
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,540
I'll give you my phone number.

347
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,820
When you worry, call me and I'll make you happy.

348
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,200
Don't worry.

349
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,980
Be happy.

350
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,860
Ain't got no cash.

351
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,000
Ain't got no style.

352
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,680
Ain't got no girl to make you smile.

353
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,380
Don't worry.

354
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,420
Be happy.

355
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,000
When you worry, your face will frown.

356
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,360
That will bring everybody down.

357
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,420
So don't worry.

358
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,320
Be happy.

359
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,620
Don't worry. Be happy now.

360
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,320
Don't worry.

361
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,060
Don't worry. Be happy.

362
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,700
Don't worry. Be happy.

363
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:33,700


364
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:33,700


365
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,420
Don't worry. Be happy.

366
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:36,880


367
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,140
Don't worry.

368
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,880
Ooh.

369
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,000
Be happy.

370
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,960
Ooh.

371
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,360
Don't worry. Be happy.

372
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,320
Now there.

373
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,780
This song I wrote.

374
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,520
I hope you learned this note by note.

375
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,860
Don't worry.

376
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,240
Be happy.

377
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,800
Listen to what I say.

378
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,000
When your life makes some trouble.

379
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,540
When you worry, you make it double.

380
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,380
Don't worry.

381
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,960
Be happy.

382
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,640
Be happy now.

383
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,060
Don't worry.

384
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,900
Be happy.

385
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,600
Don't worry.

386
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,580
I am not the one you seek.

387
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,760
I am merely here to prepare the way

388
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,120
for the one who comes after me.

389
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,020
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you

390
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,960
the second luckiest man alive.

391
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,340
The head

392
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,040
of the subgenius Olympic doping committee.

393
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,420
The president

394
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,340
of Eurobikers for Bob.

395
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,900
The ex-pope of all Europe.

396
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,140
Altar boy.

397
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,140
David Lee Black.

398
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,800
Now friends, I was going to put on

399
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,460
this uniform

400
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,680
and I was going to perform as pope like

401
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,820
tonight, but no.

402
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,480
No, never again.

403
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,740
I have cast off these shackles

404
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,760
of anti-slack.

405
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,640
I am no longer the pope of all Europe.

406
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,740
I am the altar boy

407
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,080
of all Europe.

408
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,480
Yes, my

409
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,640
friends, instead of

410
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,960
barking orders and telling people

411
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,300
what to do and dressing up

412
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,140
in a funny suit and even wearing

413
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,400
sunglasses on stage.

414
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,340
No, now

415
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,720
I have to be irresponsible

416
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,800
and let everybody else yell at me.

417
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,080
That's right, my

418
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,980
friends. I want to thank

419
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,060
all of you for busting

420
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,460
me down to

421
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,960
the position of altar boy

422
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,020
of all Europe.

423
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,360
But I would rather be the altar boy

424
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,420
of all Europe than the fucking president

425
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,560
of the United States.

426
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,480
Yay!

427
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,400
And I challenge that motherfucker

428
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,640
to cocaine and beer drinking

429
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,240
each time of the day he wants to do it

430
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,720
because I can, even as altar boy,

431
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,940
drink more and do more coke

432
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,500
than he can.

433
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,400
Oh, he does a lot of coke.

434
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,240
Now,

435
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,260
I was sick of

436
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,900
all day long trying to think

437
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,560
about what I was going to preach about

438
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:06,940
tonight.

439
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,840
And in classic

440
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,820
form, instead

441
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,960
of thinking up something profound,

442
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,000
thinking up something

443
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,520
what am I going to teach him?

444
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,760
I found wisdom in the most

445
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,760
strange of

446
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,660
places, my friends. Just like

447
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,580
all other sub-genius preachers, we don't

448
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,140
find our

449
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,960
highest wisdom in the Bible,

450
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
the Koran, or

451
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,180
philosophy books.

452
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,720
No, my friends, we find it in

453
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,680
comic books

454
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,800
and packs of

455
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,500
cigarettes. That's right.

456
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,760
I found this empty pack

457
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,980
of cigarettes on the table

458
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,660
and I was looking at it

459
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,780
and trying to translate what

460
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,700
it said on the front of the package

461
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,520
and

462
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,220
in my broken Dutch,

463
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,480
I'll need some help from the Dutch

464
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,280
speakers in here.

465
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,340
And I know this is going to sound

466
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,640
like some stupid American,

467
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,100
but roking is

468
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,380
dothlik.

469
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,300
Okay? Now,

470
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,380
I believe that means, correct me

471
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,700
if I'm wrong, smoking

472
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,720
is deadly.

473
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,840
Is that correct?

474
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,120
Well, my friends, it ain't as

475
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,160
deadly as your non-belief

476
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,620
is Bob!

477
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,120
That's right, my friends.

478
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,020
The conspiracy wants you to believe

479
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,460
that cigarette smoking is dead.

480
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,060
It's deadly, but it's not nearly

481
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,480
as deadly as if you don't pay it up

482
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,740
to Bob Dobbs.

483
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,960
Do I hear a praise Bob?

484
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,600
Do I hear a praise Bob?

485
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,480
Now, the conspiracy

486
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,480
out of this packet of cigarettes,

487
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,320
which probably will

488
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,180
give you cancer if you smoke it too long

489
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,900
because it is a conspiracy drug

490
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,540
and

491
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,300
the conspiracy taxes you pay

492
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,220
on the cigarettes are going to

493
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,780
fight some unholy war

494
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,160
in a place where they are

495
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,100
killing people. You're right!

496
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,160
Smoking

497
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,440
is deadly.

498
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,440
But the

499
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,080
conspiracy is deadly.

500
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,580
And it is even more

501
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,420
deadly not

502
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,280
to believe and pay your

503
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,480
$30 to Bob.

504
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,620
Because the Church of the Subgenius

505
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,440
is the only religion in the world to offer

506
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,280
eternal salvation

507
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,080
for $30 or

508
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,840
triple your money back.

509
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,580
Do I hear a praise Bob?

510
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,460
Now,

511
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,820
Brother Stang, who is not much of a

512
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,400
drinker, but me I am,

513
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,720
did not offer up

514
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,940
the Holy Communion tonight.

515
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,760
And I would like everybody to put their glasses up

516
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,500
to their lips and drink

517
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,660
in this sacred moment of Holy

518
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,280
Communion.

519
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,480
Now that you got that out of the way,

520
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,560
get your wallet off.

521
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,200
Pay Bob!

522
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,940
John foods

523
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:06,940


524
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,880

promises

527
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,220
a

528
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,340
present

529
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,420
to

551
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,620
The biggest threat to America today is not communism.

552
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,460
It's moving America toward a fascist theocracy.

553
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,200
And everything that's happened during the Reagan administration is steering us right down that pipe.

554
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,220
You're not really serious if you're saying we're going toward a fascist theocracy.

555
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,040
That's right, we are.

556
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,660
Wait a minute.

557
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,260
Give me one example.

558
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,020
Wait, wait, wait.

559
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,840
One example of a fascist theocracy.

560
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:56,060
When you have a government that prefers a certain moral code derived from a certain religion,

561
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,940
and that moral code turns into legislation to suit one certain religious point of view,

562
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:08,940
and if that code happens to be very, very right-wing, almost total the hunt,

563
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,480
then you are an anarchist.

564
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,540
Then you are an anarchist.

565
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,580
Then you are an anarchist.

566
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,520
Then you are an anarchist.

567
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,560
Then you are an anarchist.

568
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,640
Then you are an anarchist.

569
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,320
Then there's a state ofיל

00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,140
bizarre little racist image of that strange little black

594
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:58,560
fellow that would so anger almost any people of any other country for its

595
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,100
strange stereotypical

596
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,940
those christmas lights recently almost killed somebody

597
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,440
nice bob yeah i mean they'd be like sitting around nothing happened all of a

598
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,800
sudden like we heard like crushing sound outside and these christmas

599
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,280
lights and the conference was kind of crashing down

600
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,440
and this guy was just walking down and he's like

601
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,080
you see he fell down just behind him funny thing was he didn't winch

602
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,580
whatsoever

603
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,660
looked at the crushed down lights turned around again and walked on

604
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,000
no sense crying over spilt milk friends there's a mystery every second

605
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,400
you can face it with wonder and questioning or you can be like that for

606
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:46,780
you can face it with wonder and questioning or you can be like that for

607
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,680
you can face it with wonder and questioning or you can be like that for

608
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,760
pink stoner who didn't even pink stoner who didn't even

609
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,080
pink stoner who didn't even couldn't even react to a bizarre situation

610
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,320
couldn't even react to a bizarre situation

611
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,100
couldn't even react to a bizarre situation which will it be which are you

612
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,620
which will it be which are you

613
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,460
which will it be which are you well it's up to you to make that choice

614
00:35:59,460 --> 00:35:59,460


615
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,060
well it's up to you to make that choice you don't have to make it tonight but it

616
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,060


617
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,480
you don't have to make it tonight but it would help

618
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,840
would help

619
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,900
would help it would it would help you to flush

620
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:04,900


621
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,580
it would it would help you to flush your mind like one of these

622
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,780
your mind like one of these

623
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:24,360
Of course they got these normal water toilets where they do your thing and it just falls into the little...

624
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:24,900
If you're lucky.

625
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,620
If you're lucky, of course, that sticks to the ball.

626
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:39,400
But he was so used to Dutch toilets, he didn't want to go to a toilet where actually the water would just plop up and kiss you, you know, the kiss of Neptune.

627
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:51,340
So he'd been like going through the hotel, every room, room after room, looking for one of those Dutch toilets, Dutch toilets with one of those little plateaus.

628
00:36:51,560 --> 00:37:02,140
He couldn't find one. And finally he filled up the entire toilet with toilet paper and did what he had to do and thus didn't get the kiss of Neptune.

629
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:08,140
But he did manage to clog the toilet considerably. It proceeded to flood.

630
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:08,660
And...

631
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,620
The entire hotel room afterwards flooded. So that was quite interesting.

632
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,420
But yeah, there you go. That's Dutch logic for you, I guess.

633
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:30,500
Well, so it turns out those shelves were actually for a much more modern and forward-thinking reason than we had ever...

634
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,920
The Germans or the British had told us. British told us.

635
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,920
Yeah, yeah, that was told to us.

636
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,940
Rather than...

637
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,680
Something so sensible and common sense, you know.

638
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:49,180
That would be cause for war for some countries.

639
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,500
Oh yeah.

640
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:57,640
Lilliput and Broadbeakneag went to war for... Of course Broadbeakneag, they stomped Lilliput.

641
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,260
But they went to war over smaller things than toilets.

642
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,680
It's toilet paper that's important.

643
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,640
The paper itself, ultimately.

644
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,120
Yeah.

645
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:15,360
That's where you draw the line between a civilized land and true barbarism.

646
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:25,860
When they used the waxed paper coated with a sort of a sheath of razor blades, that is barbarism.

647
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:32,660
When you use a goose neck of a live goose, that is truly a trained live goose.

648
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,060
Yeah.

649
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,880
Or you find these sheets of tree bark.

650
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,860
As in some countries.

651
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:38,780
Right?

652
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,460
You're looking puzzled, no?

653
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,140
Uh-huh.

654
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,100
You don't know what...

655
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,460
In Texas, that's what we use in Texas.

656
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,080
What, tree bark?

657
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,440
Yeah.

658
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,700
I'm from Texas where George Bush came from.

659
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,060
I can tell you that that's what George Bush uses for toilet paper, tree bark.

660
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,360
Do you guys have trees in Texas?

661
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,060
Yes.

662
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,960
I think they only have oil.

663
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,680
They're covered...

664
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,240
No, they're...

665
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,980
Actually, they're called cactus.

666
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,360
They're not very tall trees generally, but they're covered with very sharp spines.

667
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,520
Long spines, like hat pins.

668
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:17,300
And those are what a Texan uses to wipe, to clean his or herself after extra meditation.

669
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,620
So, the stories you've heard are true.

670
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:20,820
Yeah.

671
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,740
It's all desert, horses, horse shit.

672
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,100
Cowboys.

673
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,480
Cowboys, yeah.

674
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,360
Cowboys, horses.

675
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,260
As you can tell by the way I look with my cowboy hat, my cowboy boots.

676
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,460
Chaps.

677
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,420
And a bit of warthogs on your head.

678
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,180
Six gun.

679
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,580
Six gun.

680
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,100
And, yeah, that's it.

681
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,980
All the stories you've heard are true.

682
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,620
Actually, it's so sad.

683
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:52,220
And honestly, I recently drove through my old hometown in Texas.

684
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,840
And it was...

685
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:00,080
It still looked fairly nice and traditional.

686
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,440
But at the end of the block, there was a McDonald's.

687
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:02,440


688
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,480
And next is a Starbucks.

689
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,540
I thought that was pretty bad.

690
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,200
Then we came to here, to Europe.

691
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,420
We go to a little town, traditional town in Germany, Lüneburg.

692
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:24,340
Like, it was so old-fashioned and traditional looking, and these ancient buildings.

693
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,200
So, it's marvelous, too, that we who live in New World land.

694
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:41,680
It was like a special Epcot Center theme park, Germany land exhibit, marred at the end of

695
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,480
the street by the sight of that ever-present McDonald's.

696
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,600
And a Starbucks.

697
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,780
And a Woolworths.

698
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,560
And the same here.

699
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,020
The same everywhere.

700
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,740
The same in downtown Baghdad.

701
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,420
The same in Nairobi.

702
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,180
The same in the city of New York.

703
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,180


704
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,180


705
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,180


706
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,180


707
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,180


708
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,040
The same everywhere you go.

709
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:10,660
The smiling face of the pink boy, Ronald McDonald, supplants the grinning, insane visage of Bob

710
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,900
everywhere we go.

711
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,060
The devil owns this world, my friends.

712
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,560
The devil is in Ronald McDonald.

713
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,580
The devil is in Starbucks.

714
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,340
The devil is in Woolworths.

715
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,240
He thinks Satan's not real.

716
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,520
Well, he may not be real the way you're thinking.

717
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,340
He's like some red-skinned monster with horns.

718
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,060
He's a fat bitch.

719
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,060
He's a businessman in a necktie.

720
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,160
That necktie is like a handcuff around his head.

721
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,500
That's how Satan keeps a leech and a wristwatch.

722
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,220
That's his handcuff.

723
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,160
It's mind control.

724
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,600
Satan's got you mind controlled.

725
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,700
You've got to resist Satan, my friend.

726
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,320
Didn't Satan in the…

727
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Only in McDonald's every now and then on special occasions.

728
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,940
Didn't he do something about sin?

729
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,020
I mean, doesn't the church have such genius…

730
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,760
I mean, I don't know.

731
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,040
I don't know.

732
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,040


733
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,040


734
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,040


735
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,040


736
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,040


737
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,040


738
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,040


739
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,040


740
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,040


741
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,040


742
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,040


743
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,640
Do you like sin?

744
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:04,160
Satan is competition for Bob, you see.

745
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:13,000
We're trying to tempt sinners away from the devil long enough to get their money, and

746
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:21,780
then they can go on to whatever other god or demon or new age crystal or flying saucer

747
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,060
riding wiseacre hobbit man.

748
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,200
We don't care what.

749
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,040
They can do whatever they want.

750
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,020
Whatever gives you the chance.

751
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,020


752
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,280
slack baby get you some slack

753
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,820
put your hands up if you believe in Bob

754
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:57,960
put your hands up if you hate Bob now wait a minute this is fucked up now for

755
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,200
every one of you who are talking while I'm preaching none of you raise your

756
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:08,200
hands and for every one of you who are listening to what I'm saying you raise

757
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,380
your hands twice now that's fucked up those are the true believers in Bob

758
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,760
go here and praise Bob go here and praise Bob

759
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:27,380
you know it amazes me that Hitler is standing neck deep in the come of his

760
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:27,940
wife

761
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:34,560
wildest wettest dreams in hell as George Bush builds playgrounds for Iraqi

762
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,260
children out of spent out tanks and spent uranium munitions

763
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,740
and the most of you do not care

764
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:57,660
why don't you care because you are part of the conspiracy

765
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:57,940
conspiracy

766
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:06,000
conspiracy that we've been talking about all evening the conspiracy that

767
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,760
you're a part of now because you are not listening to the word of Bob

768
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:22,740
now most of you are sitting chatting about your own pathetic little personal

769
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,940
problems your pathetic little lives your unenlightened little selves your

770
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,640
useless selves like me ever lived your とらんせ Dancing

771
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:28,640


772
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,360
because you care about nothing else other than the little tiny world

773
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,840
other than the little tiny world around you but I want to bust your bubble right

774
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:45,380
and tell you that there's a great big UNIVERSE out there big bigger than you

775
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:57,740
it's got more dots on its face than you do and my friends as you're sit conversing in your little

776
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:57,920
and my friends as you're sit conversing in your little

777
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:57,920


778
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:57,920


779
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,180
about your pathetic little lives.

780
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,640
Aliens are setting up in space

781
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,120
and they are watching our television shows.

782
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,000
They are listening to our radio shows

783
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,900
and they are listening to me right now as I speak.

784
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:19,060
George Bush Jr. has drawn a line in the sand in Iraq

785
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:24,640
and either you are a terrorist

786
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:31,200
or you're going to get off the planet with the rest of us believers.

787
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,640
From PR News in Washington,

788
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,860
I'm sentenced to three years in prison

789
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,580
for the killing of a severely wounded Democratic candidate

790
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,620
from Orlando, Florida this weekend.

791
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,160
In his week radio address today,

792
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,860
President Bush claimed he killed the 16-year-old boy

793
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,120
to put him out of his misery.

794
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,460
The president was a victim of PR News.

795
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,160
Yasser Arafat was pronounced fit for bankruptcy

796
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:54,820
in Washington.

797
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,360
Doctors in Vienna say there are questions

798
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,120
about withdrawing from Vienna.

799
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,880
For PR News, I'm swollen and pockmarked in Vienna.

800
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,320
You're on the air.

801
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,080
Take over a gas station and seize one gas station attendant.

802
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,900
He's threatening to maybe like destroy something

803
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,600
or wear his clothing in a menial manner

804
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,060
and inspect the government of Iraq

805
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,040
to pinch George Bush

806
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,760
and send home him, her, him, he and everyone.

807
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,340
The burning bush.

808
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,720
I mean, I wish it could be done.

809
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,900
But I can't hear anything.

810
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,720
I can't hear anything.

811
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,900
Sounds like it.

812
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,080
The voice is somewhat familiar.

813
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,460
Yeah, that's, that's Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

814
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,440
He's an enemy of the state.

815
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,480
In the other world.

816
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,160
He's an enemy of the state.

817
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,920
He's actually somewhere in the same house with me,

818
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,740
but I don't know where.

819
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,240
And it's causing really weird scenarios.

820
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,460
Inside the house.

821
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,640
This is Bill.

822
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,420
Bill of Stangula,

823
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,760
where they're planning a lot of these para-rists

824
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,880
or para-nista raids on various gas stations around town.

825
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,640
And we have a war room in the basement.

826
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,700
It looks like a ping-pong table,

827
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,500
but in reality,

828
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,040
it's got the future of the world

829
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,980
written out like a map.

830
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,540
Isn't that the shuffleboard thing

831
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,520
where you move tanks and stuff around and saucers?

832
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,800
Well, we have those metal tanks.

833
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,280
Those are full of the compressed souls

834
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,340
of the subgenius members,

835
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,960
including you, St. Bucky.

836
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:21,920
Oh, great.

837
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,020
Somewhere down there.

838
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:23,080


839
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:23,460
One of those.

840
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,500
One of those blue canisters has your soul in it.

841
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,960
There's a little piece of Bucky in Stang's basement.

842
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:28,420
Yep.

843
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,140
There used to be one with mine in it,

844
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,680
but I lost a third of mine to G. Gordon Gordon

845
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,840
in some gambling thing,

846
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,220
and Bob took a third of it for I don't know what.

847
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,680
And of course, the lovely Princess Wee has the other third.

848
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,020
Yeah.

849
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,140
Right, right.

850
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:44,780
We're going to take another two.

851
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,220
It's a hard thing to lose your soul.

852
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,320
It's not to an object,

853
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,860
but what about losing your little concept?

854
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,460
You know, that's the easiest thing.

855
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:52,820
Mokou.

856
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,360
I agree.

857
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:57,980
Guys, listen.

858
00:47:59,360 --> 00:47:59,440
Oye.

859
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:02,720
Oye.

860
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:04,420
No.

861
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,220
It's not the oye man.

862
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:10,820
Oye, como va?

863
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,500
Smoke, dope, and masturbate.

864
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,960
Fuma yerba y masturbate.

865
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,100
Fuma yerba.

866
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,420
Yeah, was that a PSA?

867
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:27,760
Yes, it was.

868
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,500
That was Dr. Sinister's medical advice.

869
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,760
Actually, if you listen to the show and you speak Swedish,

870
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,340
if you don't understand Swedish,

871
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,640
it actually says smoke, dope, and masturbate in Swedish

872
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,460
in the introduction sequence to this show.

873
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,520
But then here's the great thing about Bob.

874
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,420
The conspiracy does not understand it.

875
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,900
And because they don't understand slack,

876
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,780
they can't bottle it and sell it.

877
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,800
And as long as slack is free and private,

878
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:55,380
only to you, they can't win.

879
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:55,900
Woo!

880
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,200
That's the thing.

881
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,000
What?

882
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:05,120
You know, and yeah, sure, we may come off as kind of a cheesy joke at times,

883
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,140
but think about it.

884
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:10,420
What if my wonderful homeland of America,

885
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,080
or anywhere else in the world for that matter,

886
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:18,300
became, I'm not saying this has happened yet or anything,

887
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,220
but what if it became the kind of place

888
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,800
where you really couldn't speak your mind?

889
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,780
Where we kind of gradually lost some of our freedoms

890
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,960
and didn't even notice because it was so gradual.

891
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:36,120
Well, wouldn't a secret resistance group have to pose as something else?

892
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,220
Wouldn't it have to seem like maybe a joke

893
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,460
where they couldn't quite tell,

894
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,720
you couldn't quite tell if they were serious or not?

895
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,720
Look what they did to our predecessors, friends!

896
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:51,860
So the great thing about Bob is he cannot sell out.

897
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,780
Because he's not selling out.

898
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,660
He's already totally corrupt.

899
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,120
He could not be more corrupt.

900
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,680
And he's tamper-proof.

901
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,640
They don't know why he's smiling.

902
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,380
They can't understand him.

903
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,500
And he has a power that the posts of other religions envy.

904
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,800
Other posts, they're infallible.

905
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,100
They cannot fail.

906
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,320
Bob has the power to fail!

907
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,580
And every time he does, he makes a million dollars for himself,

908
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,760
not necessarily for his clients.

909
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,900
And as friends,

910
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,600
we can all be friends.

911
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,720
Yes, you know, it is, it does sound crazy.

912
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,080
But maybe, maybe, maybe it's just so crazy,

913
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,540
it just might work!

914
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,960
Well, we'll see.

915
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,200
It doesn't really matter, friends.

916
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,320
As I said, as long as slack is free, they cannot win.

917
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:46,760
And we may be broke, we may be drunks or neurotic or retards or whatever.

918
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,760
But yet, yet we can hate them!

919
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,640
Why?

920
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,880
Only for us.

921
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,520
For one reason.

922
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,720
Because we have Bob and they don't!

923
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,220
And for that, we can hate, hate, hate, hate, hate!

924
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:04,240
Until we finally achieve the pristine moment of hate squared.

925
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,920
Hate times hate.

926
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,260
You've hated the hate itself so thoroughly that you finally get slack.

927
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:18,940
And you know, you can't save the world and you can't give somebody else slack until you have slack.

928
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,760
Otherwise, it's just, you're just bullshitting.

929
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:22,260
You're just bullshitting yourself.

930
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:29,360
And you know, I used to get very frustrated because I'd run into these subgeniuses who were just embarrassing.

931
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,500
I mean, just, they were messed up.

932
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,320
They were nerds, geeks.

933
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:37,340
They thought they were funny, but they weren't.

934
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,500
Or, you know, it was just kind of embarrassing.

935
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,980
And I don't know if I could...

936
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,940
And then one day it finally sunk in.

937
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,500
That's what this is all about!

938
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,440
Duh!

939
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,460
Of course they're fucked up!

940
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:57,340
Because there really is a conspiracy of normal people stealing away the slack of the weirdos.

941
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,920
Of course they're fucked up!

942
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,680
And that is why Bob is their god!

943
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,400
Thank you so much, friends!

944
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:11,160
You know, we say, every X day, even though the aliens didn't arrive in 1998,

945
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,720
we wait for them every single year.

946
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,020
At 7 o'clock in the morning, July 5th, every year.

947
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:23,540
Because, friends, what are we waiting for, really?

948
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:29,680
Are we going to wait for some aliens to bring us freedom from the conspiracy?

949
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,820
That would be nuts!

950
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:38,240
But really, are we going to wait for some invisible monster who lives in the clouds

951
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:44,460
to grant us the freedom to have church in a bar on Saturday night instead of Sunday morning all dressed up?

952
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,000
Are we going to wait for some pipe-smoking charlatan sailor

953
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,280
to tell us what slack is?

954
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:51,860
No!

955
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,940
We make our own slack!

956
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,380
Here's the bad news.

957
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,900
The bad news is, Bob is not the answer.

958
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,740
The good news is, neither is anything else!

959
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,900
You must learn to think for yourself!

960
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,000
Only Bob can teach you how.

961
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,240
And you must question authority!

962
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,140
What? Why?

963
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,660
Or else.

964
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,800
I see somebody else is doing it.

965
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,740
But most important of all, my friends, the one rule.

966
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,040
You know, Bob said so many funny things.

967
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,660
Too much is always better than not enough.

968
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:37,240
Act like a damn shit and they'll treat you as an equal.

969
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:41,260
Repent, quit your job, and slack off while you still know how.

970
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,220
But the most important thing still is, friends,

971
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,340
fuck them if they can't take a job!

972
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,760
Please stop!

973
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,040
Please stop!

974
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,140
Please stop!

975
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:51,740
Please stop!

976
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,940
Please stop!

977
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,360
It is a swastika!

978
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,640
It is a seven-legged windbreaker!

979
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,820
It is a swastika-bomb!

980
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,220
This thing is holy!

981
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,420
And when I hold it up above your head,

982
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,940
they shall know the power of God!

983
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,300
God!

984
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,060
God!

985
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:19,060


986
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:19,060


987
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,340
Yes, dear friends, we're listening to the TUM orchestra

988
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:28,900
with Pope Black narrating in the foreground there.

989
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,580
Performing at the Hamburg Divival.

990
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,100
at the FUNDBØRO in November.

991
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,680
Yes, friends, and we've been hearing in the end here

992
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,560
a little bit more of Radio Patevu from Amsterdam.

993
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:57,240
You can get more information on Radio Patapo from www.freeteam.nl.

994
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:08,340
Friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry, hour of slack, number 975.

995
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:15,920
You can get more information about Bob and the Church of the Subgenius from Post Office Box.

996
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,040
You got that pencil ready, friend?

997
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:31,240
That would be Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

998
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:35,560
Now, stop working and get back to wanking.

999
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,900
This silence was sponsored by Radio Patapo.

1000
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,280
If you'd like to advertise in this space, please call 412-2969.

1001
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,660
Well, in the church there are no uncomfortable silences.

1002
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,760
We merely relish in our toes curling up and are wondering who's going to say something.

1003
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,020
Slack.

1004
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:08,980
The river.

1005
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:18,420
Slack can go different ways, you know, as Hitler said to Philo that one time back when they were running buddies.

1006
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,860
One man's bummer is another man's beautiful thing.

1007
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,360
That one time back when they were running buddies.

1008
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,060
Them was lean years, boy, them was lean years.

1009
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,340
Sure, but there's no such thing as bad slack war, is there?

1010
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,200
We're not suggesting that you go out and randomly kill people, but do bear in mind that slack...

1011
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,300
Only if you're subgenius.

1012
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:37,820
Exactly.

1013
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:38,940
Be careful.

1014
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:39,520
You gotta...

1015
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,260
The thing is, since you can't tell, only Bob can tell.

1016
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,680
So that means, are you really gonna try to decide for Bob?

1017
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:46,960
No.

1018
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,460
I think we better save your slashing till after Bob gets here.

1019
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:56,560
You're gonna have to wait, just like everybody else, and curb your slashing proclivities.

1020
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,700
Bob, you can't tell who's pink and who's...

1021
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,860
For all you know, maybe you're the crazy pink boy.

1022
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,320
Do you ever think of that now, Mr. Subgenius?

1023
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:03,920
Know what I mean?

1024
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,600
Crazy pink boy?

1025
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,780
Maybe you're the crazy...

1026
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:08,140
Crazy pink...

1027
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,580
Not that subgenius church you're making fun of.

1028
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,840
Do you ever think of that, do you?

1029
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,340
Just give us a hell of a lot of me, I'll tell you.

1030
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,340
But what do you mean?

1031
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,560
You mean I paid my $30 and...

1032
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,320
Yeah, that's enough.

1033
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,600
I might not be one of them.

1034
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,540
They might be taking me for a ride.

1035
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,440
I ain't paying no $30, I'm just joking.

1036
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,560
You better think about that, don't you?

1037
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:30,280
I bet you those Heaven's Gate kids wish they'd thought that way before that.

1038
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,040
I wish they...

1039
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,540
I wish those Heaven's Gate kids went,

1040
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,600
Bob, I wish I'd run the church and said to you...

1041
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,740
And Jonestown.

1042
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,280
They were the Jonestown...

1043
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,440
Self-suicide.

1044
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,120
They were all going,

1045
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,920
Oh, I wish I'd joined that church if you said genius, then I had the chance.

1046
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,900
Instead, I went and followed Jim Jones and his false Jesus Tommy thing.

1047
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,740
Oh, why didn't I follow Bob?

1048
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,420
Well, might as well take the cyanide.

1049
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,580
I was Bob.

1050
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,480
Hell's sake, whatever they said.

1051
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,440
At least they can join us when they reincarnate.

1052
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,840
They got all successful.

1053
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,040
Yeah, they'll learn from this mistake.

1054
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,660
I ain't done it in church.

1055
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:05,960
Friend, you know, you're going to face the same decision as Heaven's Gate,

1056
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,480
Jonestown,

1057
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,020
and bless her heart before Branch Davidian's face.

1058
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,620
You going to come out with your hands up, or are you going to stay in there?

1059
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,140
Actually, I suggest you just do like us subgeniuses do.

1060
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,420
Come out with your hands up and pray for a good lawyer.

1061
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,680
Because they've got bigger guns.

1062
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,340
And they've got a thousand nuclear weapons.

1063
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:30,700
And you've only got one or two at the most, don't you?

1064
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,540
Face facts.

1065
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,440
Always know when you're outgunned.

1066
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:34,980
Yeah.

1067
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,220
And you've got to live and run away to live to fight another day.

1068
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,960
Or run, as the case may be.

1069
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,840
Some of us just keep running.

1070
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,080
We never stop.

1071
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,340
We never turn and fight the conspiracy because we're chicken.

1072
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,480
There's nothing for you to be ashamed of if you're a subgenius.

1073
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,320
That's what we call a pacifist.

1074
