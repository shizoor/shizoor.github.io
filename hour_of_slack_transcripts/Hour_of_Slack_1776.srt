1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,220
Hey

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:02,680
Who's that?

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,260
Bob?

4
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,840
Totally lacking in sympathy or imagination

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,000
the modern racketeer

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,560
Psychologists say that such character can frequently be traced back to

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,160
The Self-Genius

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,600
Power of

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:16,620
SWAT

10
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,420
CREED

11
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,940
Hey

12
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:22,700
Weee

13
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,680
We bought him away

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:27,680


15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,920
Weee

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,880
In the White House, the mighty White House

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,120
The liar tweets tonight

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,780
In the West Wing, the self-obsessed wing

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,660
The liar tweets tonight

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,060
The liar tweets tonight

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,580
Ah, ah

22
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,720
Ah, ah

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,940
Ah, ah

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,200
Ah, ah

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,500
Ah, ah

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:05,820
Ah, ah

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:05,820


28
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,340
Ah, ah

29
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,220
Ah, ah

30
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,620
Hush you doctors, hush reporters

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,060
Hush you science nerds

32
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,480
Look my ratings are through the roof!

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:27,660
Hush you science nerds!

34
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,760
When I just say happy words

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,700
Ah, ah

36
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,660
John A. Sondheim

37
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,160
The Night King

38
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,720
The Night King

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,000
The Night King

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,520
The Night King

41
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,960
The Night King

42
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,840
The Night King

43
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:44,880
The Night King

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,780
The Night King

45
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,880
The Night King

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,840
The Night King

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,320
The Night King

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,180
Everyone can get a test

49
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,860
It's just the flu

50
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,060
It's a hoax like all the rest

51
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,840
A left-wing coup

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,640
We've got lots of pee pee

53
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,800
The cupboards bare

54
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,700
It's Obama's fault you see

55
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,720
The buck stops there

56
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,700
In the country, the quiet country

57
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,240
No nurses sleep tonight

58
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,880
But in the White House

59
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,820
The of shite house

60
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,040
The liar tweets tonight

61
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,660
Ah, ah

62
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,900
Ah, ah

63
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,600
Ah, ah

64
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,860
We are in the way

65
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,520
We are in the way

66
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,480
We are in the way

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,520
We are in the way

68
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,680
We are in the way

69
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,540
We are in the way

70
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,660
We are in the way

71
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,520
We are in the way

72
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:36,780
We are in the way

73
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:36,780


74
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,100
Ah, ah

75
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,100


76
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,380
We are in the way

77
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,400
We are in the way

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,520
We, he, our

79
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,160
We, he, our

80
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,200
We are in, the way

81
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,360
We're in, the way

82
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,300
We're in the way

83
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,300
We're in the way

84
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,200
We're in the way

85
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,160
We're in the way

86
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,180
We, we, the way

87
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,540
We,we, the way

88
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,080
We, we, the way

89
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,480
We, we, the way

90
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,020
Stay to including

91
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,480
We, we, the way

92
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,480


93
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,500
We, we, the way

94
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:57,500


95
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,800
This is the darkness.

96
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,400
These are the days

97
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,780
when the shadows

98
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,240
hid in human hearts

99
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
step out of the haze

100
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,760
and stand like blots of ink

101
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,500
in the bright of the day.

102
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,120
And the light can't chase them away.

103
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,980
This is the darkness.

104
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,300
Where is the sun?

105
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,240
You've traded your god of light

106
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,900
for one with a gun.

107
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,000
Empathy, justice, and mercy

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,240
only for once.

109
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,540
He deems to be the chosen.

110
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,160
This is the darkness.

111
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,760
This is the plague.

112
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,240
This is the embodiment

113
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,140
of all we have made.

114
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,480
Greed, personification,

115
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,540
heat in a suit and a tie.

116
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,360
A corpse searching for his bride.

117
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,360
This is the darkness.

118
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,480
This is the darkness.

119
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,100
These are the times

120
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,660
when you must decide

121
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,600
where you stand,

122
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,440
which side of the line.

123
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,840
Who you're gonna believe,

124
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,020
what you're gonna define.

125
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,960
For he will bend the truth

126
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,420
to fit your fears and absolutes

127
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,840
and it will leech into your soul,

128
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,720
pollute your mind.

129
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,160
This is the darkness

130
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,360
Where is the light?

131
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,500
It must still be up there somewhere

132
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,120
But you might be right

133
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,020
It might be days, weeks, and months

134
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,040
Of this long polar night

135
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,700
But I believe there's more of us

136
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,340
Than them

137
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,600
And prodigals return again

138
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,240
And scales can fall from clouded eyes

139
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,900
And moons can set

140
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,680
And suns can rise

141
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,060
And swords be hammered into plows

142
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,680
And all that crap

143
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
But this is now

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,740
This is now

145
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,820
And this is the darkness

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,480
This is the darkness

147
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,580
This is the darkness

148
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:49,860
This is the darkness

149
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,200
And Alec Baldwin

150
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,880
And here's the thing

151
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,940
Alec Baldwin

152
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,140
And the thing

153
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,560
Come back on mic anytime, Mouse Gang

154
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,460
Oh, thanks, Dr. Falk

155
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,560
I almost forgot

156
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,440
That last song was

157
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,680
Bob Walkenholz

158
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,380
This is the darkness

159
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,940
Brand new

160
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,580
From his Patreon page

161
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,440
Although he said

162
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,560
This hit was for free

163
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,260
So I can play it on the radio

164
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,720
Pretty damn somber

165
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,200
And old Bob is starting to sound

166
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,700
Even more scratchier voiced than I am

167
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,420
Although I like to think

168
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
He's just taking advantage

169
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,980
Of the high pollen count

170
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,580
Which is also affecting my voice

171
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,320
We're only about a month apart in age

172
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,260
But the cheery song

173
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,980
Before that

174
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,680
The Liar Tweets Tonight

175
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,340
Was by Roy Zimmerman

176
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,140
And on the same basic subject

177
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,300
Uh, yeah

178
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,320
Some of us miss our country

179
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,860
Okay, so I'm gonna do

180
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,260
Something different this episode

181
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,500
Actually, I probably did it before

182
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,760
But in 1984

183
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,100
What happened is

184
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,440
I pulled out my CD

185
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,100
Of the first two Oingo Boingo albums

186
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,160
Which were among my absolute faves

187
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,480
In the 1980s

188
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,300
For reasons that'll soon be obvious

189
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,220
If you're unfamiliar with this band

190
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,940
Oingo Boingo

191
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,400
Which later turned into

192
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,460
The movie composer

193
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,240
Known as Danny Elfman

194
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,100
Anyway, I hadn't listened to

195
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,380
Oingo Boingo in years

196
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,920
And I was surprised to discover

197
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,080
That I still remembered

198
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,360
Every single lyric

199
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,920
And I was not surprised

200
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,080
When all those songs were

201
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,740
Suddenly turned into

202
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,260
An immense brain worm

203
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,620
That's been tormenting me

204
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,620
And Princess We as well

205
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,880
For days

206
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,660
And of course

207
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,640
Like Cove Theft 19

208
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,480
The only way to cure myself

209
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,740
Of this brain worm

210
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,120
Is to give it to you

211
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,200
Dear listener

212
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,320
Oh, sorry

213
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,580
I should have covered my mouth

214
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,080
Or worn my new shirt

215
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,180
Or my Dobshead face mask

216
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,600
Which we have now

217
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,380
So anyway

218
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,820
I wanted to do this

219
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,560
Mostly Oingo Boingo show

220
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,300
But the big decision was

221
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,740
Do I arrange it

222
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,480
So it starts with the light

223
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,600
And hopeful stuff

224
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,760
And ends with the scary

225
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,660
And dark stuff

226
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,760
Or the other way around

227
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,640
And I decided on the other way around

228
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
And on a positive note

229
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,080
Let's not increase

230
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,460
The suicide statistics

231
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,100
Among subgeniuses

232
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,820
Which is the most common

233
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:57,820


234
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:57,820


235
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:57,820


236
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:57,820


237
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:57,820


238
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:57,820


239
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,200
This song

240
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,400
Perfect System

241
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,460
Is about where we were heading

242
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,960
Before all the crap

243
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,760
Hit the fan

244
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,340
And society may well

245
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,040
Head that way

246
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,660
Even faster

247
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,580
Once the virus

248
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,700
Kills off one type

249
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,360
Of dumbass

250
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,600
But leaves the other

251
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,700
Type of dumbass alive

252
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,800
The kind of dumbass

253
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,580
That's fine

254
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,680
With perpetual mask wearing

255
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,340
Complicated rules

256
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,040
Enforced manners

257
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,780
And isolation

258
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,020
From the others

259
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,420
Except by Facebook

260
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,280
Forever

261
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,800
I'm in love with you

262
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,540
I know

263
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,000
And I know that you love me too

264
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,900
I'm in love with you

265
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,620
I know

266
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,180
I'm in love with everyone too

267
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,080
Everyone too

268
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,820
When all comrades now you know

269
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,520
We're all brothers under the skin

270
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,980
We're all living in adjustments now

271
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,300
Living in a perfect system

272
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,080
The adjustments simple

273
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,540
There's really no pain

274
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,920
You hardly notice anything has changed

275
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,240
Living in a programmed life

276
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,460
Nothing really helps

277
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,560
Up and down

278
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,260
There's no need for fighting now

279
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,880
There's no reason to worry

280
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,080
Around one another

281
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,660
No, no, no

282
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,900
The perfect system

283
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,940
There's no confrontation

284
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,580
Unnecessary friction

285
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,680
To repeat our concentration

286
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,980
We've simply done away with

287
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,240
Unnecessary friction

288
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,180
I live in a system

289
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,340
I get enough occupation

290
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,740
I get enough nutrition

291
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,660
I get enough nutrition

292
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,900
By eating protein

293
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,680
Biscuits

294
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,120
Recommended by the system

295
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,720
It's routine regulation

296
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,280
I've handed an operation

297
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:13,120
To all the reasons

298
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,300
The definition of Www...

299
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,540
This isptions

300
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:22,540


301
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:22,560
Unquestioneable

302
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,140
Publicity

303
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,260
Reason

304
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,960
Mind

305
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,480
Unity

306
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,260
Health

307
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,420
I'm in love with you, I know

308
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,940
And I know that you love me too

309
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,760
I'm in love with you, I know

310
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,980
I'm in love with everyone too

311
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,260
I can tell by the look in your blank little eyes

312
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,840
That you agree, but you're not a bit surprised

313
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,860
Living in a programmed life

314
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,260
All the really hells of send-off

315
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,880
Don't need my fighting now

316
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,340
There's a tour of realm

317
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,400
I had an operation

318
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,980
With a reckless reaction

319
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
They tapped it with my brain some

320
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
It helped me see the reason

321
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,400
For living in the system

322
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,140
It helped me see the reason

323
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,840
For living in the system

324
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,680
We're all brothers in a perfect world

325
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,980
In a perfect world there is uniformity

326
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,760
We're all brothers in a perfect world

327
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,300
In a perfect world there is continuity

328
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,880
We're all brothers in a perfect world

329
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,160
There's no need for spontaneity

330
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,440
Perfect system

331
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,880
We're all brothers to the end

332
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,960
Brothers to the end

333
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,840
Brothers to the end

334
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,920
I know

335
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,100
And I know that you love me too

336
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,000
Promise to the end

337
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,840
I know

338
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,180
I'm in love with everyone too

339
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,100
Promise to the end

340
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,940
I know

341
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,220
We're all comrades under the skin

342
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,180
Promise to the end

343
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,000
I know

344
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,300
Living in a perfect system

345
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,320
Promise to the end

346
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,900
To the end

347
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,620
To the bitter end

348
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,180
I kind of want that operation he's talking about

349
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,280
Do you suppose some of these songs might be meant in

350
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,520
I don't know, in an ironic way?

351
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,120
Boy, just thinking about that makes my head hurt

352
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,620
I'm going to go to Trump's stop

353
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,460
And have one of those doctor prisoners

354
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,420
Give me that operation that makes me as intelligent as the president

355
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,420
I bet I'd probably sleep better

356
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,400
And I hear they have snacks

357
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,300
I'm sure they wouldn't lie about that

358
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,740
I'm pretty sure that everything the government promised us is coming

359
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,040
And it'll be just like they said it'll be

360
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:25,020
the end of this day

361
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,960
What you see

362
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,780
What you see is what you get

363
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,200
Don't relax, you're not home yet

364
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,740
What you see is what you get

365
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,280
Don't relax, you're not home yet

366
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,540
Put your life in my hands

367
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,300
Look around, you'll understand

368
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,720
Put your life into my hands

369
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,380
It's the 80s, idiots

370
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
What you see is what you get

371
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,180
It's the 80s, little fools

372
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,900
Don't forget the golden rule

373
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,640
What you see is what you get

374
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,220
What the hell do you expect?

375
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,720
Ritchie Red Rose

376
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,520
Ritchie Red Rose

377
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,940
White puppy noses

378
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,500
Men with rubber hoses

379
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,820
It's more like it

380
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:36,460
What you see is not always what you get

381
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,700
A lesson we must not forget

382
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,120
One never knows what to expect

383
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,900
So close your eyes

384
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,520
So close your eyes

385
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,900
And you'll get

386
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh

387
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,260
Here's what you see

388
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,660
And what you get

389
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,740
And what you get

390
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,280
And what you get

391
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,980
And what you get

392
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,220
Open up your eyes

393
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,520
And look around you

394
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,560
Wow, wow

395
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,520
And who's the giant Mr. Growl?

396
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,360
Wow, wow

397
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,420
You've got to be thankful you're alive

398
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,860
And how much longer can you survive?

399
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,700
Underneath the mask there's something brewing

400
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,220
Underneath the ground there's something we will find

401
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,760
And it's the golden rule

402
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,520
Put your life into my hands

403
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,260
Look around you and understand

404
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,600
It's the 80s, idiot

405
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,860
Idiot, idiot

406
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,620
What you see is what you get

407
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,860
What you get, what you get

408
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,480
It's the 80s, idiot, fool

409
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,140
Don't forget the golden rule

410
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,780
What you see is what you get

411
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,960
What you get, what you get

412
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,580
What the hell did you expect?

413
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,120
Pretty red roses

414
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,140
White puppy noses

415
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,660
Men in thwopper hoses

416
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,860
It's what I like it

417
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,420
But you're not the sweetest one for all of their friends

418
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,660
Bask you around and you'll make it like them

419
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,080
What you see is what you get

420
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,160
What a comforting song, don't you agree?

421
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,220
Yeah, eh, Oingo Boingo specialized in that

422
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,400
It's funny, it was announced that among the many musical combos

423
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,520
Danny Elfman was scheduled to perform at the now canceled

424
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,920
Bonnaroo or Hullabaloo or Woodstock or Coachella

425
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,100
One of those things

426
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,800
And all these kids were going, what's he gonna do?

427
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,140
Play the score of Batman

428
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,360
As if Oingo Boingo had never existed

429
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,840
Well, there you go

430
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm old

431
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,240
And tonight I'm playing oldies

432
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,320
That might have well have been recorded tomorrow

433
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,640
This upcoming song addresses the paranoia that so many of us feel

434
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,900
Especially those who are cooped up and surveilled

435
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,360
And feel like they're being watched all the time

436
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,420
I don't have to worry about that

437
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,780
Because for the last five years

438
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,740
I've been hacking and digging out escape routes

439
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,520
Through the deep woods surrounding our compound here

440
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,740
So when the black helicopters come for me

441
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,660
They'll never catch me

442
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,640
Until I get to the highway

443
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,900
Or unless they have dogs or infrared or armed sniffing drones

444
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,540
So yeah, I have nothing to worry about

445
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:18,280
Doing this anti-establishment show from a cult compound in Texas

446
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,640
Kind of near Waco

447
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,060
What, me worry?

448
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,780
I'll make a sound or even move

449
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,200
Don't give another doozy

450
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,760
I think they're looking for me

451
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,240
I get to run

452
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,560
I get to run

453
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,840
I get to run

454
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,060
I get to run

455
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,220
I get to run

456
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,200
I get to run

457
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,620
There's someone calling in my yard

458
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,080
There's someone creeping on my roof

459
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,260
There's someone tapping my ears

460
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,620
There's someone creeping around

461
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,060
I feel it deep in my bones

462
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,260
They want to throw my intuition

463
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,060
They want to find out what I know

464
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,800
Why don't they leave me all around?

465
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,220
Why don't they leave me all around?

466
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,440
I get to run

467
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,740
I get to run

468
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,980
I get to run

469
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,460
Might need a catcher

470
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,460
Or a night controller

471
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,820
Can't be too careful

472
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,900
I take precautions

473
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,240
They're very clever

474
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,460
I get to run

475
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,560
Faceless surgeons

476
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,260
I'm with razors

477
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,940
Cut out our imagination

478
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,280
There's someone knocking on my door

479
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,760
There's someone knocking on my door

480
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,280
I think they're looking for me

481
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,840
I think they're looking for me

482
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,260
But then there ain't nobody home

483
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,040
That makes a sound of even no boom

484
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,180
No giving nothing to see

485
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,700
I think they're looking for me

486
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,200
I get to run

487
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,520
I get to run

488
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,800
I get to run

489
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,120
Might need a catcher

490
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,240
Or a night controller

491
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,520
Can't be too careful

492
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,640
I take precautions

493
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,920
They're very clever

494
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,280
I get to run

495
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,900
I get to run

496
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,940
But then there ain't nobody home

497
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:41,940


498
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:41,940


499
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,440
I get to run

500
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:43,820
I get to run

501
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,600
I get to run

502
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,940
Might need a catcher

503
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,540
Or a night controller

504
00:22:47,540 --> 00:23:01,280
Soon I'll be my own

505
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,380
If I run

506
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:17,120
I go have to get glasses

507
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,120


508
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,120


509
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,120


510
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,780
There's those lobotomy surgeons again mentioned in that song.

511
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:02,220
Back in the days of Oingo Boingo, the 80s, we were worried about chemical and surgical lobotomies.

512
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,220
In the end, the invention of social media took care of all of that.

513
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,700
The prisoners are happiest when they build their own cages.

514
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,640
And seriously, do you think they're looking for you?

515
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,020
You wish. They don't consider you important.

516
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:28,380
And besides, you're throwing yourself at them every hour that you work at your 24-7 non-paying database entry job for Facebook.

517
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,720
Thank you, Oman.

518
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,120
Late at night, my wife and I have been dancing frenetically to these old songs.

519
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,260
It's good exercise and it baffles the dogs.

520
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,480
But I wish y'all could see my air vocals.

521
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,440
I also do air guitar.

522
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,300
I play guitar, drums, and keyboard when appropriate.

523
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:59,380
But I'm most proud of my air facial expressions and air vocals with Danny Elfman's remarkably theatrical and melodramatic singing style.

524
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,760
It's great rubber face exercise.

525
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,360
I'm proud of my own clownishly overdramatic facial and bodily poses.

526
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,360
I studied under Jimi Hendrix and other masters, so I realize I can't sing.

527
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,980
Now, that's for who we, but I look great faking it.

528
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:23,900
At least in my own mind and according to New Agers, that's all that counts.

529
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,580
Now, during this strange year of the new abnormal, a lot of my friends, the older ones and the ones who can still work at home,

530
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:42,000
which is a privileged bunch these days, are finally starting to go nuts with this sheltering in thing.

531
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,620
On the other hand, some are weird.

532
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:45,620


533
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,860
all like, hey, I could get used to this. I hate people anyway and feel horribly awkward in any

534
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:58,600
social situation. Me, I'm an old hand at being a hermit except when I have to pretend to be a

535
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,380
normal person in order to get things done and, you know, make a living.

536
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:34,860
This is my private life. I've got no friends to fear. I've got no problems, no cross to bear.

537
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,600
If you can find me, come and get me out of here.

538
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,800
This is my private place.

539
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,900
Everything is neat and clean.

540
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,260
The skeletons are hidden in the closet.

541
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,080
This is my private place. Can we get me out of here?

542
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,320
This is my private life.

543
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,880
This is my private life.

544
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,180
Can we get me out of here?

545
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,840
This is my private life.

546
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,360
This is my private life.

547
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,940
This is my private life.

548
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,020
This is my private life.

549
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,020


550
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,140
These are my private things.

551
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,480
They're there against the wall.

552
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,980
The dirty pictures, religious objects.

553
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,180
These are my private things.

554
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,660
Can we get them out of here?

555
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,700
This is my private bed.

556
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,180
This is where I lie at night.

557
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,320
Staring at a light bulb hanging out the ceiling.

558
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,780
Waiting for dreams to come and get me out of here.

559
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,060
Waiting for dreams to come and get me out of here.

560
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,480
Waiting for dreams to come and get me out of here.

561
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,740
In my humble room at night,

562
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,760
I often wander what preserved are not there.

563
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,240
What made kuroocs to look so wallet.

564
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:07,900
I stare at the people passing by.

565
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,360
They could not see me through my windows –

566
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,380
No shades, looks like I'm not even there

567
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,100
This is my private life

568
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,680
This is my private life

569
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,900
There's something dangerous I like

570
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,540
This is my private life

571
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,140
This is my private life

572
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,000
And all my problems are in trouble

573
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,580
What I really want to know

574
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Has it always been this way?

575
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,660
This is my private life

576
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,220
This is my private life

577
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,880
This is my private life

578
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,060
This is my private life

579
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,680
This is my private life

580
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,820
This is my private life

581
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,520
This is my private life

582
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,020
This is my private life

583
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,740
This is my private life

584
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,240
This is my private life

585
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,480
This is my private life

586
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:09,340
This is my private life

587
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,900
This is my private life

588
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,520
This is my private life

589
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,680
This is my private life

590
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,520
Islands in the sea

591
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,580
Are so much like me

592
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,460
They don't help that change

593
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,520
No emotion, no emotion

594
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,400
Islands on the land

595
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,440
Fly like feathered sand

596
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,060
Islands in the city

597
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,160
All alone in such a city

598
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,160
It's about to rain

599
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,840
Just face to face

600
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,740
When will it change?

601
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,560
When will it change?

602
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,200
Islands in the sea

603
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,580
What's come over me?

604
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,780
We are both surrounded by the water

605
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,120
Empty waters

606
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,620
Keep living sorry

607
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,260
And the fear it brings

608
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,620
Anything at all to break the love of life to me

609
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,700
It's about to rain

610
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,520
Just face to face

611
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,860
It's about to rain

612
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:21,820
Anything at all to break the love of life to me

613
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,120
It's about to rain

614
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,120


615
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,920
Nothing to lose

616
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,180
Nothing to lose

617
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,040
Nothing to lose

618
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,860
Nothing to lose

619
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:36,860


620
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,480
Aw, so much like me

621
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
They don't ever change

622
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,460
No emotions, no emotions

623
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,820
Island farmland

624
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,260
Dry like desert sand

625
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,800
Island to the city

626
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,980
All alone in such a city

627
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,920
Island to the sea

628
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,240
Island to the sea

629
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,360
Island to the sea

630
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,340
Island to the sea

631
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,880
Island to the sea

632
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,480
Island to the sea

633
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Oh, oh, oh

634
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,460
Island to the sea

635
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:04,060
Oh, oh, oh

636
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,540
Pretty grim, huh?

637
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,540
I'm personally not all that isolated.

638
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:09,500
So I have a solid and nearby family and a large network of friends that I actually know well and like very much.

639
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,100
So, see, I have a safety net.

640
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,900
Heck, I've got nothing to fear.

641
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,180
Nothing at all.

642
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,240
Hey, neighbor, let me give you some advice.

643
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,000
The Russians are about to pulverize us in our sleep tonight.

644
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:59,260
That is, if the crazy Arabs or the right don't get us first and the fire will rain down from the sky.

645
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,520
The fire will rain down.

646
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:30,500
The fire will rain down.

647
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,120
Now, drop your chest and drop your drop.

648
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,540
Hey, little girl, won't you come this way?

649
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,520
Hey, little girl, won't you come this way?

650
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,140
If I give candy or perhaps a chocolate shake or perhaps a nice cocaine.

651
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,980
Or perhaps a little kiss.

652
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,420
Or perhaps a ride in my big car.

653
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,360
Perhaps a ride in my big car.

654
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,980
Don't be afraid.

655
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:20,920
Don't be afraid.

656
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,920
Don't be afraid.

657
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,800
Don't be afraid.

658
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,540
Won't you make an old man happy?

659
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,440
Won't you make an old man happy?

660
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,340
Won't you let me show you paradise?

661
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,380
Don't ask your mother for advice.

662
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,400
Listen if you know the

663
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:44,420
music

664
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:44,420


665
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,240
music

666
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:45,260
music

667
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,520
music

668
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:00,520


669
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:00,520


670
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:00,520


671
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:00,520


672
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:00,520


673
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:00,520


674
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:00,520


675
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,640
There's nothing to fear

676
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,900
Temperature's taking a drop now

677
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,620
Temperature's taking a drop now

678
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,500
Temperature's taking a drop now

679
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:00,460
Temperature's taking a drop now

680
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:25,660
Temperature's taking a drop now

681
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,920
Everyone says

682
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,260
We've come such a long, long way.

683
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,140
We're civilized.

684
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,440
Isn't that nice?

685
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,640
We've gotten so smart.

686
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,000
We know how to build a whole world of fun.

687
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,440
When it comes to the simple things.

688
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,480
Like living together.

689
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:49,320
Ha!

690
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,540
Why'd we have to come all this way?

691
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,420
Is anything easier to understand?

692
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,460
Why'd we have to come all this way?

693
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,100
Our life is better than written in man.

694
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,460
We've been born in love, but we know better.

695
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,480
We've got to get it all just right together.

696
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,620
Stop wasting all my time.

697
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Why'd we come all this way?

698
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:57,840
Why'd we have to come all this way?

699
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,040
We couldn't quit while we were ahead.

700
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,100
We can't stop right now.

701
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,640
Why'd we come all this way?

702
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:06,960
Why'd we have to come all this way?

703
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:06,960


704
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,060
Why'd we have to end up like this?

705
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,040
We should've just stayed and understood.

706
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,840
Why'd we come all this way?

707
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,140
The road was long and the journey was hard.

708
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,120
That we're even dreaming that we've come so far.

709
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,260
Oh, ha!

710
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,200
We've been born all this way.

711
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,420
Why'd we come all this way?

712
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,500
Why'd we come all this way?

713
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,880
Why did we come all this way?

714
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,380
Why did we come all this way?

715
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,900
Why did we come all this way?

716
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,920
Does it look like this?

717
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,200
Doesn't it look enough like this?

718
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,860
Doesn't it look enough like this?

719
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,740
Doesn't it look enough like this?

720
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,220
Doesn't it look enough like this?

721
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


722
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,840
Why did we come all this way?

723
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,380
Why did we come all this way?

724
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,880
Why did we come all this way?

725
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,520
Why did we come all this way?

726
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,840
And did it have to end up like this?

727
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:58,360
Why did we come all this way?

728
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,260
Why didn't we come all this way?

729
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,060
I've been doing that lately.

730
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,580
I do really good air vocals and expressions to this one.

731
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,660
Have you seen my girlfriend?

732
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,100
She lives in a pig pen.

733
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,000
Have you seen my girlfriend?

734
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,420
I can't seem to find her.

735
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,660
Perhaps she is hiding underneath a plate of scraps.

736
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,940
Let's take the holy off.

737
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,340
Let's take the holy off.

738
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,400
Let's take the holy off.

739
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,520
Let's take the holy off.

740
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,340
Let's take the holy off.

741
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,420
Have you seen my new house?

742
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,580
Looks just like a dog house.

743
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,740
Have you seen my new house?

744
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,480
Someone saw it walking straight into the ocean.

745
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,100
Thought it was an ivory boat.

746
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,260
Let's take the holy off.

747
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,580
Let's take the holy off.

748
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,800
Let's take the holy off.

749
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,700
Let's take the holy off.

750
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,340
Let's take the holy off.

751
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:58,340


752
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,760
Let's take the holy off.

753
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,100
Let's take the holy off.

754
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,300
Let's take the holy off.

755
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,500
Let's take the holy off.

756
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,740
Let's take the holy off.

757
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,400
Maybe.

758
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,900
It's just a bad dream and a wake up soon.

759
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,180
But I don't think I'll be so lucky.

760
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:28,580
But I don't think I'll be so lucky.

761
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,320
Maybe.

762
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,960
It's the first one of those strange days when nothing's right.

763
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,980
No, nothing seems right at all.

764
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,040
When I threw a paper on a bathroom wall.

765
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,060
But I can't remember who I wanted to call.

766
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,200
Operator, can you help me?

767
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,120
Operator, can you help me?

768
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,120


769
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,160
Operator, can you help me?

770
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,160


771
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,160


772
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,180
We just dragged her to the bathroom.

773
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:15,180


774
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,500
I will find a bet.

775
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:18,960
You think you could lend me one?

776
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:18,960


777
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:18,960


778
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:18,960


779
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,680
I am going to have a go at you.

780
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:19,680


781
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:19,720
I am not gaming to win.

782
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:19,720


783
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:19,720


784
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:19,720


785
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:19,720


786
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:19,860
The only bad thing about cybersecurity is if the game makes you bendin' a finger forever.

787
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


788
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


789
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,120
What?

790
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,980
Anyway, think about going to school.

791
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:21,980


792
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,000
Is there nothing helping us to live when we're getting that routine?

793
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,240
Let's go home.

794
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,960
I ain't ain't.

795
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:27,460
Go away.

796
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,580
Have you seen my girlfriend?

797
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,660
Have you seen my girlfriend?

798
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:36,360
Okay, you think that one was a good rewardian subgenius theme song?

799
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,500
Listen to this.

800
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:45,260
It's a true all-purpose subgenius anthem from Oingo Boingo's second album,

801
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,080
the opening song, Grey Matter.

802
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,080
They say you're stupid that you're too young to fall

803
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:45,060
They say you swallow anything that they show down your throat

804
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:49,840
They say that you can't think that you haven't got a brain

805
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,740
That you're just there to listen, that you're just being trained

806
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,100
There's something inside your head

807
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,100
There's something inside your head

808
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,300
There's something inside your head

809
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,080
There's something inside your head

810
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,360
They say you lost the ability to even think

811
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:28,300
That your tiny little brain moves down the kitchen sink

812
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,860
They say that you'll buy anything that they turn away

813
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,060
That you're listening to everything that they decide to play

814
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,460
There's something inside your head

815
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,980
There's something inside your head

816
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,880
There's something inside your head

817
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,800
There's something inside your head

818
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,940
Grey Matter, Grey Matter

819
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,000
её

820
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:07,140
They matter, they matter

821
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,620
cess

822
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,280
They matter, they matter

823
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,380
Their music

824
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:14,480
Their music

825
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,440
I think you like it

826
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,940
Like it

827
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,820
To be told

828
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,620
What to do

829
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,440
Ain't that true

830
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,480
I

831
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,480
Think you're better

832
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,880
Better

833
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,360
Better

834
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,160
On

835
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,140
Storm come dead

836
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,940
Without your head

837
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,000
They say you're stupid

838
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,260
That you're too young to know

839
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,340
They say you'll swallow

840
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,880
Anything that they

841
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,240
Choke down and throw

842
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,320
If they say

843
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,200
You're doing it

844
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,780
They say

845
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,800
Right now

846
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,640
You're doing it

847
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,360
They say

848
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,280
Turn around

849
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,120
You're doing it

850
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:01,820
They say

851
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,780
Hit the ground

852
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,540
You're doing it

853
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,260
They say

854
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,260
Fight the big weenie

855
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:05,960
You're doing it

856
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,620
If they say

857
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,600
What is that good

858
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,400
You're doing it

859
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,120
If they say

860
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,160
Dead and over baby

861
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:10,940
You're doing it

862
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,600
If they say

863
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,280
Take it out

864
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:12,400
Now

865
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,360
You're doing it

866
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,280
There's Leading Inside Your Head

867
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:20,280
There's Dreaming Inside Your Head

868
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,260
There's Something Inside Your Head

869
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,220
There's Something Inside Your Head

870
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,480
There's Something Inside Your Head

871
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,940
Great Matter Great Matter

872
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,800
Great Matter Great Matter

873
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:37,800


874
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:37,800


875
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:37,800


876
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:37,800


877
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:37,800


878
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,360
Great Matter Great Matter

879
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:41,760
Hall

880
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,180
Hall

881
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:42,840
All

882
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,600
Great Matter Great Matter

883
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,680
They matter, they matter

884
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,200
They matter, they matter

885
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,660
They matter, they matter

886
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:32,640
They matter, they matter

887
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,280
They matter, they matter

888
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,140
They matter, they matter

889
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,060
Oh yes, dear friends.

890
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,600
Before I end the show,

891
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,980
with the ultimate Oingo Boingo subgenius anthem,

892
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,920
let me first explain I'm not personal friends

893
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,120
with Danny Elfman of Oingo Boingo.

894
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,740
We've never met, although we have friends in common,

895
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:01,320
and I have a picture of him as the devil in Forbidden Zone,

896
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,600
personally autographed to me personally.

897
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,800
He was given a copy of Book of the Subgenius

898
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,000
by Dr. G. Gordon Gordon under pleasurable circumstances,

899
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,600
a lot of pleasure.

900
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,500
He was a long time ago,

901
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,460
so he apparently remembers us well.

902
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,060
So it's mutual.

903
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,380
Anyway, this is Hour of Slack,

904
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:25,700
number one thousand seven hundred and seventy-six.

905
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,960
Seventeen seventy-six, huh?

906
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,680
You'd think I'd have some kind of

907
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,120
pertinent numerology quip about that.

908
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:41,020
But what's way more important is subgenius.com,

909
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,620
where you can learn about everything,

910
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,280
everything old, but also available.

911
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,940
It offers pathways to the newer subgenius things, too.

912
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:54,000
For instance, check out freethinkradio.com,

913
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,560
which carries all of the other subgenius shows and this one,

914
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,160
and triologiesoaps.com,

915
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,520
which can get you clean with Dobbs Head Soap,

916
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,860
and some of the ten million authorized and unauthorized

917
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:11,880
subgenius Facebook pages and whatnot, and so on.

918
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,640
But now, friends, a real anthem,

919
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:21,480
a feel-good anthem for subgenii from, like, 1980.

920
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,920
Boing-a-boing-a.

921
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,800
I'm just a clown, but I ain't got no pride.

922
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,120
I'm on the outside.

923
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:49,700
The girls look really cute, they really make it work.

924
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,280
They think I'm just a jerk.

925
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,620
I'm on the outside.

926
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,080
I never cooked and still, I never was too hip.

927
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,620
I never caught the ride.

928
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,980
I'm on the outside.

929
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,580
I'm on the outside.

930
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,640
I'm on the outside now.

931
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,520
This is where it all begins.

932
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,720
Right here.

933
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,800
On the outside looking in.

934
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,580
I'm on the outside.

935
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,520
I never was a punk.

936
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,040
I never shot junk.

937
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,500
I never even tried.

938
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,280
Counterculture passed me right by.

939
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,880
Don't talk to debutantes.

940
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,120
Don't eat in restaurants.

941
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,880
The patrons sit and stare.

942
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,320
The winners make wisecracks behind my back.

943
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,820
The teachers there in school, they front me by the rule.

944
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,480
They said I have no motivation.

945
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,600
These are all delicious brains of dedication.

946
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,620
Honestly, am I so sure right?

947
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,860
I'm on the outside.

948
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,360
I'm on the outside.

949
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,500
I'm on the outside now.

950
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,420
This is where it all begins.

951
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,560
On the outside looking in.

952
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:55,260
Looking in.

953
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,780
I am you.

954
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:02,840
I'm just a alien through and through, trying to make believe I'm you.

955
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,320
Trying to fit.

956
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,260
Just a stranger on the outside looking in.

957
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,060
The pistol makes me sick

958
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,140
I wear the wrong clothes, I see the wrong things

959
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,960
You know I can't dance, my feet are much too wide

960
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,540
Who thinks you set the trends?

961
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:48,480
You wear your head as right, your clothes are out of sight

962
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,520
Your house is modern, really kitsch

963
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,420
You get so macho when you're with your bitch

964
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,900
I see them go to work, I see them go to sleep

965
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,980
I see them on TV, I see them laugh and cry

966
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,960
I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside

967
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,540
I'm on the outside

968
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,480
On, on the outside

969
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,220
I'm on the outside

970
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:23,680
I'm on the outside now

971
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,360
This is where it all begins

972
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,340
I'm on the outside looking in

973
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,580
Looking in at you

974
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,400
I'm just an alien through and through

975
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,040
Let's cut back on the talk

976
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,040


977
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:42,240
Trying to make believe I'm you, trying to fix

978
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:47,240
Just a stranger on the outside looking here

979
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:56,560
I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside now

980
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:02,680
I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside now

981
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,920
I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside now

982
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,660
I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside now

983
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:08,540
I mean, some of us have work-at-home jobs and pensions and whatnot,

984
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:16,920
and Dave is worse off than most of our other old friends.

985
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,680
He's unemployed.

986
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,940
He was a newspaper reporter, but they don't do that anymore.

987
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:32,240
And he just had a car wreck, not his fault, other guy's fault.

988
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:39,140
But the lawyer wants money, and he doesn't have a car.

989
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:47,180
He's desperate to get a hold of a car because he can't walk to the stores anymore.

990
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,580
It's over a mile, and he's having problems with his legs.

991
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,320
Yeah, Dave's not in real great health.

992
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:57,720
He's actually, I think, about 70 years old.

993
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,180
Yes.

994
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:01,660
And has had heart conditions.

995
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,900
Probably coming back.

996
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,520
And he's a charity case, man.

997
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:14,860
And there is a GoFundMe on the subgenius.com radio page.

998
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:18,180
You should just look at subgenius.com, look across the top.

999
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,760
There's a bunch of little indexes.

1000
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,460
One is radio, HOS for hour of slack, or hose.

1001
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:32,300
But it's, you go there, and there's a link to the GoFundMe.

1002
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:37,020
It's too complicated for me to read like this.

1003
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,980
And you wouldn't want to have to write it down on the slide.

1004
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:48,300
The other simple thing to do is there's a little donation button on the beginningofsubgenius.com homepage

1005
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,200
and in the hour of slack page.

1006
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:59,280
And if you want to just throw some, you know, 10 bucks of PayPal money at Dave, send it to me.

1007
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,540
Just say what it's for, and I'll send it on.

1008
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:02,860
I'll send it to him.

1009
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,940
I send him a check every week for his phone bill and then some for the show

1010
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:15,740
and advance royalties on his book Neighbor World, which is also still available.

1011
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:20,660
And if you haven't read it, it's great.

1012
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,740
It's really amazing.

1013
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,960
It's not like anything else except Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1014
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,960
It is like Lonesome Cowboy Dave, but not in the way you expect.

1015
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:32,600
It's another.

1016
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,240
It's a novel, a science fiction novel with characters.

1017
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:42,360
Well, you can draw comparisons between that and Stand on Zanzibar, I think,

1018
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:47,260
and the one in your little bit on the back cover that you wrote.

1019
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:52,340
Oh, well, we compare it to the Firesign Theater, Federico Fellini's surreal movies,

1020
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:59,580
Kurt Vonnegut, and, oh, of course, William Gibson.

1021
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:06,740
And Clockwork Orange, because it's written in future slang to some extent.

1022
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:12,280
Anyway, Neighbor World, it's only $14 for the print version.

1023
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,480
I think the Amazon Kindle version is only $7.

1024
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:21,240
Dave gets more if you buy the print version from subgenius.com.

1025
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:29,100
But really, if you've got anything to spare, you know, I don't do begging very often.

1026
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:33,680
Not nearly as much as some preachers do.

1027
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:42,200
And this one is for a very, very specific and spectacularly needy case.

1028
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,340
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1029
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,120
Dave DeLuca.

1030
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:54,740
Look at the subgenius.com radio page or the donations button.

1031
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,860
And send me a little note.

1032
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,560
Stang at subgenius.com.

1033
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:06,620
It's not like we're overworked and flooded with contributions.

1034
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:13,080
So go ahead and feel free to help out in any small way you can.

1035
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,760
Any way you can.

1036
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,960
It'll help the morale of the old cowboy.

1037
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:21,440
Yes.

1038
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,360
He is pretty lonesome.

1039
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:29,100
He's got a sister, and he has a grown son and grandkids.

1040
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,540
They're in Ashtabula.

1041
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:37,780
But friends, Ashtabula, Ohio is kind of like Appalachia, West Virginia.

1042
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,420
It's one of the most depressed areas in the country.

1043
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:41,940
It really is.

1044
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:47,840
You can find heavenly spots there, but Dave's house is not one of them.

1045
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:48,360
No.

1046
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:57,780
He just needs to get a $300 car to get him here and there.

1047
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,220
Just.

1048
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:58,640
Just.

1049
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:58,720
Just.

1050
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:04,180
We can just get back to some vestige of a human life.

1051
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,060
And we owe Dave, friends.

1052
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:12,060
And yes, I'm helping Dave as much as I possibly can.

1053
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,500
So you can too.

1054
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:14,800
Praise Bob.

1055
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,680
Praise Dave.

1056
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,660
Hate to get serious on you like this.

1057
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:24,220
But hey, you know, Church of the Subgenius can get kind of real.

1058
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,480
In fact, to tell the truth, friends,

1059
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:32,160
and I say this as Reverend Ivan Stang, Sacred Squad Number 273,

1060
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:38,120
what surprised Philo and me the most was how useful it would be socially.

1061
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,020
We honestly didn't expect that.

1062
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,820
But people keep telling us they meet their very best friends.

1063
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,560
And I know that's certainly true of me and you, Princess Wee.

1064
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,380
It seems to be the hallmark of the religion to me.

1065
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:56,840
It's the.

1066
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,860
Alliances made within it.

1067
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,440
People's friendships.

1068
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,220
Like marriages.

1069
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:01,920
And marriages.

1070
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:02,680
Yes.

1071
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,560
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

1072
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,920
Anyway, okay.

1073
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,980
Thank you for listening.

1074
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,720
And we totally appreciate.

1075
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:17,220
If you're too broke, we understand.

1076
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:19,340
We sure understand.

1077
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:19,860
We understand.

1078
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:21,460
Do not consider.

1079
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:26,560
I mean, I'm only saying if you are one of the lucky ones.

1080
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,640
This might be a good time to help.

1081
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,540
Praise that old Bob.

1082
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:33,960
He.

1083
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,920
He wasn't as bad as everybody says.

1084
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,580
No, he wasn't as bad as everyone says.

1085
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:41,740
Praise Bob.

1086
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,200
Yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda.

1087
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:46,860
Yadda, yadda.
