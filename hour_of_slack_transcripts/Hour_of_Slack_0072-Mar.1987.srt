00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,220
This announcement from the producers of this record contains important information for radio program directors and is not for broadcast.

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,180
Home users of this record may disregard this announcement.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,180
The following cut has been cross-format focused for airplay.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,540
As you well know, a record must break on radio in order to actually provide a living for the artists involved.

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:41,060
Up until now, you've had to make these record-breaking decisions on your own, relying only on the perplexing intangibilities of taste and intuition.

6
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,700
But now, there's a better way.

7
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:54,380
The cut that follows is the product of newly developed compositional techniques based on state-of-the-art market analysis technology.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,240
This cut has been analytically designed.

9
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,280
The cut is designed to break on radio.

10
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,900
And it will.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,640
Sooner or later.

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,820
For the station that breaks it first, the benefits are obvious.

13
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:21,220
And no matter what share of the market you do business in, no other release is going to be quite so suitable for your corporation's current idea of good radio.

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,440
On this cut, we're working together on the same wavelength.

15
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,040
In scientific harmony.

16
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,940
But remember, this cut is constructed for multi-market breaking now.

17
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,100
Don't waste valuable research with needless delay.

18
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,100
We've done the hard work of ensuring your success.

19
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,300
The final step is up to you.

20
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:55,740
Special Designer Song follows in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,380
...

22
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:03,580
...

23
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:14,720
...

24
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:14,900
...

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,580
...

26
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:17,600
...

27
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,120
...

28
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,140
...

29
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,140


30
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,140


31
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,140


32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,140


33
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,140


34
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,160
...

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,160


36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,160


37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,160


38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,160


39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,160


40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,240
...

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,240


42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,240


43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,240


44
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,740
Just a minute

45
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,240
Just a minute

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,460
Just a minute

47
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,820
I can't hear a thing

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,300
Quiet please

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,240
Is there any escape?

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,460
Oh, there's so much noise

51
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,300
I can't hear the music

52
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,180
Is there any escape?

53
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,440
The noise

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,700
One orchestra in this

55
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,240
Oh

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,880
Oh

57
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,240
Oh

58
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,580
Oh

59
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:27,680
Oh

60
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,040
Oh

62
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,520
Oh

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,520


64
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,520


65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,520


66
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,520


67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,520


68
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,520


69
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,520


70
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,300
Oh

71
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,300


72
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,940
Oh

73
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,500
Oh

74
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,420
Oh

75
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,300
Oh

77
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
Oh

78
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,600
Oh

79
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,620
Oh

80
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:52,620


81
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,180
Oh

82
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,180


83
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,180


84
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,180


85
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,980
Praise Bob!

86
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,840
Help me somebody.

87
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,840
What a work of strange it is.

88
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,600
That was Negative Land.

89
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,920
What used to be their unreleased album that I've been playing, Escape from Noise.

90
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,680
And actually it turns out why it's not unreleased anymore.

91
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,360
Oh shoot, this tape deck here is acting funny.

92
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:31,980
There we go.

93
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,180
Ah, some lovely intro music.

94
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:46,960
You are now listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

95
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:54,340
That wacky subgenius show here on KNO and 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

96
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,140
And yeah, as I was saying, that song there,

97
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,520
Escape from Noise.

98
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,440
Escape from Noise is from the Negative Land album, Escape from Noise,

99
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,440
which is now available on SST Records.

100
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,820
For you punksters and pinksters out there, you may know about SST Records.

101
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,100
Smooth.

102
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,180
Negative Land's previous three albums are also available on Ralph now.

103
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,920
Ralph Records.

104
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,840
And get this, friends.

105
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,920
One of the Negative Land guys, I talked to him last week,

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,340
and he said that he gave the people,

107
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,280
Ralph, a copy of the Hour of Slack.

108
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,440
And they asked him, the next week,

109
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,840
they called him up and asked him about the song Half-Assed Drunk by Doctors for Bob.

110
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,720
So we may end up finally, Doctors for Bob, finally.

111
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,620
It's about time, man.

112
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,440
It's about time.

113
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,100
So I hope, I hope that happens.

114
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,420
But tonight on the Hour of Slack,

115
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,880
it's going to be a, it's going to be a musical kind of show

116
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,060
because frankly, I'm, I'm just, I'm, I'm burned is what I am.

117
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,860
I've been burned every, the last four shows, I know.

118
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,380
And I'll tell you, I'll finally, now, now that I've almost finished the job,

119
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,100
I'll tell you what the horrible job has been that I've been working on.

120
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,260
And that was the, well, I'm writing another book.

121
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,140
It's not exactly like Book of the Subgenius,

122
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,680
which will be re-released pretty quick here.

123
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,320
Whoa, that's a scary one, dude.

124
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,680
But, uh, uh, this new one is a book of,

125
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,380
of books.

126
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,840
It's called, um, Cosmic Awareness, Ultimate Hipness,

127
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,000
and Utter Strangeness by Mail Cheap.

128
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,340
And it won't be available for, uh, quite a,

129
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,340
well, probably till near the end of the year.

130
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,080
But for the last month, just before coming into the Hour,

131
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,200
from Hour of Slack to Hour of Slack,

132
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,340
without any sleep in between,

133
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,500
I've been sitting wrapped around a computer.

134
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,340
And when I laid down, then the Will of Dobbs would come in

135
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,620
and type stuff on the computer.

136
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,440
And, um, and I've been wading through kook literature.

137
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,940
Uh, you know, hollow earth societies and flat earth societies and so forth.

138
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,880
And, um, speaking of kook literature, uh,

139
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,200
the Will of Dobbs just handed me the paper here.

140
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,960
It says that a Florida man's gift meets Robert,

141
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,940
Oral Roberts' goal.

142
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:24,200
On the eve of Evangel, uh, Evangelist Oral Roberts' scheduled fast for contributions.

143
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,600
I thought he was gonna die for it.

144
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,340
I thought he was gonna die for contributions.

145
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,960
This guy comes along, a dog track owner,

146
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:36,340
donated 1.3 million to meet Robert's 8 million dollar goal.

147
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,940
And, uh, I mean, I had to die last week and, and, and get open heart surgery right here in the station

148
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,200
just to get a few pennies out of you cheapskates.

149
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,240
It's disgusting.

150
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,100
So anyway, um, this is, you won't be hearing,

151
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,520
you won't have Reverend Stanley.

152
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,700
You're not getting to kick around anymore.

153
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,260
I'm gonna quit talking on this show.

154
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,400
It's gonna be all music.

155
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,100
Or, not all music.

156
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,120
Some of it is gonna be some-

157
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,500
There'll be some yacking and rapping.

158
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,080
But we got some nifty sub-genius music and, uh,

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,740
God, listen to that disco, Darth Vader theme.

160
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,260
Yeah!

161
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,020
Whoo!

162
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:13,940
Yeah!

163
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,120
Oh, yeah!

164
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,100
Oh, yeah!

165
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:18,980
Oh, yeah!

166
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,880
Oh, yeah!

167
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,160
Oh, yeah!

168
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,860
Oh, yeah!

169
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,920
Oh, yeah!

170
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,660
Oh, yeah!

171
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,580
Oh, yeah!

172
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,140
And this coming up here is Onan Canobite.

173
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,320
You ought to recognize this song.

174
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,860
Onan Canobite.

175
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,460
I'm strange but not a stranger.

176
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,880
I'm an ordinary guy.

177
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,560
Burning down the house.

178
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,320
Hold tight.

179
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,660
Wait till the party's over.

180
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,400
Hold tight.

181
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,560
We're in for nasty weather.

182
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,300
There has got to be a way.

183
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,560
Burning down the house.

184
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,200
Here's your ticket.

185
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,580
Pack your bags.

186
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,460
Time for jumping overboard.

187
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,780
Transportation is here.

188
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
Close enough but not too far.

189
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,100
Maybe you know where you are.

190
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,100
Fighting fire with fire.

191
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,060
Ah!

192
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,020
All wet.

193
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,480
Hey, you might need a raincoat.

194
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,020
Shake down.

195
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,500
You ain't walking in broad daylight.

196
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:03,860
Three hundred sixty-five degrees.

197
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,740
Burning down the house.

198
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,940
Well it was once upon a place.

199
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,400
Sometimes I listen to myself.

200
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,340
Gonna come in this place.

201
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,160
There are people on their way to work.

202
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,540
And baby what did you expect?

203
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
What a burden.

204
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:25,560


205
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:25,900
But the

206
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,700
productive garden.

207
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,600
What about seeds?

208
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,360
Avos?"

209
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,920
Just another good thing.

210
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,540
I'm missing my pet peeve.

211
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,440
The fire.

212
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,200
That's right, don't wanna hurt nobody

213
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,060
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet

214
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,640
But it's down the house

215
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,860
There's no reasonable means of support

216
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,600
And you have not seen nothing yet

217
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,380
Everything's stuck together

218
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,140
And I don't know what you expect

219
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,660
Staring into the TV set

220
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,600
Fighting fire with fire

221
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,240
Oh-oh

222
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,320
Oh-oh

223
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,620
Oh, yeah, well thank you. That was Reverend Onan Canabite.

224
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,140
For a young feller, he's been a subgenius for a long time.

225
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,720
He's from Knoxville with a band called Occupant.

226
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,520
And you can only get that through being a member of the Church of the Subgenius,

227
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,700
which I can't advertise too much in here,

228
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,120
because I'm not a member.

229
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,620
Because this is a public radio station.

230
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,140
I'm not paying for the ad.

231
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,000
But keep those recorders on,

232
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,340
because this thing coming up here,

233
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,620
this is some more subgenius music

234
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,540
from Reverend Gord Don Truby,

235
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,120
once of the Dancing Cigarettes,

236
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,080
only he's not singing on it.

237
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,060
Just, this is an incredible piece of tape editing,

238
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,800
is what it is.

239
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,460
So hang in there here.

240
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,560
Listen to this.

241
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,340
Listen to this.

242
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,580
Listen to this.

243
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,380
Listen to this.

244
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:54,680


245
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,320
What I'm going to tell you now may shock some of you,

246
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,920
but it's the truth.

247
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,860
I was in the rock music scene.

248
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,740
I was a part of it for years.

249
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,800
I was a musician.

250
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,600
I was a singer.

251
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,380
Singing about what the kids want to hear.

252
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,000
Speed and pop.

253
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,220
Sex outside of marriage.

254
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,740
Said old masochistic sexual techniques involving

255
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,400
leathers, razors, and spiked heels.

256
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,340
Money.

257
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,260
Stink and the stench and the filth and the rot

258
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,540
and the bondage and the darkness.

259
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:23,820
Sports.

260
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Listen to this.

261
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,520
One of the greatest days of my life.

262
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,060
This particular night I was there with crowd control.

263
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,140
The museum was packed with capacity with tens of thousands of people.

264
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,680
Thousands, thousands, thousands, thousands, thousands there that night.

265
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,840
The air was heavily made with marijuana.

266
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,360
Marijuana smokes are thick.

267
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,760
You could get high by just being in the place.

268
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,260
You could get high walking through it.

269
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,500
And the scene was straight out of Danny's Inferno.

270
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,440
It was like animals.

271
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,000
It was like dogs.

272
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,680
Sponsoring this huge.

273
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,620
Travaganza will be.

274
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,540
Some of the mightiest corporations in the United States of America.

275
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,240
Forgive my body to this truth until it was black and blue.

276
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:09,920
I mean it.

277
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,620
I'd get down on my hands and knees.

278
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,200
I'd give them anything they wanted.

279
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,180
They're like God.

280
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,020
They're even better than God.

281
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,600
Listen to this.

282
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,740
To be blunt.

283
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:30,780
You will, after the show is over, you'll go backstage and let these animals do about anything they want to do to you.

284
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,600
So what?

285
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,320
It would be worth it to me.

286
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,600
Listen to this.

287
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,520
Listen to this.

288
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,320
Listen to this.

289
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,900
I awaited on the couch to the flaring reverberation of a monstrous,

290
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,000
I awaited on the couch to the flaring reverberation of a monstrous,

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,160
stereo that had played all night long.

292
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,980
I lit a stale cigarette set up to attempt to focus on my immediate surroundings.

293
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:03,860
Garbage, cigarette butts, dope trays, needles and albums were strung about with clothes ankle deep on the floor.

294
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:11,420
I reached forward to begin consuming one of the leftover untouched drinks when I noticed the television set was on.

295
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,360
I almost turned it off.

296
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,660
But something said watch it.

297
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,140
I looked at my life.

298
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,240
It means nothing anymore.

299
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,680
Do you hear me?

300
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,980
It means nothing anymore.

301
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,340
I sat there crammed in thick, battling with myself and the devil.

302
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,180
Whether to make an altar right there in front of that TV set.

303
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,800
Finally I declared to myself that I couldn't make it on my own.

304
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,640
I had to turn to somebody bigger than me.

305
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,520
My previous dope dealer.

306
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,880
Listen to this.

307
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,680
Listen to this.

308
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,400
Listen to this.

309
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:58,140
God has told me that your parents or anyone else who tells you what to do is the devil and you ought to shout right back at them.

310
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,480
No I'm not a Christian.

311
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,420
I'm not a Christian.

312
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,060
No.

313
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,360
I had anything to do with that.

314
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,200
I'm not a Christian.

315
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,560
I want to say it so plain that a two year old child will understand me.

316
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,620
Be vocal.

317
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,560
Be loud.

318
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,680
Be concise.

319
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,020
And be clear.

320
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,940
I don't care who you are.

321
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,640
I don't care who you are.

322
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,260
I don't care how you speak.

323
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,260


324
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,260


325
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,260


326
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,200
It's a coverup.

327
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,820
It's a sham.

328
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,460
It's a facade.

329
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,300
There is no God.

330
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,060
Man is God.

331
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,380
Yes I know.

332
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,540
Yes I know.

333
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,940
There is no God.

334
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,820
Man is God.

335
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,100
Yes I know.

336
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,740
Yes I know.

337
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,120
Yes I know.

338
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,920
No I'm not a Christian.

339
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,920
I'm not a Christian.

340
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,560
Nope.

341
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,420
Christian.

342
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,740
A Christian.

343
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,700
A Christian.

344
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,460
Held up to the American public as that which is good and noble.

345
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,620
when in reality it is dirty and preventing filthiness.

346
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,680
You better take a strong look, mister, at where you're going to church.

347
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,660
Man!

348
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,520
Oh, that was so fun.

349
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,920
That was Reverend Gordon Truby.

350
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,200
And that's a tape that just came in.

351
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,740
Let me yank that booger out.

352
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,380
Called Post-Hyp-gnosis.

353
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,980
Um, and I wish I knew where to tell you to buy that, but you can't!

354
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,580
If you didn't have that tape deck,

355
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,220
you're just going to have to tune in to Swaggart more often.

356
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,920
He's the greatest, man.

357
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,380
Swaggart, he's the Jimmy, he's the Mick Jagger of evangelists.

358
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,460
He really is.

359
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,200
I love the man.

360
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,640
I...

361
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,140
I want to talk like him.

362
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,440
I want to talk like Jimmy Swaggart.

363
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,360
And I did, I used to, till I ripped off all his best lines.

364
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,300
And now I'm preaching the word of Bob.

365
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,440
We must protect our vanishing numbers.

366
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,000
Friends, human hunters have number skinners.

367
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,060
I mean, these numbers come along, they get their little lines stuck in a trap.

368
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,020
They'll chew the edge of their selves off and lose a whole...

369
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,440
They don't mean...

370
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,460
They don't mean anything after that.

371
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,880
We get a whole bunch of them together.

372
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,760
Eventually, we could get a whole year.

373
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,200
Hold on.

374
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,840
He still has to pay us three dollars.

375
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,800
What the...

376
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,620
Yeah, Mr. Stang?

377
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,180
I want to...

378
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,980
Stang?

379
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,160
I want to tell you how much I appreciate you coming down here,

380
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,300
all the way out here from Texas,

381
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,740
trying to straighten these boys out.

382
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,820
They made a mess of this show.

383
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,300
They need some help.

384
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,260
Help me.

385
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,880
Yeah, it's beyond help.

386
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,180
It's beyond help.

387
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,560
I...

388
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,260
I think you're right.

389
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,860
I think you're right.

390
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,380
I thought for four, five...

391
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,100
Four, five years that they were praising Bob like good subgeniuses.

392
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,380
I come down here and they celebrate his death like it was some kind of a happy event.

393
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,180
Oh, we're free.

394
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,020
Ding dong.

395
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,540
The Dobbs is dead.

396
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,280
It's a subgenius rip-off.

397
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,680
They're using Bob.

398
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,840
That got seven of gunfire.

399
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,260
Just imagine those bullets passing into a Dobbs course.

400
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,880
People have lost their sense of joy in your life.

401
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,940
Most of those guys are just...

402
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,700
It brings so much joy.

403
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,420
I hope you can make these guys see the light and do right by Bob.

404
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,420
They're making a mess.

405
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:11,980
They're making a mess out of Bob.

406
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,700
We always see light when we press our fingers against our eyelids.

407
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,400
Turtle darkness.

408
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,840
Yes, that turtle darkness is so slow moving.

409
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,980
I don't know why I listen to it anymore.

410
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,400
Well, I can't tell you if you can't tell me.

411
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,840
We don't know why we do it.

412
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,680
I'm not talking to you.

413
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,900
I'm talking to Mr. Smith.

414
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,900
Smith.

415
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,360
Smith.

416
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,260
Wait a minute.

417
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,060
Mr. Smith?

418
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,980
Mr. Smith.

419
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,000
What do you guys do?

420
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,860
Take him off the air?

421
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,340
No, no.

422
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,340
Include his own history.

423
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,180
He left.

424
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,120
You're mixed.

425
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,340
This old man started the subgenius movement.

426
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,020
Oh, yeah.

427
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,900
He's our boss.

428
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,480
Oh, yeah.

429
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,900
Hey, Bob Dobbs started the Church of the Subgenius in 1953.

430
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,020
Let's not drag the pathetic humans in.

431
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,080
They don't tell us the truth.

432
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,040
Fine.

433
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,180
You see this fine fellow is more interested in producing the honest doctors of the air

434
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,240
than in listening to Ivan Stang himself.

435
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,260
Thank you for your concern.

436
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:09,780
Vote.

437
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,700
Vote.

438
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:10,960
Vote.

439
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:11,440


440
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,520
You guys don't know how to raise money.

441
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,380
Vote.

442
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,800
Well, let's hold this discussion for a moment and go from yet our other little flashing

443
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,760
hunger greets.

444
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,760
We know how to kill Bob.

445
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,240
We know how to kill people.

446
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,900
We wish we didn't kill Bob.

447
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,500
Bob's death has made you more crazy than Bob ever was.

448
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,900
How are you?

449
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,600
You on air?

450
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,460
Is it time for the ceremonial killing of Bob?

451
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,800
Oh, you missed it by about two years.

452
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,920
Oh, my goodness.

453
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,460
Sorry.

454
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,420
Hey, I'm sorry.

455
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,080
I know something.

456
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,220
There'll be a head-launching in 20 minutes, though, in a mile.

457
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,740
You know, there's a scandal going on.

458
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,340
People are saying that Shakespeare was actually bombed.

459
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,480
The barrage is getting closer, Lieutenant.

460
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,140
Do you think we ought to move from this position?

461
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
No, I think we ought to crawl a little closer.

462
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:58,980
We have to.

463
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,380
One, two, three, hop!

464
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:08,980
K-M-O-N-19.9-L-M stereo, the home of alternative rock and roll.

465
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,080
If you didn't hear it here, it is where?

466
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,260
The home of alternative rock and roll.

467
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,020
Y'all hear about somebody?

468
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,480
This is Devo, new Devo.

469
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,320
You can't get it in a store.

470
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,580
You can only get it from Bob, dear friends.

471
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,980
Only from Bob.

472
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,940
And who am I?

473
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,340
A son of all the people who wasted lots of time.

474
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,380
Pulling him out the future, forever asking why.

475
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,960
Some people go on living while others die before their time.

476
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,860
There has never been a reason, whatever is his right.

477
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,800
It's only just because it's much too big a fight.

478
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,900
Like a sailor who is way ahead, but we're still far behind.

479
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,260
You won't be quite yourself out when you start swinging slides.

480
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,380
These are things to have in that side.

481
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:38,960
These are things to have in that side.

482
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,500
These are things to have in that side.

483
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,500
These are the things we could rather not be dead.

484
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,860
These are things that could rather not be dead.

485
00:22:52,520 --> 00:23:06,140
These are the things to have in that side.

486
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,860
These are things you have to have.

487
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,380
You've got parallelimate

488
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,640
In the Interviewer receptors.

489
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,620
In the Interviewer receptors.

490
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:35,620


491
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,440
Why try to remain silent?

492
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:37,800
Why try to remain silent?

493
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,960
We're instantly observed.

494
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:38,960


495
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:38,960


496
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,440
The simple people even some don't turn inside out

497
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,280
Shaking each dimension, we're so sure about

498
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,680
The creeds get so frustrated, the fancy's turned bright

499
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,820
A simple box of common sense, just money in the bank

500
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,020
These are the things to understand

501
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,160
These are the things to understand

502
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,160
These are the things that keep you better out than dead

503
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,900
These are the things to understand

504
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,440
These are the things to understand

505
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,600
These are the things to understand

506
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,740
These are the things to understand

507
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,780
These are the things to understand

508
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,000
These are the things that keep you better out than dead

509
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,820
These are the things to understand

510
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,100
These are the things that keep you better out than dead

511
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,880
Oh, my gosh.

512
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,900
Oh, we gotta quit talking dirty now, Will.

513
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,840
Uh, well, so much for them spud boys, so to speak, for a little while.

514
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,520
What's... wait a minute.

515
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,780
That wasn't what I wanted to put on there.

516
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,600
Uh, friends, you can call and, uh, and talk to the Will of Dobbs

517
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,400
and, um, you know, get your two bits worth in, what that's worth.

518
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,580
Not much, in your case.

519
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,400
Heathens, sinners, not a one of you listening is a subgenius member.

520
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,200
Well, there's probably five or six subgenius ministers listening.

521
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,400
The rest of y'all are a bunch of damn riffraff.

522
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,760
But, um...

523
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:15,540
Uh, you can call the Will of Dobbs here at 823-7490 or 828-9500.

524
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,440
That's 823-7490 or 8... uh, what is it?

525
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,980
828-9500.

526
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,460
See, you know, I haven't had any sleep in a couple of days.

527
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,200
That, that doesn't impress you, I know.

528
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:36,780
But, see, I gotta finish playing this tape of me on the San Francisco radio show

529
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,740
because I'm gonna be on the radio.

530
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,880
I'm gonna be on the San Francisco radio show next Saturday morning.

531
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,680
What?

532
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,520
L-O-U on air.

533
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,940
Just like this.

534
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,040
Not again.

535
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,840
See, I told you.

536
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,920
We get those calls in Dallas.

537
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,380
Okay, now look, I'm not going out this time.

538
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,960
One of you guys go...

539
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,560
I went out two times and nobody else did it the last time.

540
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,060
Somebody else can go out and pick that thing up.

541
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,740
Call the animal control board.

542
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,000
I mean, I normally eat road kills, but I don't know about a smashed dog.

543
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,580
We'll have to send one of those...

544
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,760
Uh, animal control trucks over.

545
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,600
It's no good.

546
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,840
It's destroyed, man.

547
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,560
It's destroyed.

548
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,320
Fifty cars ran over it before anybody would stop.

549
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,340
Well, you know, but the cells can still...

550
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,300
One cell carries all the code information to create a new Dobbs.

551
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,460
You cook that thing just like you cook abalone.

552
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,860
You peel that dog's corpse right off the road.

553
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,020
You dip it in egg and a little bit of flour.

554
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,540
Eggs.

555
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,280
And cook it in olive oil.

556
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:31,840
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

557
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,260
What was the last time you had you a big old bowl of fried dead body of Dobbs, dear friend?

558
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:37,560
Yes.

559
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,240
We call it Bob's Birmingham.

560
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,540
Bob's Birmingham.

561
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,900
That's right.

562
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,720
It's the most delicious of all road kills.

563
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,660
Much better than skunks, squirrels, or kitty.

564
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,480
Or squished ferrets and weasels.

565
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,340
But Bob's spirit lives on.

566
00:27:51,580 --> 00:28:01,800
You can talk about these Bob corpses, like I said, but he lives because he's more than just a dead body with a grin on its face and a broken pipe in its mouth.

567
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,180
He represents something, dear friends.

568
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,300
He represents...

569
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,340
And all of the checks.

570
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,120
He represents...

571
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,900
And all of the checks.

572
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:09,900


573
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,860
P.O. Box 140306.

574
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,760
Dallas, Texas 75214.

575
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:21,420
Remember that address, folks, because later on during this program we're going to have a special bonus.

576
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,780
So, Sonia, the scene...

577
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,600
Oh, they don't like to shut their damn game out of the house.

578
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,820
They're saying, shut up.

579
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,260
Shut up.

580
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,400
Shut up.

581
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,580
Shut up.

582
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,460
Shut up.

583
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,960
Shut up.

584
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,220
Shut up.

585
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,420
Shut up.

586
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,160
Shut up.

587
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,480
Shut up.

588
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,500
Shut up.

589
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:36,760
Shut up.

590
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,160
Shut up.

591
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,560
Shut up.

592
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,560


593
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,560


594
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,560


595
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,560


596
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,560


597
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,560


598
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,560


599
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,560


600
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,840
Shut up.

601
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,620
Shut up.

602
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:40,620


603
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:40,620


604
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:40,620


605
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:40,620


606
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:40,620


607
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:40,620


608
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:40,620


609
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:40,620


610
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:47,460
So, call in and talk to the Will of Dogs at 828-9500 or 823-7490.

611
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,860
In the meantime, here's some more Reverend Gordon trivia.

612
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,040
How lucky that you dropped in.

613
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,500
I remember a will that sees...

614
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,320
Isn't it hell?

615
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,020
Just about six years ago.

616
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,900
It was 4 a.m. in a Holiday Inn, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

617
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,600
Shots on my bots, scotch on the rocks, and what else I just don't know.

618
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:26,480
I was trying to get back and buy me some slack, but I needed some money to show me the way.

619
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,240
I searched the world for my personal savior.

620
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,500
I found him nowhere.

621
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,420
I should have looked there first.

622
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:59,740
Most never, just 나나 이렇게 일이 말씀드�ético

623
00:29:59,740 --> 00:29:59,740


624
00:29:59,760 --> 00:29:59,760


625
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,000
This Know Thacks!!!

626
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,860
RAIN Diese 악기가 또icted pins Insider, hört,

627
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:02,860


628
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:02,860


629
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,580
I don't know what we're doingцию

630
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,760
My stream streaming is just this, but I'm going to do something else.

631
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:05,760


632
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,560
then just turn on prime time.

633
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:07,560


634
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,600
Through the rain and the snow I looked high and low for personal soul salvation

635
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,740
From the Trash Life Club, Cathedral and Pub to communes and bowel irrigation

636
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,700
A lot of luck then it dawned on me but New York was my destination

637
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,240
From the shower mobs I met this guy Dobbs on the shuttle to Grand Central Station

638
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,360
He said follow me and I'll set you free for only a small donation

639
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,880
I said use our wheel just send me the bill last hope is better than none

640
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,060
Yes sir, I searched the book of my personal savior

641
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,480
I found it nowhere I should have looked there first

642
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:33,340
I found it nowhere I should have looked there first

670
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,600
I call this little opus The Dark.

671
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,360
It's the sort of horror that was most effective on radio after midnight

672
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,940
to make you wish, as you pull the bed covers over your head that night,

673
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,680
that the author had been strangled while very young.

674
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,560
But he wasn't.

675
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,540
So, try this on for size.

676
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,780
Hey, where are you turning?

677
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,860
The alarm said Pine Street, didn't it, Doc?

678
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,900
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

679
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,400
So why this siren? The only traffic out here is on horseback.

680
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,000
Yeah, you can say that again, Doc. It's from nothing to nowhere.

681
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,340
Okay, let's go.

682
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,920
Yeah, right with you, Doc, right with you.

683
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,100
Said somebody was hurt?

684
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,520
That's what the switchboard said.

685
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,940
What a dump.

686
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,880
Don't seem to be a bell.

687
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,840
Oh, there must be. There's a light in there.

688
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,900
Try the door.

689
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,120
It's open.

690
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,140
Well, let's go.

691
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,620
All right.

692
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,520
Hello in there.

693
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,420
Hello.

694
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,300
This is another false alarm.

695
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,700
Anybody here? I'm a doctor.

696
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,680
Doctor.

697
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,740
Hey, look.

698
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,180
In the corner.

699
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,900
This I gotta see.

700
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,240
Lady, I'm a doctor from General Hospital.

701
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,020
Now, what's the matter?

702
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,920
She is screwy all right, ain't she?

703
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,680
Frightened.

704
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:16,920
Come on, Doc.

705
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,500
Come on, I should get her out of here.

706
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
Or the straitjacket.

707
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,780
Should I get the straitjacket?

708
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
No, Doc, wait.

709
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:23,900
Where are you going?

710
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,580
Can't get it open.

711
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,600
Huh?

712
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:27,760
What's the matter?

713
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,440
What do you want to go in there for?

714
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,620
Can't get this open.

715
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,300
Okay.

716
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,000
Whoever is hurt.

717
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,840
Must be in there.

718
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,360
Blasted door.

719
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,120
Come on, let's break it down.

720
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,240
But the woman.

721
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,060
Forget the woman.

722
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,820
Come on, put your shoulder to it.

723
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,020
Come on.

724
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,960
Yeah, yeah, all right.

725
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,320
It's dark.

726
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,080
Yeah.

727
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,600
Can't see a thing.

728
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,540
Go on back in the other room and get that kerosene lamp.

729
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,760
Well, I get it, I say.

730
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,160
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

731
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,960
Here, Doc.

732
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,620
The lamp.

733
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,220
Okay.

734
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,900
Hold it high.

735
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,680
Yeah.

736
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,420
What?

737
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,960
Oh, mother in heaven.

738
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,540
What?

739
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,260
On the floor.

740
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,400
What is it?

741
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,580
It's a man.

742
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,760
Oh, no.

743
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,240
It can't be.

744
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,580
Yes, I tell you, yes.

745
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,160
It's a man.

746
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,120
A man.

747
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:31,980
A man.

748
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:31,980


749
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:31,980


750
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:31,980


751
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:31,980


752
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:31,980


753
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:31,980


754
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:31,980


755
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:31,980


756
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:31,980


757
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:31,980


758
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:31,980


759
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,440
And he's been turned inside out.

760
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,740
Inside out?

761
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:39,500
Yes.

762
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,480
See for yourself.

763
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,420
It's a man.

764
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,020
But the skin is the inside.

765
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,760
The raw flesh is the outside.

766
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,040
Organs hanging out.

767
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,180
It's a miracle.

768
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,140
A man turned inside out.

769
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,980
They can turn a glove inside out.

770
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:01,980


771
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:01,980


772
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,960
It's alive. It's alive.

773
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,260
It's alive.

774
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,720
It's trying to get up.

775
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,560
Trying to get up.

776
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,760
Trying to move.

777
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,760
Sam, the red light.

778
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,440
Look at it rolling over.

779
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,600
Trying to get up.

780
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,480
Trying to get up on its knees.

781
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,340
Stop. Make it stop.

782
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,200
Kill it. Do something.

783
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,560
Stop. Stop.

784
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,760
Hysterical old woman.

785
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,380
That's what you are.

786
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,540
Now you stand there and shut up.

787
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,680
Listen to him.

788
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,600
Listen to him.

789
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,480
Come on.

790
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,860
Let's get out of here, Doc.

791
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,240
Please.

792
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:34,960
Don't be a fool.

793
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,660
We'll get to find out.

794
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,080
What?

795
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:37,780
What?

796
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,080
Look.

797
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,180
There's another door.

798
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:40,540
Yeah.

799
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,640
Open.

800
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,380
The answer might be in there.

801
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,560
Doc, don't.

802
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:44,780
We got to...

803
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,080
The lantern.

804
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:45,580
Bring it.

805
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,060
Gee, Doc.

806
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,320
Why can't we just go?

807
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:48,960
Hold it high.

808
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,720
Doc, what...

809
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,140
Don't move.

810
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,760
There's...

811
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,580
There's no floor in there.

812
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:56,700
I...

813
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,920
I don't see nothing.

814
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,960
Nothing but dark.

815
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:00,620
Well, look.

816
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,860
Look.

817
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,860
The dark sort of spills over on the edges.

818
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:05,620
Huh?

819
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,060
Well, look, I tell you.

820
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,740
It's a deeper dark than dark.

821
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,900
Something moving in there.

822
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,140
Doc?

823
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,120
Close the door.

824
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,440
No.

825
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,400
No, wait.

826
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,660
Then I'll close it.

827
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,820
Oh, you fool.

828
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,620
Open that door.

829
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,580
I've got to see what...

830
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,520
He's coming in here.

831
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,920
Come on, Doc.

832
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,120
Let's get out of here.

833
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:27,660
No, Sam.

834
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,220
I'm going to find out what this is all about.

835
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,560
All my life,

836
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,840
things have been what they've been.

837
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,620
And I'm going to know all about this.

838
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,440
Please, Doc.

839
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,700
Please, let's get out of here.

840
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,780
Woman, if you know anything, tell me.

841
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,100
What was it we saw back of that door

842
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:42,980
where the floor should have been?

843
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,480
Do you know?

844
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:45,880
She...

845
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,080
She's going to the door.

846
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,060
She's going to open it.

847
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,460
Yes.

848
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,400
Oh, Doc, will you listen to me?

849
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,320
Let's get out of here.

850
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:55,620
No.

851
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,260
Now, wait.

852
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,460
She's just standing there.

853
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,820
Looking in at the dark.

854
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,180
Yeah.

855
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,200
Dark?

856
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:10,080
What's that coming up out of the hole in the floor?

857
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,240
The dark.

858
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,800
It's like...

859
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,540
Like black smoke.

860
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,180
Listen to it.

861
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,440
It's reaching up to her.

862
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,180
Yes.

863
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,980
What is it?

864
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,400
Smoke?

865
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:30,720
Smoke?

866
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,900
Black?

867
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,080
What?

868
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,920
Crawling up around her.

869
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,020
It's covering her.

870
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,320
No.

871
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,120
Inside out.

872
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,680
It turned her.

873
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,600
Inside out.

874
00:44:59,020 --> 00:44:59,960
Inside out.

875
00:44:59,960 --> 00:44:59,960


876
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:01,460
Ah...

877
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,340
Sam.

878
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,520
Sam, get up.

879
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,900
Sam, open your eyes.

880
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,540
The shadows, they're crawling along the floor toward us.

881
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,220
Come on, Sam.

882
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:11,900
Come on.

883
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,480
Sam, you're...

884
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,860
Oh, you're too heavy.

885
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,700
I can't lift you.

886
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,780
Sam, you've got to hear me.

887
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,640
The shadows, they're crawling toward me along the floor.

888
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,040
I can't leave you.

889
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,120
You saw what they did to her.

890
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,520
Look at her.

891
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,240
Inside out.

892
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,460
A woman inside out.

893
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:29,920
Oh.

894
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,800
Oh, Sam, I'll drag you out of here.

895
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,920
Oh, you're so heavy.

896
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,100
They're coming faster and faster, like long black fingers.

897
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,060
Ah, my legs!

898
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,000
Let go of me!

899
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,220
Sam, I can't help you to holding me back.

900
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,340
The black, it's covering you!

901
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,000
Sam!

902
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,380
Sam!

903
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,020
Sam!

904
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,300
No!

905
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,980
No, you thing whatever you are, get off me!

906
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,280
Stop covering me!

907
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,220
I've got to get out of here. I've got to tell them all about you.

908
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,240
I've got to tell everyone there's something like you loose in the world.

909
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,460
Got to warn everybody.

910
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,100
Get off me!

911
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,400
Cold.

912
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:26,600
Slimy.

913
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,400
How can shadows be slimy?

914
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,320
So cold.

915
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,920
Covering me over.

916
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:35,860
My head.

917
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,460
My face.

918
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,960
My face.

919
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:41,660
My mouth.

920
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,020
Let go.

921
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,160
Let go of me.

922
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,620
Let go of me.

923
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,000
No!

924
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,600
No!

925
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,200
No!

926
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,780
No!

927
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:57,780


928
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:57,780


929
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:57,780


930
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:57,780


931
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:57,780


932
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:57,780


933
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:57,780


934
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:57,780


935
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:57,980
No!

936
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:57,980


937
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:57,980


938
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:57,980


939
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,380
No!

940
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:30,380
No, not Suitable To Everybody,

941
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:30,380


942
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:30,380


943
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:30,380


944
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:30,380


945
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:30,380


946
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:30,380


947
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:30,380


948
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:30,380


949
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:30,380


950
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,760
What? What strange land is this?

951
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,280
What am I doing here?

952
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,840
How did this happen?

953
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,580
Why am I asking you?

954
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,100
I've been giving a suspect foul play

955
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,560
Late at night when I am sleeping

956
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,080
You smiting momos come up screaming

957
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,840
Sucking me into your world of horror

958
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,160
Can this be the world of tomorrow?

959
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,060
Wait a minute, just a second

960
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,860
I know who you are

961
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,660
Yes, it's true, you're the citizens of the neighborhood

962
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,340
What the hell is it that you're trying to do to me?

963
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,220
Help me, help me, I gotta get out of here

964
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,880
You're making me brain damaged

965
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,100
All these people hanging around my head

966
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,460
It's the hour of the living, it's the hour of the living

967
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,500
Perhaps I just need a slight cranial adjustment

968
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,800
Like the dentist pulling my gums inside out

969
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,000
And pulling my brain out through my gum cavity

970
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,020
As my head implodes and is yanked out by some damn Yankee Garber

971
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,900
Perhaps I'm a beauty queen

972
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,200
The target of a thousand flying jackasses

973
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,460
Praying and mocking the violence

974
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,080
That's stultified, stupefied defamation on my whole TV

975
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,980
Perhaps I'm already worth ten million dollars

976
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,600
With the mofo geeks chasing me through the woods

977
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,120
Trying to rip off my crutches

978
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,480
And use me for a game of hide and seek

979
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:57,480


980
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:57,480


981
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,740
Like a human weenie roast in front of the campfire girls' glee club

982
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,160
Perhaps nothing is what I think it is

983
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,740
Maybe you're all just a bunch of nice guys

984
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,960
And you aren't really trying to suck every last semen out of my pocket

985
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,560
And give me absolutely nothing in return

986
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,580
Wait a minute, I know who you are

987
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,640
You're the citizens of the neighborhood

988
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,180
What the hell are you trying to do to me?

989
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,620
You're making me pray, damn it's always been lying around my head

990
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,120
It's the island of the living

991
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:41,520
Perhaps I need just a slight cranial adjustment

992
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,700
Perhaps I'm a beauty queen

993
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,800
Perhaps I'm already worth ten million dollars

994
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,580
With the mofo geeks chasing me through the woods

995
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,120
The mofo geeks chasing me through the woods

996
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,880
There's nobody there who's gonna go an hour

997
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:09,880


998
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,680
Never nope to the Nazis

999
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,040
They'll yell and swear what kind of a idea it was

1000
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:20,320
Or tell the secret conhece

1001
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:25,220
You know who you are

1002
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,340
You know everything that god knows

1003
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,180
Not on air.

1004
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,100
See, they gave up because we didn't respond properly, and who knows?

1005
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:31,980
Oh, there it is again.

1006
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,480
Search air.

1007
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,120
One soul.

1008
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,100
Her breath.

1009
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,100
Hello.

1010
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:35,820
Hello, caller.

1011
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:36,820
Hello?

1012
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:37,940
Listen.

1013
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:38,460
Hello?

1014
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,480
Hi.

1015
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:39,760
Hi.

1016
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,480
Hi.

1017
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:47,940
Listen, I've been having a lot of trouble trying to decide how to kill these small fur animals

1018
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:55,920
because what I find is that if you use a large gun, then you can't get the fur real good.

1019
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,920
That's really nice.

1020
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,040
You've got a big problem there.

1021
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,980
See, the problem with these furry animals is that they're like leeches.

1022
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:07,680
They're large, and they attach themselves to your body right below your navel.

1023
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,840
Now, what you've got to do is just take a gun and blow that thing right off of your belly.

1024
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,220
We recommend a 35-millimeter howitzer.

1025
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,200
Oh, that long.

1026
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,200
What is that?

1027
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:17,860
This thing.

1028
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,380
Oh, you know what?

1029
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,160
The thing is, sometimes I hit them, and it looks like it's okay,

1030
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,480
but you can't be sure if you hit them or if they got away.

1031
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:32,980
Just brush the hairs and seal in the green of the animal's natural coat any puncture, wounds, or exit wounds.

1032
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,380
If you pet the thing, you'll become friends with it.

1033
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,380
If you become friends with it, you'll be unable to kill it.

1034
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,400
And if you're unable to kill it, then you're unable to sell it.

1035
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,960
And you're certainly unable to eat it.

1036
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,480
And if you can't sell it, why own it?

1037
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,480
And if you can't eat it, why own it or sell it?

1038
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:53,800
See, if you really believe it's all powerful, then you're willing to kill it, see?

1039
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,480
And they're, let's see.

1040
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:55,620
See?

1041
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,260
There it is.

1042
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,240
Bob is not dead, dear friends.

1043
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,520
Bob is going to be back.

1044
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,380
I mean, he, as far as I'm concerned, he never died.

1045
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,180
Or if he did, they killed him twice.

1046
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,060
They had to keep killing him.

1047
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,440
But, oh, they can't keep him down.

1048
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:13,020
He's in the in-between place between heaven and earth, bobbing in the neoplasm.

1049
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,420
But he's still watching, friends.

1050
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,420
He's got a special etheric TV.

1051
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,120
He's making a list and checking it twice.

1052
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,580
He's going to find out who's naughty or nice.

1053
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,220
He'll know who believes.

1054
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,260
And who don't.

1055
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,600
And who believes too much.

1056
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,020
Remember, there's a free plastic dinosaur in every package.

1057
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,440
False slack.

1058
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,380
Get your false slack right here.

1059
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,640
Suggested from a church audiences only.

1060
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,880
Church air, one soul per breath.

1061
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,360
Friends, you think you got all the church air in the world right now, don't you?

1062
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,480
Some make rules, some obey.

1063
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,560
But the rules are for the fools, is what I say.

1064
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,280
One of these days, that church air is going to run out.

1065
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,720
What you going to be saying then, huh?

1066
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,020
You going to be saying, oh, Bob.

1067
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,160
Maybe I should not have sucked all that church air.

1068
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,760
Maybe I should have done what you said.

1069
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,620
Quit sucking on the finger and go where it points.

1070
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,540
Put that thing away.

1071
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,360
That's right.

1072
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,040
Don't hurt yourself here, Ivan.

1073
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,420
It's, it's, the show's almost over.

1074
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,240
And I mean, I'd feel terrible if you hurt yourself.

1075
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,920
Get him to throw a towel over it.

1076
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,300
Get him to throw a tantrum.

1077
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,760
See, friends, I get in the spirit.

1078
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,280
It ain't easy being in the spirit 16, 18 hours a day.

1079
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:24,880
But you, you know, you get fired up.

1080
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,460
You get all bobbed.

1081
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:25,860
You get all bobbed up.

1082
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,720
And you got to preach.

1083
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,720
You got to get up on top of it.

1084
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,020
This is true, my dear friends.

1085
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,840
They can talk about me all over Dallas County.

1086
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,260
They can talk about me all over Dallas.

1087
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,020
I don't care.

1088
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,860
I'm going to say that I believe in Bob.

1089
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,100
I don't believe that Bob's dead.

1090
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,260
And if he is, so what?

1091
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,000
Do you think I'm going to stop Bob?

1092
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:45,640
Yes, it's more like trying to stop a hurricane or a mighty force of nature.

1093
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,380
Why do you think they, why do you think they call it Hurricane Bob?

1094
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,200
Listen, dear friends.

1095
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,280
Donnie Mills.

1096
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,460
Donnie Mills.

1097
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,480
The 10th day of the human totem pole.

1098
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:40,000
The morning was December gray of the 10th and 10th day of the human totem pole.

1099
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,260
The man at the bottom was smiling.

1100
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,020
He had just finished his breakfast smiling.

1101
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,380
It hadn't rained or manured for over two hours.

1102
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,180
The man at the top was starving.

1103
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:07,640
The pole was a horrible looking thing with all of those eyes and ears and waving hands for balance.

1104
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,980
There was no way to get a copter in close.

1105
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:14,000
So everybody was starving together.

1106
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:21,040
The man at the top had long ago given up but didn't have nerve enough to climb down.

1107
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,760
At night the pole would talk to itself.

1108
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,720
And the chatter wasn't too good.

1109
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,320
Obviously the pole didn't like itself.

1110
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,380
It wanted to walk.

1111
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,880
It was the summer and it was hot.

1112
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:42,540
And balance wouldn't permit a skinning to undergarments.

1113
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,060
It was an integrated pole.

1114
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,600
It was taking on a reddish brown cast.

1115
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,840
Exercise on the pole was isometric.

1116
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,600
Kind of a flex.

1117
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:54,740
And then back to the pole.

1118
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,120
Balance.

1119
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,720
Then the eyes would roll together.

1120
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,380
The ears wiggle.

1121
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,660
Hands balance.

1122
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,080
There was a gurgling and googling herd.

1123
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,940
A tenth of the way up the pole.

1124
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,980
Approaching was a small child with Statue of Liberty doll.

1125
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:33,600
Plus all sons and daughters before much as three.

1126
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,180
Unfortunately no sign of her.

1127
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:34,260
Not all.

1128
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:37,620
Well bosh all three were out there.

1129
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,560
This was pretty nice.

1130
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,460
Shame on me if we found her.

1131
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,720
Empathies are fear in the eyes of death.

1132
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:43,740
They wouldn't let us see her.

1133
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,680
We knew these vagabonds didn't know if she would be in the house.

1134
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,200
We figured we chewy as auum.

1135
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,280
Oh, yeah.

1136
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,200
Praise Captain Beefheart.

1137
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,120
That's Captain Beefheart and his magic band.

1138
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,280
The tale of the human totem pole.

1139
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,920
And it is a human totem pole, friend.

1140
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,840
The Willa Dobbs just got him a call from a punk boy.

1141
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,500
Now, I got nothing against your hardcore music and such like.

1142
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,280
If it really was.

1143
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,080
If it was really hardcore, it wouldn't tend to...

1144
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,460
All those bands wouldn't tend to all look alike and sound alike.

1145
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:42,020
And if the punk boy was really a punk boy, he wouldn't try to look like all the bands.

1146
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,020
And I just...

1147
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,100
One wonders how far...

1148
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:57,780
How far it can evolve from, you know, a legitimate gripe on the part of working class kids in England in 1976 to 1987.

1149
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,440
Middle class America.

1150
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,240
How much did you spend on your uniform, punk boy?

1151
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:09,140
How much did you spend to look like an individual, huh?

1152
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:15,480
So that you'd have the same individual neck brace that your favorite band...

1153
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:16,380
Your hero.

1154
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,600
Your god.

1155
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,680
And yet, he had the nerve to get on and go...

1156
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,760
Yeah, I noticed.

1157
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,060
All you guys talk about is Bob, man.

1158
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,720
I question Ramones, man.

1159
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,140
Question Ramones, man.

1160
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:29,680
It's hard.

1161
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,120
Man, I thought the Ramones were a great band, you know?

1162
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,500
At one time.

1163
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:40,420
I used to dance around with my kid on my back to the Ramones.

1164
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:46,180
But then that time, I had to rape and kill all the members of all the...

1165
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:46,180


1166
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:46,180


1167
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:46,800
All the bands...

1168
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,980
That you ever liked.

1169
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,520
That changed my opinion.

1170
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,460
Because they didn't fight back very hard.

1171
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,240
It was almost like they wanted it.

1172
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,700
They wanted...

1173
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,580
They wanted to be taken...

1174
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,900
From behind.

1175
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:11,860
Children, in light, or should I say dimness, of the 17th anniversary of Woodstock, which just passed...

1176
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,360
I'd like to speak to you tonight about the 60s.

1177
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,160
60s.

1178
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:20,900
Some people have confronted me after they've encountered the philosophies of the Church of the Subgenius

1179
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,280
by saying that they've heard it all before.

1180
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:29,180
The concepts of slack and subgenius are rehashed, refried ideas left over from the 60s.

1181
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,060
A do-your-own-thing, man.

1182
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:36,520
Love, peace, anarchy, down with the fascist, imperialist, war-monging, capitalist establishment, pig-dogs.

1183
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,280
Hey, man, we closed down the New York State Thruway type mentality.

1184
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:45,820
And they go on to point out that the hippies all sold out and currently have networking parties.

1185
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:51,440
They're all at slick New York nightclubs, as if to say that that is the path of the Church of the Subgenius.

1186
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:52,260
Nay!

1187
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:57,540
The problem with the hippies was that they played right into the hands of the conspiracy.

1188
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,240
A real organization, I must remind you.

1189
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,680
They played right into their hands by losing their collective sense of humor,

1190
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,180
being low in ignorance and high in expectations.

1191
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:15,120
They took themselves too seriously, and thus they solidified, paralyzed in pools of rhetoric.

1192
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:25,720
Now, the Church of the Subgenius is an ongoing extraction process that culls the slack-filled concepts from the religions and philosophies of the past and so on.

1193
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:30,020
J.R. Bob Dobbs has always said, do your own thing.

1194
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:39,600
But just don't end up like the pinks and normals and glorps who believe that they're doing their own thing when, in fact, they pay to know what they really think.

1195
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,860
Oh, thank you, Sister Chris.

1196
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,180
Oh, that was lovely.

1197
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:55,180
Incredible how these rants from other towns seem to sync up with each other.

1198
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,360
Well, Ron Lindsey made it here.

1199
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,360
Friends, this is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1200
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,480
And, uh, there we go.

1201
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,440
It's the Down Memory Lane show.

1202
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:14,400
You are kissing goodbye to the mighty hour of slack.

1203
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,700
Praise God!

1204
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,100
Praise Ron!

1205
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:23,320
I stumbled on this photograph

1206
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,660
It kinda made me laugh

1207
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,160
It took me way back

1208
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,640
Back down memory lane

1209
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,980
I see the happiness

1210
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,620
I see the pain

1211
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,360
Where am I?

1212
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,360
Back down memory lane

1213
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,500
Back down memory lane

1214
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:45,800
Back down memory lane

1215
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:45,800


1216
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,120
I see her standing there

1217
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,760
Such a happy, happy pair

1218
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,760
Love beyond compare

1219
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,200
Look at there, look at there

1220
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,340
Do you do the way you held me?

1221
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,460
No one could tell me

1222
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,760
That love would die

1223
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,100
Oh, why?

1224
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:15,780
Do you do the way you held me?

1225
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,320
Did I have to find this photograph?

1226
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,560
I thought I had forgot the past

1227
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,980
Now I'm slipping fast

1228
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,340
Oh, back down memory lane

1229
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:29,340
I feel the happiness

1230
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,640
I feel the pain

1231
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,420
Here am I

1232
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,160
Back down memory lane
