1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
This appeared into the New Age movement for six years.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,960
Like all shaman before him, he had traversed the wilderness,

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,140
and now he was returning to his people a changed man.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,980
He brought with him his confidential report, which he called

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,260
The New Earth Army Manual.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,740
The New Earth Army is a banner under which the forces of good can gather,

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,440
the courage and nobility of the warrior blended with the spirituality of the monk.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,740
The Jedi warrior will follow in the footsteps of the great imagineers of the past,

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,740
Jesus Christ, Lao Tse Tung, Walt Disney.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,540
The role of the New Earth Army is to resolve conflict worldwide.

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,000
Jedis will parachute into war zones utilizing sparkly eyes technique,

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,080
carrying symbolic flowers and animals, playing indigenous music and words of peace.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,660
As Lin drove on, I wondered what the hell I was doing.

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,240
I wanted to go back.

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,080
This wasn't me, this was crazy.

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,540
And so was Lin.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,160
But by then it was too late.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,960
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,700
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

20
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,380
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,420
is specialized in the world of the subgenius.

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,860
Fully designed only to be played on radio station.

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,900
And only in the city of...

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,020
What's your name?

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,120
Bob, sir.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,020
Oh, that's a great name. I love Bob.

27
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,620
It's a sacred name.

28
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,340
We all have sacred names.

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,020
They're given to us in the service of the church.

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,060
Sacred Bob.

31
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,120
More like scared Bob now, eh?

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,760
Yes, sir.

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,660
Ah, good.

34
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,220
Scared keeps you fast.

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,140
Anyone in this room who isn't scared is a moron.

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:01,960
Carry on.

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,840
This is PRR.

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,940
I'll feed you a bite of structure.

39
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, you know, uh, uh, uh, not, not, not, um, but, uh, with, with, uh, what, uh, uh, and, and...

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,560
On the other hand, um...

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,420
Well, and, and, and, uh, to, to, and, and, uh, there, there I can, we can, uh...

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,240
We can uh...

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,640
I, uh, um...

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,980
And, and...

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,360
And...

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,140
Um, but...

47
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,540
Well, that's uh, but if, but if you could, uh, you could 10%?

48
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,000
Uh.

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,820
Uh, uh...

50
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,180
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,080
Uh...

52
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,300
Uh.

53
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:37,740
Uh.

54
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,740
Yeah, in the, uh, in the uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

55
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,440
Uh, um, PRR.org.

56
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,280
With physical filth.

57
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,040
Support for this program comes from...

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,000
Childrens.org.

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,740
One reason I shot the video is so I could see him better.

60
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,000
You know, blown up real large.

61
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,420
One reason I shot the video was so I could see him better...

62
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:54,420


63
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,380
better. You know, blown up real large.

64
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,900
Let me ask you something.

65
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,500
What color were the chairs in the hotel

66
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,880
bar?

67
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,720
Um.

68
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,920
You were there for hours. What color were the chairs?

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,320
Green.

70
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,220
Beige. How many lights are in this room?

71
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,520
A super soldier

72
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,120
wouldn't have to look. He would just know.

73
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,460
Super soldier? A Jedi

74
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,540
warrior. He'd know where all the

75
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,420
lights were. He could walk through a room. He could tell you

76
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,920
how many power outlets there were.

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,700
People would walk around with their eyes closed.

78
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,520
At level one, we were trained

79
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,460
to instantly absorb all

80
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,300
details. What's a

81
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,340
Jedi warrior?

82
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,400
Look at him. You were a

83
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,500
Jedi warrior? That's correct.

84
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,100
I don't...

85
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,540
I don't know what that means.

86
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,800
I'm Sergeant First Class Lynn Cassidy,

87
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,500
Special Forces. Retired.

88
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,400
In the 80s, I was trained at

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,060
Fort Bragg under a secret initiative.

90
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,440
I was a cop.

91
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,260
Codenamed Project Jedi.

92
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,500
The objective of the project was to

93
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,040
create super soldiers.

94
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,080
Soldiers with superpowers.

95
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,360
We were the first generation of the New Earth

96
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,420
Army. You've got

97
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,320
superpowers? That's correct.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,740
Wait a minute.

99
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,160
You...

100
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,520
What you're saying is that you

101
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,380
were a psychic spy like

102
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,380
Lacy. We prefer the term remote

103
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:16,840
viewer.

104
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,220
How does that work? Well,

105
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
different Jedi had different techniques.

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,820
Mel Landau used to visualize

107
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,880
packing all his troubles into a little

108
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,180
suitcase to clear his mind.

109
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,220
Steve Tuttle would recite

110
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,180
Bible verse, which was...

111
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,300
What about you?

112
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
I find drinking helps.

113
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,680
And if I'm listening to classic

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,320
rock. Oh yeah? Like who?

115
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,400
Like Boston.

116
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,260
Boston.

117
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,740
Boston. Friends,

118
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,960
we're here in the studio.

119
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,940
And it's more than a feeling.

120
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,080
And

121
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,240
uh...

122
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,600
That clip and the one we

123
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,480
started with are from a wonderful movie

124
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,540
called The Men Who Stare at

125
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,340
Goats, which is

126
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,560
based on the true story of the

127
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,500
New Earth Army, which was a

128
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,700
serious attempt by the U.S. Army

129
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,720
to create psychic

130
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,500
soldiers. Psychic warfare,

131
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,620
remote viewers, and so forth.

132
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,580
The movie's wonderful.

133
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,680
We'll be playing some more of those

134
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
clips. I identify with that

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,160
because I

136
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,620
consider myself the world's

137
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,440
only Vulcan Jedi

138
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,360
mentat.

139
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,820
I am a

140
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,820
Jedi, but I'm a

141
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,620
Vulcan Jedi. In fact,

142
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,360
I'm the Sherlock Holmes of the

143
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,160
Vulcan Jedi mentats.

144
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,760
We also

145
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,320
heard a clip from the new

146
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
Doctor Who with

147
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,280
uncanny lines about

148
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,480
Bob and

149
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,580
sacred names, thanks to

150
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,700
the great

151
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,320
rambager for that.

152
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,960
And I've got

153
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,980
three anti-drug

154
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,840
songs in a row to play.

155
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,060
But the first

156
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,700
one, I brought Princess We

157
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,580
in here to critique specifically

158
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,620
because, well, the song is called

159
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,440
Three Drunk Newts.

160
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,820
I forgot to check who

161
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,580
actually did this song.

162
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,920
I don't know who performs it, but Princess

163
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,940
We is a newtist.

164
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,280
That indeed is true.

165
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,640
She's also a newtist,

166
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,120
but I don't want to

167
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,040
go into that. I'm not.

168
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,140
But I have been keeping a newt for

169
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,900
over 30 years.

170
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,280
Yes, we have a newt that is at least

171
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,640
30 years old. It could be

172
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,440
a thousand and thirty.

173
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,480
But it's

174
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,400
a good newt. He doesn't abuse

175
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,560
that we know of. He doesn't do

176
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,620
drugs, and he doesn't

177
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,440
drink. He doesn't listen

178
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,080
to Boston.

179
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,100
He does watch Lost.

180
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,420
Yes.

181
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,120
But he doesn't have much choice about that, actually.

182
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,400
So, let us

183
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,220
proceed with this

184
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,340
educational song. It'll be followed

185
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,960
by an educational song,

186
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,060
an oldie by Canned Heat.

187
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,300
And after that, a song

188
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,160
by my son

189
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,720
and his friend

190
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,740
Jonathan Payne.

191
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,640
But now, the newts.

192
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,100
Woo!

193
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,260
Three

194
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,000
Drunk Newts.

195
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,280
Three Drunk Newts.

196
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,540
See how they crawl.

197
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,880
See how they crawl.

198
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,400
Creeping down your legs

199
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,060
and feet. Looking for

200
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,480
a snack to eat. They can't

201
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,860
even keep the beat.

202
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,020
Three Drunk Newts.

203
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,420
Three Drunk Newts.

204
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,000
Three Stump

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,660
Newts. Three

206
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,180
Stump Newts.

207
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
High as a kite.

208
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,840
Yes, high as a kite.

209
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,320
They rumble

210
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,320
in the parking lot. They scored

211
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,240
a little seedless pot.

212
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,620
Really hope they don't get caught.

213
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,760
Three Stump Newts.

214
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,200
Three Stump Newts.

215
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,840
Three Wild

216
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,380
Newts. Three

217
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,080
Wild Newts.

218
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,060
Causing a scene.

219
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,540
They're rowdy and mean.

220
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,400
They licky, sticky,

221
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,460
loony juice. They're all to

222
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,900
punish and abuse.

223
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,460
Look out, cause they're on the loose.

224
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,520
Three Wild Newts.

225
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,120
Three Wild Newts.

226
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,640
Look at their

227
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,020
tails.

228
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,560
Aren't they pretty?

229
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,700
Look at their tails.

230
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,740
Izzy, Cindy,

231
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,200
wish I had a tail.

232
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,540
I have a tail.

233
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,800
But I don't.

234
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,460
Why

235
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,160
am I drunk?

236
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,840
I'm

237
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,540
really high.

238
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,740
Let's

239
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,660
find some

240
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,400
women.

241
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,860
What's up?

242
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,080
Power

243
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Monday!

244
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,040
Let me tell you a

245
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,860
tale about a trio of hot

246
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,120
newts on parade.

247
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,000
They had Saturday Newt

248
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,700
fever, and they was

249
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,080
burning. But they got

250
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,000
a little too hot, dig?

251
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,800
Three Dead

252
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Newts.

253
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,640
Three Dead Newts.

254
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,160
Three Dead Newts.

255
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,180
See how they rot.

256
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,620
See how they rot.

257
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,620
Left out in the

258
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,820
noonday sun. Dry and stiff

259
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,360
and too well done. That's the end of their newt fun.

260
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,720
Three Dead Newts.

261
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,100
Three Dead Newts.

262
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,760
Three Dead Newts.

263
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:40,760


264
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,780
They're gone now.

265
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,020
They lived life too hard.

266
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Yeah.

267
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,720
Bye, newts.

268
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,740
Goodbye.

269
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,020
Bye.

270
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:58,940


271
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,340
Sleep good.

272
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,220
Puzzled dreams.

273
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,880
Yeah!

274
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,660
Yeah!

275
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,680
Yeah!

276
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,940
Yeah!

277
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:15,940


278
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,760
Yeah!

279
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,560
Ha!

280
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,140
Well, sad.

281
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,860
That's the fate.

282
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,640
Didn't that happen to all the other newts besides...

283
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,480
Yes, they started out as the gang of four, and two climbed out immediately and dried,

284
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,600
exactly like in this story that we just heard.

285
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,980
They probably partied first.

286
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,240
They probably did.

287
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,300
It was like going to Burning Man for them.

288
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:46,760
They climbed out of their tank, started partying, got dehydrated, over the top, and then they

289
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:46,760


290
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,620
overheated, passed out under the couch.

291
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,300
And that was all she wrote.

292
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,020
And you found them weeks later.

293
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,140
Mm-hmm. They were little dry sort of crisps.

294
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,960
But two newts did not leave the tank, right?

295
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,680
That's right.

296
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,280
One grew bigger and bullied the little one for years.

297
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,680
For 16 years.

298
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,280
And I still have him in my freezer so that I can bury the two of them alive.

299
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,060
Dead together.

300
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,720
He did die, right, before you put him in the freezer?

301
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,300
Yes, he died before I put him in the freezer.

302
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:24,300
And so now when the last one, Fig, who strangely enough is the smallest of them all, still is small.

303
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,620
The other one was Newt Rockne.

304
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,940
If Fig can die, he'll end up being buried with...

305
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,540
Newt Rockne.

306
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,240
Yeah.

307
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,940
Well, okay, now, friends, there's a moral to all this.

308
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,760
You better be careful.

309
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,760
This is a real oldie that I really wasn't all that familiar with.

310
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:53,620
But when I heard it, I thought, well, this is the most realistic song I've ever heard about methamphetamines.

311
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,700
It's an old canned heat song.

312
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,380
This is a song with a message.

313
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,340
I want you to keep my word.

314
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,480
I want to tell you all a story.

315
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,520
About this chick I know.

316
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,160
They call her methamphetamine Annie.

317
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,280
She's always shoveling snow.

318
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,080
I sat her down and told her.

319
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,920
I told her crystal clear.

320
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
I don't mind you getting high.

321
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,460
But there's one thing you should feel.

322
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,620
You might, might think it's flying, baby.

323
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,620
On those little pills.

324
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,620
But you ought to know it's dying cause.

325
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,700
Speed kills.

326
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,140
But Annie kept on speeding.

327
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,160
Her health was getting poor.

328
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,660
She saw things in the window.

329
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,740
She heard things at the door.

330
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,960
Her mouth was like a grinding mill.

331
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,300
Her lips were cracked and sore.

332
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,600
She was a little bit of a grumpy.

333
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:12,600


334
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:12,600


335
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:12,600


336
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,720
Her skin was turning yellow.

337
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,980
I just couldn't take it no more.

338
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,460
She thought her mind was flying.

339
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,460
On those little pills.

340
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,520
She didn't know it was going down fast.

341
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,220
Cause.

342
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,120
Speed kills.

343
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,500
Yeah.

344
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,400
Speed can kill you too, baby.

345
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,720
Don't let that happen.

346
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,040
Oh, maybe so.

347
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,680
Yeah.

348
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,580
Speed kills.

349
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:42,580


350
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:42,580


351
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,580
chce

352
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,600
When is

353
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:12,580


354
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:12,580


355
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:12,580


356
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:12,580


357
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:12,580


358
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,600
pretty close.

359
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,880
Well, as I sat down and told her

360
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,620
I told her one more time

361
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,960
The whole wide human race has taken

362
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,300
Far too much methadrine

363
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,280
She said, I don't care what a limey says

364
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,040
I got to get it on

365
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,140
I'm about into the scene of the man

366
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,380
Who dropped from across the pond

367
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,340
She wouldn't heed my warning

368
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,040
Lord, she wouldn't hear what I said

369
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,600
Now she's here in the graveyard

370
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,820
And she's awfully dead

371
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,900
There's people who don't

372
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,220
Love me

373
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:29,940
I've always loved whiskey

374
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,340
It's never loved me

375
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,900
Shoulda listened to mama

376
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,880
And just let it die

377
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,280
Time-tested and true

378
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,480
Was her sage advice

379
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,740
But I was too stubborn

380
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,840
Now I'm paying the price

381
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,260
Started with sipping

382
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,400
And moved up to shots

383
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,940
I keep on drinking

384
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,720
Till I sinned

385
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,560
And I'm out of spots

386
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,820
That's when I'd order

387
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,900
Just one more round

388
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,680
That's why I'm no stranger

389
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,780
To waking up on the ground

390
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,840
Didn't matter that I'd drink

391
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,580
Till I couldn't see

392
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,040
Cause that amber liquid

393
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,320
Would call out to me

394
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,840
And follow that voice

395
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,140
Is just what I did

396
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,720
Oh how I wish from

397
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,200
That voice I had heard

398
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,880
I'd be able to hear

399
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:39,880


400
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,680
I've always loved whiskey

401
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,780
It's never loved me

402
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,360
Shoulda listened to mama

403
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,540
And just let it be

404
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,060
Time-tested and true

405
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,440
Was her sage advice

406
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,080
But I was too stubborn

407
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,200
Now I'm paying the price

408
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,780
I don't remember robbing that liquor store

409
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,320
Or shooting that man

410
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,720
Behind the cash drawer

411
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,160
Then at my trial

412
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,400
When the jury saw the tape

413
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,860
I knew a guilty verdict

414
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,140
Was headed my way

415
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,160
Now in my jail cell

416
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,940
I wait for the preacher

417
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,020
To pray with me

418
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,980
Lord, please forgive this poor creature

419
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,240
I should have let mama

420
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,780
And you be my teacher

421
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,600
When they strap me in that chair

422
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,680
I'll be coming to meet ya

423
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,040
I've always loved whiskey

424
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,200
It's never loved me

425
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,700
Shoulda listened to mama

426
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,940
And just let it be

427
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,400
Time-tested and true

428
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,700
Was her sage advice

429
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,620
But I was too stubborn

430
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,160
Now I'm paying with my

431
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,800
Life

432
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,860
What other powers would you practice?

433
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,260
Invisibility

434
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,300
Invisibility?

435
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,040
Yeah, that was level three

436
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,540
Like actual invisibility?

437
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,400
Yeah, that was the goal

438
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,800
Eventually we adapted it

439
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,600
To just finding a way of not being seen

440
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,820
But once you understand

441
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,800
The linkage between observation

442
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,340
And reality

443
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,620
Then you begin to dance with invisibility

444
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,760
And that's what I do

445
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:36,760


446
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,680
Like camouflage?

447
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,520
No, it's not like camouflage

448
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,380
We also practice phasing

449
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,740
Crossing from particle to wave

450
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,560
From physical to energy

451
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,640
Solid objects seem to pass right through ya

452
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,860
That starts with a breathing exercise

453
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,640
You go

454
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,900
And then you think black

455
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,020
That's a nothingness

456
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,640
Got it?

457
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,120
It's

458
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,340
This is...

459
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,600
I don't know what...

460
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,560
Praise Bob!

461
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,100
Praise Bob!

462
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,560
And friends

463
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,820
Yes, that was a little bit more there

464
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,080
From the men who stare at goats

465
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,300
Why goats?

466
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,980
Because they're cheap

467
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,200
And they're trying to find out

468
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,400
Find a guy who can kill a goat

469
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,620
By staring at him

470
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,640
And it turns out to be the Clune

471
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,160
Yep, that's his super power

472
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,620
The Clune could kill a goat

473
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,880
By staring at it

474
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,640
And boy, they ended up with a lot of goats

475
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,720
To experiment with

476
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,200
Friends, the song

477
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,760
Is called

478
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,360
There I've Always Loved Whiskey

479
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,340
Was strangely enough by my

480
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,700
By a guy that

481
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,760
I guess I've known since he was about

482
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,900
Ten years old

483
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,580
My son's buddy

484
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,440
Jonathan Payne

485
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,700
And my son

486
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,400
We'll call him

487
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,980
Ednax Stang

488
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,460
The Hollywood director

489
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,940
Did all the music

490
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,240
He did the drums and the guitar

491
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,480
And the bass and keyboards and stuff

492
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,540
And I think they did it in separate cities

493
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,520
They did it like

494
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,640
Online or mailing files back and forth

495
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:08,900
Yes

496
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,340
And before that

497
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,760
The ironical song

498
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,660
Amphetamine Annie by Canned Heat

499
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,080
What makes it ironic is

500
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,880
I think that

501
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,620
Either the singer or the bass player of that band

502
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,460
OD'd on downers

503
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,600
They were smart about the speed

504
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,980
But they were kind of dumb about the downers

505
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,280
Downers kill too

506
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,980
Princess Wee, I can't hear you very well

507
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,680
You can't hear me?

508
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,680
I can hear you

509
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm here

510
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,520
I have to talk again

511
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,680
Okay

512
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,180
That's a lot better

513
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,720
Alright

514
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,160
You just don't have a lot of testosterone in your voice

515
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,140
You little space princess

516
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,340
I guess I don't

517
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,800
Friends, it's been a long day

518
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,320
And the main subject of this show

519
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,500
Is actually not going to be

520
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,460
Preaching about the bad pills

521
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,100
But

522
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,200
As opposed to the good pills

523
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,340
But mainly this whole show

524
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,940
I'm going to gripe about how ticked off I am

525
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,560
That my lawnmower is broken

526
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,860
I'd say that's a good subject for the hour of slack

527
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,320
Right?

528
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,800
That ought to get everybody feeling real slackful

529
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,220
Oh I felt real slackful today

530
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,380
Actually I

531
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,240
I had to move fast

532
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,200
Because I knew it was going to rain this afternoon

533
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Princess Wee was off working

534
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,380
Now that she's retired

535
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,060
She works really hard

536
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,300
Volunteer stuff

537
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,340
And I thought

538
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,000
Well I'll mow our yard before it rains

539
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,220
It's about to get out of control

540
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,920
The dandelions and monsters

541
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,040
And triffids were about to get out of hand

542
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,800
And first I had to crank up the Batmobile

543
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,620
You know Gotham City is based on Cleveland

544
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,820
And there is a Batman

545
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,180
But he's old and decrepit now

546
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,280
And we keep his car

547
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,060
The Batmobile

548
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
In our garage for him

549
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,340
And I had to jump start it

550
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,360
To get it out of the way of the lawnmower

551
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,020
To get the lawnmower out of the garage

552
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,080
And I finally get the lawnmower going

553
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,120
And I mowed the backyard

554
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,360
And I started on the front yard

555
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,380
And I hit a root

556
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,460
I hit a root

557
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,540
And here's the thing

558
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,660
This is the second time I've used

559
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,180
This brand new lawnmower

560
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,140
What is this cheery music in the background

561
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,300
That makes me sick

562
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,280
Where's Dave?

563
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,380
And he believes it's a fail

564
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,220
It's a total fail this injury

565
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,660
All of a sudden

566
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,140
All I had to do was get mad and yell

567
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,040
Where's Dave?

568
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,160
And there he appears

569
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,660
Well you said

570
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,760
You remember the time you mentioned

571
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,060
And so I was trying to keep to the schedule

572
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,380
Although I'm a few minutes floating

573
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,700
You see

574
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,240
Not too long ago

575
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,740
I had a visitation

576
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
I was in my side yard

577
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,500
Right out by the driveway

578
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,180
And I looked up and uh

579
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,280
I think it's gonna happen, Stang

580
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,700
You're gonna fix my lawnmower?

581
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,400
No, I think an extraterrestrial being

582
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,920
Perhaps some vapor type of astral projection

583
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,440
Perhaps is going to fix it

584
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,880
Well on next day

585
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,300
Everything will be fixed

586
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,260
But good

587
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,840
But you won't have a lawn on next day

588
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,540
Yes

589
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,620
You'll have some freshly new mowed grass

590
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,260
But you're not gonna be able to find any turtles to put in

591
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,240
If you know what I'm saying

592
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Well it won't be all gnarly with roots

593
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,840
It'll be

594
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,880
It will

595
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,080
My yard on my escape vessel

596
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,260
Let's see

597
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,340
What will it be like?

598
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,160
I guess I should think about that

599
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,100
Princess, what would you like?

600
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,900
We won't have to mow it for one thing

601
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,080
I think it should be

602
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,120
We'll have goats that mow it for us

603
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,200
Space goats

604
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,520
Yeah, one-eyed goats that stare back at you

605
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,980
Remember that show Space Goats?

606
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,020
That was great

607
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,720
Yeah

608
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,460
And uh

609
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:53,640
What?

610
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,600
Yeah

611
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,040
It was a talk show

612
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,660
Space Goats

613
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,320
Did the goat inflate things with its uh

614
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,240
You know its uh area back there?

615
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,520
How they do at the state fairs?

616
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,460
You know you place a balloon in the goat's rectum

617
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,300
And it will bark and blow it up

618
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,100
And it also plays songs on a bicycle horn

619
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,660
With different pitched bicycles

620
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,340
Oh in Texas they always used uh

621
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,680
Psychotic goats

622
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,960
Animal cruelty

623
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,040
Well other animals

624
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:23,920
Pigs

625
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,400
Can Dave stare at a lawn mower?

626
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,680
And get it to come back?

627
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,140
Right

628
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,740
Oh if only I could

629
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,180
I'm missing one valuable, valuable lesson

630
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,560
And then I could proceed to uh

631
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,000
Take apart the middle spindle

632
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,640
And uh the entire apparatus if you'd like

633
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,940
Straighten the crank?

634
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,220
Yeah the crank

635
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,060
Men who stare at lawn mowers

636
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,520
That's too, that um

637
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,420
In the underworld of uh

638
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,340
Conspiracy theories

639
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,680
What you just said was rife with meaning

640
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,420
Whatever the hell that means

641
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:56,680
Oh yeah?

642
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,760
Really rife

643
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,080
Well lawn mowing is known to be like

644
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,480
Giving a haircut meaning you

645
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,600
You blast somebody with uh

646
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,720
Different types of rays

647
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,980
Whether ELF or PFM or whatever types

648
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,800
Not PFM

649
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,640
ELF or whatever types of

650
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,160
Hmmmm

651
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,780
Uh substantial uh way you want to destabilize

652
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,500
The character

653
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,920
Of the character

654
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,980
Or just destabilize you know

655
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,520
A lot of people like to make pudding with it

656
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,140
Well so uh aliens will come and fix everything

657
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,420
Now I read in the

658
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,140
In the conspiracy news today

659
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,020
That Stephen Hawking

660
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,240
Uh whose mom I think is a character on Lost

661
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,560
Is uh

662
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,520
Stephen Hawking was saying

663
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,900
That he thought when the aliens came

664
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,540
They'd probably be bad news

665
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,280
Because they may very well come in the form of diseases

666
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,420
Like my little friends that I study in my micro aquariums

667
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,180
They would be

668
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,260
The aliens would be

669
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,520
What we call diseases

670
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,160
Now they might see themselves as Vulcan Jedi Mentats

671
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,620
But to us they would be fatal

672
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,680
I think

673
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,000
Dr. Hawking used the

674
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,720
Example of Columbus

675
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,880
And the Native Americans

676
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,240
Well I've been to Columbus quite a few times

677
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,980
And I can tell you the bacteria is just rampant down there

678
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,320
Especially on High Street

679
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,580
But what you were saying about Hawking

680
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,280
It doesn't have good bacteria

681
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,140
Or Hawker as some of us like to call him

682
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,340
Is he just spat upon the wrong wall

683
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,380
Because extraterrestrial biologically

684
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,420
We've been bombarded with viruses

685
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,040
And uh

686
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,340
And um

687
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,860
Disease things for

688
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,240
Since the beginning

689
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,220
Well some people think that that's how life got started here

690
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,800
Was uh

691
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,140
Came through space on comets

692
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,940
Because some critters can actually survive

693
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,480
As tons

694
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,360
Little dried up shriveled things

695
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,980
In out of space

696
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,220
Personally

697
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,200
I don't find that a necessary explanation

698
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,080
But I'm not expecting a necessary explanation

699
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,120
Only unnecessary explanations

700
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,080
A platitude

701
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,520
That's what this church is all about

702
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,600
A turgid heaping helping of a platitude

703
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,520
A big platter of platitudes

704
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,560
A buffet's worth

705
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,760
That's what any good religions were about

706
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,180
Things that make you

707
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,560
Things that sound good

708
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,200
They don't have to be good

709
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,780
They don't have to be true

710
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,900
They just have to make you feel better

711
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,740
Oh Listerine take a look at that

712
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,140
They've got the sweet and sour bobs head over there

713
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,260
And there's the general sours chicken

714
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,980
I don't know which I'm gonna try first

715
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,020
And they're all so different

716
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,880
And yet so alike

717
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:38,980
See

718
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,700
When you follow a metaphor down it's logical path

719
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,320
You often get stuck in some place that's really scary

720
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,720
And surrounded by like pointy sticks and stuff

721
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,680
So

722
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,740
That's why we don't let amateurs do this show with us

723
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,500
Well

724
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,160
Technically speaking we are amateurs

725
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,580
Well we're amateurs at some things like suicide

726
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,940
Well at the Art of Radio perhaps we're wank amateurs

727
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,080
But maybe our rank is higher than we think

728
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,200
I prefer to think of us as wank amateurs

729
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,640
Yeah unfortunately

730
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,520
There's a lot of excited substance that gets out there

731
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,560
And doesn't really fertilize anything though

732
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,440
That's why I stare at goats

733
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,820
And lawnmowers

734
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,200
Yeah

735
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,440
Working lawnmowers

736
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,760
Well why would anyone want to live in such an awful world

737
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,160
Where all the devices had brains of some sort

738
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,800
And were all

739
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,520
You know how they can create conceivably

740
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,540
Smart phones

741
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,100
Nano life

742
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,580
Yeah smart phones, smart lawnmowers, smart nano bots

743
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,620
That's just what we need

744
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,100
Smart sky

745
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,820
What's that

746
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,220
The super satellite that takes over the world in Terminator

747
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,740
Skylift or Skyhook or whatever it is

748
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,400
Skyhook

749
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,200
Skyeye

750
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,640
Skyball

751
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,560
Skybrain

752
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,220
Yeah

753
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,320
Skyburnetics

754
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:58,540
There we go

755
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,780
The ancient, no that's not an ancient art it's not even an art

756
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,900
Scrying that's what you're thinking about

757
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,560
Scrying

758
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,340
Scrybabies they would tell the future

759
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,560
Well it's like rolfing

760
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,600
With their screeches

761
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:20,500
It's like rolfing once you release all of the negative emotion that you've been storing in your body for the last 30 years or something like that

762
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,720
Not to mention the body

763
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,900
The three bottles of wine you drank that night

764
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,220
You have to rolf those as well

765
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,340
Regularly

766
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,540
Into the porcelain

767
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,020
Prayer altar

768
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,780
Which is pretty much what we're doing right now we're giving up offerings to the porcelain god

769
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,020
Nothing that's coming out so far is I would call it anything but waste

770
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,580
Actually I have something that's sort of interesting that came right through the ethers through

771
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,960
My telephone

772
00:29:52,580 --> 00:30:05,680
That lets me know that anyone who is interested could go to this website and learn about Rocknar being going into politics

773
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,000
Oh that's right

774
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,560
There's a website

775
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:19,620
Governor Rocknar the sub genius who frequently calls synesthesia following this show and thus ends up on our slack

776
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,560
Oh my god

777
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:20,560


778
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,580
Rocknar had a he's running for congress in Kentucky

779
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,880
On the progressive anarcho syndicalist

780
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,400
Well he was

781
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:36,100
I don't know but he was pushing Dr. Hal to run in San Francisco

782
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,340
I think he just run as a sub genius

783
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:46,960
And he got tired of pushing so yeah he started he's he is actually and he was going to speak on the 22nd

784
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,680
Yes

785
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,980
I was I was wondering how that turned out

786
00:30:50,980 --> 00:31:04,900
We don't know anything about it but maybe there's a report at http forward slash slash tiny earl dot com r vance v a n c e 2010

787
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,300
Oh tiny earl dot com r vance 2010

788
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
2010

789
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,320
Oh okay

790
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,720
Forward slash yes

791
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,020
Oh well

792
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,660
I was hoping there would be like a lot of flower type like flower drum girls and stuff and people like that

793
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:18,660


794
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,780
People waving red flags wearing shorts that you can actually see the crotch area and stuff

795
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:28,800
And tea makers I understand that the people who make love tea come to these events nowadays

796
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:38,760
The nice tea makers or am I confusing them with the homosexuals who lay their parts upon the faces and tops of the heads

797
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,700
Now see Rocknar was into that too

798
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,580
He didn't know he was

799
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:48,640
He wasn't so much tricked into it but he volunteered for the wrong thing

800
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,400
He was a blind robin

801
00:31:51,400 --> 00:32:00,220
He volunteered for what some somebody else had been set up for the sacred tea bagging ceremony at X day a couple of years ago

802
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,320
And the guy who was going to be the victim who didn't know that was what it was going to be

803
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,280
Thought he thought it was he was going to be getting a haircut

804
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,900
Well that guy had to leave

805
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,280
That guy had to leave

806
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,980
Well Rocknar thought well I want the free haircut and they're going to videotape it and everything

807
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,620
So and he didn't think much of me

808
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,580
He didn't think much was out of hand when they duct taped him to a lawn chair

809
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,880
Oh he should be in a good sport

810
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:31,240
But then when all the men well some of the men of X day and one or two women lined up behind him

811
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:41,880
And laid upon his bald pate the progenitorial sack one might say

812
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,040
It was a tea party a tea bagging party in the old school sense

813
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:54,880
Okay now I'm imagining proboscis filled with delights from Sri Lanka and so forth

814
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,560
But you're actually talking about the Mons Venere some sort of insect or something

815
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,200
Well it's one of those you had to you wouldn't want to have been there things

816
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,220
You had to have been there but you really wouldn't want to be

817
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,240
Yeah noise information so to speak

818
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:18,500
So let's skip let's just skip right by the tea bagging debate

819
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:18,600
Yeah let's just skip right by the tea bagging debate

820
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,220
Well I just have one fine point

821
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,600
Just one fine very fine point

822
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,120
Wasn't his pate embalmed for this ritual

823
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,240
Didn't he start with a full head of hair and they first they took the hair off

824
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,820
And then the okay I may be I may be completely wrong

825
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,980
We were way ahead of those right wing cranks let me put it that way friends

826
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,920
We were so many years ahead of the tea party bunch

827
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,400
As usual they see sub geniuses do something just as a satire

828
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,620
And fringe insane people take it to heart

829
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,560
And will imitate us but they're not kidding

830
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,280
Where do you think Fox is getting all their ideas

831
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,460
Don't you check out the people or checking out your website all the time

832
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,500
Keep your enemies close and your friends closer

833
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,600
That's what Apache I mean Arapaho always said you know the guy

834
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,400
Yeah

835
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,520
Yeah and so don't think I mean don't you know

836
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,700
The Cheyenne they would be very they would stay shy

837
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,760
And destabilizing too

838
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,460
And just watch

839
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,840
Watch in a destabilizing way

840
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,540
So you're saying that Fox News people they tune in on the hour of slack

841
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,400
And read subgenius.com and that's where they get that stuff

842
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,840
Do you think they have any original ideas of their own

843
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,460
Do you think they're capable of original creative thought no

844
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,960
I kind of thought that

845
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,020
They must scour there's a name for these kind of people in New York City

846
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,340
Well they're good at making things up I know that

847
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,600
Well just you have to consider the source and consider the resource

848
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,780
There used to be in New York City a long time ago near Tin Pan Alley

849
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,000
Was a bunch of buildings filled with so called producers

850
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,120
In your film racket you're in

851
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,340
Yeah

852
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:13,440
And they would just regularly solicit scripts ideas anything they wanted to do

853
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,840
And they promised the world and give back nothing

854
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,080
And of course New York State did investigate them and it propped up elsewhere

855
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,320
Hollywood yeah

856
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,880
Yeah

857
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,280
And the rest of the world and into the infinite sky

858
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:37,140
So what you're saying the church of the subgenius is what everything in the whole world

859
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,220
Has inadvertently been imitating and copying from

860
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,780
And discarded in many cases you must say that

861
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:48,140
Well sure because it would be insane to try to live that way unless you were a subgenius

862
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,980
Now see a pink trying to live like a subgenius is going to look like an idiot

863
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:58,540
Well I guess anybody living like a subgenius is going to look like an idiot but

864
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,460
Duh

865
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:00,900
Definitely

866
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,420
Duh

867
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:09,920
Yeah why do you think they call it subgenius have I already used that one this year

868
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,320
Oh no

869
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,240
I bet I have yeah

870
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,380
Yeah

871
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,520
I'm sorry Bob

872
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,840
Did you do the thing about the yeti with the purple mohawk and that cultural studies thing that was done in 1949 I guess

873
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,200
Did you go through all the whole smear

874
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,140
No I think you just did though

875
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,700
Well yeah that's the pretty much the is all and be all of the thing me

876
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,600
We're only allowed

877
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:39,800
Put a purple mohawk on a yeti to see what the cultural disadvantages would be within his in group meaning other yetis to the great northwest or is it south east

878
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,760
But they can grow their hair into all kinds of elaborate things

879
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,520
Yeah

880
00:36:43,520 --> 00:37:00,080
They can change the color of their hair at will they can shed all their hair instantly have it grow back in patterns they can be striped dotted mangy if they want to look that way for pity you know if they're feeling sorry for themselves

881
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,560
It is bad

882
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:11,380
Yeti they can alter their bone structure takes a while I understand now I've Mark I've never seen this happen

883
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:11,680
Yeah

884
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,960
But among the sub yeti

885
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,160
Among the sub yeti well yeah

886
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:34,920
Many of them are just incapable they're challenged they can't regrow their own hair at will and they can't regrow their own bones well they try and sometimes they manage to feel a little bump over there or look there's a little patch of peach fudge growing there but they never succeed the same way that the ancestors do

887
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:41,920
Well we've our bloodline's been watered down you know there's hardly any full blood yetis left and

888
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,300
I guess we've all

889
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,920
You know

890
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,340
Had

891
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,360
What do they call it we've been we've been touched with the human paintbrush

892
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,880
Yes we've been talked

893
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,400
At the human

894
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,220
Paintbrush

895
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,240
Paintbrush

896
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,880
Tainted

897
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,160
Yeah

898
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,360
We've all got some of the human taint

899
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,500
We've been played

900
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,200
Our taints have even more of the human taint

901
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,040
We've been burnished over as well

902
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,180
You know when it's time to look at this

903
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,160
Anxiety

904
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,600
I can't go and talk about it no more

905
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,280
The rabbits

906
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,380
The clois

907
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,620
We're going to lose

908
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:11,900
What are they

909
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:11,900


910
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:11,900


911
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:11,900


912
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:11,900


913
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:11,900


914
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:11,900


915
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,160
Coming apart in the back.

916
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,640
Therefore, I think this is what's coming undone.

917
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:23,380
Now, when the X-Men, or the men from Planet X, or the sex goddesses, whatever you want to call them,

918
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,220
when they come here this July 5th, morn, at 7 o'clock in the morning,

919
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,520
we will be given the powers of our Yeti ancestors,

920
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,620
and we'll be able to change our physical appearance at will.

921
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,420
And have you thought about what you're going to do, Dave?

922
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:47,760
Dave? No, Rob Nahr, a long time ago, said he was going to keep his same large, clumsy body.

923
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,600
Well, I'm going to keep my large, clumsy body, only it's going to be indestructible.

924
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,920
Kind of indestructible.

925
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,620
Oh, so it doesn't matter how clumsy you are.

926
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,300
Oh, well, if I'm indestructible, it certainly is, and it's going to be whoever I clumsy into.

927
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,360
Right, right.

928
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,320
You bendy bones.

929
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:11,180
And to keep that at a minimal, I was going to originally say at the beginning of the conversation about, you know, lawnmowers and wood spirits,

930
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,180
and things that go bump on your lawnmower, that, like, I was going to have sylphs and sylphides,

931
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,180
of which I don't know the difference between them.

932
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:24,200
I was going to have sylphs and sylphides be my actual greenery in my space vessel.

933
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,500
Are you one of them pagans that worships the green man?

934
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,900
You know, that's really Satanism.

935
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,360
I know that the green man is...

936
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,380
Even though the devil is red and the green man's green, it's still, it's a colored man.

937
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,440
That means the devil.

938
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,020
And they both have horns.

939
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,040
Funny colored man.

940
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,160
But the green man is not considered.

941
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,220
The devil everywhere in the world, it's considered a nature spirit.

942
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:44,740
Right.

943
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,100
Only idiots consider that to be the devil.

944
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,560
But there's, idiots actually outnumber pagans.

945
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:59,500
And although they include quite a few of the, a rather large percentage of the pagans within that number,

946
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:05,740
pagans are, I suppose, idiots are a subset of paganry as well as everything else.

947
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:11,400
Could we say that many pagans, as well as those, especially who assail...

948
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:17,220
Assail them for the beliefs are not fully aware of everything they should be.

949
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:27,920
Now, pagans are not to be confused with pegging or pagan, which is an act, some sort of a sex act that I don't even know what it means for sure.

950
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,860
It's something that pagans do when they get naked.

951
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:37,100
You see how the E changes to the A, linguistically deterministic and so forth.

952
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,400
I know, I know a pagan who needs to get pegged.

953
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:41,580
Pegged.

954
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,080
Pegged.

955
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,180
Pegged.

956
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,600
But, um...

957
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,980
Can I ask you a question about Mars?

958
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,820
I know it's not the right time because everyone's having sex again back there in the booth and stuff.

959
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,080
Obama's from Mars.

960
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,320
He's not even an Earth man.

961
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,140
I want to see, I want to see his planetary birth certificate.

962
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,160
We haven't got one until the globalists take all the way over.

963
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:07,680
That's right.

964
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,080
Yeah.

965
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,560
But, uh, I...

966
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,400
I have...

967
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:30,880
I had heard that, um, the human race was, as we know it, was a modified gene that was somehow transcripted by the dying Martian race, which looked a bit different than we do, um, to those, you know, perhaps of the Yeti bent and others of the primate families.

968
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,920
The ones at least having family reunions regularly.

969
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,440
And that those were the ones who escaped from the, uh...

970
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,900
Ancient astronauts.

971
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,080
Well, is it true?

972
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,420
Uh, everything is true.

973
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,220
Oh.

974
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:45,820
Eventually.

975
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:53,560
Sooner or later, at some point in a galaxy long, long ago and far, far away, everything happened.

976
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,020
That's called quantum physics.

977
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,700
Or will happen.

978
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,320
Well, no, I'm not talking about anything quantum.

979
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,900
I'm just talking plain, straight history.

980
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,460
It's just that we don't know about all of them.

981
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,360
But it is quantum physics, too, because there's less than a zero probability of any damn thing there could possibly...

982
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,940
be happening just by the nature of there being less than a zero possibility.

983
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,320
Oh, Dave, now come on.

984
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:24,200
That math stuff is just a bunch of hoo-ha dreamed up by scientists to scare stoners and little kids.

985
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,600
All that infinity stuff, all that quantum, that's just to confuse stoners.

986
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,380
That's just something...

987
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,900
You know, it's like religion.

988
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,480
It's just something the mathematicians came up with to...

989
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,720
It's a control thing.

990
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,100
Well, I'm glad to hear that at least...

991
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,720
They're turning out some stone-confused kids there in our educational system.

992
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,080
Well, have you done the math that leads up to E equals MC squared?

993
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,180
Well, I've...

994
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:58,800
It reminds me of my favorite little button that Nenslow had printed up.

995
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,420
It said...

996
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,580
It was a little button.

997
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,180
I bought ten of them and gave them out for Christmas.

998
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,860
It said, what part of E equals MC squared don't you understand?

999
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,620
That was a good bumper sticker.

1000
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,880
Or still is.

1001
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,500
Thanks to Nenslow.

1002
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:21,580
If we were butterflies, you know, within the Japanese psycho-psyche,

1003
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:28,300
if we could come and go as we will, between dimensions and so forth,

1004
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,040
then, and only then, would we be, you know, doing that.

1005
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,000
Doing what?

1006
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,760
I was listening to the music and not you.

1007
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,260
I forgot what you were talking about.

1008
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,060
Hide it.

1009
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,060
I forgot what you were talking about.

1010
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:42,060


1011
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,700
We'll find out when we play the tape back.

1012
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:52,120
Well, I think what I meant was, if we're speaking in terms of haptics or perhaps morphosis,

1013
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:01,300
metamorphosis becoming like being able to merge into different dimensions just with a snap of an eyelid.

1014
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:09,240
But you were talking earlier about metamorphosis being a path that you don't want to go down or something like that.

1015
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,080
Or were you just talking about going down?

1016
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,440
I was talking about pedagogological.

1017
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,100
Not pedophiliological, but pedagogical.

1018
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,440
God, you know it.

1019
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,780
Maybe we're getting in a little bit over our heads, Dave.

1020
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,580
You like gynecology.

1021
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,440
Are we wading in a little too deep?

1022
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,240
Sure.

1023
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:32,680
Are we swimming into waters that subgeniuses are banned from for good reason?

1024
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:32,960
Yeah.

1025
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,600
They don't even know what an obstructed...

1026
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,500
An obstructed...

1027
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,960
Because subgeniuses will get into this deep intellectual water and then we...

1028
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,080
We'll get into this deep intellectual water and then we...

1029
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,640
We in it.

1030
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,560
Yeah, you'll immediately see if you examine any of the websites and so forth.

1031
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,680
The websites, they call them.

1032
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:54,720
They start to make these grand pronouncements and back them up with a curious amount of information and research inside it as well.

1033
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,100
And then they say, oh, poo-poo panties, and then give a funny name and sign off.

1034
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,280
You know?

1035
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,600
I mean, I'm sorry I had that, you know, there.

1036
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,880
I guess I felt embarrassed about saying that, but...

1037
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,280
I'm sorry, too.

1038
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,680
Oh, me three.

1039
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,360
And what about my lawnmower?

1040
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:10,920
Oh, God!

1041
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,760

There ought to be a warranty or something.

1044
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,840
Calm down, Mrs.

1045
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,540
Just do that.

1046
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,060
Just calm down.

1047
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:28,840
Relax.

1048
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,600
Get here in the dental chair.

1049
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,420
The dental chair pickin' air.

1050
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,400
That's right.

1051
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:41,060
The dental chair pickin' air will just take apart all those loads and cares and worries that you're wearing.

1056
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,740
Somebody called this show childish.

1057
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,520
Well, somebody was...

1058
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:46,940
It's only money.

1059
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,420
They called us childish.

1060

00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,040
since X Day is a subgenius event.

1100
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:48,280
They would find not only all kinds of lies and truth about what we think might happen this X Day,

1101
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,820
and directions and so forth,

1102
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,780
but we have these wonderful pictorials of past X Days.

1103
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,520
And now I know some people out there don't like to see young ladies,

1104
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,520
photographs of young ladies with their shirts off,

1105
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,580
and they shouldn't look at subgenius.com.

1106
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,360
Enough said.

1107
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,040
Sometimes.

1108
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:10,600
Sometimes.

1109
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:10,940
Sometimes.

1110
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:11,060
Sometimes.

1111
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:11,060


1112
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:11,060


1113
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,460
Some of the ladies took off their shirts,

1114
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,220
and there was like a suit of armor underneath their shirts.

1115
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,020
Well, no kidding, man.

1116
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,820
There's some high-maintenance ladies.

1117
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,400
The character armor...

1118
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,540
Sure, their skin may be nude,

1119
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,400
but the character armor is hard.

1120
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,620
It's hard bark on them.

1121
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:35,480
Like a gillemonster or some little tiny lizard-like creature that lives in the desert.

1122
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,720
You know, and their skin is so rough and tough,

1123
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,940
you couldn't even chew it off if it could manage to hold it.

1124
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,460
things neck down long enough to get bited from behind.

1125
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,140
And it's not just Susie the floozy, friends.

1126
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,140
Well, in some ways it is just Susie the floozy, but yeah, I get what you're saying.

1127
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:04,960
So, you know, I've had a couple of the girls of X-Day, we'll call them in a sexist manner,

1128
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:12,780
have called me up and said, Reverend Stang, remember back in 1999 when I wrestled on the

1129
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,780
giant American flag covered with blood and I was nude?

1130
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:21,700
Well, I'm trying to get back with my family again now, and can you take those pictures down?

1131
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,120
And I did.

1132
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:30,080
So, friends, that means you better look at year 2000, 2001 before the girls from those

1133
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,960
years tell us to take their pictures down.

1134
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:32,640
Right.

1135
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,260
That's right.

1136
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,940
Take your pants off.

1137
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,880
Take your pants down before we take those pictures down.

1138
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,100
If you weren't so homophobic.

1139
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,180
What?

1140
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:40,960
Huh?

1141
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:41,940
Pardon me?

1142
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,960
The only thing I'm homophobic about is I'm phobic about homophobes.

1143
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,740
I fear people who fear queers.

1144
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,300
You fear people who fear queers?

1145
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:53,600
Yeah.

1146
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,320
I'm afraid I'll catch it.

1147
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,800
I'm afraid that homophobia is somehow contagious.

1148
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,820
See, then you believe in karma.

1149
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,940
And you know they're always going...

1150
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,100
Those homophobes, they're recruiters.

1151
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,320
You know, they're always trying to recruit young kids to become like them.

1152
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,180
Well, remember...

1153
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,160
The homophobes are.

1154
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,520
In the old days, they used to have what they would call the latent homophobic.

1155
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:21,700
And he's always, like, dressed up as a policeman or one of those, you know, guys exploring

1156
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,700
in the jungle and stuff.

1157
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,040
And then he would start killing...

1158
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,580
Or he would be a Nazi and stuff and start killing people.

1159
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,940
Because he had too many X chromosomes or Y chromosomes.

1160
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,540
I mean, we're only supposed to have one of each, aren't we?

1161
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,600
Well, and some people are just insecure.

1162
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,680
That, you know, what you're going to do.

1163
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,080
That's what it boils down to.

1164
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,700
But some of them do have two X's.

1165
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,720
And that doesn't mean, like, double X day or anything like that.

1166
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,040
Some of them are just genetically...

1167
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,700
All my X's are in Texas.

1168
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,860
It's actually true in my case.

1169
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,540
I can...

1170
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,340
I'm stuck in this bar trying to find my car.

1171
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,500
And all my X's are in Texas.

1172
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,460
And all my X's are in Texas.

1173
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,160
And all my X's are in Texas.

1174
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,420
You sound old, Dave.

1175
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,860
Oh, I feel old right now.

1176
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,920
Every neighbor and thing.

1177
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,820
I was just about to say how young he sounded.

1178
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,560
I sound like a...

1179
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,360
Oh, I forgot what you were talking about.

1180
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,760
What were you talking about?

1181
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,300
The days in the old El Paso?

1182
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,420
I was talking about that music we had on.

1183
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,560
And the background was Perry Kingsley.

1184
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,900
The old-timey Space Age bachelor pad music.

1185
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,080
Thanks to Mr. Sister for loaning us that.

1186
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,780
Thanks for the lounge job, Stan.

1187
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,860
Yeah, it was a lounge job.

1188
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:34,940
Yeah, it was a lounge job.

1189
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,420
Yeah.

1190
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,960
Which is better than a sleeve job anyway,

1191
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,040
if you're working second shift.

1192
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,620
Believe it or not, I'm looking at a new Devo album

1193
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,940
that we found when we walked into the station

1194
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,100
called Fresh.

1195
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,460
It's not really an album.

1196
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,560
It's a demo or a promo thing.

1197
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,280
It's got a side A is a three-minute song called Fresh

1198
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,780
and side B is a three-minute song called What We Do.

1199
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,920
And it shows a blue power dome

1200
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,940
full of blue plastic fruit on the cover.

1201
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,660
And I was tempted.

1202
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,460
Just because I haven't heard this,

1203
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,820
it's like, well, I've got Bernard versus the conspiracy.

1204
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,960
I've got El Paso All-Stars Hour of Slack sign out.

1205
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,500
I've got Men Who Stare at Goats excerpt three.

1206
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,620
But I'm tempted to go out with this Devo song

1207
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,880
just because I haven't heard it.

1208
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,520
Do you want to listen in and hear the new Devo song

1209
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,440
and maybe just ruin it while we talk over it?

1210
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,320
Are we close to the end of the hour?

1211
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,200
Yeah, we sure are.

1212
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,200
It's like five minutes.

1213
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,800
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, okay.

1214
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,820
The other thing is,

1215
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,260
I haven't played an actual record,

1216
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,980
a vinyl record in this station ever.

1217
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,460
And we'll just see what happens

1218
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,060
if I push all three of these buttons right now.

1219
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,140
Oh, it's like magic.

1220
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:47,860
One of them's working.

1221
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,000
Is it a 45?

1222
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,660
Sort of.

1223
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,800
Oh, it's an old EP type thing.

1224
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:59,400
It's actually, it's a full-size vinyl album and it's...

1225
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,860
Okay, now let's listen to the new Devo song.

1226
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:03,880
Listen carefully.

1227
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:05,220
Yeah, carefully.

1228
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:05,760
Carefully.

1229
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,460
Don't be...

1230
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:07,980
Okay.

1231
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,060
Careful now.

1232
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,060
Don't repeat any of the lines like...

1233
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:21,340
Mania?

1234
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,220
Mania?

1235
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:22,780
Mania?

1236
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,280
Mania?

1237
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,140
Mania?

1238
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:27,240


1239
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,440
Mania?

1240
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,140
Mania?

1241
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:34,620
Mania?

1242
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,200
I wonder if this is supposed to be a 45.

1243
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,460
Maybe it's a 78.

1244
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,300
Yeah.

1245
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:52,900
Dude.

1246
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,200
He meant to do that.

1247
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,360
I think he means to have a second brain.

1248
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,560
And for nothing could be better, right?

1249
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,100
Like a man who went to heaven.

1250
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,740
So fresh it almost makes me want to cry.

1251
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,960
So fresh it's giving me a second life.

1252
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,820
Man, I wish everybody'd see Reverend Peg dance to this.

1253
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,380
It's all over the studio.

1254
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,300
Go hands down.

1255
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,060
I won't even think twice

1256
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,960
A man in the world of a 45-year-old woman

1257
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,220
A man of his own

1258
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,500
He's gonna come around the corner waiting just outside the top

1259
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,040
Drinking, drinking, sweet and tangy

1260
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,680
Daring me to track him down

1261
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,640
And this guy, I know

1262
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,340
He's black and he's a high-rise tower

1263
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,840
He's blasting through the sands of time

1264
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,480
It's useless to resist his power

1265
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,680
He's now or never

1266
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,280
So fresh

1267
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,080
I'll search it till I find it

1268
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:00,740
So fresh

1269
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:03,140
I'm closing in behind it

1270
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:03,560
So fresh

1271
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,180
Nothing could be better

1272
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:06,980
So fresh

1273
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,140
Like a daddy went to heaven

1274
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,140
So fresh

1275
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,160
So fresh

1276
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,960
So fresh

1277
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,080
So fresh

1278
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,860
So fresh

1279
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,300
It almost makes me want to cry

1280
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,240
So fresh

1281
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,940
It's giving me a second

1282
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:31,600
Love

1283
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,000
Love

1284
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,220
Love

1285
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:32,700
Love

1286
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,040
Love

1287
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:33,320
Love

1288
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:33,380
Love

1289
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:33,540
Love

1290
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,540


1291
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,540


1292
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,540


1293
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,540


1294
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,540


1295
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,540


1296
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,540


1297
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,540


1298
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,540


1299
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,540


1300
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,540


1301
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:33,540


1302
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:33,780
Love

1303
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:33,780


1304
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,120
Love

1305
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:34,620
Love

1306
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:34,920
Love

1307
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:34,920


1308
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:34,920


1309
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,440
So fresh

1310
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,880
It almost makes me want to cry

1311
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,740
So fresh

1312
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,100
It's giving me a second chance

1313
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:43,200
So fresh

1314
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,920
Well, that is amazing.

1315
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,280
Fresh.

1316
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,820
By the Devos.

1317
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:51,300
And it sounds as fresh as 1980.

1318
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,120
It does sound fresh as night.

1319
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,200
When you first played it,

1320
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,860
I thought they were actually going in a different direction

1321
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,480
and this expressed their newness.

1322
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,340
Yeah, me too.

1323
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,980
It's going, well, that's great.

1324
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,280
They've got a new sound.

1325
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,520
And then I realized it really is a 45.

1326
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:13,160
Actually, it's a blue-colored, the size of a regular 33 RPM vinyl record,

1327
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,660
but it's printed on blue plastic, and it is a 45.

1328
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,060
Yes, that's part of the vinyl revolution is to come up with the silliest format.

1329
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:26,440
You could think of a 45 as big as a wedding cake or something like that.

1330
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,940
Well, you know, if I was cool, I'd go, well, this is just a dance mix.

1331
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,180
You know, this is what clubs get.

1332
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,320
But they did have it.

1333
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:38,140
They're higher res at 45 RPM, just slightly.

1334
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:39,700
Oh, well.

1335
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:44,020
Well, res is important, at least if you're from this place.

1336
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,240
Yeah, if you're from, well, like I used to live on the Rosebud res.

1337
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,540
And what's the res around here?

1338
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,260
Rosebud was near Wounded Knee, the Wounded Knee res.

1339
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,020
But, hey, look, it's getting time to stop.

1340
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,820
You made me think about Orson Welles.

1341
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,360
I was wearing a funny hat when you said that.

1342
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,660
Well, what do you think this is, some kind of stream of consciousness show?

1343
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,200
I hope not.

1344
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,240
For the love of God, what could be worse than that?

1345
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,540
For the muggery of blobs.

1346
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,460
Remember, free association is not free.

1347
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:23,520
Hey, I've been listening lately to I Was a Communist by the FBI.

1348
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,700
It kind of makes me feel creepy, man.

1349
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,440
Well, I've been listening to the Hour of Slack, but we can't listen anymore,

1350
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,760
so we have to go bye-bye, Dave.

1351
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,480
Okay, we're listening to the FIB.

1352
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,300
Uh, thank you.

1353
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,800
And, uh, we'll, uh, talk anonymously.

1354
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,500
Anonymous, you mean.

1355
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,740
An a-hole.

1356
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,400
How'd you find us, Lynn?

1357
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,660
I told you, I remote-viewed you.

1358
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,660
If this is a psyops base, what are you doing here?

1359
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,920
I said it was primarily psyops.

1360
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,780
They're individuals in the current administration

1361
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:55,220
who are looking for creative solutions to the war on terror.

1362
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,780
They're far more open-minded than their predecessors,

1363
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:00,700
and they've outsourced experimental research to my company.

1364
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,860
Sick.

1365
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,420
It's pronounced psych.

1366
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,140
Psychic Systems International Corp.

1367
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:07,760
Psych.

1368
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,280
Phil's looking into subliminal messaging.

1369
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,460
Oh.

1370
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,040
This is the one we designed to play to our own troops

1371
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,260
before going into combat.

1372
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,140
Push play on that.

1373
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,380
There's a subliminal message in this?

1374
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,720
This one's called

1375
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,920
Don't Get Drunk Before Firing Heavy Machines.

1376
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,400
We're gonna have to get rid of the machine guns.

1377
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,840
We got all sorts of new ideas in development.

1378
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:35,900
Give them one of our new ideas.

1379
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,160
Airbag mine?

1380
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,880
Airbag mine. Non-lethal.

1381
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:39,460
Boom!

1382
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,820
Catapult her right into the air.

1383
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,600
Give me another one.

1384
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,120
Uh, blast target with pheromones and then release attack bees.

1385
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:44,800
Excellent.

1386
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,400
Attack bees. The forces of nature.

1387
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:48,940
Another.

1388
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,560
Project Achilles. We mutilate enemy corpses.

1389
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,900
No, we're not doing that one anymore, you idiot.

1390
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,420
The point is, we got a budget, we got supporters.

1391
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,740
I'm rebuilding the New Earth Army.

1392
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:00,920
I'm rebuilding the New Earth Army.

1393
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,040
Everyone this time without all the hippie crap.

1394
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,040
IT'S CHEYENNE

1395
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:08,940
It's cheyenne-like very well, right?

1396
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:10,920
Yeah.

1397
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:11,220
All right.

1398
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:27,680
My-my-my, now what.

1399
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:27,940
I'm Кутч expelled from the Quake Applications.

1400
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,940
The ended result

1401
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,380
The LK Show All Stars.
