00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:07,520
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard our McDonnell Douglas DC-88 space liner for today's mission to Mars.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,440
The captain has asked that you remain in your seats at all times.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,420
And please, no smoking.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,820
Attention, please. Folks, this is Third Officer Collins speaking.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,780
I'm your tour guide today, and I'll be telling you about what's going on during the trip.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,040
Right now, we're on final countdown, and you can watch our liftoff on the lower screen in your cabin.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,100
I'll speak to you again after we're in space.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,820
Mission control, this is Mars 295 ready for departure.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,120
295, roger. Countdown is going.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,360
Going up in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,100
We'll meet again at midnight.

12
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,180
Do a little dance, Rich.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,340
Do a little dance, Rich.

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,980
Do a little dance, Rich.

15
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,780
I said, I'm mad.

16
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:39,640
Praise and grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:49,500
I once was lost, but now I'm found.

18
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,180
I was blind, but now I see.

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,480
I was blind, but now I see.

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,820
Now there's one you don't hear in a bar every day.

21
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,040
Father, Son, Holy God.

22
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, well.

23
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,800
Moses went on to the mountain high to find out from God why did you make us.

24
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,380
Why?

25
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,300
Secret words he held a secret room.

26
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,960
He said, ba-ba-ba-loo-ba-ba-ba-ba-boom.

27
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,120
I did not put you here to suffer.

28
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,980
I did not put you here to whine.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,680
I put you here to love one another.

30
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,140
And the kid, I'm having a good time now, now, now.

31
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,260
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

32
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,560
Yeah, yeah.

33
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,900
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

34
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,180
Go, go, go, go.

35
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,460
Hey, hey, hey.

36
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,260
Let my people go.

37
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,440
All right.

38
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,140
Let my people go.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,100
Yeah.

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,360
Chosh, a victim battled a Jericho.

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,860
He tell the boys with the horns, get down and blow.

42
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,560
They reared back, aimed their bows at the stars.

43
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,700
He said, beat me, big daddy.

44
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,740
Hey, two.

45
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,300
He said, beat me, big daddy.

46
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,300


47
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,380
I did not put you here to suffer.

48
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,400
I did not put you here to whine.

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,160
I put you here to love one another.

50
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,480
And the kid, I'm having a good time now, now, now.

51
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,580
Let my people go, go, go.

52
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,820
Yeah, yeah.

53
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,780
Let my people go, go, go.

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,820
Let my people go, go, go.

55
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,400
Sing it, boy.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,020
Let my people go, go, go.

57
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,020


58
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,440
Let my people go, go, go.

59
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,620
Let's dance, dance, dance, yeah.

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,220
Let'sland that.

61
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,000
Palm joy.

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,760
Let'sland that.

63
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,220
Come on.

64
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,600
I grade, I grade by eyes and sit sound.

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:20,600


66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:20,600


67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:20,600


68
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:20,600


69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,060
You see you on the spot, in stadium.

70
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,060


71
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,460
Me, yeah, yeah.

72
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,520
Ain't no fright, damn.

73
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,300
No I two.

74
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,440
I ain't noare though.

75
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,020
I don't know you want make a mess, all right?

76
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,060
Jesus went out for a walk with his mother

77
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,680
The scribes and the Pharisees

78
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
Plotting over their mother

79
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,300
They locked him up and

80
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,020
They threw away the key

81
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,020
He said, why's everybody always picking on me?

82
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,300
I did not put you on a solver

83
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,000
No, I did not put you on a wife

84
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,500
I put you here to help one another

85
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,180
Yes, and the kid I'm having a good time now

86
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,040
Let my people go, go, go

87
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,040
You gotta let my people go, go, go

88
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,520
Let my people go, go, go

89
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,280
Let my people go, go, go

90
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,700
Let my people go, go, go

91
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,480
Let my people go, go, go

92
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,260
Let my people go, go, go

93
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,460
Let my people go

94
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,340
Got to let my people go

95
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,080
Yeah!

96
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,300
Yeah!

97
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,840
Those other religions,

98
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,560
they want 10% of your income right off the top.

99
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,220
They want you to provide for them

100
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,740
in your will.

101
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,680
They want you to pressure your government

102
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,300
for billion dollar contributions.

103
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,040
They want you to double your taxes

104
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,680
so that they don't have to pay any.

105
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,320
And what does Bob ask for?

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,480
30 lousy bucks.

107
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,200
They're the ones with the extravagant cathedrals,

108
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,220
the lush synagogues,

109
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,680
the giant mosques.

110
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,240
And what do we have?

111
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,140
One hour a week on non-commercial radio.

112
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,580
Now, forgive me if I go out on a limb here,

113
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,580
but doesn't that sound just a little lopsided?

114
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,720
Of course not.

115
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,660
It sounds a lot lopsided.

116
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,100
But we got something they don't have.

117
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,760
It's called slack.

118
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,160
And I don't mean the artificial slack

119
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,840
they try to market for a profit.

120
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,340
Hey, folks, play the lottery and win free slack.

121
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,740
Uh-uh.

122
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,200
I'm talking about real slack.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,960
Internal slack.

124
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:54,820
Slack.

125
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,820
From within.

126
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,780
The kind that feeds on itself like a breeder reactor.

127
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,320
It radiates a warm, fuzzy glow that lights up our lives.

128
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,240
It's an inner peace they will never know.

129
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,140
And therein lies the basic difference

130
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,080
in our religious philosophies.

131
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,240
They stress pain, suffering, and sacrifice

132
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,800
because on the outside, they have everything.

133
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,280
But on the inside, they have nothing.

134
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,800
They're morally bankrupt.

135
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,500
Empty shells.

136
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,620
Just poor, pathetic souls

137
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,700
tormented by inner demons of guilt and self-loathing.

138
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,100
But we Sagini, we are the exact opposite.

139
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,160
While on the outside, we have so little,

140
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,240
on the inside, we have everything.

141
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,020
And that's why we're smiling

142
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,900
and Bob Dobbs is smirking.

143
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,840
Because we're rich with slack.

144
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,340
And for all their money, it's not for sale.

145
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,820
Herein does the word of Bob praise Bob!

146
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,280
Amen.

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:19,440


160
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,300
с So long, everyone!

161
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
We're all here tonight to praise Bob.

162
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,560
He's kind of shown us that Devo works in parallel ways

163
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,120
with other pockets of humans on this planet.

164
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,040
Where we thought we were alone,

165
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,840
we know there are now other human forms

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,740
that believe in conscious mutation.

167
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,360
As he knows, Bob is merely an enema for a constipated society.

168
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,240
These people here are here to help a constipated society

169
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,560
blow it out their ass.

170
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,280
Have you ever met Bob?

171
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,780
Well, like I said, Bob would appear in my bedroom

172
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,140
and chase me around, making me do jumping jacks.

173
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,320
I know what you do

174
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,780
Cause I do it too

175
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,540
Through subversive measures, Devo passes on the word of Bob

176
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,160
by, uh, we, if you take a look at our last album cover,

177
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,540
his name's been airbrushed into the rubber hairlines

178
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,220
of each of the band members, right next to the word sex.

179
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,120
Do Bob and sex go hand in hand?

180
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,480
No.

181
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,280
Well, Bob is a kind of total altercation

182
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,500
all consuming sex.

183
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,220
We're like explosions

184
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,360
That lead to feeling good

185
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,760
We're like ideas

186
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,820
That change the world for good

187
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,000
There's nothing past the stop and go

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,320
There's nothing but the up and go

189
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
There's nothing like some in and out

190
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,880
There's nothing more than what you know

191
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,020
Yes!

192
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,740
Yes!

193
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,540
About the only slack that I get anymore

194
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,880
is worshiping at the Holy Temple of the Yoni.

195
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,460
Tell us about that.

196
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,800
What's that?

197
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,900
I'm sure your audience don't know what the Holy Temple of the Yoni is.

198
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,020
Can you tell us?

199
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,040
It's the female delta.

200
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,780
The female delta.

201
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,560
And that's where you worship.

202
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,340
It's penis fuck pussy.

203
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,100
Oh.

204
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,240
Pussy surround please.

205
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,740
Oh, I see.

206
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,640
State your occupation please.

207
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,400
A libertine and a seducer.

208
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,340
Sex fiend.

209
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,340
Oh yes.

210
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,460
Pure and simple.

211
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,360
A libertine and a seducer.

212
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,180
State your address please.

213
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:18,940
Paradise.

214
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:19,820
Paradise?

215
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,040
Paradise.

216
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,740
I can well understand that.

217
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,940
Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?

218
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,780
Well, we could join together in prayer.

219
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,600
Uh-huh.

220
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,560
But is there anything useful we can do?

221
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,560
No.

222
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,960
Hello friends and welcome.

223
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,640
The sermon tonight is entitled, What If?

224
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,880
It is called that for good reason.

225
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,480
Because you see, everywhere I go across this great nation,

226
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,720
everywhere I tour, every performance I give,

227
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,400
some sincere but misguided Christian

228
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,720
accosts me in the parking lot

229
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,340
and barks a curse we've all heard a million times

230
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,260
for the last two thousand years.

231
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,720
Sinner!

232
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,980
They shriek, eyeballs bulging and bony finger pointing.

233
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,720
You may laugh now, but come judgment day,

234
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,600
what if you're wrong?

235
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,600
If I had but a dime for every time that thinly veiled threat

236
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,180
was hurled towards a subgenius,

237
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,600
I'd have more money than all the trial lawyers

238
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,140
in California and New York combined.

239
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,980
Yet, as mean-spirited as this rhetorical question sounds,

240
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,120
it is in fact a legitimate challenge.

241
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:49,000
What if, Bob forbid, we are wrong?

242
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,820
Such a premise.

243
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,640
It's difficult for subgenius to contemplate

244
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,960
because one of the cornerstones of good salesmanship

245
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,340
is confidence in the product.

246
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,620
We will succeed because we know we will succeed.

247
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,620
It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

248
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,680
To even question the outcome is not only defeatist

249
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,580
and anti-Dobbsian,

250
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,600
it is subgenius sacrilege.

251
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,020
And yet,

252
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,420
in the interest of open theological debate,

253
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,540
we will consider just this once

254
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,020
the question of what if we're wrong.

255
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,860
Now theoretically speaking,

256
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,940
not that it is statistically probable,

257
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,900
but hypothetically imagine if you can

258
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,820
a world come July 5th, 1998,

259
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,960
where there is no excess invasion.

260
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,960
Oh, it's painful, it's painful dear friends, I understand.

261
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,600
But remember, this is only theoretical.

262
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,600
A planet that is not surrounded by an angry alien spacecraft.

263
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,820
A globe not littered,

264
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,020
a globe not completely polluted

265
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,140
with the corpses of conspiracy dupes.

266
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,940
Oh dear friends,

267
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,860
it would be a sick society

268
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,740
still dominated by paints and normals.

269
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,220
An earth where corporations, governments, and well-equipped armies

270
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,520
still loyal to the system,

271
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,560
continue to uphold the status quo.

272
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,960
They fight to maintain their tight totalitarian grasp

273
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,520
on the very throat of freedom.

274
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,420
Oh, it's a nightmarish vision indeed,

275
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,600
one that makes my head spin,

276
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,000
but one we will contemplate nonetheless

277
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,560
in the interest of free and open debate.

278
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,260
Yes dear friends,

279
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,080
this dark future of Dobbsian defeat

280
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,840
and conspiracy conquest,

281
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,420
this desperate future

282
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,820
where the last subgenius forces are holed up

283
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,120
in the underground bunkers

284
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,880
awaiting the final onslaught

285
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,580
by conspiracy mercenaries

286
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,020
is a vision we do not want to contemplate

287
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,600
but will this one last time.

288
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,480
As the Kelvin bombs explode far above

289
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,780
on the planetary surface,

290
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,760
Stane and his subgenius generals

291
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,840
huddle beneath a flickering light bulb

292
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,040
pouring over maps of subgenius tunnels,

293
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,260
subway tunnels, and underground sewers

294
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,780
examining any and all possible attack routes.

295
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,960
They will be determined

296
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,400
determined to fight to death

297
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,180
and take the maximum number of normals with them.

298
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,700
Why?

299
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,760
Because we hate you!

300
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,160
They will be dedicated to honoring Bob

301
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,280
through a dignified Dobbsian death.

302
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,800
It is even, it is then

303
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,380
that some weak of heart heretic

304
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,160
will step forward,

305
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,280
or probably some Bobby,

306
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,800
who always dreamed of being

307
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,740
a real subgenius warrior for wartime,

308
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,240
but when the chips are down for Dobbs

309
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,460
wants to cash out,

310
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,900
this weak-willed wannabe Bobby

311
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,580
will show his first real courage

312
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,320
when he steps forward and whines,

313
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,080
But Reverend Stane,

314
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,280
Bunker!

315
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,760
you promised we'd have something to show

316
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,700
for our membership fee.

317
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,680
The bunker will fall silent like a tomb.

318
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,500
The collected gas will cause

319
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,280
the barometric pressure to plummet.

320
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,540
The bobbing above will pause in divine reverence.

321
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,520
Stane will slowly turn to the trembling traitor,

322
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,800
glare into his frightened little face,

323
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,420
and with the thunder of Daniel Webster

324
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,220
will proclaim the same answer

325
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,160
I gave the Christian in the parking lot,

326
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,540
and that is this.

327
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,340
Even in hell,

328
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,020
we'll have the one thing

329
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,480
the conspiracy tried to deny from us

330
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,240
all our living lives.

331
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,680
The one human right

332
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,840
they'll never be able to take from us again,

333
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,200
no matter how much they lie about what we did

334
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,460
or what they didn't do.

335
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,260
It's the one virtue Christians will never obtain,

336
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,140
no matter how much they beg,

337
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,840
pray,

338
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,620
or grovel to their God.

339
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,300
I'm talking about respect,

340
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,940
self-respect,

341
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,420
the only commodity that can't be bought,

342
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:15,960
traded,

343
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,540
negotiated,

344
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,560
or stolen in any of the conspiracy marketplaces.

345
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,920
Appreciate it. Hallelujah.

346
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,280
It's a concept foreign to all pinks and normals

347
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,360
who serve the system.

348
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,620
They may have stolen our freedom,

349
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,680
our slack,

350
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,200
and even our lives,

351
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,760
but by virtue of our very defiance to them and their ways,

352
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,740
we've earned a self-respect they can't even pretend to want.

353
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,680
And you want to know why?

354
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,840
Why?

355
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,080
Because their religion is based on submission,

356
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,320
while ours is based on independence.

357
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,040
Yes!

358
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,600
Praise Bob!

359
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,820
Give me a praise Bob!

360
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,420
Praise Bob!

361
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,240
Praise Bob!

362
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,140
So that, dear friends, is our answer.

363
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,900
That's what we get,

364
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,840
even if we're wrong,

365
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,280
come Judgment Day.

366
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,640
The honor and dignity of self-respect earned

367
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,700
through a lifelong fight for independence and freedom.

368
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,880
Only the devil

369
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,320
could possibly resent a man

370
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,800
for wanting to be free.

371
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,620
Any God

372
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,960
that wouldn't want his followers to be free

373
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,840
is no savior,

374
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,000
but a tyrant,

375
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,440
an enslaver of souls,

376
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,580
a devil in disguise.

377
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,840
And that leads me to my question to the Christian.

378
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,300
It's terribly original, so brace yourself for it.

379
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,320
What if,

380
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,760
what if you're wrong?

381
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,860
Come Judgment Day.

382
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,600
Please think carefully before you answer, dear friend,

383
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,520
because remember,

384
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,940
your very soul dangles in the balance.

385
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,920
Hear it, it's the word of our praise Bob!

386
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,600
Amen!

387
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,500
Praise Bob!

388
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,380
Praise!

389
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,900
Father Choke Mama!

390
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,200
Father Choke Mama!

391
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,480
Father Choke Mama!

392
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,460
Father Choke Mama!

393
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,580
Father Choke Mama!

394
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,620
This is the age

395
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,400
with the big machine

396
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,740
The age of darkness

397
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,500
The age of bad dreams

398
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,680
There was a light

399
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,660
in the oldest show

400
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,720
I had his back with a vengeance

401
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,400
and he burns to the bone

402
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,680
I had the band

403
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,620
with a plan

404
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,520
and I wanna grow up

405
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,620
to be a renaissance man

406
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,480
I shall discover

407
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,660
the meaning of life

408
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,180
I shall discover how to fly above

409
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,640
I shall discover

410
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,640
America once in my life

411
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,680
And I shall discover the love, oh joy

412
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,780
I am a renaissance man

413
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,320
By Leonardo

414
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,920
Raphael

415
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,060
Raphael Michelangelo

416
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,600
And they got nothing on me

417
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,660
Give me a brush, a push

418
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,600
and a pretty girl's face

419
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,580
I'll be painting my name

420
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,640
on every scene

421
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,600
or different place

422
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,760
I have the band

423
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,640
with a plan

424
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,520
and I wanna grow up

425
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,620
to be a renaissance man

426
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,420
And I shall discover

427
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,500
I shall discover the meaning of life

428
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,060
I shall discover how to fly above

429
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,420
I shall discover America once in my life

430
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,520
I shall discover love, oh joy

431
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,520
I am a Renaissance man

432
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,520
Oh, light, light, wash over me

433
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,660
Over the land, over the sea

434
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,740
Star of Bethlehem, I

435
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,560
Be shooting in the dark tonight

436
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,620
This is the age of reasoning

437
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,080
Got an explanation for everything

438
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,720
I've seen the Shroud of Turin rip

439
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,620
Moving mountains made the size of a silicone chip

440
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,680
I am a man with a plan

441
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,620
And I want to grow up to be a Renaissance man

442
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,460
I shall discover the meaning of life

443
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,980
I shall discover how to fly above

444
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,360
I shall discover America once in my life

445
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,440
And I shall discover love, oh joy

446
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,340
I am a Renaissance man, oh joy

447
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,360
I am a Renaissance man, oh boy

448
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,500
I am a Renaissance man, oh joy

449
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,400
Renaissance man

450
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,300
That's what I am

451
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,640
The transmission. Stand by for transmission.

452
00:24:53,940 --> 00:25:01,720
Oh my god! It's time for the show!

453
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:11,120
The only show that not only massages your prostate, but actually is part of its natural growing diet.

454
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:19,160
I'm Dr. Argus Q. Fox, and with me today, as always, is your host, Fid Julie!

455
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Hi guys!

456
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,160
And somewhere else I think there's peas.

457
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,980
Yes, it's true, it's peas. Radio the way it was never meant to be. Time for the show!

458
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,400
Yeah, that's what they say.

459
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:46,740
This time for the show, on free things, radio the contents of the show in a manner that is inconsistent with its labeling is illegal.

460
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,800
Also, this show is produced in a facility that processes gluten, so there may be trace amounts.

461
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,680
I'm allergic to peanuts.

462
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,940
You're allergic to what? Say that again?

463
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,740
Peanuts.

464
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,240
Oh, okay, well...

465
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,040
Keep your mouth closed around me, buddy.

466
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:14,100
I want to mention that BreatheRink Radio is totally user-friendly with its onboard chat-friendly room,

467
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,600
and the only people that don't seem to be able to use it is some musician in Connecticut.

468
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,120
I guess that guy was just dumb.

469
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,200
But fuck that guy!

470
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,240
Yeah, that's what you get, idiot!

471
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,580
Ha ha ha ha ha!

472
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:32,500
We're enabling the audience. We're bringing a new multimedia sphere of information.

473
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:32,500


474
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,540
And we're bringing a new audience influence to you!

475
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,880
Our friends.

476
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,520
That's right, because here on Time for the Show, we don't just have our finger on the pulse of society,

477
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,640
we have our hand wrapped around its...

478
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,900
It's, it's what? Its genitals? Its throat? Its... feminine wrist?

479
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,780
Its dirty, poor throat.

480
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,000
All right.

481
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,320
Yeah.

482
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,560
If you'd like to send an email to Time for the Show, send it to timefortheemail at gmail.com.

483
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,320
I'll be looking at it, maybe.

484
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,180
All one of our listeners can send your complaints now.

485
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,760
But hey, I mean, that's triple the regular FreeThink Radio slot, I guess.

486
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,420
So, we're doing all right!

487
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,300
The numbers don't lie.

488
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:23,260
When it comes to hijacking a radio feed from some guy you never met before,

489
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,980
well then, by golly, we're the best at it!

490
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,700
I mean, it's not exactly pirate radio, because I guess we actually...

491
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,100
I don't know.

492
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,160
We actually have, like, some sort of permission to be here.

493
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,220
Do we have any values in which we must uphold?

494
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,980
Well, we got permission to do the show without permission.

495
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,260
Exactly.

496
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,600
As long as he can... has plausible deniability, then the show never happened to begin with.

497
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,820
Well, that's a poignant and wonderful speech, if we could only have heard it.

498
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,460
I don't think I can make a radio show unless I drink some coffee.

499
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:07,900
Can you?

500
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:08,720
Yes.

501
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,800
You can?

502
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,280
I can't drink coffee. It makes me nervous.

503
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,580
It gives me the jitters, man.

504
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,400
Um, not drinking coffee gives me the jitters.

505
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,140
Like this music gives me the jitters.

506
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,280
This is something called Juno Reactor.

507
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:37,140
I don't know if that's really a person's name or a program that is used to make Juno music.

508
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,600
But that's what our background music is.

509
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:52,460
And what we just heard a minute ago was the first little installment of the podcast called Time for the Show.

510
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,560
That is sort of like the Scrumcast of the Podcrusters.

511
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,320
It was Argus Fox, Fid Chooley, and Reverend P.

512
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:02,900
Wow.

513
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,280
Before that we heard the Rainmakers doing Renaissance Man.

514
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,900
That's a song that's only on one album, I think.

515
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,320
But it's a favorite song.

516
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,500
Of course, Papa Joe Mama was ranting there.

517
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,860
We heard some old collages from Leemur.

518
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:27,080
And some yakking by Mark Mothersbaugh, Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh, back in 1984.

519
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:35,240
The Rudy Schwartz Project music that we heard was, in fact, the Rudy Schwartz Project.

520
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,460
With enhanced Florence Henderson.

521
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,380
There was a little bit of Papa Joe Mama, Slack is Not for Sale.

522
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,820
And at the very beginning we heard another Rainmakers song.

523
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,260
Well, they were doing Amazing Grace and then a live version of Let My People Go Go.

524
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,860
Their big hit.

525
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,000
The one hit they ever had.

526
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,020
If you can even call it that.

527
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,820
I don't know if it was a hit exactly, but I actually heard it on the radio once.

528
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,640
Wrote the title and the band down.

529
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,000
Never heard the Rainmakers on Dallas radio again.

530
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,580
But that is, yeah, that was their first album.

531
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,520
And now we're going to call Dave, rather than Dave calling us.

532
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,180
Yes.

533
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,480
Let's call the Dave.

534
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,120
I have to put in my special...

535
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,840
Your special code?

536
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,340
Yeah, my special code.

537
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,520
Because you've got to know the code.

538
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,080
And I have to know his name and his number.

539
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,700
There.

540
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,040
We should...

541
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,540
Yeah, listen to that.

542
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,700
Sounds like a phone ringing.

543
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,140
Yeah.

544
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,920
This is the Daveston.

545
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,180
Hello?

546
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,280
Recording everything going fine.

547
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,320
No trouble.

548
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,760
Right now?

549
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,640
Yeah, right now.

550
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,160
I have to remember to turn the recorder off after about 25 minutes.

551
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,180
Because we have that much talk time.

552
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:06,920
Before...

553
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,900
Well, I thought I looked in the mirror and I looked like the guy in Nosferatu.

554
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,700
You know what I mean?

555
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,420
You look like that?

556
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,040
Or...

557
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,160
No, Dave.

558
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,600
Actually, Princess, he does...

559
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,280
If you know which character he's talking about, he does look a little like...

560
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,660
He does not look like that.

561
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,600
Nosferatu.

562
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,440
No.

563
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,660
Max Shrek as Nosferatu.

564
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,180
No.

565
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,440
Dracula.

566
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,720
No.

567
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,940
In a silent movie.

568
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,500
Like, he was like, what's his name?

569
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,320
And Candy had a gleaming white hump on his forehead.

570
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,000
And then the huge blood vessels that course through his veins like a mighty river.

571
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:48,400
You know, I have a giant vein in my forehead that pulses.

572
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,600
I know.

573
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,040
When I get real mad, it gets...

574
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,640
I know.

575
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


576
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


577
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


578
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


579
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


580
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


581
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


582
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


583
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


584
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


585
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


586
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


587
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


588
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


589
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640


590
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,220
And I'm swollen and I probably shouldn't say this on the radio, but when I...

591
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:03,340
What my friends do when I get out of hand is they just put their thumb on that vein and

592
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,040
it makes me pass out, that forehead vein.

593
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:07,740
Yeah.

594
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,520
It's kind of like the Dead Man's Switch on the old train.

595
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,200
Right.

596
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,600
Princess, we...

597
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,140
Short circuits me either by doing that or lifting her shirt.

598
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,320
And that usually shuts me up.

599
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,020
If I'm throwing up.

600
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,920
throwing a fit.

601
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,220
That's an advantage women do have.

602
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,860
All they have to do is lift their shirts

603
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,140
and it shuts you out pretty good.

604
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,060
They can distract.

605
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,280
Well, the idea is to just change your,

606
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,860
shock you out of your bad train of thought.

607
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,840
It's kind of like with the dogs.

608
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,740
You know, when you're trying to train a dog,

609
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,840
you just distract,

610
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,400
but get obsessed over something

611
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,340
and you just go the other way.

612
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,420
That surprises them

613
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,540
and then they calm down

614
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:48,900
and they're like,

615
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,240
that wasn't working today.

616
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,800
There was some,

617
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,760
I guess there was raccoon on our walk trail.

618
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,380
There was raccoon poop

619
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,860
on all of the rocks.

620
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,360
Yes.

621
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,760
And all over your shoes you might have.

622
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,380
And I think that our new little guard dog

623
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,240
was really wanting to guard us

624
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,560
from those raccoons.

625
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,460
Of course, he's a treeing walker coon hound

626
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,540
and he has no choice.

627
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,220
But he can.

628
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,820
He gets to this point where he wants to be,

629
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,760
he wants to run in every direction all at once.

630
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,060
So he's darting right, left, up, down, all around.

631
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,680
It's insane.

632
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,260
He wants to run everywhere.

633
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,740
We're out in the woods.

634
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,200
We're out in the woods

635
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,380
and he is surrounded by varmints.

636
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,900
There really are varmints everywhere

637
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,940
and he wants to chase all of them at once.

638
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,240
All at once.

639
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,020
But it can't be done.

640
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,080
In fact, he can't chase any of them

641
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,100
because he's on a leash.

642
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,580
Oh, poor guy.

643
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:52,860


644
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,820
For now.

645
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,460
Poor guy.

646
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,760
He's strangulating himself

647
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,340
every little walk he takes.

648
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,860
He's stuck in his joy forever

649
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,620
except for he's strangulating himself.

650
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,340
Yeah.

651
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,560
I'm familiar with that one too.

652
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,200
That's what Jake used to also do.

653
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,540
He's just like half like hang himself,

654
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,600
strangulate himself,

655
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,380
trying to go in so many different directions.

656
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
And every, you know,

657
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,460
how many times you got to see a bird

658
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,760
before you don't react like,

659
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,320
it's a bird, it's a bird.

660
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,100
Yeah, but Jake was your twin brother.

661
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,840
Not a dog.

662
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,860
That's the difference.

663
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,100
He looks like Nosferatu too.

664
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,600
No, no, no.

665
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,440
Especially a few years after he died.

666
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,340
No, no, no.

667
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,180
Hey, I'll have you know,

668
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,720
my grandmother was a fishmonger.

669
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,440
That was an easy way of making money around here

670
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,140
in the old days.

671
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,240
You know, you get a cart,

672
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,000
you walk around going for fresh fish

673
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,940
and stuff like that.

674
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,800
Now they don't have any fish you can eat anymore.

675
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,920
From like Erie,

676
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,220
you mean?

677
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:50,220


678
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,080
They had these like Lake Erie mussels

679
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,940
that were similar to clams

680
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,300
and they had oyster shops around

681
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,740
as well as the many, many fish houses.

682
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,880
Well, they still do

683
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,360
and they have all those invasive zebra mussels.

684
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,220
Yes, but you can't eat zebra mussels

685
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,880
because they're zebras.

686
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,180
Well, you can't eat anything out of Lake Erie

687
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,100
because they're all,

688
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,620
they've all been eating toxic compounds.

689
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,240
Yeah, it comes from most people's shampoo

690
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,140
and their plumes.

691
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,580
The lake of Erie.

692
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,620
That's why those fish and chips taste like soap.

693
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,220
That explains it all.

694
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,600
Yeah, well,

695
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,400
the environment should get much worse very soon.

696
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:42,860
Judging by the kind of new laws that are being passed,

697
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,180
I think they're pretty much trying to kill

698
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,540
all the poor people

699
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,940
and make everyone,

700
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,200
who wasn't already super poor,

701
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,640
super poor.

702
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,680
And everybody who was already super rich,

703
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,660
super richer,

704
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,920
all five of them,

705
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,680
or ten of them.

706
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,720
And destroy all the protected places.

707
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,140
Yeah, all the protected places

708
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,240
all have to go now.

709
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,720
Ruin public schooling forever.

710
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,240
Right.

711
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,860
So, you know,

712
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,440
the average kid doesn't get to go

713
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,840
grades K through 12.

714
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,300
Right.

715
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,160
Teach children

716
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,000
the only place that they can learn real news

717
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,320
is the Russian internet

718
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,220
and everything else is fake.

719
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,240


720
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,580
Oh, I hear you laughing,

721
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,300
but it's sad,

722
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:27,880
but it's true.

723
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,200
It's not contrary to the average.

724
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,740
What do they call that?

725
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,240
Like an abolitionist,

726
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,800
only you got to be like a sharp teeth.

727
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,960
And you like,

728
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,560
you're like really,

729
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,200
yeah.

730
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,240
Vampires?

731
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,840
Yeah.

732
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,600
Vampires.

733
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,480
I don't know.

734
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,480
People are regravitating back towards grandpires.

735
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,660
Grandpires.

736
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,340
They're,

737
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:49,740
well,

738
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,340
that's because they've,

739
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,100
they're running the government now.

740
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,540
Grandpires?

741
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,000
Yeah,

742
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,620
grandpires,

743
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,840
really old vampires,

744
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,940
real fat old vampire,

745
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,540
bloated,

746
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,320
tick-like,

747
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,980
small fingered vampires.

748
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,760
Most vampires have real long fingers,

749
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,500
but the new,

750
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,420
the new vampires have tiny little stumpy hands

751
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,440
like a Tyrannosaurus.

752
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,100
We shouldn't make fun of people with disabilities.

753
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,040
Like a childish monkey.

754
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,280
Little small type sim,

755
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,960
simian organism.

756
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,080
Little,

757
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:21,500
uh,

758
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,960
fellowship monkey in the name of the 12.

759
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:25,620
Well,

760
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,020
what's cuter than a little fellowship monkey?

761
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,720
Except when you get a whole tribe of them together,

762
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,660
pretty next thing you know,

763
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,440
they're inventing nuclear weapons and lobbing them at each other.

764
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,460
That's how they get involved in macrocephalic nuclear war phase.

765
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,020
Sometimes the brains get so big they explode.

766
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,900
But I guess the Toledo,

767
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,660
or not Toledo,

768
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,180
but the,

769
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,380
uh,

770
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,580
Tokyo Power Company,

771
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,380
where Fukushima was,

772
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,860
it was so crooked.

773
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,760
The whole,

774
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,700
the whole place is so crooked that made everything that happened,

775
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,900
happen real easy and stuff.

776
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,480
Are you talking about Fukushima in Japan?

777
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,380
Fukushima.

778
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,620
Yeah.

779
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,020
Oh,

780
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:09,760
that would never happen here at the Comanche nuclear power plant just down the hill from us.

781
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,900
Up the road,

782
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,580
up the road.

783
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,240
Steak from?

784
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:13,880
Huh?

785
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,420
Sure.

786
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,020
What is that?

787
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,320
Where you got that glowing steak and baked potato from?

788
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,560
No,

789
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,760
you can't cook with it,

790
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,780
but it is where the six legged frogs and the giant grasshoppers come from.

791
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,640
Oh.

792
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,280
Yeah.

793
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:26,720
Yeah.

794
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,120
The mutated jackalopes that have,

795
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:41,020
we heard tell that rattlesnakes are evolving the ability to not rattle because rattling just gets them killed by humanoids.

796
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:47,640
So there've been more and more cases of rattlesnakes that don't rattle.

797
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,120
So they can sneak around,

798
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:50,400
Barry.

799
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,040
They don't rattle around people anyway.

800
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:59,380
The ones that just grew up with without the urge to rattle when monkey people come around.

801
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,040
Those are the ones that survive.

802
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,580
Yeah.

803
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,620
And they avoid the toiletry drowning too,

804
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,680
because that can be very painful in your life.

805
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,180
The toiletry ground.

806
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,260
Yeah.

807
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,600
Like sometimes people want to commit suicide back in the home and different other institutions I've been associated with.

808
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:16,920
Yeah.

809
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,660
Yeah.

810
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:17,680


811
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:17,800


812
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,220
Yeah.

813
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,320


814
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,320


815
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,340
Yeah.

816
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:18,340


817
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:18,520
Yeah.

818
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:18,540
Yeah.

819
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,540


820
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,540


821
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,540


822
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,540


823
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,540


824
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,540


825
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,540


826
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,540


827
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,180
I was tired of going to get going to the toilet and drown myself.

828
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,320
Oh,

829
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:23,920
well,

830
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,740
you're in toilet and snakes have been known to do that too.

831
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,220
You say,

832
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,040
well,

833
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,280
sure.

834
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,160
Sometimes when they get out of the hyena point zoo or any of those other famous places,

835
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,620
you have to be aware.

836
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,360
Famous.

837
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:36,880
Hi.

838
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,220
Yeah.

839
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,280
Hi.

840
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,000
Hi.

841
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,460
Parker.

842
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,020
So,

843
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,360
well,

844
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:41,700
you know,

845
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,380
one of the hyenas.

846
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:42,820
Point.

847
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,800
Kings point.

848
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:45,840
One.

849
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,680
Hyena is pork.

850
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,640
I'm sorry.

851
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,480
Hyena is pork.

852
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:48,800
Zoo.

853
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,140
That's my Massachusetts.

854
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,760
Right.

855
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,700
Well,

856
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,100
there's there's it's a chain.

857
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,460
Yeah.

858
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:55,960
Hyena.

859
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,420
It's always.

860
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,300
It's even out here too.

861
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,860
There's three of them like within eyesight right now.

862
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,380
Hey,

863
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:03,680
no sports.

864
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,300
We have,

865
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:05,700
but we have,

866
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,860
there's a chain of,

867
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,280
uh,

868
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:07,800
uh,

869
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,480
abusement parks here called Jackalope world.

870
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,400
Oh yeah.

871
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:12,660
The,

872
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,680
they have a giant life-size Jackalopes of every kind.

873
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,740
It's cute ones,

874
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,420
mean ones,

875
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,740
good guy,

876
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,460
bad guy,

877
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,100
Jackalope.

878
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,840
So it gets off kind of cartoonish,

879
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,960
but it educates children about Jackalopes.

880
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,400
Yes.

881
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,120
Are they animates like in,

882
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,120
like in neighbor world or very,

883
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:31,900
very,

884
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,720
very crudely.

885
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,780
They have a little motor that makes their jaw open and close,

886
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,920
or maybe their tail stiffly swings back and forth.

887
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,320
Well,

888
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,200
it's a good thing that they don't,

889
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
they're part of the track Pacific current,

890
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,500
because.

891
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,840
I guess Fukushima already pooped in Alaska 12 times.

892
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,380
Fukushima pooped in Alaska.

893
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:54,740
You say,

894
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,700
are they picking up the advance?

895
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,840
And what's the,

896
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,140
what,

897
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,340
what are these tails are?

898
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,560
Tell me if from your scientific facilities and radio,

899
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,060
autonomic curiosity,

900
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:11,620
if you've ever heard of these like huge islands of junk floating around the Pacific that are even connected from together.

901
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,400
Well,

902
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,860
they're not really islands.

903
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,540
They are,

904
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,020
uh,

905
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:15,900
you,

906
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,560
it's not like you can walk on the floating plastic in the ocean.

907
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,120
It's part,

908
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,600
it's more like an awful,

909
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,660
it's thick with plastic particles.

910
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,480
There are massive masses.

911
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,000
There are,

912
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,480
it's,

913
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:28,720
it's yeah,

914
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:28,900
there,

915
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,680
but it's not like an island made out of junk.

916
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,620
You couldn't,

917
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,060
you couldn't do anything with it.

918
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:39,500
All it's good for is choking fish and other organisms.

919
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:40,960
Yeah.

920
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,180
Organisms.

921
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,280
Wow.

922
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,840
You like organisms.

923
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,240
I think about organisms.

924
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,500
I think I stole that from Ren and Stimpy,

925
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,720
Ren specifically.

926
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,220
Oh,

927
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,140
I forgot about that or else I wouldn't have contributed anyway,

928
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,620
because I was thinking about Wilhelm Reich and the Oregon,

929
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,700
Oregon Baboon Patrol and all the other,

930
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,800
all the other sidekick simian baboons and monkeys that we were talking about before.

931
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,340
Well,

932
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:15,680
and,

933
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:15,820
and,

934
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:15,820


935
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:19,860
and Bob did Wilhelm Reich one better.

936
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,920
He had the orgasm onic chamber,

937
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,320
which was actually kind of just a large suitcase.

938
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,600
And one,

939
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,640
one person at a time would get inside of it and basically masturbate.

940
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,800
That was Bob's orgasm on it,

941
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,480
but it worked.

942
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,780
It did work.

943
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,800
It smelled horrible though.

944
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:37,720
Yeah.

945
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,540
And also it got the lawsuits from the duct tape and everything.

946
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:40,960
Yeah.

947
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,140
Yeah.

948
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,100
It was real beat up.

949
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,140
It was very large.

950
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:43,700
I mean,

951
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,000
it was big enough to hold a person,

952
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,580
but it was,

953
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,920
it was gross.

954
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,040
It was just really gross.

955
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,740
The orgasm on it chamber,

956
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,720
he called it and he would,

957
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,200
there were people,

958
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:54,700
I,

959
00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:01,800
I think Trump's dad paid over a million bucks an hour to sit in there and that sweltering,

960
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,960
stinky giant suitcase.

961
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:04,800
And well,

962
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,340
you know,

963
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,240
well,

964
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,100
that's what they say.

965
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,560
You know,

966
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,240
you can never believe all that stuff,

967
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,520
but I guess as far as a multi-billionaires go,

968
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,120
there's a very,

969
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,120


970
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,120


971
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,120


972
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,120


973
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,120


974
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,120


975
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,120


976
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,120


977
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,120


978
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,120


979
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,920
very strong possibility that the old man was in there.

980
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:25,160
Billionaires can't have sex unless they inject a solution made from rhinoceros horn with mixed

981
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,780
with tiger penis and elephant tusks and Republican brains.

982
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,440
What that's the rarest ingredient.

983
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,440
That's really,

984
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,180
really.

985
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,580
Yeah.

986
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:36,740
It's,

987
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,240
it's very,

988
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,220
well,

989
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:38,720
it's a fair,

990
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,360
it's a fine,

991
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:40,940
if you,

992
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,220
if you take a million Republicans and grind up all their brains,

993
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:45,520
you'll,

994
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,880
you could maybe get a line.

995
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,220
And that's what kind of like,

996
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,800
that's what Trump does every morning.

997
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:57,840
Just resume when he wakes up after two hours of semi twitching sleep and starts tweeting.

998
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:04,000
He does a line made from a million Republican brains who all,

999
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,060
who all donated.

1000
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,340
They,

1001
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,560
they gave it to him.

1002
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,980
He didn't even have to buy it.

1003
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:08,700
He,

1004
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:08,840
he didn't even have to pay for it.

1005
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,040
In fact,

1006
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,280
they paid him to take their brains and snort it up.

1007
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,020
I'm sorry,

1008
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:22,980
but that's just the whole relationship between you and the squid bar and the people hanging

1009
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,980
from the ceiling in the Trump Gazette.

1010
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:25,960
Well,

1011
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,500
the thing is,

1012
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:27,820
I mean,

1013
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,420
I have a lot of Republican friends,

1014
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,500
so I don't,

1015
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,820
I don't say this lightly.

1016
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,240
I mean,

1017
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:32,540
my,

1018
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,560
I have relatives,

1019
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,840
beloved relatives who probably voted for Trump.

1020
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,440
Yeah.

1021
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:38,860
And,

1022
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:39,920
and,

1023
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,700
and because I love them,

1024
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,400
I feel like going,

1025
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:44,720
well,

1026
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,580
that was stupid.

1027
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,900
Like it was so stupid.

1028
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,460
I can't even begin to imagine how stupid that is.

1029
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:56,240
But except for the fact that thanks to my training in subgenius land,

1030
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,220
I'm afraid I can imagine a lot of stupid.

1031
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,440
Right.

1032
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,300
I mean,

1033
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,180
even when it's even a subgenius has to call somebody else stupid.

1034
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,500
That's bad.

1035
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,680
Of course,

1036
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,500
there's lots of Republicans.

1037
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:11,820
Well,

1038
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,200
there's a handful of Republican subgenius is calling me stupid.

1039
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,520
Cause I was going,

1040
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,640
I'm not voting for Hillary just cause she's a woman.

1041
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,320
That's the only reason any of them voted for.

1042
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,760
So only cause she's woman.

1043
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,200
I heard that over and over and over again.

1044
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,300
I was like,

1045
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:27,500
no,

1046
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,960
that's not what we were saying.

1047
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,920
We were saying we're going to hold our nose and vote for her.

1048
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:32,780
Uh,

1049
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,300
uh,

1050
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,400
because she's not Trump.

1051
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,140
Right.

1052
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,160


1053
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,160


1054
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,160


1055
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,160


1056
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,160


1057
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,160


1058
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,160


1059
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,160


1060
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,160


1061
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,160


1062
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,160


1063
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,620
That was basically what it came down to.

1064
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,620
I mean,

1065
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:48,360
of course she's an odious trampire or grandpire or whatever we were talking about there.

1066
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,500
I can't tell the difference between them.

1067
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,100
And then there's the wee wolves.

1068
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,160
Yeah.

1069
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,440
Really watch out for the princess.

1070
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,240
Wee wolves.

1071
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,480
Oh,

1072
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,360
that made me how they make,

1073
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,660
they make everybody else how.

1074
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:04,700
Yeah,

1075
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,480
I guess that's the way they tell the story.

1076
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:06,980
Yeah.

1077
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:07,160


1078
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:07,720
it's getting really,

1079
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,080
really,

1080
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,600
really difficult to make out which parts are against each other and which parts are

1081
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,500
part of the same part.

1082
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,800
And why anybody's playing the head game to make all this head game out of everything

1083
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,220
anyway,

1084
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,360
because it's like,

1085
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:27,980
they like to write a very interesting story about the evolution of mankind on the surface

1086
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,600
of the planet.

1087
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,840
I hate guys like that.

1088
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:33,720
I think they know it all,

1089
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,080
everything.

1090
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,140
And they just look back on everything and it's sociological.

1091
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:37,140


1092
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:37,140


1093
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:37,140


1094
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:37,140


1095
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:37,840
I think it's a sociological experiment.

1096
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,340
Like,

1097
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,080
you know,

1098
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,680
the fact that all these people are going to die and all these people are going to not

1099
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,940
have enough money to live.

1100
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,120
And I was just looking at the richest people in the world and I thought these idiots could

1101
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,280
totally restore Puerto Rico with,

1102
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,220
and they wouldn't even,

1103
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,760
there wouldn't be any money gone.

1104
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:54,720
Right.

1105
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,000
They could solve most of the catastrophes in the world and help all kinds of people

1106
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,720
and they wouldn't even miss it.

1107
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,080
Why,

1108
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,640
why,

1109
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,120
why,

1110
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:02,260
why,

1111
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:02,440
why?

1112
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,140
Well,

1113
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:03,600
Dave,

1114
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:10,100
the reason that the fact that you're asking this question that explains why you're not

1115
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,540
rich,

1116
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:10,820
dude,

1117
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,580
you've obviously got your values completely backwards,

1118
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,500
right?

1119
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,840
They have no feelings of guilt or remorse when they do something bad or everything is

1120
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,400
for self defoed.

1121
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,020
Right?

1122
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,420
They don't think of it as bad because it's good for them and they feel like everybody

1123
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,940
else is just being stupid.

1124
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:31,720
If they,

1125
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,140
Or trying to do something good for someone else.

1126
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,120
It's like, why not both?

1127
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,640
You know, why not both?

1128
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:42,960
I don't know.

1129
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,900
That's where I'm standing from.

1130
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:53,740
You know, when you're faced with what everybody else thinks is a choice between stark good and stark evil,

1131
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,240
I tend to go, why not both?

1132
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,080
Because you're going to end up with both anyway.

1133
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:03,840
Anyway, the most evil has been done in the name of good.

1134
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,840
Although I don't know that the reverse is true.

1135
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,640
Do you think much great good has been done by people who are trying to be evil?

1136
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:19,340
They were just bad at being evil and they accidentally did great good?

1137
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,940
I think I've witnessed that a few times.

1138
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,680
People that were on the verge of becoming one of the greats of the underworld and stuff like that

1139
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,420
and it turned out to be.

1140
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,880
It's really kind of stupid.

1141
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,140
I knew this guy that he wanted to just be a mass serial killer,

1142
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,820
but he never quite got around to it.

1143
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,880
Instead, he invented cures for cancer.

1144
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,660
And he hated himself.

1145
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,540
He felt so let down.

1146
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:48,500
He just felt that he wasted his whole life, his calling as a serial killer,

1147
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:58,060
and instead had gotten, you know, obsessed over this silly hobby of curing various types of diseases.

1148
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,520
He was so ashamed of himself that he wanted to be evil.

1149
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,960
But he failed.

1150
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,580
He didn't just fail a little.

1151
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,760
He failed terribly.

1152
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,800
He kept people alive.

1153
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,480
That's so sad, too.

1154
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,200
For him.

1155
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,720
It was fine for the people.

1156
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,820
The guy could have been evil or he could have been good,

1157
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,080
but instead he was just a failure.

1158
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,020
Or he failed to connect or communicate whatever the misunderstanding was.

1159
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,240
And, boy, that's just, that's really sad.

1160
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,280
What was his name again?

1161
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,240
Penbroke Jaffelston.

1162
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,620
Dr. Penbroke Jaffelston.

1163
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,260
Yes, he wanted to be Jack the Ripper, another Jack the Ripper,

1164
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,640
but he ended up being a Dr. Jekyll, a kindly, kindly guy.

1165
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:53,380
He was Mr. Hyde screaming to get out inside that Dr. Jekyll.

1166
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,200
I kind of know how it is.

1167
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,060
I'm a really, really innocent.

1168
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:08,820
I'm an insecure fat nerd inside a, a young fat nerd inside a seemingly confident, skinny, old hippie.

1169
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,900
Screaming to get out.

1170
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,180
Or whining to get out more accurately.

1171
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,980
You know, that doesn't have, I don't have the confidence to scream.

1172
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,200
So I'm just kind of whimpering to get out.

1173
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,780
I want to get out and be, I quit.

1174
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,820
I want to be an insecure fat nerd again.

1175
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:27,940
Instead.

1176
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,360
Instead of the skinny hippie.

1177
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:29,940
Yeah.

1178
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,320
I want to worry about whether people like me all day long.

1179
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:43,120
That's why I think the book Neighbor World is so essential for anybody climbing the ladder to success.

1180
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,060
That's true.

1181
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,800
It gets you ready for real life.

1182
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,380
It will.

1183
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,340
I mean, it gets you ready for something.

1184
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,720
I don't know if you'd call it real life.

1185
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,000
Right.

1186
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,060
There is not going to be any more real life.

1187
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,040
Right, but that's, yeah, exactly.

1188
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,860
That's the point of it.

1189
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,060
It's like, it gets you ready.

1190
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,580
It gets you ready for no real life.

1191
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,660
The illusion.

1192
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:06,160
The pure fake news, where even your breakfast is fake news.

1193
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,480
Fake food.

1194
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:08,840
I love that.

1195
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,380
Fake everything.

1196
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,520
That's deep, man.

1197
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,160
It's deep.

1198
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,480
That's an even better quote.

1199
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,020
Put that one in there, too.

1200
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:22,020
What you just said about eating fake breakfast, you know, items, chromosomes, stuff like that.

1201
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,040
I think that was brilliant.

1202
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,620
Because what the hell do I know?

1203
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,940
You know, I had my brain smashed.

1204
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,380
I had my brain smashed seven times with a shovel.

1205
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,060
I couldn't stand up again until they took me out of the county court.

1206
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:32,860
Well, of course.

1207
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,620
Where do you think Obama got his Democrat brains?

1208
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,300
Well, he was a...

1209
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,180
To snort.

1210
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,000
He was a homosexual from another planet.

1211
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:48,920
And he ran a, what's it called, a parlor down where the mechanics were.

1212
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,880
A pizza parlor, was it?

1213
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,040
Full of child abuse?

1214
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,360
The child sex pizza parlor scam?

1215
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,040
I think...

1216
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,480
I think probably George Soros.

1217
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,960
I heard Amazon bought that.

1218
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,440
Amazon bought that chain.

1219
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:06,720
And Google, and so did George Soros.

1220
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:13,600
And, yeah, all those guys were involved anyway, at least on a spurious level.

1221
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,260
You know what I mean?

1222
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,500
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

1223
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:27,320
Speaking of spurious, I just discovered there's like this little odd button on my ancient RadioShack audio mix.

1224
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,480
And I reached down and thought, where did that button come from?

1225
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,380
And it's not a button.

1226
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,800
It's a very strong, tiny magnet.

1227
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,780
It is a magnet.

1228
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,780
About the size of a screw head.

1229
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,800
It is a magnet.

1230
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,260
Yeah.

1231
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,620
Yeah, screw heads.

1232
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,560
Back of cigarette papers.

1233
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,160
Is that what it is?

1234
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:45,520
Yes.

1235
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,560
It holds a cigarette paper thing shut?

1236
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:47,940
Yes.

1237
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:52,420
Well, what's it doing on my electronic equipment, sapping the brains out of everything?

1238
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,520
Oh, now I get it.

1239
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,440
That is something that I do not know.

1240
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,820
That's how you get high in neighborhood.

1241
00:52:59,140 --> 00:52:59,640
Oh.

1242
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,520
Yeah.

1243
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,920
At least that's what they've been telling me for the last couple weeks.

1244
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,660
You see, it's very, very hard.

1245
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,200
Why would there be a rolling paper closing magnet?

1246
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,380
Because your wife is a hoarder.

1247
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,340
Oh.

1248
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,760
And things end up in places where they're not supposed to.

1249
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,500
Oh, a hoarder.

1250
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:26,780
God, I guess I didn't hear the whole word the first time.

1251
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,720
Yeah, very funny.

1252
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,020
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1253
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,020


1254
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,020


1255
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,020


1256
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,020


1257
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,020


1258
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,300
That's very, very funny, dear.

1259
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,180
No wonder you...

1260
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,580
Ha ha, I forgot to laugh.

1261
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,360
No wonder you...

1262
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,900
Okay, that explains a lot.

1263
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,220
A whole lot.

1264
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,620
You explained that you were an hoarder, right?

1265
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,780
Yeah, a hoarder.

1266
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,080
What time is it?

1267
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,400
It's a hoarder-per-sav.

1268
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:43,800
You know what?

1269
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,780
The show is over.

1270
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,180
A hoarder-per-sav.

1271
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:46,480
Just about...

1272
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,900
What is that?

1273
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,060
I'm a hoarder-per-sav.

1274
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,640
A hoarder-per-sav?

1275
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:50,940
Uh-huh.

1276
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,800
I like that one.

1277
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,080
That's pretty good.

1278
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,420
I mean, people could take it the wrong way.

1279
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,000
A hoarder-derp-er-sav.

1280
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:01,960
Derp.

1281
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,700
Derp.

1282
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:09,040
This has been Hour of Slack number 1,651.

1283
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,220
Woo-hoo!

1284
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:19,740
Recorded at Stang Ranch, although in Texas, although Lonesome Cowboy Dave is in Ashtabula.

1285
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,080
We're connected by magic.

1286
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,020
And friends, you can...

1287
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,740
That...

1288
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,660
And we'll be back next week with...

1289
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,160
Genius.com.

1290
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,080
That's where you can go and look at things.

1291
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,260
Yeah, read things.

1292
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:40,840
And you can read how to get an even better thing to read called Neighbor World, which

1293
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:51,860
is a classic dark humor science fiction bull-dada novel by Lonesome Cowboy Dave that's 122 pages

1294
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,380
long.

1295
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,180
Yeah.

1296
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,640
I mean, you know...

1297
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:54,800
Yeah.

1298
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,800
And so, yeah.

1299
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,020
It's way longer.

1300
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,260
It's way less than a dollar a page.

1301
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,240
It's more like a dime a page.

1302
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,200
And each page is...

1303
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:03,300
A thousand.

1304
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:08,300
It was worth at least a dollar's worth of yucks and grins and horror.

1305
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,980
That's cheap, but price the price.

1306
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,020
And thoughtfulness, stuff you can chew on.

1307
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:12,920
Yeah.

1308
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,300
With your brain.

1309
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,500
Well, that's for male intelligence and stuff like that there.

1310
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,140
But I thought you said it was 325,000 books.

1311
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,160
I mean, pages long.

1312
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,040
No.

1313
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,640
No.

1314
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:25,780
No.

1315
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,200
122, I think.

1316
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,100
You can pick one up and look at it.

1317
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:36,160
Have you already been drawing animation in the borders of it?

1318
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,460
Hey, this song that's coming up now is the Rainmakers.

1319
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:43,240
Once again, I managed to work in three Rainmakers songs in a show.

1320
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:43,660
Wow.

1321
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:48,740
And this one I thought was really funny and poignant.

1322
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,520
Poignant?

1323
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:50,920
Yes.

1324
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,400
Little Tiny World.

1325
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:04,760
Oh, I was hanging around London and doing TV.

1326
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,380
I was singing my heart out on the BBC.

1327
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:17,060
A little girl stopped me on the street, I thought, to ask for my autograph and tell me I was hot.

1328
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,980
She said with a twang, I thought I recognized you.

1329
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,880
You used to pump my gas back in old KC Mizzou.

1330
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,860
It's a little tiny world.

1331
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,120
My head's as funny as a bee.

1332
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,020
Everybody's chucking it up.

1333
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:38,860
Come on now, this laughs on me.

1334
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,500
Well, I went to a party with my new girl.

1335
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,940
When we got there, we ran into four of her old boyfriends.

1336
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,940
One was with my ex-wife.

1337
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,900
One was with my gay brother.

1338
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,960
One was with my masseuse.

1339
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,960
One was with my date's mother.

1340
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:57,600
See?

1341
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,000
Everybody there had slept with everybody else.

1342
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,700
When I heard it all, I figured I slept with myself.

1343
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,700
It's a little tiny world.

1344
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,800
Just like a little tiny town.

1345
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,720
Everybody knows everybody's business.

1346
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,540
And everybody knows my town.

1347
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,580
Oh, yeah.

1348
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,100
Oh, yeah.

1349
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,460
Oh, yeah.

1350
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,260
Oh, yeah.

1351
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,060
Oh, yeah.

1352
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,040
Oh, yeah.

1353
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:26,540
Oh, yeah.

1354
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,220
Oh, yeah.

1355
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:27,220


1356
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,020
Oh, yeah.

1357
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:28,020


1358
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:28,020


1359
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:28,020


1360
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,060
Oh, yeah.

1361
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:30,820
Oh, yeah.

1362
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,180
Oh, yeah.

1363
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,040
Oh, yeah.

1364
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,040
Oh, yeah.

1365
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,140
Oh, yeah.

1366
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:36,320
Oh, yeah.

1367
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,260
Oh, yeah.

1368
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:37,640
Oh, yeah.

1369
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:37,640


1370
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:37,640


1371
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:37,640


1372
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:37,680


1373
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:37,680


1374
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:37,680


1375
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:37,680


1376
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:37,680


1377
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,320
She's got a little baby girl.

1378
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:44,340
A good job and a sob and a new age world.

1379
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,280
I really can't blame her for running off with him.

1380
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,180
I'd like to marry him too.

1381
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,100
That is, if I liked men.

1382
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,200
We were wedded for life.

1383
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,120
She's stuck in my craw.

1384
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,020
But I wish all the men would y'all to live.

1385
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:58,020


1386
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,160
To my new husband-in-law

1387
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,200
It's a little tiny world

1388
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,000
Man, it's as funny as it needs

1389
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,120
Better get to hooking it up

1390
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,880
Come on now, this laughs on me

1391
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,500
Oh, I was stranded in paradise

1392
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,320
On an island all alone

1393
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,520
I had everything I wanted

1394
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,460
But I just wanted to go home

1395
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,460
Put an ode in a bottle

1396
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,340
And I put in a drink

1397
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,360
It was all recycled paper

1398
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,360
Filed in a gradeable ink

1399
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,380
And I waited for weeks

1400
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,020
For the next one

1401
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:58,020


1402
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,640
So that answer I yearn

1403
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,400
Don't throw your crap in the ocean

1404
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,180
No deposit, no return

1405
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,160
It's a little tiny world

1406
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,280
Just like a little tiny town

1407
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,080
Everybody knows everybody's business

1408
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,080
And everybody knows what's down

1409
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,060
Yeah, it's a little tiny world

1410
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,920
Man, it's as funny as it needs

1411
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,020
Better get to hooking it up

1412
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:32,700
Come on now, this laughs on me

1413
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

1414
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

1415
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:41,320
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

1416
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

1417
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,460
Yeah, it's a little tiny world

1418
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,920
Well, and that was the Rainmakers

1419
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,860
And now we're back

1420
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:04,060
For the extra time

1421
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,300
We got an hour done, right?

1422
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:06,860
I think

1423
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,680
Jeez

1424
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,680
Yeah, I think we got

1425
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:08,920
We did?

1426
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:09,720
Yeah, we did

1427
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,020
But see, the internet people

1428
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,280
Get to hear another hour

1429
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,680
Or whatever

1430
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,780
I mean, another 20 minutes or so

1431
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,640
Where we really talk about

1432
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,820
How they can send 35 bucks

1433
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,660
To the church, the subgenius

1434
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,360
Get ordained

1435
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,620
And get a really cool new pack

1436
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:28,000
And starting off

1437
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,540
I think probably next week

1438
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,440
They'll have the right address

1439
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,580
On all the pieces

1440
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,460
All the 25 pieces of paper

1441
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,580
In a membership pack

1442
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,480
It will be an hour

1443
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,040
They'll have the new dress on

1444
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,480
Once it is fleshed out

1445
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,600
With all of the special things

1446
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,660
You know, Dave

1447
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,660
Well, that was

1448
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:47,540
I gave the credits

1449
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,920
So he knows what they were

1450
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,860
But there's

1451
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,280
But yeah, friends

1452
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,120
I had to change

1453
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,220
The address

1454
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,820
In about

1455
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,000
50%

1456
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:58,640
Of places

1457
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,980
On printed material

1458
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,740
Using Photoshop

1459
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,580
And we're reprinting

1460
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,700
All of the stuff

1461
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,840
That goes in a subgenius membership kit

1462
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,200
The pamphlet number one

1463
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:10,960
Pamphlet number two

1464
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,440
Your giant frameable excuse doctorate

1465
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,500
And doctorate

1466
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,580
There's the all inclusive divine excuse

1467
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,880
And the doctorate of the forbidden sciences

1468
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,520
The membership card

1469
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,640
The 8x10 of Bob

1470
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,580
The tree of knowledge poster

1471
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,180
The salvation or destruction poster

1472
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,580
The Connie Dobbs pamphlet

1473
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,480
And all the ads

1474
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,160
The ad sheets all have the address

1475
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,180
Had the address wrong

1476
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,800
As of November

1477
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,060
In about two dozen places each

1478
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,580
And I went in with a microscopic Photoshop

1479
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,300
And changed the old P.O. box

1480
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,060
To box 807

1481
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,640
Glen Rose, Texas

1482
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,240
76043

1483
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,920
And that's where you can find

1484
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,000
Neighbor World

1485
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,540
And the Book of the Subgenius

1486
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,600
And everything you need

1487
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,720
To get Slack

1488
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,000
And all you really need though

1489
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,300
Is the knowledge of Slack

1490
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,300
That it exists

1491
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,160
And that you were born with it

1492
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,160
And have lost track of it

1493
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,820
Now whatever your situation is

1494
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,580
You can still have Slack

1495
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,000
In fact if you're a subgenius

1496
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,580
You must already have it

1497
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:33,440
It's just not being sequenced

1498
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,540
Or used properly

1499
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,240
It hasn't

1500
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,660
The scab has not fully broken off

1501
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,000
Yeah you couldn't blame the user

1502
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,320
Because then that would get you

1503
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,480
Into a circumsuit

1504
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,960
As an example

1505
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,300
You know what I'm saying?

1506
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:52,880
No

1507
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,360
What's going on there

1508
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,960
In your neck of the woods lately Dave?

1509
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,420
I mean what's your update?

1510
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,200
Your news report?

1511
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,400
What's my chicken neck of the woods?

1512
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:02,760
Yeah

1513
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,660
Well let's see

1514
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,240
It's been

1515
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,240
The weather hasn't been terribly awfully bad

1516
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,540
It's been the 40s a lot

1517
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:13,300
I know I checked the weather

1518
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,060
And everybody became very excited

1519
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:19,200
It's 52 and stuff like that there

1520
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,880
And then it's supposed to be in the 50s

1521
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,780
For another couple days

1522
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,020
And it's supposed to be cold

1523
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,840
And most of these days

1524
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,980
It'll be dreary and grassy

1525
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,960
Which is really just really wonderful

1526
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:30,740
For your attitude

1527
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,980
Like the citizens of northern Ohio

1528
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,680
Bloomy and dark

1529
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,680
The weather and the citizens are the same

1530
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,520
Cold and gray

1531
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,600
Cold, gray, dreary, cloudy

1532
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,080
I'm telling you it makes my nipples small enough

1533
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,760
And really perky and everything

1534
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,120
And not in a good way either

1535
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,360
No it sounds cold

1536
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,920
I hate it

1537
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,980
I like sunburns

1538
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,500
And sunshine and fresh air

1539
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,440
Well

1540
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,320
Funny of it too

1541
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,360
Well I mean it's kind of a trade-off

1542
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,220
Down here in Texas right now

1543
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,980
As we approach Christmas

1544
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,400
It's 70

1545
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,620
In the 70s

1546
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,140
Breezy, sunny most days

1547
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,800
Which is really lucky

1548
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,640
Because all of my stuff

1549
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,120
Is in a non-climate controlled shed

1550
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,940
Waiting for the new shed

1551
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,080
To become insulated

1552
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,260
And thus a bit more climate controlled

1553
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,660
And it's not the winter I'm worried about

1554
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:27,980
It's the summer

1555
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,800
And that's the trade-off

1556
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,820
For you see Dave

1557
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:37,480
Although indeed the Cleveland winters are rough

1558
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,700
And you have to shovel snow out of your driveway

1559
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:44,100
The Texas summers around here are fatal

1560
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:50,640
They are of a non-earth like nature

1561
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:56,300
And the cold air can also be fatal

1562
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,920
If you don't have adequate flow

1563
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,540
And you're not using your home

1564
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,040
Right

1565
01:04:59,760 --> 01:04:59,860
And

1566
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,500
Or even you know

1567
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,100
You need to spend a lot of money on heating gas

1568
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:09,020
Well Dave now if your old furnace goes out

1569
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:12,160
You can drive two hours over to Cleveland

1570
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,540
And live in our house

1571
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,280
Until our old furnace goes out

1572
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,880
Because I think our furnace is from 1920

1573
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,800
The house is from 1910

1574
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,560
I think this one is 1912

1575
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,880
Could be 1923

1576
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,540
Yeah I mean right

1577
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,180
So

1578
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:36,840
You better talk to our renter about that dear

1579
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,400
He may not want a roommate right away

1580
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,620
Well yeah you can freeze to death

1581
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:48,660
And you can also die of heat exhaustion

1582
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:49,900
Why not both?

1583
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:51,540
That's what I just keep saying

1584
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,940
So for a while there

1585
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,360
Princess we and I were

1586
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:57,860
Kind of in a relationship

1587
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,140
We had to do it this way

1588
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,580
Even though it's made us terribly broke

1589
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:05,020
We were wintering in Texas

1590
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,000
And summering in Ohio

1591
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,460
By necessity actually

1592
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:13,440
And Princess we is going to continue to do that

1593
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,280
But I've realized that somebody's got to hold down the fort here

1594
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,520
Because there's

1595
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,160
The fort is being

1596
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,980
It's under attack constantly

1597
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,100
By aliens

1598
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,240
KKK members

1599
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,200
Cowboys

1600
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,500
Hostile natives

1601
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,420
And we're going to have to do that next week

1602
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:27,620
And we're going to have to do that next week

1603
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:28,880
Wolves

1604
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,060
Coyotes

1605
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:30,700
Bears

1606
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,540
Inflamed

1607
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:35,140
Snipe birds

1608
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:40,080
Hey I was

1609
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,300
Looking at the

1610
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,960
The Texas Wildlife Department

1611
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,260
Website

1612
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,420
To see when deer season ends

1613
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,360
And

1614
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,320
They showed snipe

1615
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,460
Hunting season

1616
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:56,320
On the official Texas website

1617
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,860
Snipes

1618
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:58,360
Snipe birds

1619
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,520
Snipe hunting season

1620
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,080
That's a joke isn't it

1621
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,580
I think so

1622
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,280
It's interesting that

1623
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:05,900
The state

1624
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:09,000
I know it's interesting that the state

1625
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,580
Well the

1626
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:11,620
What was good about it was they didn't

1627
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,420
You know it was right up there with mule deer

1628
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,440
White-tailed deer

1629
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:15,560
Pheasant

1630
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,080
Turkey

1631
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,300
Wild turkeys

1632
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,100
Snipe birds

1633
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:18,800
You know

1634
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,820
Just to help keep fooling the rubes

1635
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,560
And that is kind of a Texas tradition

1636
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,840
To just rattle off a bunch of grubs

1637
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:27,840


1638
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,340
And do all this shit

1639
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:28,340


1640
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:28,340


1641
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:28,340


1642
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:28,340


1643
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:28,340


1644
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:28,340


1645
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:28,340


1646
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,480
Absolutely made up lies

1647
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,980
In such a

1648
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:31,800
Nonchalant way

1649
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,100
That people believe it

1650
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,100
And then

1651
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:34,620
You tell them

1652
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:36,560
A truth that is very surprising

1653
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,000
They think you made up a lie

1654
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,600
That's worked for my Dad

1655
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,180
And me

1656
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:41,680
I made a career out of it

1657
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,720
Not much of one

1658
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,480
But it's

1659
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,260
What I have

1660
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:45,920
Yeah

1661
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,040
And you

1662
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,480
And you work in the news media

1663
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:48,780
See

1664
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:49,860
It's the same difference

1665
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:51,820
Yeah

1666
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:54,460
Yeah, you're spindling yourself once it gets to the artichoke,

1667
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:57,520
and you're the only bunny in those yarns.

1668
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,740
We're all just whore derpersavs, I guess.

1669
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:05,780
Whore derpersavs?

1670
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,420
Yeah, whore derpersavs.

1671
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:12,860
The next show, I think, is going to have my grandsons on it some.

1672
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:17,980
About two weeks ago, we recorded another grandson show,

1673
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:22,820
and they're terrible because the kids are absolutely wild,

1674
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:30,220
and they're child subgeniuses.

1675
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:32,280
It sounds just like a subgenius radio show,

1676
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:34,980
only they're really children.

1677
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,700
They're not just adults that are very childlike and all talking at once.

1678
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,760
They're off the hook.

1679
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,380
Yeah, they're off the hook.

1680
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,800
So it requires a bunch of editing.

1681
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,960
But I'd say...

1682
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:50,940
I'd say they're a little bit easier to understand than they were last year.

1683
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,180
I did listen back to some of it.

1684
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,440
It's hard because it's deafening.

1685
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,740
Yeah, there's a little less screaming this year,

1686
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:00,960
but not totally without screaming.

1687
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:01,500
Yeah.

1688
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,600
Yeah, Dave, we're training our own replacements.

1689
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,660
Age 7 and age 9.

1690
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:14,260
When we're age 90 and dead,

1691
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,960
then age 20 and 24...

1692
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:18,080
I'm going to be 22.

1693
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,400
We'll be able to take over.

1694
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,440
Or whatever they are, we'll be it.

1695
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:22,680
I don't want to do the math.

1696
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,420
Take over what?

1697
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,280
I don't know.

1698
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,640
My empire of a college radio show.

1699
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:33,100
Well, I knew you had an imperial tazootie bag, but I didn't think you were that close

1700
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,640
to it.

1701
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,200
You know what I mean?

1702
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:37,960
Well, but you're the special guest star of the empire.

1703
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,380
Oh, yeah.

1704
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,740
You're the imperial jester.

1705
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:41,860
Yeah.

1706
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:46,520
I don't want to forget that because you owe me $24, remember?

1707
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:47,900
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1708
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:47,960
I'm going to have to get that.

1709
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:47,960


1710
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:47,960


1711
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:47,960


1712
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:47,960


1713
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:48,500
I still...

1714
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:52,920
Actually, I do have to calculate the Neighbor World stuff.

1715
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,760
Calculator, bling, bling, ding, ding, bling.

1716
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,500
Yeah, I bet you'd rather have me do that sooner than later.

1717
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:02,780
Why not both?

1718
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:08,860
I'll calculate it soon, but not send it to you until later.

1719
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:09,960
Much, much later.

1720
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:10,440
How's that?

1721
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:16,960
That's another very, very old put-off, the substantialized jocular version.

1722
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:17,540
It's not funny.

1723
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:22,880
And I could also, like most publishers, I could say, well, I'm sorry we only sold 24

1724
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,580
copies in the whole last two months.

1725
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,440
Unfortunately, that might well be true.

1726
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:37,140
It's kind of sad how many subgeniuses have not been mailed one of those by me.

1727
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:42,980
I know everyone who hasn't bought a copy of Neighbor World.

1728
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,760
Shame on you.

1729
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,500
I think they were liking it.

1730
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:46,940
It's mostly...

1731
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:47,340
Most of y'all.

1732
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,960
I'd say it's about 99.9%.

1733
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,180
I understand why they can't read.

1734
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:58,240
They haven't read a novel since they lied about doing so in high school.

1735
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,580
We have at least one friend that's proud of not reading.

1736
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,080
Well, he's a Republican.

1737
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,720
That goes with the territory.

1738
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,660
I'm proud of being a Republican.

1739
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:08,940
They're against reading.

1740
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:09,480
They don't...

1741
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:14,220
You know, they're trying to shut down these schools that teach reading.

1742
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,240
Know what I'm saying?

1743
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:16,840
No.

1744
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,480
Unfortunately.

1745
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,920
So, I hate to get political about it and so divisive, but it's...

1746
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,520
They started it.

1747
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:29,580
Unfortunately, it is true.

1748
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:30,380
They did start...

1749
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:30,700
No, no.

1750
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:30,940
Nuh-uh.

1751
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:31,440
You are.

1752
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:31,920
Nuh-uh.

1753
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:32,380
You are.

1754
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:32,840
Nuh-uh.

1755
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:33,260
You are.

1756
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,340
Nuh-uh.

1757
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,340
Okay, now look, kids.

1758
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:40,240
If you keep this up, I'm going to have to get in the backseat with you and you don't

1759
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,200
want that because I'm driving.

1760
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:45,880
Damn, kids.

1761
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:46,200
That way.

1762
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:46,840
You're the best.

1763
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:46,940
You're the best.

1764
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,340
Guys, you're on the old right there.

1765
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,160
I like that one.

1766
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:49,660
Damn, kids.

1767
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:50,560
I like that one.

1768
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,540
Is that a really...

1769
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,340
I think you've actually tried and failed at it.

1770
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:57,820
No, you quiet down you kids or I'm going to have to slap you naked and hide your clothes.

1771
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:05,960
Sterno overheard one redneck say that to another redneck in their colorful language.

1772
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,180
Both of those.

1773
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:07,660
Not like mine.

1774
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,740
Both of those or just the second one?

1775
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:12,900
Always both.

1776
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,920
I'm not talking about the weird either.

1777
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:16,920


1778
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:16,920


1779
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,780
the cerebral hemorrhages or any of the

1780
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,800
misqualifications over the last

1781
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,940
few years, let's let bygones

1782
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:23,920
be bygones.

1783
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:25,960
I just...

1784
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,880
They're going bye-bye. That's why we can't do it.

1785
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,320
They're gone. Bye-bye.

1786
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,880
Bye-bye.

1787
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:40,080
That's my

1788
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,820
Boris Karloff imitation.

1789
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:46,080
Well, in the first movie.

1790
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,400
That's about all he did.

1791
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,140
Yeah, that's right.

1792
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,160
He was a thug guy,

1793
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:54,820
right?

1794
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:02,040
But he kept on screwing it up and made him

1795
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,380
look like Boris Karloff.

1796
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,880
You're thinking of the Black Cat, I think.

1797
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,060
No, I'm thinking

1798
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,740
of Arsenic and Old Lake where

1799
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,120
Boris Karloff played

1800
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,660
the brother. Well, probably both.

1801
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,580
Played the evil brother.

1802
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:17,960
Played Clark Kent, not Clark Kent.

1803
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,080
Stephanie Davis.

1804
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,780
What's her name? Boris Karloff as

1805
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:22,220
Superman.

1806
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:27,920
No, I meant Corny Grunt. That's my joke

1807
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:28,900
for Gary Grant.

1808
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,880
Look, up in the sky.

1809
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:39,800
Well, Dave, I think we're starting

1810
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,060
to wind down here.

1811
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,460
Winding and winding.

1812
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:45,560
I can't...

1813
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:48,240
The Burning Man music is getting louder

1814
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,980
in the background. You can't hear it.

1815
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,020
I'm starting to yearn for

1816
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,300
Mel Torme. I think there's a problem

1817
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:54,620
here.

1818
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,780
Oh, now I hear the buzz.

1819
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,420
I turned off the music

1820
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,520
and I hear Dave's buzz.

1821
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:04,160
I like your buzz, Dave.

1822
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,960
Can I come over to your house

1823
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,780
and rub that little round buzz of yours?

1824
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:10,120
Listen to it.

1825
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,980
Kind of halting and stuttering.

1826
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,120
That's a proud little buzz.

1827
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,580
It didn't go away this time.

1828
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,040
It's coming and going.

1829
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:20,900
It's very intermittent.

1830
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,140
It goes when you talk and then it comes back

1831
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,060
when you stop talking.

1832
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,200
Well, I hope I didn't buzz up

1833
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,540
the entire occupancy.

1834
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:31,960
No, no.

1835
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,560
That's why the background music is there.

1836
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,780
Besides, like I said, there's ambient noise

1837
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:37,760
in Tarzan's

1838
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,200
radio station.

1839
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,760
I think when we started...

1840
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,560
No, we don't have the heat on, do we?

1841
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,560
We don't have anything on.

1842
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:46,320
It's just air noise.

1843
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,080
These crappy microphones and the fact that we're in a

1844
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:50,720
giant,

1845
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:54,160
one really big barn-sized

1846
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:54,660
room.

1847
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,220
Luckily, there's big curtains

1848
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:00,220
right near us that help

1849
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:02,220
keep the sound from being

1850
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:02,760
flat.

1851
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:08,080
Or bouncy or something.

1852
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:08,520
I don't know.

1853
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,500
Is there an echo in here?

1854
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:14,240
Here, here, here, here.

1855
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,560
Boy, there sure is.

1856
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:16,380
There is a buzz now.

1857
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,480
Listen to that buzz.

1858
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,540
Listen to that buzz.

1859
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,360
It's louder than the buzz in my brain.

1860
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,220
I don't think...

1861
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:24,180
Really?

1862
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,560
You're lucky, then.

1863
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:30,080
It's not nearly as loud as the buzz in my brain.

1864
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,680
I can barely distinguish which is my brain

1865
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,720
and which is your buzz.

1866
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:35,100
My brain

1867
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:41,220
is louder than your brain's buzz.

1868
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:41,960
And then there's the

1869
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,360
tinnitus or tinnitus

1870
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,560
or tinnitus.

1871
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,380
That's on the high end.

1872
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:50,180
This is in the mid-range, dude.

1873
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:52,800
That's a 60-cycle

1874
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,700
hum, I think.

1875
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,320
It's just the sound of electricity

1876
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,700
in a bad wire

1877
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,860
that moves

1878
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:02,160
every time you breathe.

1879
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,140
One of my favorite things.

1880
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:05,740
So, yeah.

1881
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,800
Welcome to the future, folks.

1882
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,900
Well, you're on the landline, though.

1883
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,780
Your phone could be worse.

1884
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,560
You could be on a...

1885
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,020
on a cell phone.

1886
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,400
Those are often way worse.

1887
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,260
The buzz is actually not as bad

1888
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:23,000
as a cell phone that's crackling

1889
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,900
and breaking up.

1890
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,480
And when it's gone,

1891
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,380
it sounds absolutely wonderful.

1892
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,260
Yeah.

1893
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:31,460
It does.

1894
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,960
Well, yeah, it does, actually.

1895
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:35,280
But it's not gone.

1896
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:36,860
Much every blue moon.

1897
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:40,180
Well, one of these days...

1898
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:41,840
One of these days,

1899
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:44,140
you'll be in a different house

1900
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,220
with a different phone.

1901
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,380
Right.

1902
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:48,500
Right.

1903
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,240
And you might ask yourself,

1904
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,020
what is this beautiful house?

1905
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,400
What is this beautiful room?

1906
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,280
We just saw the Trump version of that.

1907
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,600
God, that was fucking...

1908
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,240
Oh, we're making a radio show.

1909
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:58,500
Sorry.

1910
01:16:58,700 --> 01:16:59,760
The Trump version?

1911
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,020
My son sent us a link

1912
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:03,720
that some brilliant person

1913
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,620
had made a video

1914
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,560
where they took that

1915
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,120
Talking Heads song

1916
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:10,500
and put Trump's head

1917
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,100
on David Byrne,

1918
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:13,920
but they replaced

1919
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,440
all of the lyrics

1920
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,600
with Trump saying

1921
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,160
each individual word.

1922
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:20,320
So it would cut to...

1923
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,740
Give me a typical sample lyric

1924
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:24,560
from that song.

1925
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:27,340
And you may ask yourself,

1926
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,980
well, each of those words,

1927
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,420
and would be him saying

1928
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:32,600
and at one speech.

1929
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,120
You would be him saying

1930
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,240
you at another speech.

1931
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,860
Ask yourself would be another speech.

1932
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,740
So it was all Trump's voice.

1933
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:40,260
Right.

1934
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,440
Perfectly matched to the song,

1935
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,620
to the original song.

1936
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,260
And sampled well and nice, eh?

1937
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,960
It was an editing tour de force,

1938
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:51,020
you might say.

1939
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:51,400
It was.

1940
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,400
And a coup de grace

1941
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,580
at the same time.

1942
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,280
What's the name of it on YouTube?

1943
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:58,720
I don't remember.

1944
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,040
I don't know.

1945
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:01,580
Just Trump Talking Head.

1946
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:02,500
You would Google...

1947
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,760
Water flowing down...

1948
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,340
You would Google

1949
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:07,600
Trump Talking Head song.

1950
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,400
Yeah, that's right.

1951
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:10,680
Trump Talking Head song.

1952
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,820
Trump Talking Head song.

1953
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:12,220
Yeah.

1954
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,320
Yeah, the algorithms will know.

1955
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,620
Before you even finish typing it,

1956
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:18,820
they'll know what you want to know

1957
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:20,220
because so many other people

1958
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:21,280
already typed that in.

1959
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,880
Water flowing underground.

1960
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:25,840
Yes, that song.

1961
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,380
Letting the days go by.

1962
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:27,960
That song.

1963
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:31,660
I never did have that album.

1964
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:33,400
I really wasn't that into talking about it.

1965
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,380
Same as it ever was.

1966
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:38,220
I had dinner with that band once.

1967
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,520
But the whole time I was like,

1968
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:43,380
I didn't actually ever even have

1969
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,240
a bootleg tape.

1970
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,060
I did have a bootleg tape of their album.

1971
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:51,780
They were for the rich office worker intellectuals.

1972
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:59,700
I guess I was really into Devo and Elvis Costello,

1973
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:01,620
but they didn't seem art school.

1974
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,540
And to me, Talking Heads was like art school guys.

1975
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,080
Or people.

1976
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:08,660
Did you see them perform live?

1977
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,800
I did.

1978
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:10,840
I did actually.

1979
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:14,560
And in fact, because there was a time there,

1980
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,540
David Byrne was a...

1981
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,000
I was interested in subgenius

1982
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,720
and he was going to have a subgenius scene

1983
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,400
in that movie of his, True Stories.

1984
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:24,120
And I drove him around and hung out.

1985
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:28,500
Got ignored by him and Steve Tobolowsky

1986
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,080
while they discussed the symbolism of the script.

1987
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,760
And that was where I started thinking,

1988
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:33,160
what?

1989
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,860
People actually make movies where they talk about

1990
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,460
what stuff symbolizes?

1991
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:38,860
Oh, give me a break.

1992
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,060
Only critics think that way.

1993
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:44,020
But no, they were really good.

1994
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:45,440
The little girl in the white dress,

1995
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,680
symbolizes purity or something.

1996
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:48,720
I was going, what the?

1997
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:49,740
What the?

1998
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,280
What the?

1999
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:51,440


2000
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,460
Look at your type of butter.

2001
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,480
Did they learn how to do that in art school or something?

2002
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,420
I mean, that's what you tell the press

2003
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:00,220
when you're at your premiere.

2004
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,820
Oh, speaking of premieres,

2005
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:06,780
my son's movie has had a sort of a premiere.

2006
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,300
It's about to have an LA premiere

2007
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,640
that's going to be much bigger.

2008
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:12,940
It was at the Houston International Film Festival,

2009
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,420
but that turned out to be not a very, very big one.

2010
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:15,420


2011
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,220
It was a very big film festival.

2012
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,900
But the movie is called Solver,

2013
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,280
and the trailer is out.

2014
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:30,160
And Reverend Bleepo Abernathy did the sound sweetening on it,

2015
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,900
which makes it sound really professional.

2016
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:35,880
And my son directed it, so it is really professional.

2017
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,920
It was a real good little murder mystery.

2018
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,560
Cool.

2019
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,820
With a little sci-fi twist at the very end.

2020
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,360
It's the cheapest end of the world,

2021
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,620
mind control movie ever.

2022
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,800
It's only got about eight people in it.

2023
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,040
And only four of them have very much dialogue.

2024
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,460
But it is clever.

2025
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:57,740
Oh, yeah, it's clever.

2026
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:58,420
It's tricky.

2027
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,360
Because it's about puzzles.

2028
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,480
It's about solving puzzles.

2029
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:07,280
And apparently their campaign, their advertising campaign,

2030
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,880
they have a website where you go and do puzzles,

2031
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,960
to solve solver type puzzles.

2032
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:17,300
And that's the first thing that comes to mind.

2033
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:17,300


2034
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:17,300


2035
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:17,300


2036
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:17,300


2037
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,100
But I've got enough trouble trying to figure out

2038
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:22,500
how to dig myself out of that hole in No Man's Sky.

2039
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:27,720
My video game character fell into a hole in a planet,

2040
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:29,040
and he can't get out.

2041
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:32,680
He started trying to dig his way out with his laser blaster,

2042
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,800
and it all just sort of caved in on him.

2043
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,520
And now he's stuck.

2044
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,240
I may have to start the game over, if I can't get out.

2045
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:44,640
It's like, it's an existential dilemma.

2046
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:48,300
That you came up with.

2047
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,700
No, it's an accident.

2048
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:54,020
This game, I don't know if it's a glitch or a feature,

2049
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:57,520
but my character got himself into a situation

2050
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:00,560
he can't get out of using, in the physics of this

2051
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,920
completely made up world.

2052
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:04,960
Hmm.

2053
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:05,960
Yeah.

2054
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,020
Stuck in a damn hole.

2055
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,960
He went into a mine.

2056
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:09,880
Or a cave.

2057
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:14,500
And he actually did fall into a hole.

2058
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,740
And he thought, but it was full of jewels.

2059
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:19,720
So he thought, oh, I'm gonna start mining my way along here.

2060
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:24,960
Blasting out all this jewels with my blaster.

2061
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,160
But it kind of backfired.

2062
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,120
He got away from it.

2063
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:32,500
There's no light down there, except from the blaster.

2064
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:35,220
And now he can't find his way out.

2065
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:36,840
And he's me.

2066
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,980
So I'm, you know, in one of my other lives,

2067
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,940
I've got a real bad problem.

2068
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,360
In most of my other lives, I'm fine.

2069
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,400
I can drive real fast.

2070
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,420
And one of my lives, I'm a race car driver in the future.

2071
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:55,420
And I can get killed over and over and over again.

2072
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,960
But still drive real fast.

2073
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,180
And comes right back to life.

2074
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:58,640
Yeah.

2075
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:02,620
And of course, in several of my other lives,

2076
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:03,760
I hunt monsters.

2077
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:06,620
And I'm very good at that, actually.

2078
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:09,920
Well, I'm no pro, but I'm a good amateur.

2079
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:15,960
And I don't play Grand Theft Auto much anymore,

2080
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,640
but I was a criminal in that.

2081
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:20,620
And...

2082
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,340
That's what most people were, yeah.

2083
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,460
In some games, I'm a beautiful, skinny girl.

2084
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:30,520
Leaping and hopping and slicing heads off zombies.

2085
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:33,720
So feminine.

2086
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:37,960
I think you're a sick individual.

2087
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,160
No, I'm just a normal American playing video games.

2088
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,620
No, I agree with that, Dave.

2089
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:43,200
That's sick.

2090
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,860
Zombie stuff is sick.

2091
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:46,280
I hate all the zombie stuff.

2092
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,640
You don't like walkers?

2093
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,560
No.

2094
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:50,860
Our dog's a walker.

2095
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,060
I know, but I don't like any of that.

2096
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:52,340
We walk all the time.

2097
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:52,820
We're walkers.

2098
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,740
No, I don't like any of that zombie, dead zombie.

2099
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:58,280
If we were living dead walking people with a walker,

2100
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,160
we'd be walker, walker, walkers.

2101
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,160
I don't like any of it.

2102
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,960
We walk a walker dog.

2103
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,560
And if we were zombies,

2104
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:06,600
we'd be walker, walker, walkers.

2105
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,240
We're walker, walkers.

2106
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:10,020
That sounded like a funny joke.

2107
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:11,140
We walk, walk, walker.

2108
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,920
Well, that sounds pretty stupid.

2109
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,600
We should probably stop recording.

2110
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:16,860
Yeah, it certainly does.

2111
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,140
Let's see how long, wow.

2112
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:23,040
Let's just say 50, 52 minutes.

2113
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:28,900
So that's another 20 minutes after the approved hour long.

2114
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,920
And we're just all, it sounds just like

2115
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,660
a damn phone conversation.

2116
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:37,920
I don't know what it is.

2117
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,780
There's no music behind it and it's buzzing.

2118
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:40,100
No.

2119
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,440
Yeah, it's buzzy.

2120
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,400
No music.

2121
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:43,900
But who cares?

2122
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:44,360
It's the internet.

2123
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:46,800
Yeah, who cares?

2124
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,220
They can turn it off after the hour, you know.

2125
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,100
So, well, my back hurts too.

2126
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,920
I get claustrophobic after a while here.

2127
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:02,220
And yeah, claustrophobic, oh, because having to wear the headphones?

2128
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:03,400
I guess or something.

2129
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,940
Well, yeah, it is.

2130
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,580
It's so.

2131
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,620
It's not comfortable like the radio station.

2132
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,720
It's cramped.

2133
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,720
We're at a kind of a small table.

2134
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:17,840
And not only is the table small to begin with,

2135
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,640
it's made even smaller by a giant reel-to-reel deck

2136
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,420
that I've got set up here just because it looks cool.

2137
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:26,020
My dog's eyes are rolling up in his head.

2138
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:26,780
It doesn't work.

2139
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,900
This reel-to-reel deck, I need to repair it.

2140
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:33,960
It's partly out to remind me to try to repair it someday.

2141
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,580
But mainly it just makes Tarzan feel like he's a good guy.

2142
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:38,820
Tarzan's radio station looked like a radio station.

2143
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:41,360
You know.

2144
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,740
Why do you call it Tarzan's radio station?

2145
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:47,900
Because it was developed for campgrounds.

2146
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:52,140
And mostly it gets used on picnic tables

2147
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:55,060
surrounded by rustic wooden structures.

2148
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:59,520
And it's held together by snot and scotch tape.

2149
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:02,880
It's the cheapest old stuff.

2150
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:06,060
You know how your phone buzzes and is crappy?

2151
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:09,060
Well, Tarzan's radio station was made...

2152
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,580
It's like Tarzan's treehouse.

2153
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:13,780
Or the Little Rascals.

2154
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:17,360
It could just as easily be called the Little Rascals radio station.

2155
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:19,300
With the S backwards, yeah.

2156
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,700
I've got a quartz crystal and a tin can.

2157
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:22,680
We can make radio.

2158
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,060
I've got these instructions that I downloaded

2159
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,640
from Captain Future radio show.

2160
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,360
Well, I like that idea too.

2161
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,900
But yeah, it's Tarzan's radio station

2162
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,040
because it's like Tarzan's house.

2163
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,060
It's like something Tarzan would build.

2164
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,800
Or maybe the professor on Gilligan's Island.

2165
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,760
You know, he'd make a station,

2166
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:49,940
a radio transmitter out of the boat's spark plugs

2167
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:52,380
and a coconut.

2168
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,120
Some shells.

2169
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,920
And Mary Ann's earrings.

2170
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:03,600
Now, you know,

2171
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,540
a perennial question on the internet

2172
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:07,940
that gets asked a lot is,

2173
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,320
who do you go for?

2174
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,700
Mary Ann or Ginger?

2175
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,520
I like both actually, I must say.

2176
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:19,740
Well, and here's the really sad thing about that.

2177
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:23,300
They're leaving out Mrs. Howell

2178
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:29,480
who, frankly, is unbelievably rich.

2179
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:33,580
And she's pretty hot for a grandma age person.

2180
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,080
I mean, I'd hit that.

2181
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,660
Not when I was 12 years old

2182
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:40,120
and Gilligan's Island was on.

2183
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:42,180
I didn't, you know, she looked like a grandma.

2184
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,500
Well, I look like a grandpa.

2185
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:48,960
So, after you get rescued,

2186
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:52,040
who do you want to be hanging with?

2187
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:55,140
The vapid, idiotic movie star?

2188
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:02,200
The nice but not very glamorous Mary Ann?

2189
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:07,040
Or the lady with a billion dollars?

2190
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,580
After her settlement with,

2191
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,480
from Thurston Howell III?

2192
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,320
I think I'd rather be with Don Knotts

2193
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,480
and Mayberry R.F.D.

2194
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,200
Because those guys are all real heterosexuals

2195
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,440
and criminals and stuff.

2196
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,680
Well, I'd rather be Don Knotts

2197
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:27,920
and the love god.

2198
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:30,880
He was, in that movie,

2199
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:32,080
he's this nebbish,

2200
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,460
nerd birdwatcher

2201
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:36,180
who is tricked by publishers

2202
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:38,900
into acting as a sort of a front man,

2203
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,340
Hugh Hefner.

2204
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,540
It's like, what if Hugh Hefner

2205
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:44,200
was really an unwilling nerd

2206
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:47,080
who didn't want to do any of this stuff

2207
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,380
and he's forced to live this Hefner lifestyle?

2208
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,580
And it was Don Knotts.

2209
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,360
It's actually a really funny movie.

2210
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:55,020
Yeah.

2211
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:59,520
And I learned something about our subgenius movie.

2212
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,260
I realized,

2213
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:03,300
I was taught by watching the love god

2214
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:04,880
that you gotta have a montage.

2215
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,680
And that we can get through a whole bunch,

2216
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,780
we can just cut out a bunch of dialogue

2217
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,660
by having a good visual montage

2218
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:13,800
with the right song.

2219
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:15,140
Yeah.

2220
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,520
That's what Don Knotts did.

2221
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,340
So if it's good enough for Don Knotts,

2222
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,520
hell, it's good enough for any subgenius movie.

2223
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:24,860
Yeah.

2224
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:29,580
So, well, Dave, we should go.

2225
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:32,760
Well, have a pleasant afternoon.

2226
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,700
I actually have to get up early in the morning.

2227
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:38,960
The dog wakes us up at eight o'clock on the dot.

2228
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:43,740
Well, I have to go frop up and go to the bathroom.

2229
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:45,200
Well, yeah.

2230
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:47,540
Well, of course.

2231
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,440
Yeah, why not both?

2232
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:54,020
Well, believe me, that's part of the plan.

2233
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:57,240
Yeah, there's gonna be shit involved no matter what.

2234
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,000
Good shit.

2235
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:01,120
Yeah.

2236
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:01,240
Yeah.

2237
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,520
We got that right squirin'.

2238
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,220
Yeah.

2239
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:03,740
Yeah.

2240
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:06,200
Okay, Dave.

2241
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:08,620
Okay, Stang.

2242
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:10,640
Well, good night.

2243
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:11,780
See you, Dave.

2244
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:12,040
Good night.

2245
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,060
See ya.

2246
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:15,180
Let's see.

2247
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,080
How do I do this nicely?

2248
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,540
Okay, he hung up.

2249
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:23,920
There's the music.

2250
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,240
It's still there in the background.

2251
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,460
The dog is asleep.

2252
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:36,780
Well, I'll do it.

2253
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:37,060


2254
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,080
Okay, yeah.

2255
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,340
So, I guess I'm gonna have to catch up with Dave next time.

2256
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:42,340


2257
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:42,340


2258
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:42,700
Yeah.

2259
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2260
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2261
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2262
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2263
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2264
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2265
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2266
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2267
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2268
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2269
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2270
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2271
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700


2272
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,720
Yeah.

2273
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:42,720


2274
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:42,720


2275
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700
