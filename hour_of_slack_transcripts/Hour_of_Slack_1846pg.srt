1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,040
It feels like your skin is being torn right off you and then you ache all over and get sick and you can't breathe.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,880
Your nose runs and you have a high fever and then you pass out, but when you wake up it starts all over again.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,380
The Self Genius Power of Swag.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,900
Such a stupid, ghastly, tragic mistake.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,780
Tonight's show is a mix of old and young.

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,260
Part of it is old me and old lonesome cowboy Dave.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,600
A new call-in recording.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,940
And the young folks are from the last X-Day drill in Florida.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,120
Reverend Fid Chooley of the Super Sphere denomination.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,060
And the Time for the Show show fame.

11
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,760
Hosting a late night...

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,580
Sorry.

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,220
All night Sunday night in fact at X-Day.

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:17,900
And his first guest was Reverend Purge who is a very pretty young black trans woman with great knockers who is an adult film star.

15
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,800
So it's a different show.

16
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,640
Like I say, it's the old and the young.

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,560
Not exactly getting.

18
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,820
Together but contrasting I guess in some way.

19
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,700
And I'm not sure what order it's going to be in but let's just wing it.

20
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,920
And praise Bob.

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:47,680
By the way I'm recording this out in the woods taking a break from walking the dogs with Princess Wave.

22
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,140
Ahhh.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,120
And it's hot.

24
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,060
Yes.

25
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,720
But we have special little plastic cheap chairs.

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:56,760


27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,900
And wind chimes.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,380
Yes.

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,860
But the wind isn't blowing.

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,360
No.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,080
It's hot.

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,860
It's hot.

33
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,980
Anyway back to this week's strange hour of slack young and old mix.

34
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,360
Praise Bob.

35
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,220
Yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai.

36
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,200
I don't really yell too much and if I do I yell quietly.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,740
Hey Fox.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,260
Slightly.

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,840
Old Crow.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,220
Can you hear me all right up there?

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,760
Can you hear me?

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,700
All right.

43
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,120
Cool, cool, cool.

44
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,740
And just make it so everybody else can hear you.

45
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,740


46
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,740


47
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,740


48
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,740


49
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,660
Old Crow.

50
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,860
Sorry.

51
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,220
Yeah we're doing a marriage tonight.

52
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:31,900
I think if we just put the podium over that's fine.

53
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,560
Okay.

54
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,600
You are now live on freethinkradio.com.

55
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,660
Oh my god.

56
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,560
We are live on freethinkradio.com.

57
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,220
Hello everybody.

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,200
It is the Too Late Show with Dr. Beelzebub.

59
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:46,880
Crow.

60
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,760
Bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow.

61
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,540
Bow.

62
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,540
Folks, we got a special show for you tonight.

63
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,900
We got a lot going on.

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,060
We've got a marriage that we're going to officiate.

65
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,960
Maybe even get a little consummation going on stage.

66
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,200
I don't know.

67
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,680
This might be the wrong part of the resort for that.

68
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,880
I understand there is a nudist part of the resort and then a f***ing part of the resort.

69
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,180
And I don't know if those are the same thing or a different thing.

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,400
But either way, we're very happy to have all of you with us here tonight.

71
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,940
We got a lot going on.

72
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,080
Okay, this is X-Day.

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,660
I never really knew that X-Day was a thing until I accidentally wandered down here.

74
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,060
I got on the wrong megabus and I got off here at this resort.

75
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,840
And these fantastic people, they started telling me about UFOs.

76
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,080
And if you know anything about our show, we talk about UFOs a lot.

77
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,420
We think about UFOs a lot.

78
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,620
We like to make foods kind of shaped like UFOs from time to time.

79
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,700
UFO pies and cookies and that sort of thing.

80
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,420
But the point.

81
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,420
The point that I'm trying to get across here, folks, is this s*** is weird.

82
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,140
All right.

83
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,440
This is allegedly the Church of the Subgenius.

84
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,740
All right.

85
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,940
Now, from what I understand, we worship a guy named J.R. Bob Dobbs.

86
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,280
All right.

87
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:14,600
And there's a deep mythology and indeed a theology associated with Mr. J.R. Bob Dobbs.

88
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:21,220
But tonight, folks, we're going to highlight for you what we've learned about the Church of the Subgenius over the last few days.

89
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,420
We've met some really lovely people.

90
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,580
We've met some really lovely people here in Florida over the last few days.

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,020
And we would like to sort of, you know, bring that to you back at home, wherever that is.

92
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,460
You know, probably you're watching YouTube.

93
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,400
A lot of people watch us while they're taking a s***.

94
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,300
A lot of people watch us like while they're supposed to be doing their homework.

95
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,540
That's kind of, you know, that's one of our big demographics, people trying to do homework.

96
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,200
We also get a lot of traffic from people that click on the wrong video.

97
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,420
And a lot of times when you're in a K-hole, you can't really click away from the video that you accidentally clicked on.

98
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,440
So you end up watching.

99
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,820
You are s*** about an hour and a half.

100
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,060
You wake up later on.

101
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,520
You're like, oh, did I even do ketamine?

102
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,360
I feel so dumb.

103
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,160
I usually don't feel this dumb when I wake up from a ketamine binge.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,780
Not that I know anything about that, folks.

105
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,520
I don't do, well.

106
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:08,980
All right.

107
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,580
Nicotine doesn't count as a drug.

108
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,040
Also, alcohol doesn't count as a drug.

109
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,380
Ketamine doesn't count as a drug.

110
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,000
None of that stuff is drugs.

111
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,180
Look, folks, I'm sorry.

112
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm getting distracted.

113
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,220
Let me introduce you to our.

114
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,920
Let me get this through real quick.

115
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,780
OK, you know, on the ones and twos and threes and fours and probably even other numbers.

116
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,320
We've got Mr.

117
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,200
Jonah Jones.

118
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,820
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

119
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,640
And then, of course, we have our inestimable producer, Mr.

120
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,460
Daniel Holmes.

121
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,360
Call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call.

122
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,500
And running our running our Chiron in the back, you know, we have Dr.

123
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,120
Beef Supreme.

124
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,000
He's around here somewhere.

125
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,240
Oh.

126
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,060
There he is.

127
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,900
That's that mother.

128
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,620
So we're going to get right around to it, folks.

129
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,340
Look, we've got a very small time slot today.

130
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,720
OK, we're going to be on for about 10 or 15 minutes and then we're going to be on for the next eight hours.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,340
So, you know, settle in, grab yourself, you know, whatever you need to tie off with and join us for a long, weird trip down.

132
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:18,880
J.R.

133
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,740
Bob Dobbs Lane.

134
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,300
So here's a question.

135
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,820
Where's my second microphone?

136
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,260
Because this is like allegedly a talk show.

137
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,900
And if I don't have two microphones, then I can't really, you know, I can't really talk to anybody.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,700
You know, I can talk to myself, but nobody wants to be that.

139
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:48,780
Well, so I've actually, you know, over the last few days, I've learned a lot about myself and the limits of moisture.

140
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,420
You know, I myself.

141
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,420
You know, I'm a little bit of a.

142
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:53,420


143
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,580
A lot of folks might not know this, but I'm actually the half son of Satan.

144
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,160
So I'm used to a hot climate.

145
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,840
You know, I spent most of my summers as a child.

146
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,420
Oh, that's a microphone right there.

147
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,400
The Zing.

148
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,760
Oh, that's fucking beautiful.

149
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,360
Whoa. It's got a little got a ninja star attached to it.

150
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,780
Yeah, it's the kind of microphone you could throw that through the air, like really do some damage to somebody.

151
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,280
This should be good.

152
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,180
Oh, my.

153
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:23,740
God.

154
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,200
Does it does it say call?

155
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,140
It says call.

156
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,540
Oh, good.

157
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:27,820
Good.

158
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,240
This is actually this is a nice mic.

159
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,420
This one's nice and loud.

160
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,040
Well, I mean, but I'm loud.

161
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,540
Oh, I can be louder.

162
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,100
Well, that's not that's not.

163
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,820
Oh, it's not the goal.

164
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm going to start the show.

165
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,640
You're the producer.

166
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,320
Oh, oh, I can be louder than you.

167
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,100
I'm just fading.

168
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,140
I will have a background stage right now.

169
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,760
I am not in front of the PA.

170
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,360
I will cry.

171
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,160
Okay.

172
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:46,800
Okay.

173
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,040
We should.

174
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,980
Don't be louder than me.

175
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,600
Okay.

176
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,180
It's important.

177
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,620
All right.

178
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,160
Sorry, everybody.

179
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,400
I mean, for my producer to upstage me.

180
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:53,400


181
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,100
Like a monster.

182
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,040
Anyway.

183
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:56,660
All right.

184
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,540
I know.

185
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,320
I see.

186
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,400
I think I see it out here in the audience.

187
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,840
One of our one of our lovely guests for this evening.

188
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,920
Would you like to come up on stage and join us for a brief moment?

189
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,100
Carl, make some room for our guest.

190
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,640
Damn it.

191
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,220
Well, hi.

192
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:16,640
Hi.

193
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,420
Welcome to the show.

194
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:17,960
I'm Dr.

195
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,560
I'm Dr.

196
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,140
James Crow.

197
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,640
Hi, Dr.

198
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:20,900
Crow.

199
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,600
I'm Dr.

200
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,220
Perg.

201
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,000
Dr.

202
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,380
Perg.

203
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,460
It's really nice to meet you.

204
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,980
So tell me, what brings you to X Day?

205
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,780
Are you here for the UFOs or the guy with the pipe?

206
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,340
What initially drew you to the Church of the Subgenius?

207
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,960
I wasn't drawn to the Church of the Subgenius.

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,640
I was drafted.

209
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,620
Oh, okay.

210
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:38,960
Okay.

211
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,780
Like a kind of a military style.

212
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,160
You were forced into service.

213
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,140
Yes.

214
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,400
It's that sometimes it doesn't take any time.

215
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,160
It doesn't take you stepping forward.

216
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,440
It takes everyone else stepping back.

217
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,400
That's true.

218
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,420
You're the only the lone survivor.

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,400
It's true.

220
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,400


221
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,400


222
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,400


223
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,400


224
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,400


225
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,400


226
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,620
And you still have to live.

227
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,540
If you want to make it like a true survivor.

228
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,640
A true survivor.

229
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,260
And when was this you were drafted?

230
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,480
I mean, how long have you been a part of the Church?

231
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,020
Oh, time is an illusion, but also I'm not great with it either.

232
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,420
That's a solid fucking point.

233
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:08,700
A fucking point.

234
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,200
Okay.

235
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:09,740
All right.

236
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,680
Well, several years.

237
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,560
That's good enough for me.

238
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,340
I can't really count much higher than eight or nine anyway, just between the two of us.

239
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,360
So like anything beyond that could just completely go over my head.

240
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,320
And so, what do you do in the Church?

241
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,380
You know, from what I know, I come to this church like every day, every night, every

242
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:29,280
From what I understand, I've been watching a lot of people in leadership roles and non-leadership roles,

243
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,080
and I can't really tell what anyone's deal is.

244
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,300
Is this an organization? Is this a roving gypsy party-style event?

245
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,520
What's going on here at X Day? Help me understand.

246
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,260
It's that leadership roles aren't doled out. They're taken.

247
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,880
They have to be claimed.

248
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,300
Yes, they have to be claimed.

249
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,600
It's that it is...

250
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,180
Oh God, you're going to break me into a story, aren't you?

251
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,460
I mean, I like stories.

252
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,820
It's that upon my first X Day, again, just like yourself,

253
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,520
I did not know that X Day was a thing that actually occurred.

254
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,140
I thought it was something that happened in the past.

255
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,420
Something that you saw...

256
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,860
Sorry, God. Okay, all right, I'm into the mic.

257
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,200
Is this any better?

258
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,300
All right.

259
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,200
But yes, I didn't know that the...

260
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,280
X Day...

261
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,280


262
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,180
X Day actually still occurred.

263
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,260
And when I was told, again, I don't know if you guys can tell online,

264
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,900
probably with the white balance of the way it's set,

265
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm probably an unlocked character at this point.

266
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,040
A mystery character has appeared.

267
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,800
You need more badges to unlock me.

268
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,480
But I'm of a darker skin tone,

269
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,920
and with all the history and things that come with that,

270
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,220
I was not fully mentally prepared.

271
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,460
I wasn't prepared for what I was about to witness.

272
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,480
And also, I didn't know what to expect.

273
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,080
I just thought two white people were going to take me into the woods

274
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,020
and do terrible things.

275
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,240
That's usually how it goes.

276
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,300
There's a history there.

277
00:10:59,420 --> 00:10:59,800
Yeah.

278
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,000
But when I...

279
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,020
Upon arriving,

280
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,060
upon arriving,

281
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,600
I was greeted with community and love and kindness

282
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,520
and just this great social structure

283
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,580
and madness and terror

284
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,140
and jankum fumes.

285
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,360
And it was just...

286
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,680
All the beautiful things in life, all combined into one.

287
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,660
However, this year, there is no jankum.

288
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,520
You have to bring your own.

289
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,820
We have running water.

290
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,380
It is nice.

291
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,560
Yeah, that is nice.

292
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,900
But my car didn't get hot enough on the way down here,

293
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,380
so I'm still trying to get my second badge going.

294
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,280
Give it time.

295
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,060
Okay, okay.

296
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,760
It will eventually ferment and mature.

297
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,180
Okay.

298
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,440
I like that you talked about sort of being surprised

299
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,900
by the amount of community that you saw here.

300
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,940
I've been following...

301
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,460
the writings of the church,

302
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,100
and I've been listening to the Hour of Slack for a long time now,

303
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,800
and there's a very powerful sarcastic edge

304
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,600
to the church's comedy.

305
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,060
I thought that I might be able to get more of that

306
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,000
in the personal interactions that I got here,

307
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,540
but everyone has been so kind and loving and welcoming.

308
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,420
It really is a beautiful contrast

309
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,180
to the sort of the, you know,

310
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,120
the kind of the edge humor that happens a lot

311
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,640
around subgenius media.

312
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,460
I love it so far.

313
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,040
Yes.

314
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,280
I think what I'm trying to suggest is that one of the biggest things

315
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,260
that they think that when they look at our readings,

316
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,860
they look at our rants and our teachings,

317
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,820
that they think that we're just generally hateful assholes,

318
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,520
and that's true.

319
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,220
We are hateful assholes,

320
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,480
but it's a clean burning hate.

321
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,840
It's an efficient hate.

322
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,020


323
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,560
That's not a coal-style hate.

324
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,820
This is a nuclear hate.

325
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,240
Yes.

326
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,180
Nuclear.

327
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,420
Nuclear.

328
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,820
Nu-cu-lar.

329
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,140
There you go.

330
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,100
You'll get it.

331
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,740
I think that's right.

332
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,840
I'll get there eventually.

333
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,160
From PR News in Washington,

334
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,240
I'm releasing a report with 40 recommendations

335
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,760
that left 10 people dead.

336
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,260
The actual number of deaths was more than 4,600.

337
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,700
Governor says

338
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,560
the racial racial racial racism

339
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,200
can make in-plan the all-

340
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,560
tougher red metal gun locks to help identify PR News.

341
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,440
The United States is running out of immigrant children

342
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,420
who are being separated from PR News.

343
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,460
Immigrant children usually stay in bed.

344
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,100
Immigrant children jump PR News illegally,

345
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,380
unlawfully in empty government buildings.

346
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,760
Twenty-two percent.

347
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,220
Ninety-five percent.

348
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,500
Retail giant Walmart is threatening to disrupt

349
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,440
Canada's second largest PR News

350
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,520
in Washington.

351
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:42,460
Millions who are scary kids

352
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:42,460


353
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:55,620
by committing 0 to 0 Ross in September.

354
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,120


355
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,600
. But the ROJ is outlawed.

356
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,040
Well, that's a cognitive problem in your brain.

357
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,380
So I'll pretend that I just called you.

358
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,560
Okay.

359
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,340
Hello, Dave.

360
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,380
Hi, Doug.

361
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,640
Hey, Dave.

362
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,140
We didn't really talk for a minute or two before we started this recording or anything.

363
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,520
That's right.

364
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,980
I didn't cut anything off the beginning, any clumsy, awkward sound problems.

365
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,600
Oh, yeah.

366
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,220
Sound problems, overtures, and various physical liabilities, too, as well.

367
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:45,200
Well, we actually have those very much so today because any minute all four dogs might start barking frantically at deer.

368
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:54,600
There's a tribe of deer or deer-like things that have decided that our backyard is their toilet.

369
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,060
Well, that's a good idea.

370
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,240
Yeah.

371
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:57,780
I thought.

372
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:04,780
I mean, there were, you know, bums and other homeless people that would walk by and they saw the sign.

373
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,740
No.

374
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,460
You put it up.

375
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,680
We only have homeless animals out here.

376
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,440
It's too far for bums to walk.

377
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,300
Well, do they need toilet paper and other experimentary valves or are they pretty much.

378
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,740
Maybe I shouldn't leave the rolls of toilet paper hanging from trees because that may be what's drawing the deer.

379
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,340
It's confusing.

380
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,860
It's making me think, come on home and we'll have some.

381
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,220
We'll have some sauerkraut and some pickles and honest eggs and, you know, stuff like that.

382
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,440
And we leave ourselves with nature's problems.

383
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,720
Yeah.

384
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,880
Nature's vowels, I would say.

385
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,600
Nature's vowels because it's more of a vowel sound.

386
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:50,260
Well, the deer leave all these little piles of smart pills all over the yard.

387
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,080
The dogs are not very smart.

388
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,480
They try to eat them.

389
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,520
If we walk them around back there.

390
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,860
See, the deer don't come.

391
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,000
If they come into the fence part, let's call that the front yard.

392
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,480
It's fenced and the dogs can't get out and the deer can't get in or don't want to.

393
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:17,320
And then there's, let's call it the backyard, which is, for all intents and purposes, endless wilderness.

394
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,800
Yeah, we'll call it the backyard.

395
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,480
Yeah.

396
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,740
And so the varmints come and go.

397
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,840
Raccoons and possums, foxes and.

398
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,000
Armadillos?

399
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,360
Armadillos, yeah.

400
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:36,340
They all go under the back porch with the cats and play poker and smoke cigars.

401
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,500
Yeah.

402
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,440
I'm pretty sure.

403
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,480
Yeah.

404
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,360
That's what I was told would probably happen next.

405
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,280
Yeah.

406
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,880
With the vowels and the chocolate bars and the cigars.

407
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,180
And the wasps and centipedes apparently don't interfere with the game like they do with me.

408
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,780
You know, I went to the hospital.

409
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,400
I went to the hospital with a wasp sting all of a sudden a couple of months ago.

410
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,740
I never used to be allergic like that.

411
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:15,500
But my nurse, Reverend Anna Phylaxis, gave me a bunch of injections that made me fall asleep practically right there at the hospital.

412
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,300
And saved me from dying.

413
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,660
Now I have a special shot that if I go exploring out in the woods, which I don't do anymore.

414
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,760
I don't do that anymore.

415
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,700
I can give myself an injection.

416
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:30,760
Yeah.

417
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,800
You just carry that micrometer around with you like it was a bad joke.

418
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:43,860
And if the highway patrol ever stops, you just like jump out of the car and stick it in their arm and let them chase you all summer.

419
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,040
At least for a few more years.

420
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,520
Yeah.

421
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,080
The cops chasing me?

422
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,380
I don't want to do that either.

423
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,780
I'm just getting tired of running, you know.

424
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,620
Okay.

425
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,360
I can't run.

426
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,360
I can't run anymore.

427
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,140
I don't know what to tell you what to do.

428
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,840
You're still wearing the sports sneakers.

429
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:11,680
I made all these trails, these secret trails that lead from my house down to the creek and various other hideouts.

430
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,600
And in case the black helicopters show up, you know, I'm always ready to bolt.

431
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:24,100
As long as they don't have stang-sniffing dogs, they wouldn't be able to follow me.

432
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,280
Because I'm not sure where I'd go.

433
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,820
After I got down to the creek.

434
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:36,800
Well, I heard that they are now using stang-sniffing dogs in almost every adventure with Mr. Stang.

435
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,880
Yeah, that's what I heard too.

436
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,560
So I don't want to have any more adventures.

437
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,480
I really hate adventures.

438
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:52,180
I had a bunch over the years and they all were terrifying and tiring and hurtful and traumatizing.

439
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,380
Well, maybe you need a nice big pair.

440
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:02,640
You know, you can wear panties and a brassiere and confuse the animals into thinking you're something you're not.

441
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,700
Like maybe, you know, a great college professor or a cyclops or something.

442
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,240
I don't know.

443
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,820
But get them on a different track.

444
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:19,080
No, just wear a wig and a dress and tell them that I'm the Queen of England and they better leave me alone.

445
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,740
Oh, that sounds great.

446
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,580
Yeah, I got that idea from my Cheech and Chong game.

447
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,260
There's a game that tells you to dress up like the Queen of England?

448
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,200
Well, Chong was going to get deported.

449
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,820
You would...

450
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,300
And because he's Canadian.

451
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,760
I don't know if you knew that.

452
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,500
But Chong of Cheech and Chong is Canadian.

453
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,740
And so they were going to deport him.

454
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,480
So he dressed as the Queen of England.

455
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:53,160
And the mayor believed him and fell in love with him and tried to seduce him really hard.

456
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,560
Yeah.

457
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,280
Well, it sounds good so far.

458
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,300
You know what happened.

459
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,760
Then...

460
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,620
What did happen?

461
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,820
He got deported and that was the end of the story.

462
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:07,840
Oh, no.

463
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:15,800
Then Bigfoot showed up and it distracted everybody from Chong being deported.

464
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,780
And that just sort of got forgotten because of Bigfoot and the aliens.

465
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:21,960
Yeah.

466
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,140
Now there's aliens everywhere.

467
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,140


468
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,740
There's aliens in it.

469
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,820
In fact, there's also aliens in my other Idle Harvest game, Trailer Park Boys Greasy Money.

470
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,820
I've gotten really far in both of these games.

471
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:45,540
I make like an assload-tillion as soon as I start up a business in those things now.

472
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,220
Because they're so upgraded and corrupt.

473
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,100
You did confuse me.

474
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,240
Because you had me thinking it was all part of the backyard.

475
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,940
And now you're telling me it's a game.

476
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,440
A video game that you play.

477
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:04,680
No, that's just where I got the idea of dressing up like the Queen of England and telling the black helicopters that,

478
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,160
Hey, hey, don't mess with me.

479
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,880
I'm the Queen of England.

480
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,820
You're trying to start a...

481
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,980
I'd say it's like in a British accent.

482
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,760
You're not trying to start an international incident now, are you?

483
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,720
Bloody well, better not be.

484
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,460
Yeah, that's right.

485
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,820
That's pretty convincing, isn't it?

486
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,820
Yeah, that's what I was hoping for.

487
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,100
The whole time doing our timesheets together there.

488
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,840
Right.

489
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,100
I wanted to see you dressed like that.

490
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,420
And you did it.

491
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,760
And so now I feel much better.

492
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,960
My beard might throw them off a little bit.

493
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,120
Well, beards throw everybody off a little bit.

494
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,220
You know, that's not your problem.

495
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,180
If they don't like a beard, you can tell them to go take a royal hike.

496
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,060
Right.

497
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,500
I've got a phone app called Faceplant or something like that.

498
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:07,180
And you can take a picture of anybody and replace a movie actor with your face.

499
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,920
For some reason, Bob's face doesn't work because it can't handle the pipe.

500
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,520
Yeah.

501
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,240
But my face, it works with my face pretty well.

502
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:26,940
And so I've added my face to Marilyn Monroe movies and Sophia Loren movies and Thai dancer,

503
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,060
ballerina movies and stuff.

504
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,980
And it's really hideous and scary.

505
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,040
You can see it on my YouTube.

506
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,440
I think it's called Bobmations or something like that.

507
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,540
It's the latest in my experimental animations playlist.

508
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,660
It's really pretty sickening.

509
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,460
So you did, you Photoshopped your head?

510
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,720
Well, it's moving.

511
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,800
Into the body of a Thai.

512
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,200
The funny thing is it adds your face onto, say, Marilyn Monroe.

513
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,660
And she's talking or singing.

514
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,980
And when she smiles, you smile.

515
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,740
And when she closes her eyes, you close your eyes.

516
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,640
It's quite realistic.

517
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,720
You know, it's like an instant deep fake.

518
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,080
I could add my face to Joe Biden's speeches and everybody would think I was the president.

519
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,300
I have a stutter similar to his.

520
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,440
And, you know, they'd be able to collect blue peaches.

521
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,840
And then they'd be able to go to the super reals and say I was falling down senile.

522
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,760
Really, I'm just falling asleep senile.

523
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,860
Yeah.

524
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm not at the falling down from the senility.

525
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
Just falling asleep from it.

526
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:39,400
So as my ex-wife used to say, though, senility is the last thing you have to worry about.

527
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,920
Yeah, I know.

528
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,040
Real funny.

529
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,400
Yeah.

530
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,640
Heh, heh.

531
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,920
Heh, heh, heh.

532
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:55,040
So I still don't understand if you're in a Thai movie, the queen of Thailand has your face on, right?

533
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,580
Yeah.

534
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,240
Yeah.

535
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,060
And she's singing and dancing and everything.

536
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,620
And she's singing like that lady that's in the...

537
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,440
It's really disturbing.

538
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,580
They all...

539
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,460
In bridal movies.

540
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,940
Or, I'm sorry.

541
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,720
Well, it looks...

542
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,660
I'd look a little better on, like, monster movie characters and things like that.

543
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,480
But the female characters, it looks like my mom with a beard.

544
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,000
And glasses.

545
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,620
Everybody looks like that to me, in some way or another.

546
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,900
Everybody looks like your mom with a beard?

547
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,900
Yeah.

548
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,820
Or your mom with a beard, too.

549
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,800
In fact...

550
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:42,660
I saw a movie in which this mentally ill man, superhero, was so traumatized by his evil mother,

551
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,940
who gave him his unique powers at a great cost.

552
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,880
And everyone he sees looks like his mom, which makes it easy for him to kill people,

553
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,040
because he hates her so much.

554
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,720
And they have scenes where he tells somebody,

555
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,440
well, I find it easy to kill others because everyone looks like my mom.

556
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,080
And you see, for a couple of times, you see through his eyes, and sure enough,

557
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,940
everyone looks like his mom.

558
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,580
The fat guy looks like a fat version of his mom.

559
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,100
The skinny guy looks like a skinny version of his mom.

560
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,520
Everyone looks like his mom.

561
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:29,300
And the strange superpower that is given to this man in this movie, called the Suicide Squad,

562
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,300
is that he can shoot polka dots out of his flesh.

563
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,700
These polka dot tumors form all over his body,

564
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,060
and when they build up too much and he becomes too heavy,

565
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,040
he expels them and they blow things up.

566
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,660
Polka dots.

567
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,620
Multicolored, gaily colored polka dots come shooting out of this guy's diseased body

568
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,120
and blow up buildings and stuff.

569
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,100
That's his superpower.

570
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,660
That sounds like a good weapon to use.

571
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,260
Polka dot man.

572
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,020
Yeah.

573
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,820
That sounds exciting.

574
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,040
My friend Dr. Philo Drummond started a Facebook page called

575
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,060
Bad Superhero.

576
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,480
He's got a bunch of super villain and super hero names.

577
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,140
And I should just read a list of them, but I don't have it in front of me.

578
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,300
Oh yeah, that's what I was going to say.

579
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,220
Read a list, but you don't have it in front of me.

580
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,880
Right.

581
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,100
I also have a list of all the mystery men who weren't in the mystery men movie,

582
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,340
but are mentioned in it.

583
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,360
And they're pretty funny.

584
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,420
There's like the Waffler ballerina man.

585
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,140
Yeah.

586
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,360
Ballerina man.

587
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,360
French tickler.

588
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,280
Oh, Lucky Pierre and the French tickler.

589
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,440
White flight and black rage or something like that.

590
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,360
Another pair made in heaven, yeah.

591
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,880
Yeah, there are all these superhero teams that are pretty funny.

592
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:09,020
And all I'm hoping they're all, if not heterosexual, at least some form of sexual.

593
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,580
Oh, they're all over the place.

594
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:18,100
I saw another superhero movie called The Old Guard, which was really pretty fun.

595
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:25,320
And it has these, there's five immortals that have been around for thousands of years living in secret,

596
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,140
mostly doing good deeds by killing lots of bad guys.

597
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:39,000
And two of the five immortals are gay men that are really, really deeply in love with each other.

598
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,480
Which is an unusual aspect for a superhero movie.

599
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,860
Yeah, that's usually what.

600
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,440
They're always holding hands and hugging and kissing and stuff.

601
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,320
And then they kick ass, you know, and kill bad guys.

602
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:52,980
Yeah.

603
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,400
I just learned there's going to be a sequel to it.

604
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,120
I'm very excited about that, actually.

605
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,100
Yeah, that's usually where I put the bookmark in there.

606
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,220
And I read a couple of chapters post-tense.

607
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,040
Yeah.

608
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,000
And into the next chapter.

609
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:08,980


610
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,840
Yeah.

611
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:09,840


612
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,280
Because I don't want to, you know, think too many thoughts at one time.

613
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,040
Because this has easily crushed my brain as anybody else.

614
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,860
You know, so.

615
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,060
Well, yeah, your brain crushes mine every time we do a show.

616
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,800
Mine in reverse, too.

617
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,940
It's the same thing to you.

618
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,040
And I have, when I listen back to it, it's like I have to relive getting my brain crushed over and over again.

619
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,440
Well, I'm sorry about that part.

620
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,340
I couldn't help that.

621
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:40,580


622
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,220
I know.

623
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,840
Well, it's Dr. Howell does it, too.

624
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,620
He crushes my brain.

625
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,880
Philo does.

626
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,820
Philo is one of the only people who doesn't crush my brain because we have almost exactly the same brain powers or lack thereof.

627
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,980
And also we tend to sound a little bit alike.

628
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,760
So it doesn't matter which one of us says what.

629
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,720
It's going to come out the same way.

630
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,460
Either way.

631
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,920
Yeah.

632
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,180
Like an Andrew Flax Lloyd or whatever.

633
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,780
Yeah.

634
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,340
People can't tell us apart except that I'm so much better looking than him.

635
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:21,700
Well, I heard this one woman, one woman scream out in the middle of the parking lot.

636
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,660
It's alive.

637
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,260
It's alive.

638
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,600
And it was pointed at a picture and looked like you dressed up as the queen of Thailand.

639
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,400
Yeah.

640
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,580
And Philo dressed up as the queen of England.

641
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:32,860
Right.

642
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,940
That's Philo Dina.

643
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,680
Philo Dina.

644
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:35,900
Yeah.

645
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,660
Oh, yes.

646
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,660
Oh yeah.

647
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:40,980


648
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,980
That's a good one.

649
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,600
What did you think?

650
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,140
Oh, yeah.

651
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,300
I thought you were going to say you were going to sayandi.

652
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:50,300


653
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:50,300


654
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:50,300


655
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:50,300


656
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:51,900
That's what this hack.

657
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,940
Oh, uso Who's understood.

658
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,420
It is very famous for Facebook.

659
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:53,420


660
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,120
Video game What works in walking

661
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,400
you can'

662
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,620
If you're an activist who doesn't care about your relationships, don't.

663
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:58,620


664
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:58,620


665
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,220
Oh, condensed, condensed.

666
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,300
Okay?

667
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:02,500
Sorry.

668
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:02,500


669
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,480
I actually don't meet these people on stage for the first time.

670
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,440
We talked beforehand.

671
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,600
And I know you don't want to see how the sausage is made,

672
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,580
but I feel like we do want to be transparent here.

673
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,280
They do with me.

674
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,780
Oh, oh, oh, I see.

675
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,120
So let's get into the sausage a little bit, okay?

676
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,040
So you're part of the adult film industry.

677
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,120
Yes, yes, I am.

678
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,860
So how did you first get into that?

679
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,660
Are you a self-starter?

680
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,460
Were you approached?

681
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,260
How did you first get into it?

682
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,140
Huh.

683
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,500
Again, another thing you can't tell probably from the camera is that I'm trans.

684
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,200
Okay.

685
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,480
Very proudly so.

686
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,940
But, like, in my own personal headcanon,

687
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,720
I believe that at one point in time, earlier on in life,

688
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,840
I really, really wanted to be a porn star.

689
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,760
And somewhere a monkey's hand slowly closed.

690
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,820
And it transed my gender.

691
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,580
And, yeah, it's much easier to be a porn star when you're a girl.

692
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,260
So, yeah, things were made.

693
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,000
Things were made.

694
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,860
Things happened.

695
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,100
I approached the studio.

696
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,980
They said yes.

697
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,280
I don't know why, but they did say yes.

698
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,360
They saw something in you or something that they wanted to be in you.

699
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,000
Exactly.

700
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,940
And it just has been going on well ever since.

701
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,140
Like, the most put-together my life has ever been is when I became a porn star.

702
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:29,840
Oh, that's awesome.

703
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,160
It's great.

704
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,060
Yeah, it's great.

705
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,320
So, tell me a little bit about the day-to-day logistics of this.

706
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,600
Like, I'm always fascinated with, like, the minutia of jobs.

707
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,100
How do you schedule stuff?

708
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,280
Like, do you do it months in advance, weeks in advance?

709
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,560
Is it kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing from time to time?

710
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,500
It is a bit of a spur-of-the-moment thing.

711
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,860
However, you're doing well if you have two weeks of content prepared in advance.

712
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,760
For bigger studio shoots, you may have those planned months in advance.

713
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,380
Like, I had my...

714
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,720
August schedule planned in February.

715
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,120
Okay, well, alright.

716
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,260
That's pretty far in advance.

717
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,960
I'm going to be doing, like, eight shoots in the span of a week and a half.

718
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,380
I don't know how...

719
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,340
Sounds exhausting.

720
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:11,860
Oh, yes.

721
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,340
Do you just have to get, like, a flat of Powerade and, like, a bunch of cashews?

722
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,840
Like, how do you survive it?

723
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,760
Oh, that's cool things I can talk about.

724
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,540
The logistics of a porn girl's, like, packing.

725
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

726
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:27,980
Yeah.

727
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,780
Usually pack several things, several interchangeable outfits for lingerie.

728
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,340
Okay, sure, sure, sure.

729
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,660
Do you usually...

730
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,620
So, do you do mainly video or mainly photography or both?

731
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,040
Is that...

732
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,100
I do video, primarily.

733
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:55,260
However, there is usually photo shoots of about 150, 200 photos per scene.

734
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,640
Little thing behind.

735
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:03,340
Usually in porn, like, when you look at the photos, they aren't just stills of the video.

736
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,320
You actually restage those events, that timeline, in photos.

737
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,720
See, you get the storyboard, you go through it again.

738
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,480
Exactly.

739
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,280
Okay, okay.

740
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,820
So, you take the pictures and then you go through those actions and try and hit those same markers.

741
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:19,520
Interesting.

742
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,940
So, okay, here's kind of a weird question.

743
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:27,380
Are there any directors that are good at the photo part but total trash at the video or vice versa?

744
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:36,540
Yeah, however, I have been blessed with seeing multiple good, well-versed producers slash directors slash photographers.

745
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:44,460
Usually they start in camera photography, stills, and then they go on to do video.

746
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,380
That makes sense.

747
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,540
You get the static stuff down first and then you're able to do the dynamic stuff a little more easily.

748
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,060
And they usually have some...

749
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,820
Every producer usually has their own formula of how they like things to go.

750
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,520
Okay, sure.

751
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,740
And so they'll do the same things over and over.

752
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,380
And they kind of have a grindhouse style of production.

753
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

754
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:08,660
Well, yeah, because for a lot of porn production companies, they're putting out a load of scenes all the time.

755
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,960
I would imagine as a producer for that, you've got to get people in and out the door.

756
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:13,960
Oh, yeah.

757
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,620
It's that the typical porn scene, in my particular case, lasts about two hours.

758
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,900
Okay, all right, all right.

759
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,480
How much of that is downtime?

760
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,580
What is the longest out of stretch that you'll actually be filming?

761
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,040
Oh, yeah.

762
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,560
I think it's about a week.

763
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:30,560


764
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,780
So, usually I count it from when things start.

765
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,380
Okay.

766
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,080
Sometimes there is makeup and production, but usually when you get there, everyone's

767
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,420
already there and set up, and you're the diva late to the party.

768
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

769
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,980
I love being in that position personally.

770
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:50,580
As a host, I love bitching at my staff, you know, being like, eh, you got the wrong M&Ms.

771
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,260
You're probably a lot nicer to the people that you work with.

772
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,300
These are technically...

773
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,580
I don't pay them.

774
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,020
I don't have somebody.

775
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,940
It's a much less professional relationship.

776
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,960
Yeah.

777
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,560
Stranger.

778
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
I've got to watch this recorder here.

779
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:06,700
I just...

780
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,960
It went from two...

781
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,980
The battery was at two of four, and now it's at one of four.

782
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,520
One of four.

783
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,180
Yeah.

784
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,260
It'll either...

785
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,040
I don't know what that means.

786
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:20,980
One of four.

787
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,320
Well, it's like cell phone power, you know.

788
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,740
It's like, I'm only getting one bar.

789
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,500
Oh, my God.

790
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,940
I'm not getting any bars.

791
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,300
Yeah, I mean, you're...

792
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,180
This is a dry county.

793
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,420
There's no bars out here.

794
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,400
Is it really a dry county?

795
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,540
No.

796
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,120
No.

797
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,120
Where I am is...

798
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,840
Well, you can't get hard liquor except in...

799
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,860
You have to join a club for an hour to drink a hard liquor, and they don't sell it in stores

800
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,200
here.

801
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:54,180
They used to be dry until my family moved here, and my father, the lawyer, put an end

802
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,220
to that first thing.

803
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,920
Then he quit drinking.

804
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:56,920


805
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:56,920


806
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:56,920


807
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:56,920


808
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:56,920


809
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:56,920


810
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:56,920


811
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:56,920


812
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:56,920


813
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:56,920


814
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,640
Well, nice gift to the rest of the community.

815
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,720
He was a heavy drinker, and he moved out here, and he said, I'm gonna have to make this county

816
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,700
wet again, and he did.

817
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:16,760
And then a few years later, he kind of went, I don't think I better drink anymore ever

818
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,140
again.

819
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,240
And he was 45 when that happened, and he turned into a really nice guy.

820
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,560
Yeah.

821
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,520
Strange.

822
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:26,840
Yeah.

823
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:26,900


824
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:26,900


825
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:26,900


826
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,660
That's what happens.

827
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,060
Yeah, but his old drinking buddies thought he was...

828
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,960
It's like, what happened to Captain Stang?

829
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,680
He's not...

830
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,500
What happened?

831
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,140
Do you know why he quit?

832
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:45,000
And I said, I always guessed that maybe he woke up in a ditch with his car rolled over

833
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,320
on its side with somebody's bloody panties in his mouth, and he doesn't even know who's

834
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,740
they were and where they came from.

835
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,100
Yeah.

836
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
That's what I assumed.

837
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,240
That's what usually happens.

838
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:56,700
Yeah.

839
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,840
Why'd you quit drinking?

840
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,780
Because, well, why...

841
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,460
Because the same reason most people quit drinking.

842
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,100
Yeah, that was why I quit drinking.

843
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,980
But then it happened again, and it traumatized me so much, I started drinking again.

844
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,120
Yeah, you can't go 70 in a 35-mile-an-hour zone.

845
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,980
You just can't do that anymore.

846
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,760
I'll tell you what, though.

847
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:22,760
I have not operated a motor vehicle under the influence of anything in years and years.

848
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,100
Not even Polish cake?

849
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:31,160
Well, my riding mower, yeah, and the utility vehicle that my dad left me.

850
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,880
It's...

851
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,400
Well, it's a good...

852
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:42,520
Princess, we and I used to drive way out to the back 40 and work on...

853
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:42,840
Make love.

854
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,280
No, no.

855
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:52,280
We were actually cleaning out dinosaur tracks and making casts of them, and then when we

856
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,060
were finished, we'd celebrate by drinking two beers.

857
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,440
And then we'd drive back real crazy, wild, screaming.

858
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,080
But this is our own property, so, you know, and there's no...

859
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:09,380
We're not likely to run into anybody else except my drunken nephews and nieces driving

860
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,080
their utility vehicles all over, or their dirt bikes and stuff.

861
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,080
Well, you're allowed to be a yahoo on your own time.

862
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,760
Yeah.

863
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

864
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:23,740
Actually, somebody told me that in Texas it's illegal to drink and drive on your own property.

865
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,040
I don't know.

866
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,200
I mean, this is supposed to be a patriotic state where you can do anything you want except

867
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,760
to get a shot and wear a mask.

868
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,060
You better not do that, because, you know, the government has control over your body

869
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,520
for that.

870
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,460
Yeah.

871
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,540
And abortion.

872
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,120
You can't get an abortion and you can't get a shot, because what'll the neighbors think?

873
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:52,280
Oh, speaking of which, you know, the only person who comes here is a nurse for my mother-in-law,

874
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,340
my 92-year-old mother-in-law.

875
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,560
This nurse comes twice a week.

876
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:03,400
And she told me about two weeks ago, we went out to the Rangers game and sat in the stands

877
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:11,140
and just hollered and yelled, and I realized this woman in front of me, although she was

878
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:19,060
wearing a mask, was in a crowd of screaming rural Texans in the big city, packed together.

879
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,300
I bet she comes down with the COVIDs.

880
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
And she did.

881
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,020
She did.

882
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:30,100
She had to call in sick on Tuesday and say, I can't come in because I got a fever.

883
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,780
And it turned out she did indeed have COVID.

884
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,660
And I hope she can handle it at home, because we ain't got no beds left in this county or

885
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,700
the next county or the county after that.

886
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:46,580
They have to fly people to Oklahoma, because they're slightly less backwards there, believe

887
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,300
it or not.

888
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,760
I can't believe it.

889
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,420
It's shocking.

890
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,000
But they've legalized medical marijuana in Oklahoma and in Texas.

891
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,520
And Arkansas.

892
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,340
But not Texas.

893
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,300
Oh, hell no.

894
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,340
It's just what, that's just what the people want.

895
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,340
Like Governor Frankenfurter or whatever his name is.

896
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:06,740
Oh, God.

897
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,620
Oh, Jesus.

898
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,920
Seems to be quite an anal mess of garbage.

899
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,920
Oh, yeah.

900
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,180
Oh, yeah.

901
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:21,040
They, you know, the funny thing is they thought that the COVID was just going to kill ethnic

902
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,980
groups in big cities that traditionally vote Democrat.

903
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:24,980


904
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,560
And it did at first.

905
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:36,280
But now it's starting to hit the people who, I'm not going to wear a mask even if God King

906
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,320
Trump tells me to get a shot.

907
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,640
I'm not going to get that job.

908
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,040
King Trump.

909
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,480
And yeah, and they, and now they're dying like flies.

910
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:51,740
There's going to be a lot fewer, let's say, red state type voters soon.

911
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,960
So there is a silver lining.

912
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:54,960


913
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,340
There's a silver lining, you could, you could say.

914
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,080
Yeah.

915
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,600
And people are starting to say that too, I've noticed.

916
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,400
I think we talked about this.

917
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:02,960
Calling the silver lining.

918
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,280
I was wondering about the same thing about Sturgis.

919
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,680
If that turned out to be kind of a wonder.

920
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:06,960
Oh, yeah.

921
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,440
The Sturgis biker.

922
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,300
Biker rally.

923
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:09,580
Yeah.

924
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,000
I ain't afraid of no COVID.

925
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,180
I'm a tough guy.

926
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,660
I can't breathe.

927
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,120
I ain't going to get no shot.

928
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:21,740
What do you think?

929
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,220
I'm stupid.

930
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,240
Yeah.

931
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:24,940
I remember when I was in the military.

932
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:24,940


933
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:24,940


934
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:24,940


935
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:24,940


936
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:24,940


937
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:24,940


938
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:24,940


939
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,740
I remember one of them guys in the news, he said, why are you doing this?

940
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,900
He says, it's my freedom.

941
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:29,860
Right.

942
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,860
Well, that's, you know.

943
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:37,140
Well, it's my freedom to drive a car at 120 miles an hour with my headlights off at night.

944
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:37,340
Right.

945
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,120
That's my freedoms.

946
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,060
Yeah.

947
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,880
I don't need to obey red lights and stop signs.

948
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,500
That's, I'm not going to let my freedoms be abridged by a robot.

949
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:53,580
I actually heard, I actually heard one of my dad's cousins when I was about six years

950
00:41:53,580 --> 00:42:01,740
old, he, the concept of traffic lights had just been invented in this little South Carolina

951
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,280
town.

952
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,640
And this guy, this, this redneck cousin was saying, I'm not going to obey no robot.

953
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,360
That's just crazy.

954
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:16,200
So to him, it was an infringement on his rights to have to stop at an intersection and let

955
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,380
somebody else go through.

956
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,180
It was like, but I guess he, he must've gotten, oh no, he didn't get used to it.

957
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:22,820
Come to think of it.

958
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,040
He lives in Thailand or someplace now.

959
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,340
Oh really?

960
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,000
Yeah.

961
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,820
Well, he can't afford to live anywhere else.

962
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:36,280
I thought he took the rodent's cure, you know, and decided just to go and rat himself out

963
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,740
and live somewhere where they didn't have any kind of robot machines because I robot

964
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:48,740
says that you must never hurt another robot or maybe it's people or one or the other.

965
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,480
You're not allowed to harm them.

966
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,800
Unless of course you're doing something wrong.

967
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:52,800


968
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,860
You got the adequate equipment, like guns and firecrackers and stuff.

969
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:09,260
Uh, I, I had a job in Beijing, China in 1986 and, uh, they, they didn't have traffic lights

970
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,880
and most people were on foot or bicycles, but there were lots of cabs.

971
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,340
And of course I have no idea what it's like now, but these cabs wouldn't stop for anything.

972
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,680
In fact, we, a couple of times we hit.

973
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,620
We saved bicyclists lives because this guy was just going to run them over.

974
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,580
Cause cause he wants, cause he, they were in the way.

975
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,260
I mean, it was, it was, it was the weirdest thing.

976
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:44,200
I told him, I told that, that cab driver that I liked the music he had on and he just pulled

977
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,800
out the cassette and gave it to me.

978
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,260
Was it, were you just being factual or were you?

979
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,240
No, I was, I was serious.

980
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,960
I was stressing, I mean, I was lying down the road.

981
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,120
This guy was train sad, he was been walking the subway.

982
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,760
That was changed, was he had ties on his nose and a couple of times I haven't been able

983
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:04,840
to leave

984
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,160
Oh, yeah.

985
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,480
Reading the books.

986
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:09,480


987
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,360
Oh, I have more, not more doctors and I have no, I can't, I have its name on it, right?

988
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,180
Don't sell them.

989
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:14,180


990
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:14,180


991
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:14,200
Oh.

992
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:14,840
Okay.

993
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:14,920


994
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,760
Today's the day.

995
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:16,020


996
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:16,240
Oh my.

997
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:16,520
Oh my.

998
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,020
This morning, I had a conversation with him.

999
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,060
Uh, Yeah.

1000
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,540
And he hated it.

1001
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,460
He said, don't give me more American music.

1002
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,880
I hate it.

1003
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,480
I just don't like it.

1004
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,060
He liked Chinese opera.

1005
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,600
He was a sound man for Beijing Film Studios,

1006
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,400
and they filmed a lot of those operas.

1007
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:38,840
Yeah.

1008
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,140
And he really liked that stuff.

1009
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,620
To me, it was like subgenius doctor music.

1010
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,260
But their costumes were so bizarre,

1011
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,320
and the stories were insane.

1012
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:51,620
Insane.

1013
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,460
They're loaded with special effects.

1014
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,240
I saw one that took place underwater.

1015
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,060
It was merpeople singing Chinese opera.

1016
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,580
That's bizarre right there.

1017
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,100
That's like people singing Demosera, you know?

1018
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,040
I suppose I've got the wrong religion, but...

1019
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,380
I think Reverend Kosmak is dead.

1020
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,500
He's just floating face down in the pool.

1021
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,180
There's no way he can be breathing.

1022
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,540
I think he just went over there and died.

1023
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,100
Sure he's not snorkeling there?

1024
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,300
Yeah.

1025
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,000
Oh, no, he's alive.

1026
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:22,440
Okay.

1027
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,700
He came up for air.

1028
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,640
He spouted a minute ago.

1029
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,960
There was a little hole in his back.

1030
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,540
I saw some water squirt out.

1031
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,640
It's weird.

1032
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,740
The Martians also created giant insects

1033
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:37,360
to vex the Earth people during the attack period.

1034
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,020
Something which was supposed to go into the movie,

1035
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,920
but was cut out.

1036
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,700
Now that's every TV show.

1037
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,300
Tragic superheroes, out-of-control giant monsters.

1038
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,140
Practically gotten boring.

1039
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,300
Just what the public...

1040
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,740
I got to the point where if I see another werewolf face transformation,

1041
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,680
I'm gonna scream.

1042
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,620
And I used to live for those.

1043
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,460
But you only saw a good one every year or so,

1044
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,740
and then it got to where they were on every TV show.

1045
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:05,840
Oh, my God.

1046
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,040
We'll morph from this face without makeup

1047
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,300
to a face with a mask on.

1048
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,520
What a special effect.

1049
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,320
It's a lot better than a bunch of dissolves of Lon Chaney.

1050
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:15,840
Really?

1051
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,080
I thought those were somewhat artfully done.

1052
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:18,880
Some.

1053
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,780
It blurs a little bit.

1054
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,300
A kid could do that.

1055
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,040
You could see through it.

1056
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,720
Well, you know it's an effect,

1057
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,780
but you know also what it represents.

1058
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,480
And the music is portentous,

1059
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,260
and it comes after a period of dread,

1060
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,080
and then the first beam of moonlight.

1061
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,020
The difference is it was rare then,

1062
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:35,840
and now it's just...

1063
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:35,860
Yeah, it was hard.

1064
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,540
It was hard to do.

1065
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:36,820
It took a lot of time.

1066
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,480
Yeah, it was hard to do,

1067
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,380
and now it's just CGI.

1068
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,840
Yeah, you do it in your phone.

1069
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,340
That's one of the tricks of the conspiracy,

1070
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,820
that they'll take anything that's fun,

1071
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,640
and they'll just beat it to death until you hate it.

1072
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,020
Yeah.

1073
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,080
Like the hippies.

1074
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,800
For a while there, it was kind of cool.

1075
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,920
And then, well, you like hippies?

1076
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,060
We'll give you hippies.

1077
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,120
Yeah, punks.

1078
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:53,720
Same thing.

1079
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,960
I had to warn the punks

1080
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,220
that that was going to happen to them.

1081
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,020
They didn't believe me.

1082
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,080
You're just a oppressor now.

1083
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,820
It's like, no, you'll see.

1084
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,820
All your fashions and your music

1085
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,180
will be used in beer commercials

1086
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,340
in about two years.

1087
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,640
Sure enough, that's it.

1088
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:08,860
BLM, when that first came out.

1089
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,920
Then they had to come up with something

1090
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,080
even worse than punk.

1091
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,320
This is showing the man,

1092
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,540
and now they're painting intersections

1093
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,960
in every major city.

1094
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,940
Yeah, it's like every little fad

1095
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,060
that the teenagers think

1096
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,280
is going to change the world.

1097
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,140
Just turns out to have been a fad.

1098
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:23,500
Yeah.

1099
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,100
Damn it.

1100
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,840
I like the hippie one.

1101
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,440
That's why I've still got my ponytail

1102
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,060
and everything.

1103
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,140
I almost got kicked out of school

1104
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,020
for having hair about as long as yours.

1105
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,320
And ever since then,

1106
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,700
I was like, by God,

1107
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,740
when I get old,

1108
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,700
I'm going to have a haircut

1109
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,780
just like I wanted to when I was 17

1110
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,900
and look like the bass player

1111
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,920
for Quicksilver Messenger Service.

1112
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,120
And sure enough,

1113
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,240
my dream came true.

1114
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,280
I have,

1115
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,480
and wouldn't you know it,

1116
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,300
every other old redneck in Texas

1117
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,940
looks exactly the same way.

1118
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,920
Every old guy that retires,

1119
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,260
they grow their hair long

1120
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,780
and end up with a ponytail.

1121
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,880
I used to hide the ponytail

1122
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,820
in Texas because I might be carrying

1123
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,360
something they'd mistake for contraband.

1124
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,100
But I'd hide it in my hat,

1125
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,760
and then I gradually realized

1126
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,060
every old bastard around here

1127
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,060
looks just like me.

1128
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,440
Who needs to bother to go into a town

1129
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,100
for a God darn day?

1130
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,080
I don't know.

1131
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,080
I'm just a little bit of a

1132
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:41,020
pink boy and chop off his tail.

1133
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,360
That would be the,

1134
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,380
don't tell your wife that.

1135
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:43,740
No.

1136
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,300
Yeah, the Monster Hunter movie

1137
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,400
got censored in China

1138
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,860
because there was a joke about

1139
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,300
Chinese,

1140
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,280
Chinese,

1141
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:51,280


1142
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:51,700
Chinese.

1143
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,720
Now, in context,

1144
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,600
I'm sure they could get along without it.

1145
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,120
It actually was sort of fitting

1146
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,560
because there was these two guys

1147
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,140
that told bad jokes to each other.

1148
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,720
And one of them was a Chinese-American

1149
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,900
and he said something about,

1150
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:06,360
you know,

1151
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,080
they're Chinese,

1152
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:07,800
ha ha ha.

1153
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,880
It was a bad joke.

1154
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,660
And in China,

1155
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,840
they wouldn't release the movie

1156
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,800
because it translated all wrong

1157
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,460
into some sort of racist thing,

1158
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,860
which it wasn't at all.

1159
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,560
But there you go.

1160
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,280
They couldn't.

1161
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:21,980
They couldn't edit it out,

1162
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,640
that one joke.

1163
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:23,180
They did.

1164
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,400
They did edit it out,

1165
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,560
but by then,

1166
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,160
public opinion was so riled up.

1167
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,540
This is that movie

1168
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,520
that hates the Chinese.

1169
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,160
Right.

1170
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:31,720
Yeah.

1171
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,160
Yay, verily, yay.

1172
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,820
It's accurate to the game

1173
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,480
in that it takes forever

1174
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,940
to kill one of those big monsters.

1175
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:40,860
So therefore,

1176
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,760
they could only have

1177
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,880
two boss fights in the movie.

1178
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,840
There was only time

1179
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,840
for two boss fights.

1180
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:46,340
I suppose humans...

1181
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,700
Because it was true to the game.

1182
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,120
Humans are as mosquitoes

1183
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,440
to those lumbering,

1184
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,280
lumbering,

1185
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:51,920
giant monsters.

1186
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,280
So it takes a lot of them

1187
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,700
to put one down.

1188
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,300
A lot of my fellow

1189
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,820
monster hunter player

1190
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,680
fanatic addicts

1191
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,140
refused to even see the movie

1192
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,200
because they mixed in

1193
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,640
modern times with it.

1194
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,400
It's a modern soldier team

1195
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,500
ends up in monster hunter world.

1196
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:09,980
It's not pure.

1197
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,280
Their weapons are useless

1198
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,520
against the monsters, of course.

1199
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,580
Only an experienced monster hunter

1200
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,260
knows how to make the bow

1201
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,760
that shoots the special poison

1202
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,200
made from other monster parts.

1203
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,460
It would be hard for me to believe

1204
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,100
that modern,

1205
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:21,760
modern artillery

1206
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,540
couldn't put away any monster.

1207
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,480
Oh, you haven't seen,

1208
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,520
you haven't seen

1209
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,100
a Rathalos in action, Tal.

1210
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,140
They're faster than you can imagine.

1211
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,140
Anyway, they, it's,

1212
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,180
it was, it was really fun for me.

1213
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,480
I was supposed to go to Rathalos

1214
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,080
when I graduated high school.

1215
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,980
You've got to be scared of anything

1216
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,940
violating the laws of physics.

1217
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:40,560
Well, sure.

1218
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,640
All giant monsters do that.

1219
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,080
Yes.

1220
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,860
Well, we were watching

1221
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,180
the Warcraft movie yesterday.

1222
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,420
And I thought,

1223
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,780
well, they basically took the,

1224
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,720
the game and turned it into a movie.

1225
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,880
Did you see that one?

1226
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,440
I started watching it.

1227
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,700
I never saw the whole thing.

1228
00:50:59,020 --> 00:50:59,740
It did have a lot.

1229
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,360
There's something kind of corny about it.

1230
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,920
I like the CG.

1231
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,160
Okay.

1232
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,780
Yeah, it does have that

1233
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,520
trying to look very much like

1234
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,420
Lord of the Rings look.

1235
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,260
Is it in a sort of

1236
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,500
quasi-medieval period or something?

1237
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:13,980


1238
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:14,680
Oh, really?

1239
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,680
They had the elves,

1240
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,620
but see, the elves here

1241
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,860
have eyes that glow.

1242
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,660
That must be off-putting.

1243
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,300
So I think they mixed in Dune with...

1244
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,300
The smiles that win,

1245
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,400
the looks that glow.

1246
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,040
You know, the old,

1247
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,220
the old monster fans on Facebook

1248
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:31,980
detest CG.

1249
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,100
All you got to do

1250
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,440
to give those guys heart attacks

1251
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,460
is say, oh, I thought

1252
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,460
Peter Jackson's Kong

1253
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,680
was much more realistic

1254
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,620
than the original.

1255
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,660
Oh, my God.

1256
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,040
The next day I felt like

1257
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,980
I'd mugged a room full of old men.

1258
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,220
Yeah, they got upset,

1259
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,940
but they,

1260
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,560
they're very partisan to the...

1261
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,940
The other thing you can do

1262
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,240
to really shake them up

1263
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,080
is say, well, you know,

1264
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:56,780
Lon Chaney Jr.

1265
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,300
is actually a terrible actor.

1266
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,420
Oh, fuck.

1267
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,840
They'll just go on and on

1268
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,280
about how those guys were so much,

1269
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,140
he was so much better

1270
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,220
than these modern-day actors.

1271
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,820
I'm not sure he was so bad.

1272
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,760
A son of Dracula,

1273
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,120
he's pretty good.

1274
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:09,540
Oh, God.

1275
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,340
He was better than Lon Chaney Sr.

1276
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,820
I wouldn't say that.

1277
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,400
Lon Chaney III,

1278
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,200
who actually goes to conventions,

1279
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:17,780
you know,

1280
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,720
just to come and count his name.

1281
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:19,980
Well, that's amazing.

1282
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:20,820
I hope he comes here.

1283
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,180
Lon Chaney Sr.

1284
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:25,780
didn't have to talk,

1285
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,040
and he invented all those makeup tricks.

1286
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,260
Well, Lon Chaney Jr.

1287
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,160
tried to do the makeup tricks,

1288
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,280
but they wouldn't let him

1289
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,600
because by then the unions

1290
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,920
were so strong

1291
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,780
that he couldn't trespass

1292
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,860
on the makeup people's union.

1293
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,200
He made his own makeup

1294
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,140
for 1 million B.C.,

1295
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:43,780
which was better

1296
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,600
than what he ended up with,

1297
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,520
and he did that,

1298
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,820
and he did that compound fracture thing

1299
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,580
with the bones sticking out.

1300
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,540
But...

1301
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:53,140
Unions.

1302
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,100
They screw everything up.

1303
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,020
My favorite...

1304
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,280
Unless you need to be involved.

1305
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,640
Lon Chaney Jr. werewolf transformation

1306
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,300
is in House of Dracula,

1307
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,340
where he shows up at the police station

1308
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:03,720
and says,

1309
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,500
I'm going to go through another one of these werewolf things,

1310
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,480
and I can't stand it.

1311
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,720
Just lock me up in this cell,

1312
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,900
and don't let me out to whatever I do.

1313
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:17,500
So the inevitable Lionel Atwell police inspector calls in the...

1314
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:17,500


1315
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:17,500


1316
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,440
the local mad scientist,

1317
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:19,920
and he says,

1318
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:20,640
well, my boy,

1319
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,080
you may think you turn into a beast,

1320
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,060
but this is caused by intracranial pressures,

1321
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,460
and I think in my clinic I might be able...

1322
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,120
You don't understand.

1323
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,320
I'm about to go through the torches of the dam.

1324
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,380
Well, you may think you will,

1325
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,900
and in our minds we often have strange pictures.

1326
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,340
And then right in front of them,

1327
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,360
he turns into the werewolf with that...

1328
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,220
Is that House of Dracula?

1329
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,140
Yes, yes, yes.

1330
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,620
The hair grows on his face,

1331
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,820
his teeth start working,

1332
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,820
his nose starts...

1333
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,180
And then he's hurling himself at the bar,

1334
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,200
gnashing, you know,

1335
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,060
trying to get at the guy who was just saying it.

1336
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,960
It was all an unfortunate delusion, my boy,

1337
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,920
which I can cure in my clinic.

1338
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,160
But the funny thing is,

1339
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,040
at the end of the movie,

1340
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,060
he did cure him.

1341
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,200
But he himself turned into a monster.

1342
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,060
You say it's funny.

1343
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:03,900
I thought it was horrible.

1344
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,460
We got no more sequels after that.

1345
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,600
Oh, no, there were,

1346
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,400
because it reasserted itself.

1347
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,360
He cured him,

1348
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,360
but then it came back,

1349
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:14,040
so that in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,

1350
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,140
which is next to...

1351
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:15,640
Yeah, but I mean...

1352
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,660
He's on the phone,

1353
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,120
trying to warn them about the monster conspiracy,

1354
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,680
which is another thing.

1355
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,380
He never realized he was on the monster side.

1356
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,800
He counts himself on the human side,

1357
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,920
Larry Talbot,

1358
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,640
but he actually belongs over there

1359
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,040
on the other side with the monsters.

1360
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,320
He's trying to stop their plan

1361
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,320
and stop Dracula from reactivating

1362
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,880
the Frankenstein monster.

1363
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,000
He's a good monster.

1364
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,060
Well, he's not...

1365
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,420
When he's not transformed, yeah.

1366
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,620
He won't accept his werewolf identity in any way.

1367
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,160
Well, it was fantastic in any way.

1368
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:47,320
Michael BAMAGNY

1369
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,320


1370
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,560
B مش natur

1371
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,580
Well done...

1372
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,900
McFadden

1373
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:52,920
APPLAUSE

1374
00:54:52,920 --> 00:55:01,160
Richardav Zimmerman

1375
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:01,480
Just somewhere in there...

1376
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:16,160
It was an excellent performance.

1377
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,960
Now, when you say thrillers, do you mean thrillers as in the thriller TV show by Boris Karloff?

1378
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,120
Because I don't know if you've seen him there.

1379
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,900
I believe he was in a couple of those.

1380
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,800
I mentioned Lon Chaney Jr. being a bad actor.

1381
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,280
Was a Frankenstein.

1382
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,520
Ten minutes later, we're still on Lon Chaney Jr.

1383
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:40,060
Well, I feel sorry knocking anybody down to tell the truth.

1384
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:45,780
And the reason these people are prominent and we talk about them is that they have got something.

1385
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,280
And maybe it's a subgenius something.

1386
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:52,600
Maybe it's a talent that is not expressed as people understand it.

1387
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,380
It seems certainly to stand for a number of things.

1388
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,080
I'm sure we all have a problem.

1389
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,780
Stegg doesn't like it because this is all parts he has to edit out.

1390
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,080
But that's what we talked for so long.

1391
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,980
I'll be silent until someone introduces a new subject.

1392
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,220
Well, there's an hour of slack.

1393
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:16,540
I collected together all of the doctor's explanations from House of Dracula,

1394
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:20,440
where he goes on and on about how, well, I've got this new fungus I'm growing.

1395
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,260
Yeah, he's growing funguses underneath the castle.

1396
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,300
Little does he know that the body of the Frankenstein monster is also down there.

1397
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,360
It's all very scientific.

1398
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:30,920
Yeah, it's quite scientific.

1399
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,400
Yeah, those were the lines I liked from that movie.

1400
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,240
Well, don't forget the gorgeous hunchback girl.

1401
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,940
They combined two monster types.

1402
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:40,040
Oh, yeah.

1403
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,800
The gorgeous girl nurse and the hunchback into one.

1404
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,620
She gave me mixed feelings as a child.

1405
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,640
Yes, she's supposed to.

1406
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,800
Yeah, that hunchback.

1407
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,220
Especially when she's attacked in the end by Dr. Edelman.

1408
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:57,180
Now, Hal, you would know, did Lone Chaney do all of his stunts as the Wolfman?

1409
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:02,100
Not only did he do all of his stunts, but sometimes he put on the Frankenstein makeup

1410
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,680
and did stunts for other people in Frankenstein movies,

1411
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:09,360
particularly Bela Lugosi in Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman,

1412
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:09,960
but also...

1413
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,200
I think he did it in Frankenstein.

1414
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:18,280
He did it in Frankenstein, where Hugo, the hunchback, is thrown through the glass window

1415
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,180
by the monster.

1416
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,220
That was actually Chaney Jr.

1417
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,280
I can remember some scenes in which he was extremely athletic.

1418
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,240
He was a great big guy.

1419
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:32,820
He's this huge, lumbering doofus, which is why he's incredibly improbable as Claude

1420
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,520
Rayne's son in the original Wolfman.

1421
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,140
Well, you never knew who Claude Rayne's wife was, so...

1422
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:38,360
Yeah.

1423
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,320
Big break, though.

1424
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:45,160
Evelyn Ankers said that she was scared during some of those Mummy movies,

1425
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:49,980
because as the Mummy, Lone Chaney Jr. didn't have to act, really.

1426
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,920
You couldn't really see his face behind the makeup, and he would get drunk.

1427
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,980
He would sip vodka through a straw.

1428
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,520
Yes, he had an alcohol problem.

1429
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:02,020
And then he had to carry this actress along these trails.

1430
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,220
He was strong enough.

1431
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:03,940
He could do it.

1432
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,520
Yeah, but she was terrified.

1433
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,500
She was really pretty.

1434
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,360
Because he was drunk.

1435
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:07,800
He was drunk.

1436
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,160
He was drunk.

1437
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:09,300
He was drunk.

1438
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,300


1439
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,300


1440
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,300


1441
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,300


1442
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,300


1443
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,300


1444
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,300


1445
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,300


1446
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,300


1447
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,300


1448
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,300


1449
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,300


1450
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,760
He was going to drop her off this ledge.

1451
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,060
Very pretty woman.

1452
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:12,760
I always thought it was manna leaves.

1453
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,460
Beautiful actress.

1454
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,300
Tanna leaves.

1455
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,180
The tanna leaves.

1456
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,520
That was all Bill and Bunk.

1457
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,020
That wasn't in the original movie.

1458
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,940
That was in all the sequels, that he had to have tanna leaf tea.

1459
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,220
All right.

1460
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:30,940
Although it was something in the Tom Tyler one, whatever that one was, where they spill

1461
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:35,800
the tea, and the mummy frantically gets down on his hands and knees trying to lap it up

1462
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,520
with no tongue.

1463
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,280
You know, to get even a few molecules of tannin.

1464
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,740
Yeah, the slurpee.

1465
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,660
The great slurpee.

1466
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:45,800
That would be a great product to make though, tanna leaf tea.

1467
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:46,860
I think that would really sell.

1468
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:52,720
They did a good thing for the, whatever the mummy movie is that Tom Tyler plays the mummy,

1469
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:56,560
where they just optically blanked out his eye sockets.

1470
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:00,840
So they have a traveling mat on his eyes so there's nothing.

1471
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,940
You know, you're looking at his eye holes, but there's nothing in there whenever you

1472
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:06,480
see him.

1473
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,200
Yeah, I hate when that happens to me.

1474
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,280
Well, it's...

1475
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,780
You chose to...

1476
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,600
Those traveling mats really irritate your eye.

1477
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,980
They sort of sparkle around the edges.

1478
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,260
Being a supernatural phenomenon.
