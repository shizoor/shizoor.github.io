1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,420
We interrupt this program to activate the emergency

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,380
Subgenius Power of Spark

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,320
It's just recording on the air

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,120
Open air, ambiently

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,580
Okay

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,240
It takes a long time to load

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,020
Because it's got like

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,920
Everything's going fine

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,040
23 hours worth of recording time on this one

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,160
Hour after hour

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,800
Subsumed to electronic forms

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,260
I didn't want to worry about changing the disc

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,180
So I got one of those 32 gig cards

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,400
Well, we don't know what day it is

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,380
Or where we are

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,520
But we do know it's another hour of slack

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,600
Only this time it's going to have

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Ask Dr. Hal in it

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,000
That's supposed to happen

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,260
And the Bulldada auction following that

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,780
Both of those things are problematical

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,140
They may occur

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,600
Or greater forces surrounding us on all sides

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,960
May prevent them from occurring as planned

25
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,740
The weather is changing

26
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,500
It looks like Wotan may have some surprises for us

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,400
So are we still doing show up here?

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:14,920
Yeah

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,080
We are because he flipped it

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,260
We just started a new show

31
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,800
We're into the next hour

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,720
I get it

33
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,080
There we go

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,220
Subgenius Radio Ministry

35
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,760
Hour of Spark

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,340
Broadcast once again

37
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,320
From Caffeina's Cosmic Cafe

38
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,400
Lovely Wisteria community

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,000
In Ohio's outback

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,340
Meigs County

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,420
Home of Meigs County Green

42
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,540
A beautiful place

43
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,760
With many beautiful things in it

44
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,480
Oh brave new world

45
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,360
That has such goodly creatures in it

46
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,440
But I need to

47
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,400
You need to

48
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,760
I need to

49
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,100
I need to prepare the Ask Dr. Howell sheets

50
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,020
The special questionnaire sheets

51
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,800
You have to slit some sheets I understand

52
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,260
Yeah

53
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,840
We can take a small break

54
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,900
Take a break while Stang slits sheets

55
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,900
Well

56
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,260
Yeah actually

57
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,960
You could slit them

58
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,640
I'm going to leave this thing on

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,340
And go do other things

60
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,760
Well Stang will be back ladies and gentlemen

61
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,100
Here's the science book

62
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,980
Oh alright

63
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,740
Now that we've got it

64
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,280
We've got science

65
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,800
We're absolutely on target

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,180
In the deep discovery of the subterranean world

67
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,500
A shallow part would satisfy some inquirers

68
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,260
Who if two or three yards were digged up about the surface

69
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,640
Would not be content to rake the bowels of Potosi

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,080
And regions toward the center

71
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,220
Nature hath furnished one part of the earth

72
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,620
And man another

73
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,520
The treasures of time lie high

74
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,720
In urns of time and earth's depths

75
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:57,720


76
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,560
And the

77
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,080
The treasures of time and earth's depths

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,760
And the treasures of time and earth's depths

79
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:14,780
And otherwise prepare

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,200
Separate

81
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,060
What about separate Dr. Howell?

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,260
The question sheets for the Ask Dr. Howell show

83
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,020
Absolutely essential for the performance of this show

84
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,260
And now Stang is resorting to his caveman tools

85
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,520
And now Stang is resorting to his caveman tools

86
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,420
Of fingernails

87
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,860
And sweaty brute strength

88
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,940
To rip through phone book sized swats of paint

89
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,860
If you fold it in half a lot of times

90
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,580
Well you could fold it

91
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,820
Yes you could make it easy

92
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,060
But what about the challenge?

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,740
Let it be a challenge

94
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,280
I'll tear that phone book in half Dr. Howell

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,040
It's happening

96
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,520
It's happening right now

97
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,760
And I think a pair of scissors may be making its way here

98
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,620
Right now

99
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,820
Stang behold scissors

100
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,760
Scissors

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,240
And more than scissors

102
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,380
It's Reverend Joadu

103
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,880
And so with these still damp scissors

104
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,640
The pieces are being partitioned

105
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,760
And soon we will be ship shape and squared away

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,640
To do the Ask Dr. Howell show

107
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
Yes it does happen

108
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,960
You see there is an answer

109
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,980
Sometimes all you need to do is ask the question

110
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,220
But if you're mumbling and silent

111
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,440
Fidgeting and fumbling

112
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,380
Then you'll never get anywhere

113
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,900
Yes sir you've got to speak right up

114
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,260
Like Dr. Drummond

115
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,400
Yes sir you've got to speak right up

116
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,560
When he wants something he doesn't keep it to himself

117
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,860
No I just butt right in

118
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,900
That's right

119
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,920
Talk over people

120
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,760
I don't know if we want to tell that story

121
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,620
Like when you challenged your inner authoritative white man

122
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,600
And got out of paying thousands of dollars of damage

123
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,720
For a damaged RV

124
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,200
That was a magnificent performance

125
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,120
Well sometimes a little indignation does go a long way

126
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,860
Maybe we don't want to talk about that one

127
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,620
But these are genuine powers

128
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,400
These are real powers

129
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,040
These are powers

130
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,020
They actually work

131
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,660
They actually preserve you from harm

132
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,500
And more than that

133
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,880
They advance you

134
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,720
Into upper realms that few others

135
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,940
Can actually dream of

136
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,420
Well they had harshed my mellow

137
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,560
And I had to make them pay

138
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,180
Yes you had to get back your slack

139
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,960
That they were trying to filch away

140
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,060
In their way

141
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,320
Of course they could have positioned it a different way

142
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,040
That I'd abused their vehicle

143
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,740
They didn't have time

144
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,560
Because you rolled over them

145
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,860
In a storm of righteousness

146
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,920
That's right

147
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,380
I couldn't do it

148
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,420
They would tell by my cringing demeanor

149
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,840
That I was guilty

150
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,440
Guilty, guilty

151
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,520
But I wasn't guilty

152
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,780
Because I did have righteousness on my side

153
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,560
You had righteousness

154
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,220
But you hadn't bought any insurance

155
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,100
For the vehicle

156
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,440
Which was heavily damaged

157
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,020
By Michael Pepe and other roisterers

158
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,220
Yeah Michael Pepe

159
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,200
Yes

160
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,900
Not the kind of

161
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,440
Michael Pepe who

162
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,240
Put away your glassware

163
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,740
He just put his hand on the screen

164
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,260
And the handle would come off in his hand

165
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,260
It just broke

166
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,400
He broke the mirror in the bathroom

167
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,760
Then he'd go into the bathroom

168
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,360
And you'd hear a shower of glass

169
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,680
From the bathroom mirror suddenly breaking

170
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,940
And falling into the sink

171
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,700
Well Philo ground his teeth in anger

172
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,240
And so the RV was degraded

173
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,080
Over a series of intervals

174
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,800
Remember when I chewed him out like a small child

175
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,540
Yes he hung his head like a small dog

176
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,280
I shamed him

177
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,380
I felt so bad

178
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,660
It also didn't help that you threw the raw timber

179
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,460
Of the boards used to support the giant screen

180
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,360
For the drive-in theater outside into the van

181
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,560
And said we'll fasten them down when we get going

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,660
And so while the thing rolled along

183
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,880
These huge beams

184
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,820
Splintery beams crashed back and forth

185
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,660
Through the delicate plywood cabinets

186
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,720
And everything inside the RV

187
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,220
Then there was a little problem

188
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,040
With trying to drive over a concrete road divider

189
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,740
With the RV

190
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,920
It was hard on the undercarriage

191
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,140
Although a noble attempt

192
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,640
So that by the time Philo got there

193
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,060
This RV

194
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,000
Which he hadn't bought any insurance for

195
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,880
Because who needs to pay $50 extra

196
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,100
By the time he got it back to the rental place

197
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,520
He had some thinking to do

198
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,580
And man did he rise

199
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,060
Magnificently over it

200
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,540
By putting on his authoritative

201
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,100
Aggressive inner angry white man

202
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,440
And storm in there

203
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,640
Complaining about everything that was broken

204
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,700
About every dent

205
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,360
And atrocity that had done

206
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,660
And they were quieting him down

207
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,500
Saying we'll give you money off

208
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,180
We'll give you a discount

209
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,740
Next time

210
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,220
Please calm down sir

211
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,820
And they gradually mollified him

212
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,380
They got him to be more comfortable

213
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,940
I think they even gave me $100 on top of that

214
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,440
So there was slack for all

215
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,040
You see

216
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,420
Slack is the opposite of tension

217
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,360
Leisure

218
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,120
The basis of culture

219
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,220
Only after you can sit down

220
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,280
And invent the wheel

221
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,540
And discover how to generate fire

222
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,760
You can be a caveman who has slack

223
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,280
You see

224
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,780
Yeah

225
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,140
And you have to avoid that persistent

226
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,720
Unless your slack is chopping logs

227
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,620
Pursuing mammoth

228
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,480
For the fire

229
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,900
That chases you 20 days

230
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,280
But keeps you fit

231
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,940
While you grab some berries

232
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,420
And nearly inedible roots

233
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,860
Some crazy nuts would think

234
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,480
Chopping wood might be fun

235
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,620
Yes because it might

236
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,580
It might exercise the shoulders and back

237
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,720
And also make you more Lincoln-esque

238
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,620
So you could sweep into political office

239
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,080
Only in leisure

240
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,440
Look there's some children over there

241
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,600
Little tiny children

242
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,260
Proto-subgeniuses

243
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,840
The rising generation of subgeniuses

244
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,560
Raising them upright

245
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,700
Yes they seem to be small and feeble now

246
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,840
Eventually they'll be iron overlords

247
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,580
With their metal shoes on our necks

248
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,360
And we'll beg them to take our next breaths

249
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
So take care of those little kinder

250
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes

251
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,980
Only in leisure can you figure out

252
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,100
The next thing there is to do

253
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,440
All the pleasure saucers we have

254
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,980
Cars

255
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,160
Cars

256
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,400
That look like

257
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,900
You know

258
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,980
They would be hot inside

259
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,360
That's what we actually leave the kids in

260
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,900
They're like bumper cars

261
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,960
Yeah they get in there

262
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,060
They just bounce around like crazy

263
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,400
Like popcorn

264
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,240
Seething in a pan

265
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,400
We turn the air conditioner on in there

266
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,480
If they're good

267
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:14,960
Well

268
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,480
Or not

269
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,780
That's all part of the wonder world to come

270
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,300
On the pleasure saucers

271
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,020
Okay here they come

272
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,520
Oh we already have an

273
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,860
Ask Dr. Hal question slip

274
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,640
That is good

275
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,140
And that is part of the

276
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,300
But we're going to need

277
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,580
Ivan Stang back

278
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,820
To explain the rest of the gaffe

279
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,680
Yes we have the questions

280
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,300
And the slips

281
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,860
But there's a little bit more that we need

282
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,960
But it's funny

283
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,080
I'm not seeing Ivan Stang anywhere

284
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,700
He seems to have dropped off the face of the earth

285
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,400
What's going on Philo?

286
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,580
I think he did

287
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,420
I think he's gone

288
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,160
I think something happened to him

289
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,400
That is sad indeed

290
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,340
We're going to have to carry on

291
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,540
We're going to have to limp on

292
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,200
A crippled version of ourselves

293
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,960
Ourself

294
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,940
Coming in on a wing and a prayer

295
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,020
Though there's one motor gone

296
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,600
Still we must carry on

297
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,920
I know you're just being a little bit frivolous

298
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,700
But he could have actually hurt himself

299
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,440
You know

300
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,140
Put it over here

301
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,740
Thank you

302
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,980
He could have slipped and fallen

303
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,740
Yes

304
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,000
And he can't get up right now

305
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,300
Yes

306
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,100
Thank you

307
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,820
Is he on the ground over there?

308
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,740
Oh he was in the crap station

309
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,120
Don't turn in your slips yet ladies and gentlemen

310
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,360
Wait for Reverend Stang

311
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,920
He was dumping a load

312
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,120
He has more to tell you about these

313
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,840
Although it's fine

314
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,520
We have already received some

315
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,540
That shows that others are ready

316
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,320
For the juggernaut of Ask Dr. Howe

317
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,640
And here's Stang now

318
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,580
You need to tell them about the protocols

319
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,380
Of sending in these slips

320
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,260
Because they're not doing it quite right

321
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,920
Although they are doing it

322
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,520
Yes it's important

323
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,300
And well here's Ivan Stang

324
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,660
Well dear friends

325
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,140
Dr. Howe sees all

326
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,220
Knows all

327
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,020
Or at least can appear to

328
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,280
You will be convinced

329
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,080
Anything you can ask him

330
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,200
Will be answered

331
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,260
But for him to exercise

332
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,200
This kind of almost supernatural

333
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,440
Brain power

334
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,400
Takes a lot out of him

335
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,300
And is actually kind of expensive

336
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,700
So although we do not insist

337
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,000
On any gratuity by any means

338
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,260
It is traditional to

339
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,080
To include a tip

340
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,840
Give Hal a tip

341
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,000
Give Hal a tip

342
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,300
Otherwise how do we know

343
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,260
That you actually value your question

344
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,400
And it's not just some

345
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Bored snarky trope

346
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,260
If you put a little

347
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,180
Of the actual cash there

348
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,820
Then we know

349
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,900
You will try to make it a little better

350
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,300
You see it's for your benefit

351
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,320
More than ours

352
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,700
Focus is the important thing

353
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,600
You've got to focus on the locus

354
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,360
And get some traction in the action

355
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,600
Thank you, thank you very much

356
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,140
I will read the questions

357
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,500
Once we get some

358
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,000
To Dr. Howe

359
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,160
And then I will interpret them

360
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,100
In my usual fashion

361
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,520
And I'm going to be selling a cheat sheet

362
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,580
Right over there for $25

363
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,820
That has some questions that have been proven

364
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,280
To be impossible for Dr. Howe to answer

365
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,460
Dr. Drummond has been there before

366
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,220
He's even been a host of the Ask Dr. Howe show

367
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,680
When we've performed it in San Francisco

368
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,640
So uh

369
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,960
In a horrible venue I might add

370
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,980
One of the worst places we ever did that show

371
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,760
And yet Philo was a trooper

372
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,780
He was there

373
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,160
And he showed a 3D movie

374
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,440
Which wasn't in 3D

375
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,300
And we're going to try not to make fun

376
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,360
Of your handwriting

377
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,840
Your spelling

378
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,140
Much can be determined

379
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,180
From orthography

380
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,540
Is there a question that Dr. Howe can't answer?

381
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,580
That's the question

382
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,040
That's not it at all

383
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,740
Oh yeah, yeah, here

384
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,480
Right over here

385
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,180
There is, there's several questions he can't answer

386
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,760
So if you're into that thing

387
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,480
And stumping

388
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,460
I mean not

389
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,640
This really isn't stump, Dr. Howe

390
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,400
But if you're really into that thing

391
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,820
Then it can't be done for an additional price

392
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,480
Well friends, what you will receive from me in any case

393
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,200
I assure you is an answer

394
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,740
And the idea of an answer

395
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,080
Like the idea of a question

396
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,500
Is simply a structure which we impose

397
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,000
For our own convenience

398
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,340
Upon the otherwise

399
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,600
Impossible to understand

400
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,780
Visage of reality

401
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,040
Your concept of correctness doesn't really play

402
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,600
Into the

403
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,200
Abnormality

404
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,580
Into the

405
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:24,980
The

406
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,560
The

407
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:25,740
The

408
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,200
Anxiety

409
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,200


410
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,200


411
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,220
It

412
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:27,420
It

413
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,580
Operates

414
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,120
By the fact that often the question is right there

415
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,820
The answer is right there on the slip

416
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,740
Lurking inside the question

417
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,400
It's not difficult if you practice it properly

418
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,280
But we will perform a limited version of this silly-ass show

419
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,120
And then

420
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,320
The Bulldada Auction

421
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
Will have its first iteration

422
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,860
Here at the Church of the Subgenius' most famous festival

423
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,920
Ex Day

424
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,680
And here's our first question

425
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,000
already, but I didn't do that.

426
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,220
It's got a George Washington with it.

427
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,120
And the question, it has a drawing also,

428
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,320
which I'll show you in a second.

429
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,680
Sure.

430
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,660
Are you sure you don't want to tell them

431
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,600
the other facts about the show,

432
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,440
the other things that we need to know about?

433
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,600
Yeah, the other things.

434
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,900
We're already in the end of the question phase.

435
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,480
No, wait a minute.

436
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,920
You're the one who's supposed to answer the questions.

437
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,360
What are the other things?

438
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,620
Yeah, but you have to tell them

439
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,780
that a really good question gets this and that

440
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,300
and the other.

441
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,120
A really good question gets this.

442
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,460
A really good, no, I don't remember the rules exactly.

443
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:27,800
Okay, all right.

444
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,460
All right.

445
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,240
A really good question,

446
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,860
but we can't do it that way anyway.

447
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,660
We dispense shots of liquor for good questions,

448
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,360
but we don't.

449
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,240
We got some wild turkey right there.

450
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,060
No, that's too precious to burn up on such a trope.

451
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,080
But we give them horrible liquor.

452
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,480
We give them Fernet Branca, and we don't have any.

453
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,360
But then also we'll give you a Bardic recitation

454
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,340
if your donation is higher than usual.

455
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,840
And if there's something you'd like to add,

456
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,420
write on the back of your question slip

457
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,440
and bring it up here,

458
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,300
and it will be added to the Akashic recording.

459
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,900
It's what we call a side note.

460
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,620
And now I think that's all the preliminary codswallop

461
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,940
that we need to interject at this time.

462
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,680
Yes, in other words, you get what you pay for,

463
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,740
and the more you pay,

464
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,820
the more grandiose an answer you will get

465
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,500
and special rewards.

466
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,540
Even so.

467
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,220
And now please proceed, Stang,

468
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,180
because the hour,

469
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:23,820
grows late.

470
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,240
Question number one.

471
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,120
If nine out of ten dentists

472
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,400
recommend Brand X toothpaste,

473
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,200
what does that tenth dentist recommend?

474
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,920
And here's a drawing of a pipe-smoking molar.

475
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,040
Wow, look.

476
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,500
A pipe-smoking molar

477
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,060
with three roots,

478
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,380
making it one of the toughest

479
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,440
and largest of the adult wisdom teeth.

480
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,440
Yes, these three root molars

481
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,860
are...

482
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,460
They're not the only root molars.

483
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,000
They're the only root molars.

484
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,040
They're the only root molars.

485
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,160
They're the only root molars.

486
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,160


487
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,160


488
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,160


489
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,060
Now, let's review the question quickly.

490
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,760
If nine out of ten dentists

491
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,080
recommend Brand X toothpaste,

492
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,600
what does that tenth dentist recommend?

493
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,440
Look into the question

494
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,180
from a statistical basis.

495
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,360
Oh, thank you.

496
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,640
Nine out of ten dentists

497
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,860
are dishonest crooks,

498
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,800
like nine out of ten of any profession.

499
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,200
And they do not have your interest

500
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,320
at heart.

501
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,260
They have not taken

502
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,260
the Hippocratic Oath to their bosom,

503
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,420
but that tenth idiot has.

504
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,340
He's the one who will actually recommend

505
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,440
the good brand,

506
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,580
but these other so-called quizling

507
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,000
fellow traveler dentists

508
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,440
are recommending Brand X

509
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,680
because it does no good

510
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,440
and allows your teeth to become

511
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,380
an unsightly mass of rotting fissures

512
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,400
and craters and deep damage

513
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,580
below the gum line.

514
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,060
Yes, you want to find that tenth dentist,

515
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,300
and we wish you all the best.

516
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


517
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


518
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


519
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


520
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


521
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


522
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


523
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


524
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


525
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


526
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


527
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


528
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


529
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,300


530
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,240
We wish you luck in that enterprise.

531
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,500
Oh, my gosh.

532
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,660
It's raining.

533
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,780
The rain is falling all around.

534
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,040
It falls on field and tree.

535
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,580
I love the rain.

536
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,240
It falls on the umbrellas here

537
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,540
and on the ships at sea.

538
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,960
It's like footsteps

539
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,040
on the sidewalks of life.

540
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,780
It'll wash everything away.

541
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,420
This is nothing to the rain

542
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,560
that will come in a few days

543
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,300
that will scour the planet

544
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,360
clean as a cue ball.

545
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,380
My attention was captured

546
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,760
by the baby.

547
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,960
Yes.

548
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,060
It's a yeti baby.

549
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,660
A yeti youngling.

550
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
The Werdigan child.

551
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,560
Right.

552
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,480
Produced by a noted subgenius.

553
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,280
Yeah, and you know what?

554
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,800
She's the Antichrist.

555
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,220
Look how cute she is.

556
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,920
The cutest little Antichrist

557
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,240
I ever saw in my life.

558
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:47,960
Yes.

559
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,400
See, this infant is seeing a show

560
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,140
being performed for the first time.

561
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,180
To come as an angel of light.

562
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,240
Right.

563
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,020
Okay.

564
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,220
Time for question number two.

565
00:17:59,460 --> 00:17:59,920
Okay, okay.

566
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,960
Get the brat out of here.

567
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,240
Okay, we're done with the...

568
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,760
I'm gonna...

569
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,420
I'll kiss his...

570
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,360
I'll kiss his forehead later.

571
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:05,740
Yes.

572
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,320
White, actually.

573
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,720
Kiss him.

574
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,180
Yes.

575
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,260
Okay, here we go.

576
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,040
Okay, here's a $1 question.

577
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,020
Very good.

578
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,240
Why is Dr. Kleiner

579
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,580
always thinking about

580
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,840
sex and reproduction?

581
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,340
Well, uh...

582
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,240
Dr. Kleiner

583
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,540
is always thinking about

584
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,300
sex and reproduction.

585
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,000
Because the combine,

586
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,960
that group of humans

587
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,480
who go along with the alien invasion,

588
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,040
particularly Arch Administrator Dr. Breen,

589
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,960
are just fine with the dampening field

590
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,120
over City 17

591
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,200
that prevents the toiling human worker slaves

592
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,380
from fornicating.

593
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,440
But my character, Dr. Kleiner, says

594
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,580
we, the underground workers,

595
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,240
have suspended that field.

596
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,420
Get to fornicating at once.

597
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,080
Yes.

598
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,880
We don't know when

599
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,620
that field will be reestablished.

600
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,700
Although we think

601
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,420
we have turned the tide

602
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,320
and the dampening field

603
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,880
will not fall again.

604
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,660
Nonetheless,

605
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,840
it is time to turn our minds

606
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,960
to sex and reproduction.

607
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,100
And that is a summary

608
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,580
of my noted speech

609
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,460
to the citizens of City 17,

610
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,080
which has become part of a...

611
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,240
Yeah, it's a paraphrase

612
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,800
and it's shortened.

613
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,940
It's part of a movie

614
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,520
called Escape from City 17.

615
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,380
But it's good advice

616
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,700
to take at any time.

617
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,520
For ye never know

618
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,560
when the master cometh.

619
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,140
And when the master cometh,

620
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,040
you don't get to.

621
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,840
So let's pass along

622
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,960
to the next question.

623
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,580
This is another one dollar question.

624
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,520
That's fine.

625
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,660
U.S. dollar.

626
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,460
Good everywhere.

627
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,980
What are the circumstances

628
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,580
behind the first recorded case

629
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,940
of butthurt?

630
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,720
Well,

631
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,400
what are the circumstances

632
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,060
behind the first recorded case

633
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,060


634
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,060


635
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,000
of butthurt?

636
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,980
You have to go back

637
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,500
a long time ago

638
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,020
to the first generation

639
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,560
of human beings.

640
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,900
It would have to be

641
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,500
to be the first recorded case.

642
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,540
Now, you may have heard

643
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,920
a distorted version of this story.

644
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,360
But there were two brothers,

645
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,620
one known as Cain

646
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,760
and one known as Abel.

647
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,720
The elder of the two, Cain,

648
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,540
was actually more Abel

649
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,380
in his own way.

650
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,040
He was the elder of the two.

651
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,660
He was able to grow plants,

652
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
which means that

653
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
he was the first agriculturist.

654
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,960
And there came a time

655
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,500
when Cain and Abel

656
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,780
presented their sacrifices

657
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,300
to Jehovah One,

658
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,540
malign and senile space god,

659
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,360
even then.

660
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,840
Now, Abel, the fair-haired boy,

661
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,880
the younger brother,

662
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,880
put a bunch of smoking meat

663
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,040
and entrails

664
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,360
on the sacred altar.

665
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,780
While Cain spread

666
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,480
the fruits of the earth,

667
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,760
fruits and vegetables,

668
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,540
kale, gluten-free,

669
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,000
all that stuff on the altar.

670
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,060
Who do you think God chose?

671
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,120
The meat altar.

672
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,720
Because the scent of burning flesh

673
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,500
is of a sweet savor

674
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,080
unto the nostrils of the Lord.

675
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,080
And because,

676
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,380
if you know anything

677
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,460
about the supernatural,

678
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,780
ghosts like blood.

679
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,040
Because it makes them more human.

680
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,800
If you are,

681
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,820
are invoking a ghost,

682
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,320
you put a little bowl of blood there

683
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,340
and gradually you see

684
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,760
the level going down

685
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
and you know there's a ghost.

686
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,820
Well, God is the greatest

687
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,880
of all ghosts,

688
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,400
the arch spirit,

689
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,600
and needs a lot more blood,

690
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,520
which is plain

691
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,880
when you look at human history.

692
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,680
And so, Cain was miffed by this

693
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,140
and he slew his brother Abel,

694
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,980
conking him in the head

695
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,840
with a rock,

696
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,200
as it says in the book of Genesis.

697
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,120
To make up for this,

698
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,440
the Lord put a weird mark

699
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
on his face.

700
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,620
So, that wherever he moved

701
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,120
across the face of the earth,

702
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,860
people would recognize him

703
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,140
as anathema,

704
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,360
recognize him as

705
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,900
the first case of butthurt

706
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,400
on planet earth.

707
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,580
And Dr. Howell,

708
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,860
didn't he have his brother?

709
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,400
What about his brother, though?

710
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,460
I'm not hearing you

711
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,540
through your microphone,

712
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,780
but his brother was killed.

713
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,780
His brother Abel was killed.

714
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,480
Now, there are other examples

715
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,280
of butthurt in the Old Testament,

716
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,160
like Jacob and Esau,

717
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,820
all kinds of rip-offs.

718
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,660
Maybe you're thinking of that one.

719
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,320
Thank you, sir.

720
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,880
Here, we missed it, but...

721
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,900
Oh, there we go.

722
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,860
It's a string kind of thing.

723
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,060
Look at this.

724
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,440
Stang, things are looking up.

725
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,200
Well, we'll go to this one.

726
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,660
Didn't the Lord also like

727
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,720
this hot smell of burning flesh?

728
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,680
Always. The Lord loves the hot smell

729
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,420
of burning flesh.

730
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,020
This hot smell of burning flesh

731
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,940
will be at the final days,

732
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,140
according to the book of Revelation.

733
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,560
The armies of the plain of Megiddo

734
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,840
will be burned, and the Lord will

735
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,340
whiff the stench of their frying

736
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,060
and frizzling.

737
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,100
Kind of like the pinks frying

738
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,560
in their own juices.

739
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,760
Kind of, isn't it?

740
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,320
Oh, that leads us into this question.

741
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,880
Very well, let's have it.

742
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,000
Which we're going to immediately,

743
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,100
because of the size of the donation.

744
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,400
Which questions have any meaning...

745
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,160
No, what questions have any meaning

746
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,720
when X day is only a couple of days away?

747
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:21,960
Why?

748
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,420
So relevant at this time.

749
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,820
Did everybody hear that?

750
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,240
What questions have any meaning

751
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,160
when X day is only a couple of days away?

752
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,960
Beautiful hand printing job, by the way.

753
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,580
This is clearly a squared away subgenius

754
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,280
who asked this.

755
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,440
Well, if meaning is to be exterminated

756
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,740
when the saucers arrive,

757
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,780
not much is the answer to the question.

758
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,020
But what if the arrival of the saucers

759
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,260
will make everything that is now murky

760
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,340
and doubtful so easy to understand

761
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,320
we don't have to worry our poor,

762
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,460
bothered craniums about it anymore

763
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,040
and can devote ourselves to entirely

764
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,680
slackful pursuits?

765
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,180
Isn't that what's it about?

766
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,200
We're not going to mean, we're going to be.

767
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,900
Yes, meaning is only a tool

768
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,420
to help us stumble through life.

769
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,660
Every lowly animalcule, the, uh,

770
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,140
paramecium or slipper creature

771
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,640
understands irritation.

772
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,920
It understands the way to go forward.

773
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,600
Now, ethology teaches us that we are exactly

774
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,160
what we are because of environmental pressures.

775
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,080
We look like what we are because we must,

776
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,440
because this is the best way

777
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,540
we can survive in our environment.

778
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,700
That's why the philosophy that says,

779
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,140
oh, well, we'll never really understand

780
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,840
with our human senses what's going on,

781
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,440
that's, uh, wrong.

782
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,160
And it's been wrong ever since Plato

783
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,500
because our human senses evolved

784
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,520
to make sure that we understand

785
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,620
what means the most significantly to us.

786
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,040
But we will have new bodies

787
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,820
and new forms and new vistas of slackfulness

788
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,460
when the saucers come.

789
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,860
Why else are we here?

790
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,160
That's my question to you.

791
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,840
But I got a nice donation,

792
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,920
and so now here is the Bardic recitation,

793
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,560
a relatively short one,

794
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,760
by Walt Whitman.

795
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,000
A noiseless, patient spider

796
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,080
I marked where on a little promontory it stood,

797
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,240
marked where it shot out from itself

798
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,900
filament, filament, filament,

799
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,840
ceaselessly speeding them,

800
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,380
ceaselessly on the way.

801
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,560
Unreeling them.

802
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,420
And you, oh my soul,

803
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,900
where you stand,

804
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,400
surrounded by measureless oceans of space,

805
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,400
ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing,

806
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,820
seeking the spheres to connect them,

807
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,460
till the bridge you need be formed,

808
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,540
till the ductile anchor hold,

809
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,860
till the gossamer thread you fling

810
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,220
catch somewhere, oh my soul.

811
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,560
Thank you for your question.

812
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,820
Let's do the next one.

813
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,620
Arugaa!

814
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,800
There's another eye in the pyramid for you.

815
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,540
Very good.

816
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:33,600
Considering the number of rainbow confederate ISIS dildo sex toy flags loose on Facebook recently,

817
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,440
should I consider switching back to MySpace for my own safety?

818
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,280
Well, you heard that one.

819
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,200
Because of all these confederate goofballs,

820
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,400
these football flags that are put up in light of the recent controversies

821
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,280
about the old star and bars confederate battle flag,

822
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,100
and their liability to hurt a sensitive individual,

823
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,220
should that person creep back to the safety of MySpace

824
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,460
and avoid the rude blandishments of Facebook?

825
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:12,100
Well, whatever brings you slack is of course the easy and dime store answer to that one,

826
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,520
but let's go a little further.

827
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,480
MySpace can have only what you want to see there.

828
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:23,220
But are you sure that's the best for your own development?

829
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:30,760
Because everything that you don't like causes you to get in motion and do something about it.

830
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,160
If only stuff that you liked were there,

831
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,560
you wouldn't make that move to MySpace or whatever it is you do,

832
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,420
which might be better advised in reaction.

833
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,500
Yes, irritation is an important motivational force.

834
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:44,500


835
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:50,420
And even, as I said before, the lowest creatures in the hierarchy of life know it.

836
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,360
Embrace the value of these annoyances,

837
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,340
and then you will get to the slackful pinnacle wherefrom you can annoy others.

838
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,420
Very good, very good.

839
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,280
Here's one that I have to comment on myself.

840
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,920
Very good. That's your job.

841
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,480
Can you describe events leading up to the first day

842
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:20,540
of the first X-Day drill and the excommunication of Jesus Bevilacqua,

843
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,940
if that is really what happened?

844
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,100
Remember, I was there, and it is signed Rev. X.

845
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,800
Anyway, Jesus Bevilacqua is never excommunicated.

846
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,060
Yes, that's a misunderstanding.

847
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:43,760
The first X-Day drill would be the thing called the first X-Day drill in 1996.

848
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:51,040
But poor Jesus, you know, it was the actions of Evil Judge Punch,

849
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,520
the family New York judge that caused, made it a little uncomfortable

850
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:03,040
for the Bevilacqua family to continue to associate real closely with Satanist.

851
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,780
The infernal serpent.

852
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,980
Although we're still in touch.

853
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,980
He it was.

854
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,240
But.

855
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,700
Yeah, so, you see, Bevilacqua, Jesus,

856
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,440
was not excommunicated.

857
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:20,660
But there was a procession, a rite,

858
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,160
which caused much trouble when the conspiracy heard about it,

859
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,500
because it deeply offended them.

860
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,440
Particularly the use of a goat or a goat's head,

861
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,240
an important part of the ritual.

862
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,080
It was a mask.

863
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,400
A mask worn by the live, unclothed body of Sister Mary Magdalene.

864
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,600
I almost brought it.

865
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:49,800
But this judge who played golf with the defense lawyer on his off days

866
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:56,740
was not inspired to think the book of the subgenius was even funny.

867
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,560
He kept thumbing through it at the trial saying,

868
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,440
well, I don't see what's so funny about this.

869
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,760
And things didn't look good.

870
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,880
And much grief.

871
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,120
Totally scam proof.

872
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,720
Much grief was brought into their lives.

873
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,600
Much unnecessary human anguish.

874
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,080
Because this is how the conspiracy can misinterpret

875
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,900
our simple, humble platitudes and playfulness.

876
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,720
So, what really happened is joy.

877
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,160
And the pagan Dionysian spirit.

878
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,080
And then what happened after that is that Christian severity

879
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,560
came heavily down upon it.

880
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,720
The forces of reaction swung their iron mallet.

881
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,000
And so, it's not always easy to be a subgenius.

882
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,600
Sometimes you have to pay for it.

883
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:51,100
Sometimes being a subgenius out there in the conspiracy mental maze

884
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,160
is an additional level of difficulty.

885
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,600
What if you're by the side of the road having trouble with a car

886
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,260
or an auto accident or something.

887
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,060
Someone stops who might help you but then starts asking you,

888
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,660
well, what's that face there?

889
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,840
What's that all about?

890
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,600
And now when you want to talk about anything,

891
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,940
you have to talk about Bob and Slack and so on.

892
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,460
And usually they won't even help you after that.

893
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,300
So, forewarned is forearmed.

894
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,340
Jesus' wife Magdalene de Valaqua is the only person we know of

895
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:29,600
who is legally restrained from having subgenius publications in her house.

896
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,460
They have to keep them in the garage.

897
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,020
Right. They won't allow them in the house.

898
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,500
Thanks to the juridical system.

899
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,580
By the way, I saw the little boy.

900
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,900
We don't let them in our house either.

901
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:49,160
At Chris Lee's wedding to Magdalene's sister, as it turned out.

902
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,180
And Conbo.

903
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,220
Connor.

904
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,060
The subgenius name was Conbo.

905
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,380
Marjo was named after Mary and Joseph.

906
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,900
Conbo, the son of Jesus and Magdalene, was named after Connie and Bob.

907
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,400
So, anyway, Conbo, when I saw him a couple of years ago,

908
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,520
was a strapping 16-year-old boy.

909
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,380
He was with his buddy.

910
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:20,220
When he got to the wedding, he and the boy were surly and teenage.

911
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,820
And stayed in the back.

912
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,900
Like, you know, this is lame and stupid.

913
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,060
We had to go to this wedding.

914
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,100
By the end of it, they had gotten so into the spirit of things

915
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,620
that they were running around bringing people drinks

916
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:36,500
and just became a real big part of the party.

917
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,720
So, it just goes to show.

918
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,320
Teenagers are that way all over the place now, aren't they?

919
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,840
Well, when they get slack, they become advanced beings in a flash

920
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,040
while you're not even looking.

921
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,000
They were bound and determined to be sullen teenagers,

922
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,180
but the spirit of the subgenius wedding won them over.

923
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,680
Yes, the spirit of the subgenius wedding moved upon the waters.

924
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,240
And now we're ready for another question.

925
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,760
Here's a $1 question.

926
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,160
What is the best key for doctor band jams?

927
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,300
What is the best key for doctor band jams?

928
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,660
That's a good question.

929
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,900
Young people are strong these days.

930
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,820
That's so relevant in today's...

931
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,800
When they're musicians and they've got good strength, good circulation, and good lungs.

932
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,780
So they could, I suppose, consume a whole key.

933
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,980
But we usually consume about half a key when performing our music.

934
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,380
But youngsters, it doesn't seem to hurt them.

935
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,160
They can just absorb it.

936
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,260
And more power to them.

937
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,700
Of course, when that is used up, growers must grow more.

938
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,340
And the earth is rendered more fruitful and delightful.

939
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,060
Yes, the key of .

940
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,180
Next.

941
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:59,320
In order, from nicest to meanest, what are the alien races' names and description?

942
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,680
That could go on forever.

943
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,100
That is a very good question.

944
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,460
There are many of them.

945
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:11,160
There are many alien races and many descriptions.

946
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,500
So, you know, look out at the stars and you'll see that there are quite a few of those.

947
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,060
And you know that equation about how many planets are inhabitable.

948
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,580
However, it doesn't say how many planets are sociable.

949
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,020
A lot of them won't even talk to you, even when you talk to them nicely.

950
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,760
So, you have to know, I guess, about the worst ones.

951
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,360
Yes.

952
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,400
And from nicest to meanest, first we would have to talk about the equivalent of Ewoks.

953
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:44,080
Fuzzy, cuddly, chubby, little inoffensive beings.

954
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,860
Well, you might meet them.

955
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,940
But they're so unmotivated that they never push to the head of the line.

956
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,640
It's up to you to meet them.

957
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:59,100
Because who goes off and meets nice folks voluntarily?

958
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,340
The ones you encounter first are the biggest aliens.

959
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,040
The most stupid assholes in the universe.

960
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,700
Even in our near area of the galaxy, the Sagittarius arm.

961
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,780
The very center of our galaxy is a black hole.

962
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:22,140
And also, our galaxy is about, in a few billion eons, to collide with another galaxy.

963
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,460
Galaxy Andromeda.

964
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,940
That should be interesting, but I'm glad I won't live to see it.

965
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,320
So, to skip ahead to the worst aliens.

966
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,980
They are in power right now in the US government.

967
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,500
Changelingies.

968
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,660
Which airish spirits left there.

969
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,240
Their own parents thought that they sired them.

970
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,600
Not really.

971
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:53,720
The actual bodies that belong to these politicians are off on a joyful planet.

972
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,080
We might even encounter them after X-Day.

973
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,300
And these characters will not be lost.

974
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,460
They are the hateful versions that they assume here.

975
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,420
And that we see constantly nattering at us on the news channel.

976
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,220
With the aid and abeyance of the pundits.

977
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,700
Finally, there are the Elder Gods.

978
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:22,460
Who are, as their name suggests, crotchety and in a state of perpetual irritation.

979
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,660
With their long, their eons long disintegration.

980
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,020
Arthritis and ankylosis.

981
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,420
Their anger is profound.

982
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,280
And they aren't very generous to meatbags.

983
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,400
Who come up and pester them with unusual requests or questions.

984
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,980
Great.

985
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,220
Short one here.

986
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,200
If you have sex with your sister, will it continue the mutant race?

987
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,800
Um...

988
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,620
If you have sex with your sister, will it continue the mutant race?

989
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,800
Well, if your family last name is Mutant, perhaps it will.

990
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:17,800
But otherwise, unless your sister springs from a long tradition of inter-family inbreeding,

991
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:24,040
the genetic chances are pretty safe that you will produce a standard human offspring.

992
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,720
But the problem here is the limiting of the...

993
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,900
The possibilities of genetic interchange.

994
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,840
Once you limit that, then mutations crop up with greater frequency.

995
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:45,000
Until you get the two-headed backwoodsman who you always tend to run into when you're in trouble in the woods.

996
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,640
And need help from somebody who can actually help you.

997
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,180
Here's one that came from...

998
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,160
It came inside this little...

999
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,440
Came in a shot glass.

1000
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:55,500


1001
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,240
How about that?

1002
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,920
From Oh Betty's Red Hot Restaurant in Athens, Ohio.

1003
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,660
Showing a naked devil girl with a flaming pitchfork.

1004
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,060
Well, it's not often we get a question like that, ladies and gentlemen.

1005
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,720
And three dollars.

1006
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,980
And three dollars, which means some kind of sawed-off bardic recitation will also be in the offing.

1007
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,780
But let's have that question and do it justice.

1008
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,320
Oh, here's one that migrated over here.

1009
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,280
Well, Betsy's is a hot dog restaurant.

1010
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,560
Hot dog?

1011
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,980
Right. And the question is...

1012
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,860
A mighty hot dog is our lord.

1013
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,180
It's a cool little restaurant.

1014
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,020
Why do they call them hot dogs?

1015
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,220
And there's a drawing of a hot dog there, too.

1016
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,720
Why do they call them hot dogs?

1017
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,120
What a beautiful academic rendering of a hot dog.

1018
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,560
Even with a little stream of mustard.

1019
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,000
Hmm, I assume that's mustard.

1020
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,440
Well, so why do they call them hot dogs?

1021
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:52,220
You know, the hot dog and the ice cream cone were invented at the same time.

1022
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,640
At an early festival.

1023
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:59,060
The Columbian Exposition of the late 1800s.

1024
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:04,760
And the ice cream cone was invented right down the street from the hot dog.

1025
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:13,620
But in the old days, they used to have all sorts of wonderful treats and snacks that they have no more.

1026
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:19,420
In fact, they would not be allowed today by the over-eager protective government,

1027
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,620
which doesn't like its subjects to assume too toxic subjects.

1028
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,880
Sausages, or as it was called at carnivals and other cheap places where they were offered,

1029
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,040
were called winnie-wurst.

1030
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:38,560
The name hot dog did not arrive until the Columbian Exposition.

1031
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,920
But if you ate these sausages...

1032
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,040
Well, this is like the old saw about you don't want to see how the sausage is made.

1033
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,540
The novel by Upton Sinclair, The Jungle, tells just how these early prototypical hot dogs,

1034
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,340
were made.

1035
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:59,580
And it's a disquieting read that you don't want to read before lunch.

1036
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,440
But of course, they are also hot dogs.

1037
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:08,820
They are hot because they contain chi, the energy that you need.

1038
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,420
The same energy that's in hot soup or anything that is nutritious and hot.

1039
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,720
Like the book of the subgenius.

1040
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,860
Or like some subgeniuses themselves.

1041
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,100
And the name stuck because the name is appropriate.

1042
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,560
It's easier to say hot dog than winnie-wurst.

1043
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,100
And it's also easy to say it as an expression of exuberance.

1044
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,080
Hot dog!

1045
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,840
I got away with that one.

1046
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,220
How about that dumb song?

1047
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,360
Hot diggity, hot doggity, boom what you do to me.

1048
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,500
Obviously, hot dog is an ecstatic interjection.

1049
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,540
And so, let us hope it remains.

1050
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,900
And now one parenthetical aside.

1051
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,480
Because of the generosity of this question.

1052
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,080
It has long been known that...

1053
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,360
It has been known by certain explorers into the unknown and savants.

1054
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,500
That hot dogs vocalize when placed in a microwave oven.

1055
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,860
Yes, when you cook certain hot dogs in the microwave.

1056
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,880
They've actually been known to scream.

1057
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,060
And you can put your ear near the door.

1058
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,120
And hear this faint, desperate, and appealing sound.

1059
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,040
Yes, these hot dogs are flesh born of flesh.

1060
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,020
And even in their afterlife, they suffer.

1061
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,980
Perhaps they erred or sinned in their early lives.

1062
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,960
Perhaps the pinks, who will all fry in a few days,

1063
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:36,060
are hot dogs unto the barbecue grill of the exists.

1064
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,220
Let us hope we avoid the same immolation.

1065
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,440
Thank you, Dr. Howell.

1066
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,320
What are these clinking coins that I see?

1067
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,880
This is a heavy question.

1068
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,040
And it came with heavy metal coins.

1069
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,820
Dollars. Dollar coins.

1070
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,340
With Eisenhower.

1071
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,060
Silver dollars.

1072
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,000
With Eisenhower on them.

1073
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,480
Well, it's coin of the realm. Spendable.

1074
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,060
Bite one of them, Dr. Howell. Make sure.

1075
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,880
My teeth are not in good shape, Dr. Drummond.

1076
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,360
I'm in need of dental assistance.

1077
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,160
Did you really think you were going to get away with it?

1078
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,420
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1079
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,640
I think that every year.

1080
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,040
And you have to try to find out.

1081
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,080
And in some ways I did.

1082
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,980
But in the other ways I didn't.

1083
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,260
But there's always another opportunity.

1084
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:39,160
One must act whether one thinks or not that one is going to get away with it.

1085
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:44,440
Without putting it in motion, then there is no chance for success.

1086
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,800
Even the faintest chance is extinguished

1087
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,500
if there is no attempt to try.

1088
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,500
One must try.

1089
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:57,620
One must put oneself forward, even in the face of coldness and indifference.

1090
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:01,780
Because there is a goal worth reaching.

1091
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,240
Otherwise, why do it at all?

1092
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,160
All right, Stang. Back to work.

1093
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,400
Question number 700.

1094
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,740
Should artists fuck non-artists?

1095
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,780
Should artists fuck non-artists?

1096
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:17,920
Yes.

1097
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,900
It came with a dollar.

1098
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,620
Okay.

1099
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,560
By all means.

1100
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,040
Should artists fuck non-artists?

1101
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:30,080
Well, sometimes this just has to happen because nobody else is available.

1102
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,440
But let's look at this question.

1103
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,800
It can be interpreted in two ways.

1104
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:43,540
As a matter of praxis, artists shouldn't seek out non-artists to fuck.

1105
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,600
In that sense, artists should...

1106
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,500
Not fuck non-artists.

1107
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,560
But in the other larger and embracing sense,

1108
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,540
artists should because these are the partners that are presented.

1109
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:05,100
So the artist, like everyone else, must take up the slack when it is offered.

1110
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,740
I have to interject that...

1111
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,040
Was that the one with these big coins?

1112
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,020
Non-artists can be decent mothers.

1113
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:12,800
No, that wasn't...

1114
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,060
They can be.

1115
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,340
They can be quite decent.

1116
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,560
And one should not allow...

1117
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,340
personal prejudice to interfere.

1118
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,660
Also, artists are batshit crazy,

1119
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,180
but sometimes that works when two of them get together.

1120
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,740
What race of extraterrestrial are the X people?

1121
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,120
Ah, the X people.

1122
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,180
From Planet X.

1123
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,040
Planet X is in our own solar system.

1124
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,820
But in another sense,

1125
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,140
it is not in our own solar system.

1126
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,240
Beyond the heliopause,

1127
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,780
where the influence of the sun's photosphere ends,

1128
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,000
there is actually a barrier.

1129
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,440
I bet you laughed and snickered when you saw that old movie,

1130
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,120
This Island Earth,

1131
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,800
where when the flying saucer takes off,

1132
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,500
it has to go through a flame barrier

1133
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,660
to reach the planet Metaluna.

1134
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,000
A flame barrier. Ha ha ha.

1135
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,880
Well, now they know there is such a barrier.

1136
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:22,140
Set up by successive waves of photic energy

1137
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,760
emitted from the hydrogen-helium fusion reactor,

1138
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,380
which is our sun.

1139
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,480
A book I could recommend,

1140
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,880
which contains my own illustrations of this

1141
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,660
and other astronomical phenomena,

1142
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,980
is The Night Sky by Richard Grossinger

1143
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,620
from North Atlantic Books, 2013.

1144
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,340
I think it's 2013.

1145
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,660
And I illustrated this.

1146
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,880
So beyond this barrier,

1147
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,220
there are other planets.

1148
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,780
One of them is Biden,

1149
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,280
named after the present Vice President

1150
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,460
of the United States, Joe Biden.

1151
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,200
I guess if you're in office,

1152
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:56,940
you get lucky,

1153
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,000
and you get heavenly bodies named after you.

1154
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,560
There are asteroids named after Bob and Connie.

1155
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,280
That's right.

1156
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,540
Subgeniuses have bought the right to name,

1157
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,520
I think they were asteroids.

1158
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,260
Maybe one star and one asteroid.

1159
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,080
Some scientists are on our side.

1160
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,140
There are also planets you might have heard of

1161
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,400
called Quawar.

1162
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,740
That's one.

1163
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,440
Another one is called Sedna.

1164
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,340
Has anyone heard of those planets?

1165
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:21,880
Yes.

1166
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,880
So beyond that,

1167
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,860
there is planet X,

1168
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,860
the planet Innominate.

1169
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,020
It is called X because it has not yet been named.

1170
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,740
But it is said that at the moment of its discovery,

1171
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,180
it is too late.

1172
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,740
And like the Philistines on Samson,

1173
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,260
they will be upon us.

1174
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,980
Then their legions will be irresistible.

1175
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,060
When I say us,

1176
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,420
I'm speaking from the human race perspective,

1177
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,020
not the subgenius perspective.

1178
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,060
Because as Nietzsche pointed out years ago,

1179
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,700
when you gaze into the abyss,

1180
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,240
the abyss gazes into you.

1181
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,700
H.P. Lovecraft thought planet X was Yuggoth,

1182
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,900
the home of the horrible flying crab like Mego,

1183
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,020
who fly through the solar system

1184
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,040
tacking against the solar wind

1185
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,920
on bat-like membranous wings.

1186
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,660
But they are actually inhabitants of the dwarf planet Pluto

1187
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,900
and scuttle about under its giant moon Charon

1188
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,280
and its smaller moons,

1189
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,960
which are barely visible even to their far-seeing eyes.

1190
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,380
Ah, Uga!

1191
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,860
To this five dollar bill here.

1192
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,260
Five dollars?

1193
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,620
All right, very good.

1194
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,740
A simple question.

1195
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,320
A question which is elevated and correct.

1196
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,820
Oh, and it has art on it.

1197
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,700
With art yet.

1198
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,040
The question itself is art.

1199
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,720
What is that smell?

1200
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:58,460
And the word smell has two flies buzzing around it

1201
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,660
and stink lines.

1202
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,760
Well, I said that the questions often contain the answer.

1203
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,840
If the word smell is surrounded by cartoon flies,

1204
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:13,760
yes, drawn just the way every cartoonist draws them,

1205
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,760
with stink lines coming up,

1206
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,820
a kind of waft-a-rom, as we cartoonists say,

1207
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,800
the smell is not a good one.

1208
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,960
The smell is stercorous and bad.

1209
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:30,740
It is the smell of everything foul left behind a human

1210
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,360
or even some subgeniuses.

1211
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,460
The smell of decay, corruption, and the tomb.

1212
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,840
And also the smell of the disintegration of matter,

1213
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,260
the products of an entropic universe,

1214
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:50,160
resolutely bent upon grinding down everything which lives

1215
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,040
and has vitality and some transitory beauty

1216
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,580
into formless, unrecognizable pulp and slime.

1217
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,180
And this is the way of the cosmos.

1218
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,360
Only a fraction escape it.

1219
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,440
Many are called, but few are taken.

1220
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,260
The spawning grounds, the mackerel-crowded seas,

1221
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:16,040
are enormous, but of those billions of eggs,

1222
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:22,220
only a few form the subgenius who is to rule over all.

1223
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,520
And of course, everybody thinks that's going to be him.

1224
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,980
Like all those movies about survivors of an apocalypse,

1225
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,100
everybody loves them because they think

1226
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,780
they're going to be the survivors

1227
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:44,040
instead of the first to fall under the scythes of,

1228
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,480
under the scissors of, under the choppers.

1229
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,000
Well, you get the idea.

1230
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,280
But who gave us these coins of silvery shine?

1231
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,940
Actually, it was Fid Chooley.

1232
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,020
Oh, very good.

1233
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,680
And he had that question there.

1234
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,060
Oh, okay. All right.

1235
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,080
This one. What pheromone,

1236
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,800
spelling, in case the spelling is not right.

1237
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,380
No, it's all right.

1238
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,520
What pheromone?

1239
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,060
The N looks like a V, but it's spelled correctly, isn't it?

1240
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:22,320
What pheromone should I use for male or female yeti loving?

1241
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,120
Signed, Fnord.

1242
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,360
Fnord with a subgenius symbol.

1243
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,620
And yet I can see that, plainly see that written out.

1244
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,340
I'm not supposed to be able to see that word.

1245
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,040
I see it all the time.

1246
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,440
That's because it wasn't the Discordian who wrote it, Ivan.

1247
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,660
It was a subgenius.

1248
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:44,180
And it's signed only as an affectionate appellation.

1249
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,400
Also, it is negated by the Bob symbol right next to it.

1250
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,040
Otherwise, it would be concealed,

1251
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,580
like some books of demonology that the demons themselves change the words in the book,

1252
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,220
making it even harder to find out what's going on.

1253
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,880
We prefer to be called imps, if you don't mind.

1254
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,020
Well, I'll have to do that.

1255
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,780
I'll tell you, there is a difference of quality between imps and demons.

1256
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,000
Imps are mischievous, tiny spirits, like Lil Hot Stuff.

1257
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:15,420
Everyone would agree.

1258
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,220
Oh, now you're calling me short.

1259
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:21,560
They're little, and they're more concerned with making you lose your temper and be irritated.

1260
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,460
What are you talking about? What are you getting at?

1261
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,500
Imps like it when they frustrate you and make you lose it, because that is ecstasy to them.

1262
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:34,940
But demons are the full-grown beings whose ecstasy is a...

1263
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,620
master soul in the agony of torment.

1264
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,680
And this is ecstasy and nectar to demons.

1265
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,740
Imps just like it when you hit your thumb with a hammer, or some comic equivalent of that.

1266
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:53,540
Demons want you to burn in eternal spiritual agony, because they just love it.

1267
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,940
But back to the question.

1268
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,320
Let's not beat around the bush.

1269
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,960
I mean, we can't go around Robin Hood's barn here.

1270
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,760
We owe these people an answer, and an answer they're going to get.

1271
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,980
So what pheromone should I use for male or female yeti lovin'?

1272
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:18,740
My friend, you need to buy no medicinal preparation, no ointment, no elixir.

1273
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:23,580
You yourself generate the pheromone in question.

1274
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:33,740
Just don't wash too thoroughly before ecstasy, and you will indeed be radiating what will draw your yeti love mind.

1275
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,860
And I'll be a mate to you as she lumbers out of the forest.

1276
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,680
Not to be confused with those... bears.

1277
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:44,640
No.

1278
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,080
Okay.

1279
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,460
This one has a dollar, and the question relates to a dollar.

1280
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,680
A dollar, okay.

1281
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,260
Or that dollar.

1282
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,740
Sure, that dollar, any dollar.

1283
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:54,740
Dear Dr. Howell.

1284
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,400
Yes, I'm here.

1285
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,540
Enjoy the dollar.

1286
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,220
I do.

1287
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:57,820
Period.

1288
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:58,480
Or...

1289
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,080
Enjoy the dollar?

1290
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,260
Question mark.

1291
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,320
Or...

1292
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,720
Enjoy the dollar...

1293
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:10,120
What does your intuition, the immediate style, tell you?

1294
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,020
Well, there are three words, and it's repeated three times.

1295
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:24,760
Perhaps the questioner means, dear Dr. Howell, enjoy the dollar, or enjoy the dollar, or enjoy the dollar.

1296
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:30,900
You know, there are three words and three possible methods of apprehension or understanding.

1297
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,780
Each one is valid, and each one I accept.

1298
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:41,040
You can believe that, like the legendary subgenius hamburger, I enjoy the hell out of the dollar.

1299
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:52,380
Even though the dollar is, of course, a symbol of an invisible, evil, supernatural force which governs all human actions and surrounds the entire globe.

1300
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:59,400
Because the dollar itself, as many boars have told you over the years, is not without a certain mystic significance.

1301
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:06,720
And on the back, we see the pyramid being erected toward the eye on top.

1302
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,460
What does this mean?

1303
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,780
Under the banner Novus Ordo Cyclorum, is that what's there?

1304
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,820
No, it's Annuit Coeptis.

1305
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,200
All right.

1306
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,640
A new order of worlds, or a new order of beginnings.

1307
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:27,120
That's even better, because the idea is that by masonry, if you will, building something, think of it as Minecraft,

1308
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:33,580
putting blocks on top of blocks, creating, building, you are building toward something.

1309
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:42,980
You are building toward the ultimate roost on whose very pinnacle the eye of God, the oculus dei, may rest.

1310
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:49,640
Yes, God may not be here now, but he will be after we get finished.

1311
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,980
That is what the almighty dollar says.

1312
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,100
And that's why they use the dollar.

1313
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,000
That adjective to describe it.

1314
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,860
This is the last question.

1315
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,700
The last question.

1316
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,360
But it is a compound question.

1317
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,360
There are four questions embedded here.

1318
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,900
Someone was pretty sneaky.

1319
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,380
How do you want me to do this?

1320
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,600
Read it one at a time, or read them all at once and then hand it to you?

1321
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,720
Read it, read it, read it, hand it, read it, then hand it.

1322
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,220
All right, you asked for it.

1323
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,900
Okay, what the fuck are we doing?

1324
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,280
Quote, stop and shrift.

1325
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,100
Stop and shrift.

1326
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,800
Question one.

1327
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,980
When will Hillary announce her candidacy?

1328
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,740
Question two.

1329
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,840
What is that banana looking at?

1330
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,780
Question three.

1331
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,220
Is the clown car not a vagina?

1332
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,060
Question four.

1333
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:58,900
Does the question involve monkey?

1334
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:10,580
Most interesting, particularly this typically subgenius attempt to get something for nothing.

1335
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,940
But we are proud of that.

1336
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,520
We salute you.

1337
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,840
All the extras you asked for, you shall be granted now.

1338
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:22,180
After all, you paid some money to cross our threshold already.

1339
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,700
So you are...

1340
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,240
deserving of the answers.

1341
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,420
All right, here they are.

1342
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,740
Okay, what the fuck are we doing?

1343
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:40,580
We are engaged in the most basic and honorable of all philosophical questioning and ratiocination.

1344
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:44,320
We are wondering what the fuck we are doing.

1345
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:53,680
Most people mechanically, robotically do what they are told and go about their lives trudging through the coils of the bowels of the truth.

1346
00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:02,380
But here we are just sitting around, goofing off, being slackful and wondering what the fuck we are doing.

1347
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:07,700
Now I don't know about the second line, stop and shrift, stop and shrift.

1348
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,280
Does it mean sift?

1349
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,780
I could sift what I have already said.

1350
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:18,080
But there are a few nuggets to be found in it since I have already brought them to the surface.

1351
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,980
But shrift also means a succudenaeum, a substitute.

1352
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:33,820
So if you are inspiring me or impelling me to stop and add a substitute, I can add a substitute.

1353
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:39,980
What the fuck are we doing means how are we acting now.

1354
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:45,740
You might want to get your ducks in a row because the saucers are on their way.

1355
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,620
Question two.

1356
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,360
When will Hillary announce her candidacy?

1357
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,960
The answer is Hillary already announced her candidacy.

1358
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,600
You weren't paying attention.

1359
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,580
They went on and on about will she, won't she.

1360
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,420
They were very coy.

1361
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,820
Finally by the time she did, nobody seemed to care one way or the other.

1362
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:10,100
But what's interesting is that Bernie Sanders gets more people at the rallies, bigger rallies and actual interest.

1363
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:20,680
People are sort of exhausted by Hillary but like a Ron Paul on the left, Bernie Sanders seemed, at least when I left the world, to be gaining momentum.

1364
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,060
Question three.

1365
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,620
Is the clown car not a vagina?

1366
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,420
The answer is yes.

1367
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:30,140
The Republican clown car is not a vagina.

1368
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:37,440
If it were, the Republicans inside would be fetuses brooding, waiting toward conception.

1369
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,880
But they are not being created.

1370
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,120
They are already fully created and fully formed.

1371
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,740
In them, no further development is possible.

1372
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,300
When they tell you what they want and what they're going to do, that's it.

1373
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,700
That's what they are.

1374
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:58,980
They are not infants ready to be developed or ready to be squirted out of a giant vagina.

1375
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:10,400
No, the Republican clown car is a clown car and it's called that because like the magical car that the clowns drive in the circus, there are many of them inside.

1376
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:17,300
Far more inside than you would think could ever come boiling out like an anthill that is disturbed.

1377
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,240
Finally, the last question.

1378
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,360
Question four.

1379
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,440
Does the question involve monkey?

1380
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,500
Let's pause for a moment here.

1381
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:31,960
Monkey seems to be a word that just sets some people off.

1382
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:46,900
And a lot of people who are offended by the idea of evolution, or at least that humans had a distant ancestor, have said, even educated people have said to me, and this is the sad state of education in this country.

1383
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,800
If humans came from monkeys,

1384
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,380
how come the monkey is still here over there?

1385
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:52,840
Huh?

1386
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,720
How about that?

1387
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,160
Well, we did not come from monkeys.

1388
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,160
We are not monkeys.

1389
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,340
Please try to understand.

1390
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,620
We are apes.

1391
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:15,180
We're not those horrible things with tails that shit on everything and go chittering through the trees and rob and steal and will bite you to the bone if you give them a chance.

1392
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,420
No, no, no.

1393
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,560
We are noble apes.

1394
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,360
Problem solvers.

1395
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,320
And mighty men of old like King Kong.

1396
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,560
Chest-beating warriors.

1397
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,220
We know this.

1398
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:31,460
We subgeniuses acknowledge it in our yeti ancestry.

1399
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,760
But where did the ape come from?

1400
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,520
Well, the ape also had an ancestor.

1401
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:40,760
Everything that lives today is a version of something that lived before.

1402
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,000
And these mutations might have thought to have come into being.

1403
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:49,420
If you had a picture of something and you put the picture in a Xerox camera,

1404
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:53,240
and then you took the Xerox and Xeroxed it and it and it,

1405
01:00:53,320 --> 01:01:01,240
eventually there would be such variation that the last one on the top of the pile would be hard to tell from the first one that you put in.

1406
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,380
This is evolution at work.

1407
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:08,480
And the ancestor of apes and humans was something like a monkey.

1408
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,720
But it is not a monkey.

1409
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:17,460
And it was not a monkey because the monkey, even at that time, was on its own evolutionary journey.

1410
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:22,620
Before the beginning of our era, the Cenozoic, even in the Mesozoic,

1411
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,600
our order, the primate order, was represented.

1412
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,480
But they didn't look like monkeys and they didn't look like apes.

1413
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:36,600
They had long noses and twinkly whiskers and they looked more like opossums or rats.

1414
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:43,520
Think more about that when you're driving these innocent fellow travelers out of your living space.

1415
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,680
So, the question might involve monkey,

1416
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:51,220
but now it's involved it only to the degree that I've allowed it to do.

1417
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:57,160
We can look at this impious creature which, for humorous purposes, seems to resemble us,

1418
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:01,300
but we should remember that we are of the ape line, not the monkey.

1419
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,880
And it starts in the old world, not here.

1420
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,600
Here we have monkeys, but not apes.

1421
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,620
Except, of course, for the human apes,

1422
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:16,660
who have overrun every inch of available space.

1423
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,140
Let's learn that from Cheetah.

1424
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,520
Yeah, Cheetah is a sad case.

1425
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:30,560
You know, Cheetah was Tarzan's pet chimp in the movies.

1426
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,940
And Cheetah lived to a ripe old age.

1427
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,480
He lived to be sixty years old.

1428
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,260
But in the last years of his life,

1429
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:45,140
you know, chimpanzees that are in the movies can only be used in the first year of their lives

1430
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:46,660
because afterwards they become dangerous.

1431
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:47,780
dangerous, and intractable.

1432
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,900
But Cheetah made enough money in Hollywood

1433
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:50,880
that he got to retire.

1434
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,940
In the last year of his life,

1435
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:57,080
some do-gooders got a hold of him,

1436
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,180
and they made him stop drinking alcohol

1437
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:00,740
and smoking cigars.

1438
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,820
And he died of grief.

1439
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,520
Isn't that true, Philo?

1440
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,880
Yeah, Bridget Bardot.

1441
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:09,920
Bridget Bardot and her animal do-gooders

1442
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,480
discovered that Cheetah was having a grand old time,

1443
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,640
and for the old gray-muzzled ape's own good,

1444
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,500
took away his cigars and alcohol.

1445
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,240
He was dead in a year.

1446
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,460
Uh-huh, yeah.

1447
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,820
And so you see what the conspiracy will do

1448
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:24,380
if it gets a chance.

1449
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,080
That's interesting, though.

1450
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,920
Did you read about how there was some disconnect

1451
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,200
on potentially that that was not the same Cheetah?

1452
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:31,780
Oh, wow.

1453
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,160
And that his handler...

1454
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,340
What was the same Cheetah?

1455
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:38,020
His handler had been swapping out Cheetahs

1456
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,200
over the years to be able to maintain

1457
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:43,460
that legend of Cheetah for 65 years.

1458
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,980
Which was significantly longer than chimps normally live.

1459
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,780
To humans, they all look alike.

1460
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,660
And so you can't tell.

1461
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,340
And besides...

1462
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:54,500
But, you know, this was the guy's bread and butter.

1463
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:55,720
What else was he going to do?

1464
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,480
You're thinking of Tarzan movies made in the 1930s.

1465
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,260
They themselves suffered a de-evolutionary process

1466
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,520
and got worse and worse.

1467
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,780
Then came Bomba the Jungle Boy and Jungle Jim,

1468
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,620
still starring Johnny Weissmuller,

1469
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,140
but they were really bad.

1470
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,740
Still, they all had an ape doing cartwheels

1471
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:13,460
and chittering.

1472
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,340
And grimacing.

1473
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,820
Named Cheetah or something.

1474
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,040
In Jungle Moon Men, which I saw recently,

1475
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,580
it was something else.

1476
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,440
But you might as well ask,

1477
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,820
who was the real Lassie or real Tin Tin Tin?

1478
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:30,780
These beings are creations of popular culture.

1479
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,920
Lassie was not even female, but a gelded male.

1480
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:37,920
And Rin Tin Tin started out in the silent movie era.

1481
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:41,000
However, as a parenthetical aside,

1482
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:43,120
in the 1980s,

1483
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,840
some coke-huffing TV producers

1484
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,160
tried to bring Rin Tin Tin back.

1485
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,720
And I wondered, how the hell could they do that?

1486
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,520
Was he frozen in ice at Fort Ridiculous or whatever

1487
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,460
and then thawed?

1488
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,320
And it said in TV Guide,

1489
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,620
Rinty's back!

1490
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:01,160
Only now he's sniffing out small-time drug users

1491
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:01,940
and blah, blah, blah.

1492
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,380
He was a police dog

1493
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,800
in this horrible incarnation

1494
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,000
of the great Rin Tin Tin.

1495
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:11,280
The actual Rin Tin Tin made a fortune in Hollywood

1496
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,460
and lived in North Carolina.

1497
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:26,320
And she isrás successful,

1498
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,020
in deal-making,

1499
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:27,140
servein a company,

1500
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,340
and sex-flav Mesons atמהeki-

1501
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:29,220
from all-òn Belovo.

1502
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,180
No-vo-ry?

1503
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:31,800
Imitation

1504
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:31,840
Transformations

1505
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:31,880
One P puppet

1506
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:41,240
dis Pengan-

1507
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,420
sees R edited,

1508
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,740
of freedom before the next onslaught

1509
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:49,620
of imbecility, filth, and nonsense.

1510
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,900
Or education, if you look at it that way.

1511
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,600
And now it's time for the poem.

1512
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,720
The other day I spoke one about

1513
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:05,520
that misaligned and misunderstood creature,

1514
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:06,920
the vulture.

1515
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,100
Here is another pro-vulture poem.

1516
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,280
And you know, there are more than one of these.

1517
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,460
This one is called

1518
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,640
Under the Vulture Tree.

1519
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,740
And it's by the American poet David Bottoms.

1520
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,640
We have all seen them,

1521
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,040
circling pastures,

1522
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,040
have looked up from the mouth of a barn,

1523
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,380
a pine clearing,

1524
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,120
the fences of our own backyards,

1525
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,120
and have stood amazed

1526
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,100
by the one slow wing beat,

1527
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:42,320
the endless dihedral drift.

1528
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:45,140
But I had never seen so many,

1529
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,740
so close, hundreds,

1530
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,120
every limb of the dead oak feathered black.

1531
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,060
And I cut the engine,

1532
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:57,580
let the river grab the john boat,

1533
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,240
and pull it toward the tree.

1534
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,660
The black leaves shined,

1535
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,200
the pink fruit blossomed,

1536
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:08,240
red, ugly, as a human heart.

1537
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:12,240
Then, as I passed under their dream,

1538
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,740
I saw for the first time

1539
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:17,420
its soft countenance,

1540
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,180
the raw, fleshy jowls,

1541
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:22,000
wrinkled and generous,

1542
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,440
like the faces of the very old,

1543
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,580
who have grown to empathize with everything.

1544
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,380
And I drifted away from them,

1545
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:34,360
slow, on the pull of the river,

1546
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,300
reluctant,

1547
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,660
looking back at their roost,

1548
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,780
calling them what I never called them,

1549
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,140
what they are,

1550
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,360
those dwarfed, transfiguring angels

1551
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:50,620
who flock to the side of the poisoned fox,

1552
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:54,960
the mud turtle crushed on the shoulder of the road,

1553
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,340
who pray over the leaf graves

1554
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,540
of the anonymous lost,

1555
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:03,580
with mercy enough to consume us all

1556
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,120
and give us wings.

1557
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:08,880
Thank you.

1558
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:13,280
And this concludes this iteration of the Ask Dr. Hal show.

1559
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:17,520
We'll be here tomorrow for the final version of Ask Dr. Hal.

1560
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,380
Now, don't go too far,

1561
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,780
because the Bulldada Auctions first iteration

1562
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:26,800
is about to take place as soon as we set it up.

1563
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,520
In the meantime, let joy be unconfined.

1564
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:34,000
Friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry,
