00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Your FBI hopes through this series of programs to enlist each of you as a volunteer in the army of women engaging in serious crimes like murder, robbery, and the self-genius power of SWAT.

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:24,080
Neither your FBI nor any local law enforcement agency can prevent those parasites from attempting to get easy money from you, the decent citizen.

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,820
Only you can do that.

4
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,320
Do it by always following Bob.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240
But that trick never worked.

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,760
From PR News in Washington, I'm the instigator in an explosion in Phoenix, Arizona tonight.

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,760
Federal investigators in the U.S. injured dozens of passengers.

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,180
However, none suffered injuries.

9
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,500
President Donald Trump reports Trump is much, much worse.

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,180
President Trump is red meat for his base.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,500
But President Trump says the president will have PR News.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,240
The Trump is buff.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,080
Buffing a colon.

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,040
Now one executive says President Trump says his colon is under intense scrutiny.

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,640
That's Pierce reporting.

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,300
The Dow 61-21-865.

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,180
At least one of the four detained suspects saying this is PR News.

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,680
According to that suspect.

19
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,180
I painted a picture of Maryенты even though a w σεnd werfd gImичhol así

20
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,180


21
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,400
I woke up this morning with a bad hangover

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,620
And my p fnus was missing again

23
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,600
Benien mio

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,660
This happens all the time

25
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,940
This comes in handy a lot of the time

26
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,140
I can leave it home when it's going to get me in trouble

27
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,300
I can leave it home—

28
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,840
rent it out when I don't need it. But now and then I go to a party, get drunk, and the next

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,120
morning I can't, for the life of me, remember what I did with it. First I looked around my apartment

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,060
and I couldn't find it, so I called up the place where the party was, they hadn't seen it either.

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,840
I asked them to check the medicine cabinet, cause for some reason I leave it there sometimes, but

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,300
not this time. So I told them if it pops up to let me know. I called a few people who were at

33
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,320
the party, but they were no help either. I was starting to get desperate, I really don't like

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,720
being without my penis for too long, it makes me feel like less of a man, and I really hate having

35
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,620
to sit down every time I take a leak. After a few hours of searching the house and calling

36
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,520
everyone I could think of, I was starting to get very depressed, so I went to the Kiev and ate

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,680
breakfast. Then as I walked down 2nd Avenue towards St. Mark's Place, where

38
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:55,920
the

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,260
people were, I saw a man with a broken toaster oven, all those people sell used books and other junk on the street.

40
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:07,300
I saw my penis lying on a blanket, next to a broken toaster oven, some guy was selling it, I had to buy it off him.

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:16,600
He wanted 22 bucks, but I talked him down to 17. I took it home, washed it off, and put it back on.

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:25,400
I was happy again, complete. People sometimes tell me I should get it permanently attached, but I don't know.

43
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,520
Even though sometimes it's a pain in the ass, I like having a detachable penis.

44
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,680
No one on the street is a man with a penis.

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:39,700
Nobody there.

46
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,680
No one there.

47
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:41,680


48
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,240
No one there.

49
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,980
Nobody there.

50
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,280
Nobody there.

51
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,020
Nobody there.

52
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,380
Nobody there.

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,360
Intentional Venus

54
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,560
Detachable Penis was the name of that song and King Missile did that a long time ago.

55
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,820
Man, I so identify.

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,880
I actually met King Missile once at the Anti-Emmys in New York.

57
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,860
Long story.

58
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,420
Thanks to Mr. Fernando Nandi Lemur for the titles and any news.

59
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:03,600
Oh yes, dear friends, this episode of Hour of Slack, number 1790, isn't a rerun, but it will have a lot of old stuff.

60
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,100
I just can't stay on top of the complexities like I used to.

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,380
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and I want to do more live shows, but we'll have to do it while he's in the hospital with his heart and nerve diseases.

62
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,500
He can't do that quite yet.

63
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,400
Thanks to everyone.

64
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,400


65
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,900
Thanks to everyone who sent him fan letters and get well wishes, which I'm sure he'd love to see more of.

66
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,520
And you can send them through me, stang at subgenius dot com.

67
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,600
He doesn't really even have email.

68
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,520
His son brings his snail mail to the hospital for him.

69
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,000
He's okay.

70
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,700
I mean, he's still funny.

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,600
He's still Dave, but his phone situation is like his computer situation.

72
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,400
He doesn't work well with machines.

73
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,800
He doesn't have the kind of machinery.

74
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:03,380
In the meantime, as one of his admirers suggested, we could play some best of Lonesome Cowboy Dave, which is a good idea and easy for me to do

75
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,820
because I assembled a whole album of just that 20 years ago.

76
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,760
Not that anybody bought it.

77
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,200
It's probably one of the best subgenius albums.

78
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,700
The one guy who bought a copy said it inspired him so much that he started writing science fiction short stories.

79
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,960
and he got them published.

80
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:30,960
So now you can get the same sort of shot of inspiration for free.

81
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,300
Bob's going to kill me for not selling this stuff harder,

82
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,440
but hey, you know, something's going to kill me soon enough anyway.

83
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,220
Why not Bob?

84
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,300
So I'm going to edit some of the 23X Day recordings into this.

85
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,180
The audio isn't great because X Day happened on the Zoom teleconferencing platform.

86
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,940
But on the other hand, because of that, it also has lots of new faces and voices.

87
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,520
And I have all this best of Lonesome Cowboy Dave, all from ESO Swamp Radio,

88
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,920
the show on WCSB Cleveland,

89
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,380
hosted by the late Professor Chaz Smith for hundreds of years

90
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,640
until he suddenly died.

91
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,280
And I'm going to edit some of the 23X Day recordings into this.

92
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,340
And that's a reminder, my friend.

93
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,440
Just as Chaz boarded the saucers prematurely,

94
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,000
and Legume, and so many of our loved ones,

95
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,040
Lonesome Cowboy Dave could just suddenly up and die of a heart attack just like that.

96
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,800
That happened to several friends of mine when they were in their 30s.

97
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,480
St. Joe Riley, for instance.

98
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,980
Heck, it almost happened to me a few years ago.

99
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,660
That's why I'm going to slack off and surf the luck plane,

100
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,840
and follow the path of least resistance

101
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,040
and blow off the level of work I used to put into this damn weekly show,

102
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,080
now in its 1,790th episode, dang it!

103
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,780
So, heck, phooey.

104
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,400
Phooey, I say.

105
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,280
I'm taking it easy henceforth.

106
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,840
And if you get bored, touch that dial.

107
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,840
Oh, this music in the background, by the way, is by Blackout.

108
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,460
Old Reverend Blackout.

109
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,620
But before,

110
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,600
and maybe betwixt the old Dave Chaz ESO and new X Day recordings,

111
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,800
I'm going to get back to my Oingo Boingo kick,

112
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,360
and run some songs that I've decided speak to today's current events in Ameristan.

113
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:37,060
I was listening to the Oingo Boingo live album and other very old albums,

114
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:43,000
and some songs struck me as more meaningful in 2020 than they were in 1984.

115
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,820
In fact, they could perfectly fit into the album.

116
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,040
Right.

117
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,320
So here's a quick category of the Oingo Boingo that could perfectly, well,

118
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,320
be about the new, but probably short-lived species of human offshoots called anti-maskers.

119
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,660
This series of songs on the show, then, is dedicated to all you anti-maskers,

120
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,400
anti-vaxxers, and flat-earthers.

121
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:11,480
Indeed all anti-science po-buckers and pinks should feel free to include yourselves as well in that dedication.

122
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,900
Nothing bad ever happens to me

123
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,820
Nothing bad ever happens to me

124
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,400
Why should I care?

125
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:37,200
Why should I care?

126
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,220
A man broke into my neighborhood

127
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,860
He threatened the family with a loaded gun

128
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,400
He turned them all up and beat them real good

129
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,840
He took everything and he got away clean

130
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,340
And I can't believe that anyone would

131
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,680
Want to do such terrible things

132
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,600
Why should I care?

133
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,600
I hear about Fred, he's unemployed

134
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,260
He threw him away like a useless toy

135
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,880
He went down the drain after 20 long years

136
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,100
No warning, no pension, nobody's cares

137
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,660
And I can't believe that anyone would

138
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,380
Want to do such terrible things

139
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,240
But why should I care?

140
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,880
Why should I care?

141
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,100
Every time I look around this place

142
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,600
I see them scream but I hear no sound

143
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,960
And the terrible things happen down the road

144
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,340
It's something else that I don't even know

145
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,740
Nothing bad ever happens to me

146
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,640
Nothing bad ever happens to me

147
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,660
Why should I care?

148
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,680
Why should I care?

149
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,520
Why should I care?

150
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,600
Every time I look around this place

151
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,140
I see them scream but I hear no sounds

152
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,560
And the terrible things happen down the road

153
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,860
There's something else that I don't even know

154
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,200
I heard about the Joneses, my, my, my

155
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,840
It happened so quick, no one knows why

156
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,360
But the Joneses are the best

157
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,120
The teenage son, he seemed okay

158
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,820
But his suicide ruined everyone's family

159
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,240
And I can't believe that anyone would

160
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,500
Want to do such a terrible thing

161
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,440
But why should I care?

162
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,760
Nothing bad ever happens to me

163
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,700
Nothing bad ever happens to me

164
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,160
Nothing bad ever happens to me

165
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,580
Nothing bad ever happens to me

166
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,960
Nothing bad ever happens to me

167
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,320
Nothing bad ever happens to me

168
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,740
Nothing bad ever happens to me

169
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,860
Why should I care?

170
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,720
Nothing bad ever happens to me

171
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,540
Nothing bad ever happens to me

172
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,500
Why should I care?

173
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,460
Nothing bad ever happens to me

174
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,180
No, no, nothing bad, nothing bad ever happens to me

175
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,280
Why should I care?

176
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,160
Nothing bad ever happens to me

177
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,100
Nothing bad, nothing bad ever happens to me

178
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,180
Why should I care?

179
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,000
Nothing bad ever happens to me

180
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,560
It's the winning side

181
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,860
And everyone is cheering for the winning side

182
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,260
And the children leave their homes to join the winning side

183
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:34,600
And when Jesus comes he'll march on with the winning side

184
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,900
And we've got all the right answers

185
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,260
In the kingdom of God

186
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,260


187
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,440
Shining light

188
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,640
Weather on the right

189
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,780
And we have no fear

190
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,960
No, we have no fear

191
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,240
Waiting for the sign

192
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,800
We will give our lives

193
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,020
We will give our lives

194
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,980
And I feel so isolated

195
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,380
It's so lonely here at night

196
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,700
It almost feels

197
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,260
Like I'm in a dream

198
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,260


199
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,800
I can't hear me

200
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,020
I imagine that you're with me

201
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,000
On the winning side

202
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,040
We don't ask too many questions

203
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,360
On the winning side

204
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,320
And I've got this strange sensation

205
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,800
On the winning side

206
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,900
I don't recognize the faces

207
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,100
On the winning side

208
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,460
And we all live here in cages

209
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,260
Someone's got to be here to save us

210
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:40,940
And we all love to be just one

211
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,240
Right last night

212
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,480
Betty made a sound

213
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,680
We can hear meOP

214
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,620
With my eyes closed tight

215
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,440
To get to the place

216
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,920
Where you were

217
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,540
Jerry-Lynn

218
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,120
And I can hear YOU

219
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,900
When I'm up in the air

220
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,060
And my ears are blind

221
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,060


222
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,060


223
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,060


224
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,000
When I kiss the ground

225
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,860
And I like to know you better

226
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,280
And I like to get to know

227
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,960
And I'd like to know your name

228
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,200
I could win each ale

229
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,240
I did all I can

230
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,240


231
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,240


232
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,220
I'll tell you something, if you give me half a chance

233
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,940
Cause I'm on the winning side, yeah

234
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,980
In the sleepless night, when the blindness comes

235
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,240
Washing over me, like a giant wave

236
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:58,440
I'm a sandwich beach, washing over me

237
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,680
I am proud to be

238
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,560
And I'd like to take you somewhere

239
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,400
That you've never been before

240
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,240
And I'd like to take you somewhere

241
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,240


242
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,180
I feel so isolated

243
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,620
And I feel so all alone

244
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,280
Here I'm on the winning side

245
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,900
And I feel so all alone

246
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,680
Here I'm on the winning side

247
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,360
And I feel so all alone

248
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,080
Here I'm on the winning side

249
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,680
And I feel so all alone

250
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,400
Here I'm on the winning side

251
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,040
And I feel so all alone

252
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,320
Oh yeah, I'm inside

253
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,920
That was Oingo Boingo from the 1980s.

254
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,960
Danny Elfman and Steve Bartek being the main songwriters.

255
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,960
And now, Back in Time.

256
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,920
I pray. I pray.

257
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,420
Amino acid ancestors.

258
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,980
Now I die before I wake in silent void.

259
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,920
Galactic space shimmering molecular designs.

260
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,120
Are you trying to bum out the people that are tripping or something, Chaz?

261
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:38,820
Hey man, you trying to put a dodecahedron in the back of their conceptual shadow space now?

262
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,960
Hey.

263
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,020
Man, life is a joke. It's a lie.

264
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,760
And friends, someday you're gonna shut up like hell.

265
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,300
So you better make, you better shout and make a lot of noise.

266
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,980
Because someday your vocal cords are going to be frozen.

267
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,640
Just like that is snow right to the left of your, there on the monitor.

268
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,480
So I'd like to give thanks to the universe for every single,

269
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,240
Oh, hell no, hell no.

270
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,900
for every single word you say.

271
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,080
that I get to live.

272
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,520
Praise Bob and hail Connie.

273
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,100
By God, there's at least seven minutes left of this life.

274
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,860
This little life captured forever on the spinning disks and reels.

275
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,540
So much more permanent than you or I.

276
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,220
We are but mayflies.

277
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,640
A passive shadow.

278
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,380
Perhaps just as we examine and pity and laugh at the little mayfly

279
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,220
in its best interest.

280
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,220


281
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,580
brief span, perhaps some larger creature is gazing upon us.

282
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,440
Perhaps our little world is but an aquarium.

283
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:56,920
And you are nailed to the door of perception, endlessly watching it swing open and shut.

284
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,540
Jesus came knocking, but no one answered.

285
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:06,440
It's more like Prometheus on the dock, waiting for the persecutor to let him be.

286
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,480
Buddha came knocking, and they hit him on the head with a stick.

287
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,240
Bob came a-knocking, but you didn't have your thirty dollars.

288
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,440
And he was too thick.

289
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,180
And so Bob was wroth and wrath in his anger.

290
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,940
And he yanked upon the rug and spread the banana peels.

291
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:35,340
And so many fell, and the bigger they fell.

292
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,360
Offer.

293
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,900
The harder Bob came, and his laugh rang out.

294
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,560
For political corruptigation.

295
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,840
From holiday to holiday.

296
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,220
And a very, very drastic disease in the body politic.

297
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,520
We thank our Lord Jesus, the fight-meister Lord, and his big shiny fangs.

298
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:03,480
For God has made us in his own image, and he's tired of looking in the mirror.

299
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,180
Bob, make up.

300
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,660
Make up your mind for the American people, why don't you?

301
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,740
And just step in and take over, won't you, Bob?

302
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,340
Hey.

303
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,220
Hey.

304
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
I want some cheesy poops, mother f***er.

305
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,360
Not that Bob.

306
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,240
Not Bob Grodds.

307
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,020
Bob Dobbs.

308
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,220
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

309
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,640
The living avatar of slack.

310
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,040
You crats from another dimension.

311
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,520
For our frop.

312
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,080
Our frankness.

313
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,800
Our frang.

314
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
And our fang-eye.

315
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,560
Our fang.

316
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,320
And other things.

317
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,880
Our fang?

318
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,000
That the listener does not know.

319
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,920
Let's go into the void.

320
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,380
For all of you to decrease.

321
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,300
Let go.

322
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,240
The many, many fools you have.

323
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,460
Float downstream, dude.

324
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,540
Black is the color and none is the number.

325
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,700
Turn off your mind, relax.

326
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,520
Void, void, void.

327
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:00,840
Anything that makes it harder to pee is anti-slack.

328
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,500
J.R. Bob Dobbs, 1959.

329
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,340
I believe it.

330
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,500
Prunes are God's answer to man's every dilemma.

331
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,800
Anything that makes it harder to learn is also anti-slack.

332
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,100
Reverend Ivan Stang, 2000.

333
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,680
We can only offer our Sinjurish thanks for that.

334
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,460
So turn off that TV and turn up your radio and read a book every now and then.

335
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,020
Foo!

336
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,280
How come Danny P. Chagas isn't saying anything?

337
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,460
He doesn't.

338
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,280
Show his face.

339
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,340
Either he's cowering down there.

340
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,160
Or maybe he's not.

341
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,180
His microphone is muted.

342
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,400
Danny P. Chagas, unmute your microphone.

343
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,640
Mute type, man.

344
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,260
Mute type.

345
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,000
Unmute now.

346
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,960
Uncover.

347
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,920
Mutant.

348
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't think he's really there.

349
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,020
I think he's out like at the 7-Eleven getting some milk.

350
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,500
He's rummaging through the refrigerator at the moment.

351
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,900
Oh, here he is.

352
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,540
He unmuted.

353
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,060
I think.

354
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,060
Fuck you, motherfucker.

355
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,820
Look, guys.

356
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,000
Here he is.

357
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,600
Paul just messaged me.

358
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,100
Like, you want me to add you to the panel?

359
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,580
I responded.

360
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,320
Give me a minute.

361
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,900
I got it.

362
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,700
I just woke up.

363
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,780
I got to do some stuff.

364
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,160
And then I hear him in here.

365
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,500
Like, he's not responding.

366
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,860
I'll just add him anyways.

367
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,160
Like, ah, heck.

368
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,720
I like your boogaloo stuff.

369
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:23,660
Yeah.

370
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,200
Yeah.

371
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Look, I'm not letting the fascists take my fashion away from me.

372
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,180
So you're a pro-fat in the boogaloo big luau movement?

373
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,340
Yeah.

374
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,740
Yeah.

375
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,380
Big luau.

376
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:35,820
Nothing.

377
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,100
Is there a big luau now?

378
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,040
Look, if these guys, they wear Hawaiian shirts.

379
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,840
Oh, that's right.

380
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,420
That's right.

381
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,600
They do wear Hawaiian shirts.

382
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,660
I saw a picture of that.

383
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,460
That makes you a boogaloo boy, right?

384
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:47,860
Yeah.

385
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,580
Yes, exactly.

386
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,660
You're probably a boogaloo idiot.

387
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,280
Look, if wearing these shirts is going to get people to think that I'm some idiot who goes

388
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,640
around carrying an AR-15 at protests, and if I have to start carrying an AR-15 to defend

389
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,620
myself against people who mistake me for them, then that's what it's going to do.

390
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Because I'm not buying.

391
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,000
Different shirts.

392
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,900
Are you willing to shoot them first before they shoot you?

393
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,060
I'd have to.

394
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,860
I don't want to.

395
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,420
You carry it, but there's always somebody who's going to be less inhibited than you,

396
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,160
just about.

397
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,040
I'm going to get an AR-30 because it's twice an AR-15.

398
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,320
It's twice as long and twice as wide.

399
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,140
Twice as many bullets.

400
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,120
Duck take them together.

401
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,040
Yep.

402
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,480
And an AR-45.

403
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,260
A mounting automatic rifle.

404
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,520
Just big round.

405
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,120
A little dwarfish assistant to carry it or help carry it.

406
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,820
AR-450.

407
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,820
I don't have ammunition for mine.

408
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,060
That's a problem that I can't buy it here in libtard California.

409
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,900
That's funny.

410
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,020
You should have a gun in California.

411
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,140
I'm without ammunition.

412
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,300
I wonder what they make.

413
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,840
They got rid of it.

414
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,860
They outlawed them in California, so you're safe.

415
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,760
Don't worry about it.

416
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,980
Yeah, under 15 years ago, maybe longer.

417
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,680
You have to go out of state to get ammo.

418
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,260
Well, you have to go into the Indian Empire, definitely.

419
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,620
Yeah, well, all the guns are gone.

420
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,300
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

421
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,200
Well, the guns are around, but you need the ammunition.

422
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,400
It has to be the right size.

423
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,220
You know, I even have silver bullets.

424
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,580
Really?

425
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
In case a werewolf...

426
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,920
Yes, they're right here.

427
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,180
Where are they?

428
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,540
I only have four.

429
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:35,780
Four?

430
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,140
They're not very good.

431
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,640
They're of a too small gauge.

432
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:45,120
They would kill your werewolf, but by the time they did, your werewolf would have killed

433
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,400
you many times over.

434
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,740
If you don't have any silver bullets, you can kill a werewolf.

435
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,860
I have these little neighbor kids, and they're four and five, and their favorite show is

436
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,220
about zombies and werewolves, and they're always chattering about, yeah, I want to be

437
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,800
one of the werewolves, but he wants to be one of the zombies, and I think we're just

438
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,060
there.

439
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,980
The cartridge case is brass, but the bullet part is silver, and the problem with firing

440
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,260
a silver bullet is...

441
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:11,380
You have to be about six feet from your werewolf because the silver melts.

442
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,940
The bullet tends to tumble in flight.

443
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,420
It is not accurate.

444
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,360
And if you're six feet away...

445
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,420
See, they don't bring these details in the movies.

446
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,600
They don't do their research.

447
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,740
And this is a...

448
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,120
They don't, because you could just cut a werewolf's head off and save your silver.

449
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,320
Or a .22, which is...

450
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,420
You want a larger bullet to take the...

451
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,180
No, don't count .22.

452
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,320
I'm going to take my chances.

453
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,120
I'm going to take my chances with a knife and cut a werewolf's head off if he attacks

454
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,440
me.

455
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,100
Chainsaw.

456
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,660
Silver chainsaw.

457
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,780
I got a silver chainsaw.

458
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,300
A silver toothed chainsaw.

459
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,800
Here's some of the consecrated host.

460
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,700
This, of course, is for anti-vampire protection.

461
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,780
What the hell is that?

462
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,380
That blackened stuff in there?

463
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:56,880
What is that?

464
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,140
Oh, it's technically the blood of Christ.

465
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,420
Holy...

466
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,240
Well, yeah, it's the blood of somebody.

467
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,460
Where did you get that?

468
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,300
I don't know.

469
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,380
I forget.

470
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,760
This bread I break was once the oat, this wine upon a foreign tree.

471
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,420
Any Catholic can get that stuff.

472
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,420
I was going to say, is that consecrated wine?

473
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,940
Yes, it is.

474
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,560
Oh, I see.

475
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,520
It's wine that...

476
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:21,860
It's transubstantiated.

477
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,800
It's wine...

478
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,400
Oh, I see.

479
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,740
No, it's blood.

480
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,080
It looks just like blood.

481
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
Thanks to transubstantiation.

482
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,620
Come on.

483
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,780
People have been burned alive for mentioning the wrong difference.

484
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,160
It is, according to doctrine, the transubstantiated blood.

485
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,640
It's the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.

486
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,500
Is that phyllo?

487
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,440
That's a universal antidote.

488
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That's what it's like.

489
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,920
That's not the vapor of encouragement, is it?

490
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,380
If you get poisoned, this'll save you.

491
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,700
I would have had me...

492
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,840
If you get snake bit, this'll save you.

493
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,320
What will it save you from?

494
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,900
The chicken John threw most of them away.

495
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,580
Whatever it needs to.

496
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:57,960
Libertarians.

497
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,540
Is that cyanide or something?

498
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,300
The cyanide comes just before 7 a.m. on July 15th.

499
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


500
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


501
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


502
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


503
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


504
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


505
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


506
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


507
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


508
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


509
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


510
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


511
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


512
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,300


513
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,240
Everyone gets a capsule and drinks Freulein Braun.

514
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,900
And we will fly to the...

515
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,880
Freitag von Loringhoven.

516
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,740
The comet.

517
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,820
We will fly together to the comet.

518
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,660
We will cut off our testicles into the bucket and fly together to the comet.

519
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,800
The last testicle of the movement.

520
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,600
If you had some money, what would you do with it?

521
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,460
How would you use it?

522
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,080
I'd buy more of these bandanas.

523
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,740
Buy gold.

524
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,760
We have to get one of those bandanas, Mickey.

525
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,720
Oh, Ned, you know very well what to do with money.

526
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,340
You send it to Bob, of course.

527
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,040
Sell gold.

528
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:54,680
Buy gold.

529
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
Deliver it to the people.

530
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:56,560
Sell gold with it.

531
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,340
Actually, the coronavirus has been really good for the church business.

532
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,200
Really?

533
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,020
Strangely enough.

534
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,280
Really?

535
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,320
Because people are stuck at home and so they're so desperate.

536
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,600
Bob's looking out for you.

537
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,860
He's looking for slack.

538
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,500
He's looking for slack.

539
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,480
He's like, you know, Stang could use a little help.

540
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,000
I got this prayer cloth.

541
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,580
I guess that Reverend Stang prayed over it.

542
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,820
Maybe that'll make it better.

543
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,600
I breathe.

544
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,820
I put on every one of these bandanas and breathe through it.

545
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,540
A prayer cloth?

546
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:35,280
Isn't it a shame that televangelists are waiting for the coronavirus to pass?

547
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,160
And the quarantine to be over so that they can get back to healing the sick?

548
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,920
That's got to be humility.

549
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,400
It's a strange world anyway now.

550
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,580
The world gets a little stranger every day.

551
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,560
Because we slipped in in 2016.

552
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,400
We slipped into an alternate universe.

553
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,800
And now it's like getting more and more alternate.

554
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,340
It's alternating more and more.

555
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,880
That's how you do it, Stang.

556
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,100
Slipping more and more off kilter.

557
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,580
That way you let Bob see for you.

558
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,680
You don't need your eyes.

559
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,880
As long as you got the eyes of Bob.

560
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,640
Some wise guy sent us a picture of himself doing that.

561
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,500
He was behind the wheel of a car.

562
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,300
Oh.

563
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,200
That's kind of...

564
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,540
How long are we going to go tonight?

565
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,400
I'll see what I need.

566
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,820
There's a reason why they call it subgenius.

567
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,600
Hey, it works.

568
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
He survived long enough to send you the picture.

569
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,260
Yeah.

570
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,080
That's an endorsement right there.

571
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,120
You can put that on the website.

572
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,760
Blanked the illegal disclaimer.

573
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,060
I'm going to go to the trash.

574
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,080
Missing the shot.

575
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,100
Missing the money.

576
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,240
I'll see you at my buttocks, Bob.

577
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,040
Which is also subgenius.

578
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,100
I should get an extra one of those used for like a cloth toilet paper thing.

579
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:52,000
You can only easily transition into an alternate universe that is almost like this universe.

580
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,400
That has only a few slides.

581
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,080
Yeah, you wouldn't know.

582
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,460
You wouldn't know necessarily.

583
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,680
But from that point, you could start with another one.

584
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,060
And there is a phenomenon where there's a cascade.

585
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,560
Where you simply start moving faster out of this.

586
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,600
Into variant universes.

587
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,640
I hate when that happens.

588
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,840
It may be harder to get back.

589
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,960
I know.

590
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,760
It's like I've been trying to get back.

591
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,080
How do you un-cascade though?

592
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,960
You can't un-cascade.

593
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,320
You can't un-mute.

594
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,400
You can't un-cascade.

595
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,060
You can't un-mute.

596
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,980
That's where you tile.

597
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,240
You can't un-mute because you're a mutant.

598
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,020
Mutant.

599
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,400
We call them.

600
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,120
We can't un-mutate.

601
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,140
We can't un-cascade.

602
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,960
You can't go backwards.

603
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,580
You can evolve.

604
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,900
Yes, Owen.

605
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,960
One of my fears is that X-Day already happened.

606
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,880
And that at 7 a.m. on July 5, 1998, the entire universe disappeared.

607
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,840
And then was instantly replaced by one far stranger.

608
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:59,080
Well, remember, if we're in a simulation, it's not good to blow that scene.

609
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,020
Because then there's no reason for the simulation to continue.

610
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,220
And they'll turn it off.

611
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,760
So we have to believe in it for the time being.

612
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,940
You gotta believe.

613
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Or you wake up and you're in some glass globe with the tube stuck in you and so on.

614
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,340
Will everybody clap if they believe in the...

615
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,200
Just keep a pipe, like a piece of pipe around you.

616
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,580
Yes, the pipe.

617
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,320
Yes, we...

618
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,120
Believe in reality.

619
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,300
Bring it back.

620
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,480
Come on, reality will die.

621
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:32,900
You don't...

622
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,540
Clap your hands.

623
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,460
Poor Tinkerbell.

624
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,620
She's been poisoned.

625
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,080
We gotta clap our hands.

626
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,440
I need to have a shoe or something.

627
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,880
They're not all ungulates.

628
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,300
They're like jellyfish horses.

629
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
You can't be ungulocentric, man.

630
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:52,320
Man, think of how it just like winds down to the wire until there's like only 15 planets with actual cowbells.

631
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,000
Uh-huh.

632
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,180
Or I don't know if it's 15, Chad knows the actual number.

633
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:56,540
But that's still...

634
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,900
Because he's been playing with himself with these things the last two weeks.

635
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,000
Man, any life at all is a beautiful miracle.

636
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,860
It takes billions of years for all those chemicals to...

637
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:10,100
Yeah, but isn't it odd that there are, you know, since we're kind of on Dada horse cowboys,

638
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,800
you know, like we're on them little rocking horses with the big garish faces and stuff,

639
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,640
just think of the ulterior worlds which surround us right at this proper moment, which probably

640
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,700
drift off these really...

641
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,940
Well, and you know, you guys...

642
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,000
These are not cowboy worlds where people have, you know, draw at the bar and stuff like that...

643
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,680
Yeah, there's a cop world.

644
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,720
...but they're wearing like business suits.

645
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,360
Not a business world, Jesus world.

646
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,000
Jesus world.

647
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,260
There's so many.

648
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,240
But you know what we're forgetting?

649
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,600
You know, it's not a mechanistic universe.

650
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,180
The world, life obviously is driven by some intelligence.

651
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,360
Evolution doesn't explain all of it.

652
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,100
And there must be an intelligence, and we can tell by the way things are that it must

653
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,980
be a cruel, vindictive, and rapacious...

654
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,380
R.

655
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,340
...intelligence, an implacable evil beyond any...

656
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:57,740
I don't see any R.

657
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,000
...with a sense of truth...

658
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,900
I don't see any R.

659
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,400
...any proof at all for any intelligence or anything.

660
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:10,440
I think all awareness is just a byproduct of the evolving brain adapting to its environment.

661
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,040
It's a little lone little baby boy.

662
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,060
It's a poor little thing, not a real baby boy, not a sexual being of any...

663
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,040
It's a poor little thing.

664
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,240
It's coming slowly, crawling on its nut.

665
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,380
And now it's...

666
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,040
Nah.

667
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,380
It's...

668
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,340
But because of the interconnectedness...

669
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:27,480
I could be wrong.

670
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,880
...of all life, that crawling thing is part of your life.

671
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:30,880


672
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,780
It's part of your brain, too.

673
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,180
Right.

674
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,960
And then, so naturally, that reflects Stang's view of the ultimate evil of this evolving

675
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,460
being.

676
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,280
Yes.

677
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,880
No, no, in that world there can be no good or evil in that view.

678
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,020
I think we're the mirror image of it, and we're basically good, and it's basically bad.

679
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,420
No, there is no good or evil.

680
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,760
There's just stuff people's does.

681
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,060
There is only the pipe and the smoker of the pipe.

682
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,880
Neither is...

683
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,080
All...

684
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,120
...good or evil as men know.

685
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,860
All...

686
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,680
...ussia, god, whatever.

687
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,840
...verbal, the mundane, the nanoward, ningún.

688
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:03,820
... şedem...

689
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:03,900
So, then we're all plural, and we're connected...

690
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:03,900


691
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:03,900


692
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:03,900


693
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:03,900


694
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,260
This real world is connected!

695
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,280
You are connected.

696
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,380
Oh!

697
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,060
I was going to tell this to myself.

698
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:14,700
Wait!

699
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,320
I do not know who you are, Stan, or if you're going to say SPANDI standing here.

700
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,740
No, not me, I am a man.

701
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,420
You are not a man but I am an animal being.

702
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,320
Oh...

703
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,840
So you are a human being, a mate, or is that also a human being, Atlanta?

704
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:25,840


705
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:25,840


706
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,260
Yes, you are an animal being.

707
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:27,760
Oh, what am i?

708
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,380
Listen to me, won't you listen to me?

709
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,820
When God is watching, we watch him back

710
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,620
We see right through his disguise

711
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,900
He tries to scare us with angry words

712
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,860
But we all know that they're lies

713
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,660
The world is waiting

714
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,880
Just see the fear in their eyes

715
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,460
The world is watching

716
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:22,600
We watch him back

717
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,560
He comes holding every move

718
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,580
Is it forgetting or the end?

719
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,440
Just like the chess game

720
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,200
But so intense

721
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,960
That I just don't understand

722
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,140
Anticipation

723
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,940
It's much too big to pretend

724
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,680
Wake up, it's 1984

725
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,600
Wake up, but we've been here

726
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:52,600


727
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,560
Wake up, it's 1984

728
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,020
Wake up, but we've been here before

729
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:10,580
Wake up, it's 1984

730
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,660
Big brother's screaming

731
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,900
But we don't care

732
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,540
Cause he's got nothing to say

733
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,600
Think of the future

734
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,520
Think of the prophecy

735
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,220
Think of the children of today

736
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,320
Big brother's marching

737
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,540
So we all stand in his way

738
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,300
Open your eyes

739
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,600
Look at the world

740
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,840
And see the signs

741
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,040
So walk away

742
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,020
All in your heart

743
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,880
Try to remember

744
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,820
Two worlds apart

745
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,600
It's all gone away

746
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,780
But to your angel as a planet

747
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:54,820
Here to see the light

748
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,740
Be a必�르� dwarf

749
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:56,920
We look back

750
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,720
But who doesn't notice

751
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,300
an answer

752
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,880
This is but a phase

753
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,300
In the cycle

754
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,340
Of space

755
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:04,700
My dream will never take no place

756
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:04,900
The calmness realize

757
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,380
But the dance

758
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:05,700
Is a gift

759
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:12,480
Yeah, I'm afraid

760
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:12,480


761
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,960
To be the one

762
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:13,960


763
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,220
That takes away

764
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:15,220


765
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,500
My trouble

766
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:19,500


767
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:19,700
When I have

768
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:22,600


769
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:22,600


770
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,560
Leading up to the slay

771
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,500
Watching the world

772
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,900
Wake up, wake up

773
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,980
Wake up, wake up

774
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,300
Open your eyes

775
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,180
Surrounded by the new disguise

776
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,200
So far away

777
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,340
Open your eyes

778
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,200
Try to remember

779
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,040
Two worlds apart

780
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,920
But so far away

781
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,800
Wake up, it's 1984

782
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,440
Wake up, but we've been here before

783
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,880
Wake up, it's 1984

784
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,340
Wake up, but we've been here before

785
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,180
The world is watching

786
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,520
Anticipating

787
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,080
The big brothers marching

788
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,700
Losing forgetting

789
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:20,780
Losing forgetting

790
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,340
The world is turning

791
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,320
Losing 500

792
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:28,320


793
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:28,680
We've taken back

794
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,160
You can't think civilization

795
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,400
But portable

796
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,300
It's the journey

797
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,120
To the better

798
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,540
Doesn't remain

799
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,320
You mentioned

800
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,000
I've never seen

801
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,560
queria

802
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,940
Sentiment in my life

803
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,180
And now as you leave

804
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,180


805
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,300
interaction

806
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:49,900
Diddy Boy.

807
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,260
That's not what we've been

808
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,940
doing before.

809
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,640
Oingo Boingo did that.

810
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,760
And now this.

811
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,700
Dave, thanks to the heroic efforts

812
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,860
of the great Mr. Sister,

813
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,420
your butt has been

814
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,620
saved from a hanging.

815
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,440
Really?

816
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:17,900
Yep.

817
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,880
And it's hanging down in my car.

818
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,320
Really?

819
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:20,780
Yep.

820
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,160
Really?

821
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,880
It'll run.

822
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,540
Really?

823
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,000
Yeah, your butt runs again.

824
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:24,520
Really?

825
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,620
Thanks, Mr. Sister.

826
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,500
Fixed your butt.

827
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:26,900
Really?

828
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,260
He saved the wand over it.

829
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,320
He said there were cat hairs

830
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,020
all clustered around the...

831
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,560
Dig this, Dave.

832
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,080
There's tons of cat hairs here.

833
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,860
You're going to love this.

834
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,860
I just washed a bunch.

835
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,660
When you turned it on

836
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,400
and the DOS screen came up

837
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,580
and you thought everything

838
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,320
was messed up,

839
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,540
all you had to do was type

840
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,560
slash W-I-N

841
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,920
and then hit enter.

842
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,320
No, that didn't work.

843
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,720
That didn't work.

844
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,100
Oh, really?

845
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:51,520
No.

846
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,840
It worked for Mr. Sister

847
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,800
on your butt.

848
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,500
See, for Dave, it was spazzing.

849
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,180
No, it was not doing that.

850
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,580
It was saying

851
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,700
slip disc entry

852
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,780
of your boot vehicle

853
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,720
and stuff about your vertebrae.

854
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,960
It would not say

855
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,580
so you go

856
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,180
and then you go

857
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,320
W-I-N, enter.

858
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:05,920
No.

859
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,700
Maybe it just needed

860
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,840
to be carried around

861
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,040
in a car for a while.

862
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,860
Driven around

863
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,960
and wanted to go for a ride.

864
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,380
He had to visit to clean...

865
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,420
Maybe it was the cat hair.

866
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,220
Just needed to clean

867
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:14,820
the cat hair.

868
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,800
I had a four-track

869
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,980
reel-to-reel deck

870
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,780
that would only work

871
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,900
if you drove around with it

872
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,920
on bumpy roads

873
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,140
for about ten minutes.

874
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,380
Then it was fine.

875
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,660
That is a true thing.

876
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,700
Doesn't work anymore.

877
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,200
Some equipment

878
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,860
has possessed...

879
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,900
Maybe it was overheating

880
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,740
because the cat hair

881
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,820
was blocking the fan.

882
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,240
Well, that could be...

883
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,000
That's like practical...

884
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,940
I think it had

885
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,940
the Niels Bohr effect

886
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,920
or whatever they call it

887
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,580
when a scientist

888
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,320
looks at something

889
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,300
and the quantum physics

890
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,960
gets different.

891
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,220
So that's why...

892
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,960
Because he looked at it.

893
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,980
Yeah, and so now they...

894
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,920
The act of observing

895
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,260
changes it.

896
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,460
Yeah, so you had like

897
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,880
this retard looking at it

898
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,200
and maybe it was actually saying,

899
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,320
you know, whatever, you know,

900
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,600
and then...

901
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,700
That's a bunch of new age

902
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,300
gobbledygook days.

903
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,200
So I guess they posted...

904
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,840
Didn't I have

905
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,640
somebody else's rant here?

906
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,580
Put it in the...

907
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,560
Put it in the...

908
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,200
Put it in the...

909
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,920
Put it in the blue blazes.

910
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,600
Put it in the Sam Hill...

911
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,060
Oh, here it is.

912
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,920
This is from

913
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,480
a new subgenius,

914
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,580
or at least new to me,

915
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,080
or she,

916
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,080
I have no idea.

917
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:12,980
Reverend Longdead

918
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,600
Illuminati spy

919
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,360
sent...

920
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,920
this interesting statement

921
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,700
to the scrub genius group

922
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,500
on Google Groups.

923
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,980
That is members only.

924
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,300
In fact, you have to go through me

925
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,640
to get into it.

926
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,100
And this...

927
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,160
Reverend Longdead,

928
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,080
Illuminati spy,

929
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,320
said,

930
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,400
so far...

931
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,520
This is a little bullet list.

932
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,460
So far,

933
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,300
my leftist friends

934
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,700
have decided to start

935
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,800
buying up guns

936
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,820
in preparation

937
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,120
for a QAnon election attack.

938
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,760
Some pretend anarchists

939
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,820
have decided that

940
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,420
provoking a federal response

941
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,700
is the best way

942
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,500
to get Facebook likes.

943
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,880
President Trump

944
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,800
acted exactly

945
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,900
how we all knew

946
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,540
he would act

947
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,760
and sent in

948
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,800
federal officers

949
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,860
as his own

950
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,980
personal thugs.

951
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,680
Everyone is pretending

952
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,940
all the abuses of power

953
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,800
aren't from the WTO

954
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,540
protest playbook

955
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,660
and are a brand new thing.

956
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,740
So far,

957
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,420
also,

958
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,740
having the audacity

959
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,460
to point out

960
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,320
that most attempts

961
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,380
at Marxism

962
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,220
have resulted

963
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,800
in more oppressive societies

964
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,580
gets you labeled

965
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,600
a fascist.

966
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,020
Meanwhile,

967
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,340
protests around

968
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,460
legitimate problems

969
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,180
in the U.S.

970
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,120
are getting drowned out

971
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,020
because middle class kids

972
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,160
just want to vent

973
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,860
their unfocused anger.

974
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,760
The founders

975
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,280
of the national level

976
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,340
Black Lives Matter movement

977
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,440
want Mao-style culture

978
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,200
to be a cultural revolution

979
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,600
but have changed

980
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,940
every instance of

981
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,080
class in Marxist theory

982
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,800
to race.

983
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,760
So far,

984
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,000
no one is acting

985
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,400
the slightest rationality

986
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,700
on either side.

987
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,020
Only emotion

988
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,880
and embellished storytelling

989
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,020
are ruling the day.

990
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,260
Meanwhile,

991
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,580
Reverend Longdeck says,

992
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,100
we actually need

993
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,520
to

994
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,320
to get some

995
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,320


996
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,760
can take

997
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,540
dill

998
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:24,540


999
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:34,940
seriously.

1000
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,740
To this end,

1001
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:41,980
I canld

1002
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,860
if you

1003
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:42,880
ever

1004
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,200
do

1005
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:43,460
this

1006
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,940
thing

1007
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,360
here,

1008
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:44,680
I'm

1009
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:44,700
down

1010
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:44,740
the descub

1011
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:44,940
if everything

1012
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,900
but for anyone in their 20s and younger.

1013
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,460
Serious education around civics and critical thinking.

1014
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,660
Good luck on that one.

1015
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,720
And finally, for the left,

1016
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,920
to quit thinking they can only focus on one thing at a time

1017
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,620
and to realize you don't need ideological purity.

1018
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,860
But screw all that.

1019
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:13,180
You can't tribalize and feel superior over easily identified others.

1020
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,240
So let's ignore those things.

1021
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,580
Instead, let's focus on categories we've already tried to establish are arbitrary

1022
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,980
and then split into factions over those.

1023
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,240
That'll show them.

1024
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:33,960
So, I thought that was reasonable from a subgenius.

1025
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,740
Price Bob, and now this.

1026
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:43,640
I am.

1027
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,960
What is Dobstown?

1028
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,080
What is, then, Dobstown?

1029
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,780
It is the stuff that dreams are made of.

1030
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,260
It's what makes Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys fly.

1031
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,640
It powers the Starship Enterprise.

1032
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:12,600
It's the hidden code in Windows and Mac OS.

1033
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,640
Though not yet available in Linux.

1034
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,880
It's the general oblivion created when the moon dance strikes the cornea of your head.

1035
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,040
Dobstown.

1036
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:26,200
It's the cancer-causing, teeth-staining, smelly, pukey habit.

1037
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,780
It's the drug that helps you find God.

1038
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,320
It's the lonely night before it never, never ends.

1039
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,100
Dobstown.

1040
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,460
It is your brain on drugs.

1041
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,740
It's learning to work as a team and as a slave.

1042
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,160
It's where there is a lake in which results...

1043
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:48,240
It is the sword excalibur kept by the lady of the lake, Connie Dobbs.

1044
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,900
And if you think it's hard to pull that stone from out of that sword out of that lake,

1045
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,500
it's easier to pull a fig from a donkey's anus.

1046
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,460
Dobstown.

1047
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,640
It is where all the flowers have gone.

1048
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,020
It is the home of John Dillinger's real penis.

1049
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:06,620
Dobstown.

1050
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:12,500
It is a mystery, wrapped in an enigma, smothered with sauteed mushrooms and onions in a savory gravy.

1051
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,160
Mmmmm.

1052
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:13,680
Dobstown.

1053
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:21,540
It is John Dillinger's penis, savaged in muscular gravy and surrounded by mushroom people.

1054
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:23,980
Dobstown.

1055
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,540
The home of both Lemurians and Cenobites.

1056
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,720
My proper home.

1057
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,840
I'm going back someday.

1058
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,720
I've got to get back to my home.

1059
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,160
Dobstown.

1060
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,540
It's near the coast of Honalee and the land of Fredonia.

1061
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,160
Dobstown.

1062
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:43,160


1063
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,660
Dobstown.

1064
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:55,460
It's the world's largest producer of manna, ambrosia, froth, and the green stuff that Dave injects into the brain to reanimate dead tissue.

1065
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:00,620
Spiritual bliss with open-loam bowling every night from midnight to dawn.

1066
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:02,680
Dobstown.

1067
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,120
It's the residence of J.R. Bob Dobbs, part of the year.

1068
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,440
It's creamy and crunchy.

1069
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,360
It tastes great and is less filling.

1070
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,340
It is margarine and it is butter.

1071
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:20,380
But if it were to fall into enemy hands, it would mean the destruction of us all.

1072
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:25,420
Ah yes, Stang, but it is the downfall of us all.

1073
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:30,980
And it tastes bad on bread because, man, those that go don't come back.

1074
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,180
They're losers. Losers.

1075
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,460
No, man, those who graduate from Dobstown come back changed.

1076
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,280
In a new form.

1077
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,340
You can't see them like you can see a man.

1078
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:42,560
I don't see the others.

1079
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,340
They don't move or talk.

1080
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:48,900
Graduated like the chrysalis to the elf all the way up to a higher being.

1081
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,540
They grow and grow.

1082
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:58,600
Their tiny skin's hardly large enough to pop them as they begin expanding into that new form.

1083
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:01,840
Dobstown!

1084
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,760
It's where UFOs are not just a fact of life.

1085
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,580
They're the law.

1086
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,120
Of course it's a law here.

1087
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,600
Of course it's a law.

1088
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,800
Everyone needs to live by laws, by rules.

1089
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,620
We need to have our lives governed by...

1090
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,960
Dobstown!

1091
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:27,380
It's where the bad little girls and boys go.

1092
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,500
It's where something is happening all the time and most of it unsolved.

1093
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,300
Some of it is so hard to locate.

1094
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:37,560
Some of it is so hard to locate.

1095
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:37,560


1096
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:43,400
Many of the people from the Saucership Emblem itself have been sucked out and left here.

1097
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,720
Dobstown.

1098
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,980
I didn't want them to be oblique.

1099
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:55,120
When they were strapped me down in a chair and started asking me questions about Dobstown,

1100
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:01,040
I gave them literally a location but the website...

1101
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:02,820
Dobstown.

1102
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,540
It's Nwatsbaud spelled backwards.

1103
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,560
It's Brigadoon without the haggis.

1104
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,980
It is surrounded by the seven cities of Cibola, which are its slums.

1105
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,540
And it has a ferry to Monster Island.

1106
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,460
And what a delightful pair of individuals you'll never find there.

1107
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,240
The ferries of Monster Island.

1108
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,780
Tiny little happy people who do things for other people.

1109
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,820
Who live for other people.

1110
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,280
So big are their hearts and so tiny is their stature.

1111
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,120
They can't get it.

1112
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:39,900
Dobstown!

1113
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,540
That's where Amelia Earhart crashed, friends.

1114
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,640
It's where the Tunguska meteorite came out after bouncing around inside the earth for a while.

1115
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,320
Yes, if you're waiting for another salubrious comment to someway illuminate that stupid passage.

1116
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,920
Just read it again, Stang.

1117
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,020
Just see what you just said.

1118
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,020
What, the Dobstown is where the Tunguska meteorite came out?

1119
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,260
After bouncing around inside the planet?

1120
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:13,240
The Tunguska meteorite was, of course, as you know from reading your book of the subgenius, Dave, was a miniature black hole.

1121
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,960
Shot by Dobbs, the young ten-year-old J.R. Bob Dobbs from his slingshot.

1122
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,940
In a fit of rage?

1123
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,940
No, he didn't even know he was doing it.

1124
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:31,660
It was just, you know, he picked up a, other kids might pick up a pebble or a cat skull for their slingshot.

1125
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,620
What would Bob pick up? A tiny black hole.

1126
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,120
A pretzel.

1127
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,200
A singularity.

1128
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,700
A singularity.

1129
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:42,720
A glowing essence of nothingness sucking in all that is not Bob.

1130
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,620
And that is what he shot into the Tunguska plains of Siberia.

1131
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,900
And then past the event horizon, the little thing itself went and then became like a bigger thing?

1132
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:01,440
And it went into the earth, Bob's tiny black hole did, and it bounced around like a cue ball on a pool table.

1133
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,600
Back and forth until finally it exited the earth.

1134
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,000
And it exited at the place we now know as Dobbs Town.

1135
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,600
Dobbs Town, friends.

1136
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,860
It is where a thing of beauty is a joy for a while.

1137
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,660
It's where you are better than you were in high school.

1138
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,780
It's where you get all the pets you ever wanted.

1139
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,880
It was never a colony of France.

1140
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,480
It is where science and magic are the same things.

1141
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,640
It is the unfolding of miscalculations.

1142
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,220
Wow.

1143
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:38,140
It is the dawning of the height, weight, hair, and eye color of Aquarius.

1144
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,340
It is the fizzling, crackling of new horizons for man.

1145
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:48,160
It is the dissonant fifth vortex disrupting the harmonic convergence.

1146
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,480
It's where the early worm gets away.

1147
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,300
It's where the gravediggers leave their shoes in the middle of the night.

1148
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,960
Dobbs Town.

1149
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,040
It's for when you're too lazy to kill yourself.

1150
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,360
Dobbs Town.

1151
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,820
Where there are no lawyers.

1152
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,380
And where the government never tries to be helpful.

1153
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,340
Dobbs Town, friends.

1154
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,640
It's where you can make your imaginary friends fight to the death.

1155
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,120
Dobbs Town.

1156
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,120
It's between the dark and daylight.

1157
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,640
When the night is beginning to lower.

1158
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,280
It is where neither heredity nor environment matter.

1159
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,220
Yeah, I feel you.

1160
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:35,440
It's where the lamb and the lion lay down and have sex together, friends.

1161
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,180
You cannot think.

1162
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,840
Dobbs Town.

1163
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,480
You can only follow and listen.

1164
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:47,260
It is proof that hell is full and the dead walk the earth.

1165
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,740
The fabric is one thing like yourself.

1166
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,060
One thread that could lead to thousands of other threads.

1167
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:13,280
That is our caustic solution for you as members of this solemn group gathered together, squandered and quashed and pushed under heavy stone so that you may not know the truth that we speak.

1168
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,460
And yet here we are speaking it to you.

1169
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:25,380
Dobbs Town is not a place where a man or woman dwells, but a place in the heart as big as that mighty elephant yoke.

1170
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,120
And twice as tasty as all the trees.

1171
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,260
That you could imagine.

1172
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:33,300
Now imagination is not a place you want to stay.

1173
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:39,160
It's not a place you want to bring the kids, grandma, ride the ferris wheel with.

1174
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,840
It's not the kind of place you want to leave for a better home.

1175
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,740
It's a place you visit over and over again.

1176
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:53,100
With your pants on, your pants off, and your heart ripped right out hanging from your chest.

1177
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,100
Dobbs Town.

1178
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,100
Dobbs Town.

1179
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:03,740
Where Bob comes home after an easy day's work.

1180
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,700
And where you can come home too, friends.

1181
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,920
Where you'll be home.

1182
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,600
Where you'll finally realize why.

1183
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,220
Why.

1184
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,480
Why.

1185
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:23,540
And why you can find out more about beautiful Dobbs Town when you join the Church of the Subgenius.

1186
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,960
The world's only first, true, last, final...

1187
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,080
I'd like you to stop.

1188
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,200
...tapping me on the head with...

1189
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:30,500
One true religion.

1190
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,180
Because it admits it is full of crap.

1191
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:35,680
It is paid for by the nuts.

1192
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,380
It is the only one that's not full of crap!

1193
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,520
...and the contrite.

1194
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,000
And I know it's coming each time I can tell it.

1195
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,000
You tell it.

1196
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,020
Ah, ah, ah, go.

1197
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:55,280
It's where Enio Morricone was delivered of his inspiration for this music in the background.

1198
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,340
Huge, huge mandibles.

1199
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,820
Large, large, fresh, gamy legs.

1200
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:06,840
And now the matador Dobbs steps out before the enraged triceratops dinosaur.

1201
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:12,020
Flashing his red Dobbs-headed cape in front of the maddened beast.

1202
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,480
The furious creature stomps its feet and paws at the ground.

1203
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,060
Dobbs grins. He smokes. The creature charges.

1204
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:25,980
Dobbs whips out his pipe and gives it a little conk on the noggin as it runs by.

1205
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,820
And after that...

1206
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,720
It sits and pants like a little puppy dog.

1207
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:51,520
From PR News in Washington, I'm forcing dozens of German auto executives in Glacier National Park to either reroute or hunker down in a Confederate country chalet.

1208
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,960
Liberal activists say they're white nationalists in some art.

1209
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,420
In opposition stronghold...

1210
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,880
PR News, fire.

1211
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:04,980
The owner of one of the world's largest amateur-built submarines announced...

1212
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,800
This is PR News in Washington.

1213
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,240
Thank you, Leimur.

1214
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:20,340
And thank you, the participants of 23X Day on Zoom, as hosted by the good Professor Pressure.

1215
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,160
Ah, yes.

1216
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:25,080
Friends, I have some news.

1217
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:35,160
The controversial Dr. Argus Fawkes has established a new subgenius network using the Discord program.

1218
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,620
Or platform, I should say.

1219
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:44,120
And it might well link everything subgeniously together in that futuristic way that I don't really understand.

1220
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:48,780
The name of this network is Dobbs Chord.

1221
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:53,760
And the secret key URL is...

1222
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,920
Discord.subgeniuses.com

1223
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:06,140
That's Discord.subgeniuses.com

1224
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,500
Not subgenius.com.

1225
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,820
Dr. Fawkes...

1226
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,640
Most people mispronounce his name as Faux because of the way it's spelled.

1227
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,540
Uh, but he's not French.

1228
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:22,820
Uh, Dr. Fawkes wisely nabbed subgeniuses.com.

1229
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:23,920
A while back.

1230
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:30,980
Uh, the other new network, and it's much older, like a year older, is Dobbs.town.

1231
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:35,480
Which is like Facebook for subgeniuses, but it's not on Facebook.

1232
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,240
It's on Mastodon, so it's...

1233
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,400
Less onerous.

1234
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:45,900
It was founded by a doctor, uncle, onan cannabite, and he's the mayor of Dobbs.town.

1235
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:51,620
You might want to check it out, although technically it's supposed to be for authorized subgenius ministers only.

1236
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,420
As seen at subgenius.com.

1237
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,900
Yeah, Dobbs.town.

1238
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,180
That's the URL.

1239
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:07,340
Friends, these are strange times, uh, that I sort of expected for much of my life, but not this way.

1240
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,180
It's actually even more stupid than we expected.

1241
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,400
WAY more stupid.

1242
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,220
But, I guess that's the way of Jehovah One.

1243
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,540
Uh, Bob can only continue to guide us through.

1244
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,760
And we can only follow Bob's lead.

1245
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,000
Yeah, I mean, even when he's blindfolded.

1246
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,680
So praise Dobbs, and let there be slack.

1247
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,160
At subgenius.com.

1248
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,220
From PR News in Washington, I'm reporting.

1249
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:47,020
Judge A. Wallace Tashima said both the enactment and enforcement of the statewide ban on PR studies were motivated by PR News.

1250
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,540
On Wall Street 7221.

1251
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,940
May 27, 824.

1252
00:58:52,440 --> 00:59:02,020
A photo released by North Korea suggests Pyongyang is working on more advanced PR News that could, in theory, reach parts of the U.S. mainland.

1253
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,640
North Korean state media say this is PR News.

1254
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,980
This is aéd Sage.

1255
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,540
The Press Inflation Goods Network on Pания本部
