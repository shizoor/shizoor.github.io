00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,300
Run. Get out of here.

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,780
Save yourself.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,020
The tapping of a blind person's cane,

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,300
an ancient symbol of mystery and dread.

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,040
Yet what is the mystery about blindness?

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,200
By the tens of thousands, we, the members of the National Federation of the Blind,

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,840
are living ordinary lives every day.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm an air traffic controller, have been ever since the big strike

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,860
when they really needed people bad.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,780
Unlike other controllers, I've received a reputation for remaining calm,

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,920
even when my planes disappear from the screen.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,600
I don't see what the big deal is.

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,800
The NFB has really helped me out.

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,640
Better get back to work.

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,920
For further information, contact your local chapter of the National Federation of the Blind.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,420
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry,

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,680
our radio.

21
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,560
The film is shown to you not only for the benefit of your own personal good health,

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,420
but for that of your entire unit.

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,820
Lights out.

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,680
Some of the things that you'll soon see are highly spectacular.

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,900
But let me assure you that they are authentic in every respect

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,340
and are dramatic proof of the excellence built into your subgenius.

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,340
Now, see for yourself and take what you find here

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,000
and put it to work.

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,680
I am authorized to assure you that so far there is no reasonable cause for alarm.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,960
Cover yourself with wet newspapers and lie still until the blast has subsided.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh my God.

32
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,160
Have no fear.

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,860
You will not be hypnotized.

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,160
You will not lose consciousness.

35
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,660
Nor will you be made uncomfortable in any way.

36
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,600
Bob?

37
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,300
Bob?

38
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,000
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,020
Every time you say, see, hear, or think

40
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,780
Bob?

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,660
That's your key phrase.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,220
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

43
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,220
I think it leads to demon possession.

44
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,680
And the reason I come to that conclusion is because there's a warning on subliminal tapes right now.

45
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,960
And it says that when people watch this, the warning says that it can lead to seizures.

46
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,940
It's so new, it's almost too new to be true.

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,040
Kill, kill that.

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,360
And it prepares their mind for the slate-like impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,620
You know, by golly, he's absolutely right.

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,400
Wake up, puppet boy!

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,400
The farmer in the dell, the farmer in the dell

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,160
I hold the dairy, oh, the farmer in the dell

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,700
Well, Mr. White, let's listen to the song backwards.

54
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,080
Oh, I'm really intimidated.

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:37,040
I would kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy.

56
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,880
And now, Mr. White, do you have any comment?

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,840
The farmer in the dell is one of my favorite songs.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,360
I was referring to the other lyrics, your lyrics, the subconscious lyrics.

59
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,160
Now, don't you think it's a little dangerous?

60
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,380
Dangerous? How? I mean, they're just lyrics.

61
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,640
Well, telling kids to kill their mothers.

62
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,180
Hey, now, wait a minute. We didn't tell kids to kill their mothers.

63
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,920
That was the artist expressing his own personal feelings, no one else's.

64
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,660
Besides, no one takes that stuff seriously.

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,780
It could happen.

66
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,360
It could happen? Well, sure, it could happen.

67
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,860
My molecules could line up with those in the chair and I could fall through, but it's very unlikely.

68
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,080
All right. Perhaps we should draw on a more direct example.

69
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,780
Now, how about this selection?

70
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,040
Yankee Doodle went to town riding on a pony

71
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,360
Stuck a feather in his head and called it mother.

72
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,360
Oh, yeah.

73
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,420
All right. Sounds harmless enough, but now let's listen backwards.

74
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,520
Why steal when you can kill?

75
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,920
Why steal when you can kill?

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,240
Why steal when you can kill?

77
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,900
Mr. White, you're telling kids to kill.

78
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,600
Oh, come on. That was a rhetorical question.

79
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,400
I don't see you defending us for discouraging thievery now.

80
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,120
Now, you're just trying to lower shoplifting losses, which proves you do expect subliminal messages to have an effect on listeners.

81
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,460
Oh, that doesn't prove anything.

82
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,940
What it proves is that I don't like you.

83
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,220
I've got a friend who's a salesman and he listens to subliminal tapes.

84
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,700
One of the areas that they use them, though, a lot is in children's books.

85
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,460
And Shel Silverstein writes a lot of pornography, but also he writes a lot of children's books.

86
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,360
We must stop it. Mankind hangs in the balance.

87
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,220
It's just crazy enough to work.

88
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,580
Kill sex.

89
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,440
As some people think, oh, this church, they think, oh, this church is subgenius.

90
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,320
Subgenius is a joke.

91
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,700
A funny joke.

92
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,320
Well, if it's a joke, it is the joke you had better believe in.

93
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,980
The joke you have to take seriously.

94
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,220
But people say, who is this man, this man Bob?

95
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,060
Many don't believe in Bob because they don't have enough faith in themselves to believe there could be something as good as Bob.

96
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,540
He's too good for them.

97
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,720
He is, you've heard the traveling salesman jokes of ancient mythology.

98
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,320
They are based on this historic person.

99
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:54,060
We've gone in search of historic Dobbs, and as you've seen on that video, there is no question about him.

100
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:01,780
But the important thing that people miss is that, well, by the name subgenius, you might be able to guess this if you thought twice.

101
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,420
Bob is not smart.

102
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,220
He is not the greatest salesman in the world because he's smart.

103
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,440
He's lucky.

104
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,320
As Bob said, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

105
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,020
Now that makes sense to me.

106
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,460
So it's not intelligence, but just sense that we're after.

107
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,300
Common sense, sense of humor, and dollars and cents.

108
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,100
Oh yes, there's some out there that have been studying up.

109
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,080
There's a Bob on my mudflap.

110
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,920
There's a Bob on my hood.

111
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,300
There's a Bob on my rear view.

112
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,380
And it sure makes me feel good.

113
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,860
There's a Bob on my dashboard.

114
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,880
There's a Bob on my trunk.

115
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,660
There's a tiny little Bob head on my steering wheel.

116
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,160
And he drives when I'm drunk.

117
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,880
I said, Bobface.

118
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,960
Bobface.

119
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:15,100
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that Bobface every place.

120
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,200
Bobface.

121
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,160
Bobface.

122
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,260
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that Bobface every place.

123
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,400
It says, Bob on my license plate.

124
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,180
It says, Bob on my bumper.

125
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:44,520
I got a tiny little Bobface on my battery cables when I need a jumper.

126
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,080
There's a Bob on my mailbox.

127
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,120
There's a Bob on my street.

128
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,380
I even got tiny little Bobfaces tattooed on the bottom of my feet.

129
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,140
I said, Bobface.

130
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,320
Bobface.

131
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,360
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that Bobface every place.

132
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,500
Bobface.

133
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,500


134
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,500


135
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,500


136
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,500


137
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,980
Bobface.

138
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,960
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that Bobface every place.

139
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,900
There's a Bob on my shirt.

140
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,000
There's a Bob on my tie.

141
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:41,260
There'll be a Bobface on my gravestone when I die.

142
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,440
There's a Bob on my wallet.

143
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,600
There's a Bob on my cap.

144
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,640
There's a little smiling Bobface on the place I like to crap.

145
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,440
I said, Bobface.

146
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,440
Bobface.

147
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,000
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that Bobface every place.

148
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,440
I said, Bobface.

149
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,440
Bobface.

150
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,400
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that Bobface every place.

151
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,060
One more time, sing it.

152
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,500
Bobface.

153
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,340
Yeah, you hope I'm fast, yeah.

154
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,320
I'm a awesome singer through everything.

155
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,100
Yeah.

156
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,540
You hope I'm fast, yeah.

157
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm a awesome singer through everything.

158
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,820
Yeah, when you're all so high, you think about the noise in the high.

159
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,980
Where is there the time to shine?

160
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,920
You know it.

161
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,020
Yeah.

162
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,800
You hope I'm fast, yeah.

163
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,420
You hope I'm fast, yeah.

164
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,100
Thank you.

165
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,940
Thank you.

166
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,740
Thank you.

167
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,840
Thank you.

168
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,160
Thank you.

169
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,340
Thank you.

170
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,580
Thank you.

171
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,040
Thank you.

172
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,980
Thank you.

173
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,600
Thank you.

174
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,160
Thank you.

175
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,260
Thank you.

176
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,740
Thank you.

177
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,480
Thank you.

178
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,260
Thank you.

179
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,740
Thank you.

180
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:01,900
Thank you.

181
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:01,980


182
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:01,980


183
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,000


184
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,000


185
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,000


186
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,000


187
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,460
take it easy,

188
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,680
The colors are wrong.

189
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,400
The colors are wrong.

190
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,740
nude Arizona contest.

191
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,700
Oh.

192
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,960
This is supposed to be,

193
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,480
I thought this was

194
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,320
a cut her in half here.

195
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,720
Oh, jeez, Dave,

196
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,920
this is a chainsaw competition

197
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,580
that follows, you know,

198
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,920
led by the feminist

199
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,720
raincoat brigade.

200
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,860
And, uh,

201
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,900
the fact is,

202
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,580
it's too late.

203
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,160
But if you're not fat-brained,

204
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,920
and if you're thinking

205
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,160
from the rear end of the rain,

206
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,040
wise up.

207
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,060
The Subgenius Show

208
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,980
has the only answer.

209
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,500
So, uh,

210
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,340
we're going.

211
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,320
Oh, God.

212
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,200
What does it mean?

213
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,140
Oh, God.

214
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,500
Play old rock and roll, man.

215
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,920
Let us see what...

216
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,660
Hello, friends,

217
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,160
and welcome.

218
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,680
Tonight's sermon

219
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,500
is entitled

220
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,380
The Love of Bob.

221
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,740
The Love of Bob.

222
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,920
That's L-U-V-U-S-O-V.

223
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,400
And I mean by that

224
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,940
the greatest of all love.

225
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,280
I'm not talking about

226
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,940
that love you see on TV

227
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,360
or in the movies

228
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,580
or read about in the back section

229
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,700
of the magazine rack.

230
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm not talking about sex.

231
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,700
If you don't already know about sex,

232
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
you're in the wrong church, friends.

233
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,600
Go to one of them

234
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
non-industrial churches

235
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,760
if you're afraid of sex.

236
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,920
Everyone here should be experts

237
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,160
in intercourse.

238
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,920
But we don't want your mind, friends.

239
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,820
Here at the Church of the Subgenius,

240
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,580
our heads are big enough as it is.

241
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,840
No, what we want

242
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,000
is your money.

243
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,480
And we don't want your money

244
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,240
for ourselves.

245
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,300
No, no, no.

246
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,440
We want it

247
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,840
so that you won't.

248
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,280
That's right, friends.

249
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,680
There's nothing wrong

250
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,560
with having money.

251
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,760
J.R. Bob Dobbs' very own words said,

252
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,560
in money we trust.

253
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,120
No, friends,

254
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,680
the problem is wanting money.

255
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,120
Like the good book he says,

256
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,680
the love of money

257
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,260
is the root to all slacklessness.

258
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,020
See, a lot of folks think

259
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,860
the saying is

260
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,640
money is the root.

261
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,060
But that's just

262
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,440
disinformation, friends,

263
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,840
put out by the conspiracy

264
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,380
in order to confuse you.

265
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,760
It's the love of money

266
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,380
that loses you slack.

267
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,560
And believe me,

268
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,360
if there's one

269
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,320
subject in the conspiracy

270
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,940
wants to confuse you with,

271
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,000
it's the desire for money.

272
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,140
Because it's that desire for cash

273
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,980
that fuels the conspiracy

274
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,120
and enslaves 99.9%

275
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,940
of the human race.

276
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,100
And yes,

277
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,340
even a few unwary subgenius.

278
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,660
You get so wrapped up

279
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,040
chasing those pieces of paper around

280
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,260
that you're too busy to see

281
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,580
the conspiracy has got you

282
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,600
wrapped around its little finger,

283
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,800
heart, body, and soul.

284
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,400
You're so busy working for money

285
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,720
that you forgot money

286
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,340
you're supposed to be working for.

287
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:40,960
You're supposed to work for you.

288
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,680
And that's the good news, friends.

289
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,580
There is a way out of the rat race

290
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,680
through the conspiracy money made.

291
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,120
There is a key.

292
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,080
There is an answer.

293
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,340
And J.R. Bob Dobbs

294
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,180
has often thought aloud,

295
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,480
life is a game.

296
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,480
And you can play by their rules

297
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,980
or you can play by your own rules.

298
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,240
But if you play by your own rules, friends,

299
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,040
you can always get away with cheating.

300
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,240
That's right.

301
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,160
See, the conspiracy

302
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,320
has got you trapped in a trap.

303
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,280
You're going around that monopoly board, friends,

304
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,620
in circles, hoping to pass gold

305
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,880
and collect that lousy $200.

306
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,020
You're just trying to last

307
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,200
until the end of the week, friends,

308
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,780
trying to collect that chintzy little ass paycheck,

309
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,100
praying all the while

310
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,980
not to land on someone else's property,

311
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,120
especially if they have hotels.

312
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,660
Yes, sir, after that happens a few times,

313
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,200
it's game over now, isn't it?

314
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,720
That's because they've got you

315
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,600
playing by their rules.

316
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,300
But why not make up a few of your own rules?

317
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,420
It's only fair.

318
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,700
Why should the conspiracy

319
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,600
get to monopolize all the laws?

320
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,020
It's supposed to be a democracy.

321
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,720
Hell, you already got free parking now, friends.

322
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,840
What does that tell you?

323
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,020
And we know how good it feels

324
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,820
to land on that free parking now, don't we,

325
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,400
when you collect that big pot of money in the middle?

326
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,600
Yes, sirree.

327
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,020
But do you think they, the conspiracy,

328
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,480
would let you enjoy that little bit of slack deliberately?

329
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,840
Hell, no!

330
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,800
It was J.R. Bob's job's idea.

331
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,300
And it paid off.

332
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,420
It pissed them off so much

333
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,660
that they expressly forbid the practice

334
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,720
in their rule book.

335
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,660
I kid you not.

336
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,040
Look it up if you doubt it.

337
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,900
You know what they, the conspiracy, say should happen

338
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,000
when you land on free parking?

339
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,100
Nothing!

340
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,480
Nothing at all!

341
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,580
That's right!

342
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,240
It's just supposed to be free parking.

343
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,580
Like a day of rest, Sunday, to pacify you.

344
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,260
So you'll calm down and then go around the board

345
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:33,940
for another week

346
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,020
and put up with the conspiracy bullsh-t.

347
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,040
Well, friends, that's not good enough now, is it?

348
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,440
Hell, no.

349
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,320
That's not how Bob Dobbs plays the game.

350
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,100
And that's not how you have to play it either.

351
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,580
But some of you out there are probably wondering,

352
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,860
and you're thinking aloud,

353
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,760
Father Joe Mama,

354
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,360
how come Bob's changed that rule for us,

355
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,640
but he hasn't changed the other rules?

356
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,320
Well, friends, I'm glad you asked that.

357
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,120
Because Bob wants you to think for yourself.

358
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,340
He doesn't want to rule your lives,

359
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,460
but he doesn't want the conspiracy to rule it either.

360
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,540
He wants you to rule your own life.

361
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,120
And that's why he's giving you a hand

362
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,420
instead of a hand

363
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:09,800
out.

364
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,860
Like Bob Dobbs said many a time,

365
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,480
you can lead a man to slack,

366
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,260
but you can't make him use it.

367
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,660
He doesn't want to lease you slack.

368
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,760
He wants you to own your very own.

369
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,240
The next rule to break is up to you.

370
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,020
Imagine the possibilities.

371
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,500
Why not agree that when you land on someone else's property,

372
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,240
you give each other slack?

373
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,020
No fees, no fines,

374
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,080
just good neighborly hospitality.

375
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,220
Or better yet, make the state pay the fees.

376
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,380
And abolish taxes while you're at it.

377
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,420
You can do it, friends.

378
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,060
You make the rules.

379
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,940
Remember free parking?

380
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,120
The possibilities are endless.

381
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,540
Now instead of trading going around the block,

382
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,660
you're actually looking forward to it.

383
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,920
Now you're having fun with the game

384
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,860
instead of the game having fun with you.

385
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,080
Now instead of minding the masters,

386
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,780
you become master of your own mind.

387
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,060
Now instead of being a board player,

388
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,780
you're chairman of the board.

389
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,920
Now every time is your move.

390
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,620
Now you're using the money

391
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,580
instead of the money using you.

392
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,160
Bob turned around all this a long, long time ago, friends.

393
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,700
He also learned that it takes money to make money.

394
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,180
That's exactly what he wants to do now.

395
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,020
Take your money so that you can make more of it.

396
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,000
Show the conspiracy that they no longer have charge of your charge card.

397
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:26,780
Take it out.

398
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,160
Take it out of your wallet right now and cut it in half.

399
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,420
Send it to us, friends.

400
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,000
Be sure to include both halves.

401
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,060
And also avoid cutting it vertically there.

402
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,800
You don't want to damage the Mad Max strike.

403
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,000
We'll burn that sucker for you.

404
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,960
I promise.

405
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,520
Or better yet, just send us cold hard cash.

406
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,740
Or sign checks.

407
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,240
We'll even fill them out for you.

408
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,720
Hell, we don't care about the money.

409
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,940
You think we'd be the first church to pay taxes if we cared about money?

410
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,480
No.

411
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,220
We only want to show the conspiracy you don't care about money.

412
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,600
In fact, I'll personally make sure that money is not spent on anything tangible.

413
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,960
That number is on your screen.

414
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,780
Send that money in and praise Bob, baby.

415
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,460
I'll be right back.

416
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,060
I was sitting on my porch swing the other day

417
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,900
When a woman and a dog came a-walking my way

418
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,220
There was nothing and a straining at the end of the chain

419
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,720
When she yanked it over to the side of the lane

420
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,120
She said, come on, Rover, won't you do it for Mom?

421
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,560
I jumped off my porch and screamed out of my lawn

422
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,440
It's no dog bathroom

423
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,720
No dog bathroom

424
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,320
There's lots of fire hydrants for your dogs and more

425
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,840
Use your super duper poopy scooper out in the park

426
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,380
Right now

427
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,280
Right now

428
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,500
Right across the road you find the forest of trees

429
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,060
Perfect place to wander with that bag of slaves

430
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,420
He can water the plants and mess on the grass

431
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,720
But if he comes around here I'm gonna kick his ass

432
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,620
Cause it's no dog bathroom

433
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,900
No dog bathroom

434
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,160
No dog bathroom

435
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,480
Yeah, it's no dog bathroom

436
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,380
You wanna empty that dog you better find some other place

437
00:24:41,160 --> 00:25:02,100
Yeah, it's no dog bathroom

438
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,100


439
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,540
guitar solo

440
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,460
I was dozing in my backyard

441
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,700
the other night

442
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,760
When I heard a collar jingle

443
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,300
somewhere off to my right

444
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,360
And I felt something wet

445
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,920
trickle over my face

446
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,920
And I heard a voice whisper

447
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,380
from out in the street

448
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,260
It said, come on, Rover

449
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,860
won't you do it for Dad

450
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,540
I jumped up and screamed

451
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,140
man, you're driving me mad

452
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,120
cause there's no dog bathroom

453
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,420
No dog bathroom

454
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:00,740
No dog bathroom

455
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,320
No dog bathroom

456
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,580
Well, the next time your dog

457
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,080
haunts you over my lawn

458
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,140
I'm gonna gather up his goodies

459
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,520
and as soon as he's gone

460
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,000
I'll put him in a paper bag

461
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,200
and follow him home

462
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
I'll sneak up on your porch

463
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,480
and when I'm sure I'm alone

464
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,640
I'll set that bag on fire

465
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,740
and ring your doorbell

466
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,740
When you stomped that out

467
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,500
I'll be laughing like hell

468
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,380
Cause this is your dog bathroom

469
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,680
Your dog bathroom

470
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,940
Your dog bathroom

471
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,240
Well this is your dog bathroom

472
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,060
Do you want to after that dog

473
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,120
You better find some other place

474
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,620
Do you want to after that dog

475
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,780
You better find some other place

476
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
So I got lost the woah ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh woah ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

477
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,300
If you're not careful, stick to your teeth.

478
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,340
You smell like a native for a couple of weeks.

479
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,600
Down in France.

480
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,280
Something's happening out here.

481
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,620
Down in France.

482
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
That's where it was.

483
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,480
Listen, I smelled it.

484
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,060
It went way on down.

485
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,160
And then it smelled like way on down.

486
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,400
That was down in France.

487
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,380
Ooh, smelling funny now.

488
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,900
You've tried beer shampoo.

489
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,720
You've even scrubbed your way from honey to wheat germ.

490
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,460
And came so close with egg shampoo.

491
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:11,620
But at last, the secret fragrance of France is imported to America with semen shampoo.

492
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,780
European women have been using it for years.

493
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,640
And now it comes in a sanitary bottle.

494
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,800
Yes, semen shampoo.

495
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,780
Nothing can quite give you that life-giving shine.

496
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,700
That manageability, that natural must.

497
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,800
It draws men like sharks.

498
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,120
Why not give semen a shot at your hair?

499
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,520
Semen shampoo.

500
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,760
Ask for it by name.

501
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,260
I mean, if you're gonna be on the show and you're gonna talk about the show, you gotta be real loud.

502
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,620
Alright, what have you done to the family?

503
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,500
I'm gonna turn on the vacuum cleaner here and clean up the studio.

504
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,780
No, Doug, put away the vacuum. I know how to handle birds like this.

505
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,160
Oh, okay.

506
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,320
Oh, okay, yeah.

507
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,240
There we go.

508
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,580
Good.

509
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,880
Clean up everything.

510
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,240
Oh, look out.

511
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,220
It's Dr. Dossameter.

512
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,800
He's the chief of the

513
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,120
You should see the beautiful studios at KNON.

514
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,760
We're staying at this show in Texas.

515
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,460
Yeah, this place is kind of antiquated.

516
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,800
Those oxen downstairs turning that beam around provide the motive power for our, uh...

517
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,820
I mean, the towels, the towels in their gym are bigger than the carpet in this room.

518
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,720
We've got a bunch of ape-like creatures pounding rocks downstairs.

519
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
That's the laundry wing of the...

520
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,800
The KPFA, the station that was so poor it had to take in laundry to stay on the air.

521
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,860
The hoof, the focus on the locusts and the whammy.

522
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,320
The

523
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,640
Now, let's go over that again.

524
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,420
You say you saw some sort of monster?

525
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,660
Come, come.

526
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
This is the 20th century.

527
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,400
We've put a man on the moon.

528
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,920
There are no such things as monsters out there.

529
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,700
Or are there?

530
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,380
I'm afraid that's not good enough on this one.

531
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:00,920
Okay.

532
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,800
Yeah, this planet doesn't go in for things like that, mister.

533
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,420
Ha, ha, ha.

534
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,000
I guess we'll have to try something else out.

535
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,000


536
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,000


537
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:22,560


538
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,280


539
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,080
Yep, yep.

540
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,340
Nur, Lebik.

541
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,840
Guess what?

542
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,040
We did it.

543
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,040


544
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,040


545
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,040


546
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,040


547
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,880
What are we doing here?

548
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:46,020
Well, we're on a hill so we can see the river dear.

549
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,360
And we're in the woods so city lights won't interfere.

550
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,500
While we watch.

551
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,360
Watch what?

552
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,520
Watch the race.

553
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,600
What race?

554
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,700
The submarine race.

555
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,720
Oh.

556
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,880
You want to march the lamb?

557
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,400
Walk like you see the stars.

558
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,320
I like Bob.

559
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
I can tell you.

560
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,740
This is such a perverted nation.

561
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,020
I like Bob.

562
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,160
Nobody wants to listen to me.

563
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,520
I like Bob.

564
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,300
I like Bob.

565
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,100
Well, Lorenzo, you think that's great.

566
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,700
I try to tell everybody what's going on.

567
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,160
They won't listen to me.

568
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,980
Well, to tell you the truth.

569
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,880
And you know what?

570
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,800
I can't stand it.

571
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,020
I'm going to die.

572
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,400
Bob loves Lorenzo.

573
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,080
Bob.

574
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:33,500
Bob.

575
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,760
Bob.

576
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,820
My dad.

577
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,080
You got the dog?

578
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,840
Take care of him.

579
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,400
You like Bob?

580
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,280
I like Bob.

581
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,320
It may be the end of the world.

582
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,080
It may be the end of the world.

583
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,380
Don't stop for a thing.

584
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,800
It may be the end of the world.

585
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,020
It's a peaceful space.

586
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,780
It's a peaceful space.

587
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,680
It's a peaceful space.

588
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:18,680


589
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:18,860
Yes, Bob?

590
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,580
Yeah.

591
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,340
Why us?

592
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,620
Well, first get your lines over this side, Bob.

593
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,400
Now, listen, both of you.

594
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,280
To begin, you both know what our energy situation is.

595
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,040
Of course.

596
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:36,720
The last drop of oil was drained out of the entire planet way back in the year 1998, wasn't it?

597
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,340
Yeah.

598
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,600
Besides his own exaggerated humor,

599
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,920
Bob still who can't make his own way.

600
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,500
There was a time when none of us knew the life, wellness, and gun graphics that we haveロ

601
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:00,620
were there still alive to signify the beginning of the entire galaxy's life.

602
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,820
He hadn't Fauld famous skill set in the 80s.

603
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,060
A dis Hinterglaug Tech is now an art new technology.

604
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,600
He brushing away cryptocurrency and Phil Ubik impression that God is taking it easy.

605
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,080
不要像 enslaved Diablo-man You know, those famous words about manifesting

606
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,080


607
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,080


608
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,080


609
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,080


610
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,080


611
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,180
まる

612
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,720
But even if we're trying to make be equal, the choice of a mission is all point in

613
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,880
Man and machine know Chairman Lenny An kindly calliveness.

614
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:24,560
On July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m., the Exists shall make a mass landing on this planet.

615
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:32,140
The children of Bob shall be rewarded at this foretold rupture, this day of judgment,

616
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:45,100
when all those who paid their church dues will be lifted up in power and glory to gain new homes and bodies aboard the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses.

617
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,900
All the while watching the hapless pinks twitch and bleat and wail in the death throes of their world.

618
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:00,520
The last drop of oil was drained out of the entire planet way back in the year 1998, wasn't it?

619
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,240
Fissionable material for any nuclear energy is almost gone.

620
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:10,500
Fossil fuel is exhausted. Wind and tidal energy is neither dependable nor sufficient.

621
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:15,280
And our last hope, energy from the sun, hasn't worked out the way we hoped.

622
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,240
Not quite.

623
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:25,580
You know that back in the 1970s, we started to investigate the possibilities of oil in the south polar area of the sub-frigid zone.

624
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,720
Yeah, but we failed. It was impossible to reach whatever may have been there if there was anything to begin with.

625
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,420
That's true.

626
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,480
After all these years, we're trying again.

627
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,420
We are.

628
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:43,540
Two weeks ago, we started drilling. We're drilling at this very moment for what could be billions of barrels of oil.

629
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,280
Our technology is advanced.

630
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,460
Improved to where we think we may have an even chance of success.

631
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,120
In the south polar area?

632
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,020
Why are you telling this to us?

633
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,420
What's that noise?

634
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,100
Where do you come in?

635
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,620
By the front door, like everyone else.

636
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,280
After all, it is a private restaurant.

637
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,120
I'm told they have a new chef.

638
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,700
Yes, who specializes in preparing seafood.

639
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,340
Yes, exactly. A little expensive, but it's worth every cent.

640
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,800
I think whoever was in that plane has gone.

641
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,760
I think we can continue.

642
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,060
Now, to answer your question, where do you come in?

643
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,820
The SSC is sending you both down there to report on whatever progress we may be making.

644
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:26,940
They...

645
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:31,320
They are very much aware of what we're up to.

646
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,120
Their noses are out of joint because of it.

647
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,980
Their noses are out of joint because of it.

648
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,200
Their noses are out of joint because of it.

649
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:39,500
Their noses are out of joint because of it.

650
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:39,620
They...

651
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,020
They...

652
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,220
They will stop at nothing.

653
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,400
Absolutely nothing to prevent us.

654
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,400
That and something much more serious.

655
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,620
Which is?

656
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:56,500
The sub-frigid ice sheet, as you well know, covers over five million square miles.

657
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,920
How thick it is, how deep down it goes is anybody's guess.

658
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:13,060
Anything that would cause that huge continent, that solid block of blue ice, to slip, to break up, to disintegrate, would mean the end of all of us.

659
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,340
Wouldn't it?

660
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:14,560
Wouldn't it?

661
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,140
But all.

662
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,060
The way it probably happened 20,000 years ago.

663
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,780
The last ice age.

664
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:31,240
Any slippage of the ice sheet, any breaking of this tremendous mass of mild, thick ice, would result in gigantic tidal waves all over the globe.

665
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,840
Which would cause sea levels to be raised to what?

666
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,460
40, 50 feet.

667
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,620
We estimate hundreds of feet, maybe even thousands.

668
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,260
What would happen to our cities?

669
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,840
I suppose most of them would wind up at the bottom of the sea.

670
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,920
It's only the beginning.

671
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:55,660
As these gigantic blocks of ice keep rushing to the north, melting almost not at all, their white, snowy surface would reflect solar energy back into space.

672
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:00,820
And the entire atmosphere around us would be chilled way down below the freezing point.

673
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,400
Way, way down below.

674
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,240
Yes, but Dr. Burns, why would they consider doing anything like that?

675
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,180
I mean, even if they could make it happen, they'd be out of their minds.

676
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,200
They would consider it, Bob.

677
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,220
And they could make it happen.

678
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,540
And would consider it, Bob.

679
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,740
They would consider it, Bob.

680
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:26,680
Don't forget that Bob has come to, uh, has prophesied the end of the world July 5th, 1998.

681
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,060
Okay?

682
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:32,120
When most Americans will have hangovers, but it's not just for the Americans, it's for everyone in the world.

683
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,040
I didn't hear that!

684
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,140
Yeah, right.

685
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,680
That is why...

686
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:35,900
I'm gonna start smoking again.

687
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,280
Yeah, start smoking, start drinking, and live it up.

688
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,940
Start fornicating as if you're very life-dependent, Ollie.

689
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:48,600
But this plan will succeed only if conditions are just right at the appointed time.

690
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,580
Otherwise, dark forces of antiquity will be awakened from their slumber of eons

691
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:00,220
and rise again from Atlantis to rule our world in their sizeless grip.

692
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:07,780
These primordial elementals, the Elder Gods, have countless demonic and interplanetary minions

693
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,200
carrying out their unholy schemes.

694
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:18,100
They even control Bob's own evil twin brother, Dick Dobbs, the Unclean One.

695
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:24,080
With all his powers, could Dobbs really be defeated by these beings?

696
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,780
Ah, but you must not underestimate the conspiracy.

697
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,880
Its weapons are so insidious, even the human conspiracy leaders are unaware of them.

698
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,760
The fact that the conspiracy itself is ignorant, that it is a conspiracy,

699
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:37,760


700
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,800
gives it such control over our minds that the very thought becomes unthinkable.

701
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,760
You cannot think about your own minds!

702
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,940
That's part of the problem.

703
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,940
You cannot think about your own mind.

704
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,820
You cannot wash soap.

705
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,920
You cannot see your own eyes.

706
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,120
You cannot run from your own legs.

707
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,680
You cannot hide from a superhuman guy.

708
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,280
You cannot hide from a guy who's burying you.

709
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,360
He's burying you in all reality!

710
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,360
Help me somebody!

711
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,880
She ain't got no legs, poor little thing!

712
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,540
My legs are on fire!

713
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,740
The bovinity and temerity of the human mind itself does all the work.

714
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:14,020
The evil ones may just lean back and watch the little humans march gladly, even proudly, to their doom.

715
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,300
They would consider it, Bob.

716
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,240
They would consider it, Bob.

717
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,240
And they could make it happen.

718
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:25,800
There's not enough space on this globe for both them and us.

719
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,600
Yes, but wouldn't that be the end of the world for them, too?

720
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,260
Not by a long shot, Bob.

721
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,740
Unfortunately for us.

722
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,280
Your job, my friends, is to prevent this.

723
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,140
If you can, my friends, is to prevent this.

724
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,020
If you can.

725
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:49,480
Ironically, his mission will not be to sell Earth, but to prevent Earth being sold and transformed into a kind of Stuckeys in space.

726
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,040
To prevent this.

727
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,980
If you can.

728
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,520
Not by a long shot, Bob.

729
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,260
On point.

730
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,680
Meantime, JJ, you have a nibble at the end of your line.

731
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,820
Pull it in.

732
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,600
Slowly.

733
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,340
Slowly.

734
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,820
Oh, it's a big one.

735
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,800
Hold onto it, JJ.

736
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:05,700
Careful.

737
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,840
Here it comes.

738
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,520
Look at the size of it.

739
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,800
Oh, what a beauty.

740
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,400
Wait a minute.

741
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,780
Don't, don't touch it.

742
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,800
Why, what is it?

743
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,360
Fastened onto its side.

744
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,180
Look.

745
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,900
A tiny microphone.

746
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,420
No, no, no, it's too late for the amyl nitrite.

747
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,640
You see where you classify your import as a snow creature.

748
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:32,860
That's right.

749
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,680
Well, it's necessary that we clarify that.

750
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,680


751
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,680


752
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,680


753
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,680


754
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,680


755
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,680


756
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,680


757
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,680


758
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,680


759
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,680


760
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,680


761
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,680


762
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,700
It's immigration status.

763
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,940
Immigration status?

764
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,900
I don't understand.

765
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,980
Well, the question is, is it a beast or a man?

766
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,240
Well, he's not human, if that's what you mean.

767
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:52,040
Very soon, the most horrifying monster menace ever conceived will be oozing into this theater.

768
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,960
From then on, there's no stopping the mob as it spreads from town to town.

769
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,420
It's indestructible.

770
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,620
It's indescribable.

771
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,220
Nothing can stop it.

772
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,740
How can it be stopped?

773
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,660
Mob hysteria sweeps one city before a lot of people.

774
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:05,660


775
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:05,660


776
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,220
The meine reputationましょう was followed by newspapers and the age of Zionist propaganda.

777
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,460
Casual flips and things like that.

778
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:15,460


779
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:20,480
To think of how a revolting malepitia evolved in theCHEIT T chancellor, you ask me.

780
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,820
And to me, you know you Hwoo-Hwoong 10, and I don't know, it was over 10,000 years ago.

781
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,780
22 years ago, the назад, anti-democractive leader.

782
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:32,480
No matter who you are, who you are as a woman, it was always Hwoo-Hwoong 10.

783
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,420
Not just anything, былаительism was incredible.

784
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:33,580
Female-dominatory spectrum.

785
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,900
And lastly, John Ph 000.

786
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,000
He was at the Italian industrialghittoour in thegangue ofnya.

787
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,620
I wonder why he would do that when he lived in oxycontin.

788
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,460
Just let it ring.

789
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,560
Okay, yeah.

790
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,480
I was in the apartment at night.

791
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,700
I never knew what I asked for.

792
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,280
Oh, now it's ringing.

793
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,680
It's ringing on the television.

794
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,420
This is the show, the West Coast report.

795
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,360
I said, who's at half past three?

796
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,240
Who's awake over there?

797
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,980
Is anyone there?

798
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,080
And a few hours later, Wes replied to me.

799
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,580
I think Stang's curled up in a bath somewhere in the other room.

800
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,640
Man, he's hard to wake up.

801
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,140
So, did we torment your sleep?

802
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,920
No, not really.

803
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,340
We didn't tweak you into wakefulness when you wanted only safe, serene slumber.

804
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,820
No, no, no, no, no.

805
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,960
Nothing like that.

806
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:07,840
Oh.

807
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,480
Well, okay, we won't blow the police whistle then.

808
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,560
Okay.

809
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,580
And we'll turn the color down on the picture here.

810
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,220
And we'll stifle the Boeing machine.

811
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,960
Is there anything in particular you need to know?

812
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,280
Well, we wanted to know just what the schedule of events was, so we're all going to drive

813
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,320
out to New Orleans in time to talk to George and see about how many subgeniuses we can

814
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,960
get into the White House and other places before the end of the show.

815
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,320
I knew the convention was going to be held.

816
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:34,320


817
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,220
I knew it was going to be screwed up, but I just thought it was going to be like, you

818
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,200
know, screwed up Yeti style, but it turns out it's screwed up conspiracy style.

819
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,800
Well, how many conspiracy dupes does it take to screw in a show?

820
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,200
Ah, yes.

821
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,340
In the Church of the Holy Rotating Cow, we're talking to New Orleans, and we're talking

822
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,660
to the giant subgenius convention at which no one is awake.

823
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,020
Look at those thousands of people on the convention floor.

824
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,860
Except your hostess.

825
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,340
They seem right to see us.

826
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,320
Well, the people who are here are Stang, Lillidog, and George.

827
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:04,320


828
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:04,320


829
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:04,320


830
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,780
They're hyperclites.

831
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,120
Pope Sterno.

832
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,720
Pope Ster- don't Pope Ster- you gotta hit him.

833
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,100
Captain, are you prepared to start your landing?

834
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,140
Okay, but we're in.

835
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,900
Everyone get into this gravitational acceleration couches.

836
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,120
This isn't landing.

837
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,180
It's very comfortable.

838
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,420
Oh, there's an icky stain on my arm.

839
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,460
See, the one that was supposed to be for her turned into you, young.

840
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:31,360
We are preparing to touch down on planet KZP Delphoi IV.

841
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,300
This planet is a little bit more of a mess than it is.

842
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,300


843
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,300


844
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,300


845
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,300


846
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,300


847
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,300


848
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,240
This planet orbits an M200 class star.

849
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,160
It is the third from its primary.

850
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,080
Extending anti-gravity.

851
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,060
Okay, here we go.

852
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,720
Okay, caller.

853
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,480
We're down.

854
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,880
Wait, wait, no, no, I called you, right?

855
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:50,960
Yes, yes.

856
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,800
Okay, we're clear of the launch pad now.

857
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,160
All right, gentlemen, who wants to be the first to step off on this new world?

858
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:56,940
I'm starting a propellant.

859
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,700
Did you ever see anything like this air down here, JJ?

860
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:03,980
Never, Bob.

861
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:04,280
I'm not sure.

862
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,280


863
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,280


864
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,280


865
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,280


866
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,280


867
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,280


868
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,280


869
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,280


870
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,280


871
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,300
It's the first time in my life I'm able to see the air I'm breathing.

872
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,180
The reason we finally figured out why we have so much technical problems with this radio

873
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,660
program, I went outside the studio today for the first time and there's nobody else here.

874
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,420
It's been abandoned.

875
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,060
No.

876
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,660
Yes, really.

877
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,280
No, I've never left since the first show, so I can't tell.

878
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,180
I just see the faces and the walls changing, but...

879
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,000
Oh, it's all gone.

880
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,300
All the machines that used to give the news, they're all gone.

881
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,240
There's no more news now.

882
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,280
No, there's no news anymore.

883
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,860
The only thing that's left is...

884
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,280
Oh, it's gone.

885
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,400
...an empty filing basket and some coffee machines.

886
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,220
That's all?

887
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,780
You can get the news out of the coffee machines.

888
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,380
There are strips of yellow paper hanging out of the Coke machines.

889
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,480
Right, you can get the news with sugar, without.

890
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,120
You can get creamy news, right?

891
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,880
Population reports are coming through the coffee machines.

892
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:49,540
That's right.

893
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,140
But other than that, there's nothing, nobody left here.

894
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,240
Nope, nope.

895
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,400
It's just an empty studio.

896
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,900
We do have an engineer in there.

897
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,460
Hi, Earl.

898
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,740
Yeah, he's sitting at the train.

899
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,340
How you doing?

900
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:58,540
Yeah, yeah.

901
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,500
I can hear you all.

902
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,240
That's wonderful.

903
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:02,380
Good.

904
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,040
That's encouraging.

905
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,620
Well, great.

906
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,540
So can all our dear friends out in the outside world.

907
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,680
The outside world.

908
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,720
Coming to you from this abandoned warehouse studio tonight, as we have been for some considerable

909
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,820
length of time now.

910
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:18,500
Well, it's only like in this decade, right, that people have really gotten themselves

911
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,400
connected electronically like this.

912
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,060
So we could be talking about the fact that we can't exactly hear all of us, and yet the

913
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,440
people out there can hear us, and he can hear us, and they can't.

914
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,460
I mean, that's far out, right?

915
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:28,980
Mm-hmm.

916
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:33,020
I mean, putting these mushrooms over your ears, and trying to find out who you can hear.

917
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:38,500
I was told last night about a show of pre-Columbian art that's going on at the Metropolitan

918
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:43,760
Museum in New York, in which there are a number of pre-Columbian mushrooms, speaking of mushrooms,

919
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:50,940
set up in a small glass case with little pre-Columbian people fast asleep and dreaming underneath

920
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,500
them in a little Alice in Wonderland setting in the museum.

921
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,880
They have now popularized art, you know, in New York.

922
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:57,560
No, really?

923
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,020
Yes, yes.

924
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,260
They have it in decorator colors.

925
00:45:59,520 --> 00:45:59,880
Yeah?

926
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,600
And in movie stills.

927
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,380
And so you can go in, and all these little film fantasies are available for you with pre-Columbian statuary.

928
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,540
In mason jars and Catholic boxes.

929
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:11,860
Real art.

930
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,560
The opportunity to see real art so it looks like fun, right?

931
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:15,940
Mm-hmm.

932
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,340
Yeah.

933
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:22,000
So, you know, when I used to go to the art museums in New York, all I could dig on was the guards, because they seemed to me to be the most artistic thing there.

934
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,040
You know, all the same color, kind of like moving statues, like moving art.

935
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,860
They were as still as the paintings, but somehow older, if you know what I mean.

936
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,080
You work all day or you sleep all night?

937
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:32,660
Yes.

938
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,720
Yes, you do, right?

939
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,920
And that's a heavy breakfast for a man.

940
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,300
What do you do?

941
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,300
I'm a digester, a professional digester.

942
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,800
A professional digester?

943
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:49,860
Yeah, he works over in the brood, he used to be in the brood combs, I believe, but he moved down to the honeycombs now, you know, right down there, the security first national honeycombs.

944
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,240
Yeah, that's when I was with the two little women, but I had to give that up.

945
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,160
You did, huh?

946
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,260
I'm living alone now, yeah.

947
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,860
And working all day and sleeping all night.

948
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,260
Yep.

949
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,940
It's a good way to make a living.

950
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,000
Sounds steady, at least.

951
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,520
I'm going to have a vacation in about 20 years.

952
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,700
Yeah, 20 years?

953
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,040
I'm looking forward to it, I've been saving it.

954
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,380
That's weird, man. 20 years is a long time, isn't it?

955
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,620
To me, it means nothing. My days and my nights are all confused anyway.

956
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,160
Where are you going to spend this vacation?

957
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,580
Well, I have plans. I'm going to go to church.

958
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,200
No, we'd like to know exactly where you're going to spend it.

959
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,020
I'm going to do the Fustik Church.

960
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,040
Fustik Church.

961
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,340
Yes, the Gautams religion, you may have heard about it.

962
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,060
No.

963
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,140
Yeah, well, they just sit in there, they're all little Indians and they eat all day, sleep all night.

964
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,960
That's a vacation for you to do that?

965
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,600
Oh, a vacation, it's a paradise.

966
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:33,420
Right.

967
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:42,880
Now, wait a minute, the pause, the pause that we had just then, now wait a minute, is that the pause that happens when you go into Echo and don't say anything?

968
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:50,120
Is there a delay? Is there a delay?

969
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:57,340
No, senor, the trains are running on time, they are just not running in your direction.

970
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,480
Unfortunately.

971
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,560
Am I late for the train?

972
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,120
Which train did you have in mind, senor?

973
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,920
The train of thought.

974
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,340
The safest milk train doesn't stop here anymore.

975
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,700
You can't get out of it by pausing. It's like...

976
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,740
No, you can't stop music by just...

977
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,640
stopping.

978
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,460
The pause that regresses.

979
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:35,120
There's another way. It requires not thinking.

980
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,540
Relaxing one's mind.

981
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,240
Ripping off.

982
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:53,000
Meanwhile, the crowd that packed the slopes of the amphitheater, from the distinguished spectators on the marble podium to the mob beneath the gallery,

983
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,660
music was growing louder and louder.

984
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,840
Strains of music accompanied the show.

985
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:07,140
There were occasions when a hydraulic organ was played, but the musics may soon have been lost in the savage hubbub produced by 45,000 maddened sportsmen,

986
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:13,460
each bellowing his delight or dismay as he watched the varying fortunes of a different pair of duelists.

987
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,280
Some of the spectators' cries have come down to us.

988
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,100
Hobbit!

989
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,680
Hook Hobbit!

990
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,060
Verbina!

991
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:23,980
Ure!

992
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:35,140
Whenever a man dropped, St. Augustine relates, the whole mass of fiercely attentive spectators gave that glance to a general roar.

993
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:45,560
...guest brand's the Coliseum, one of the wonders of man where a lot of good times have taken place over the years.

994
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,400
There was a man who...one of the senators...

995
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,660
Actually, the treasurer.

996
00:49:49,660 --> 00:50:08,000
...the treasurer of the tribune spoke at the Coliseum last week, uh, uh, Tharoideus, I thought you might be interested in this, uh, actor, actor Jameis Stewardess, uh, hopes, hopes, uh, policemen will continue to do their jobs against lawbreakers, whose only excuse is that they are doing their thing.

997
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,940
Uh, Stewart presenting an outstanding policeman award to a member of the wheeling West Virginia department.

998
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,420
October 15th told...now this is an amusing anecdote, he told...this has been pretty boring up to this point, but now it gets good.

999
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,260
Go ahead, would you, Professor?

1000
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:28,300
...told an anecdote about a youth who burns down a, a bunkus, a bank, burns down a bank and says to the judge, I was only doing my thing.

1001
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,920
Well, now, here's the funny part.

1002
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:30,460
The...

1003
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,020
Now, you'll love this.

1004
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:39,160
The judge then sentences the youth to serve a term of 5,000 years in jail.

1005
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,320
Judge, the youth asks after hearing the sentence, do you call that fair?

1006
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,160
No, I don't, says the judge.

1007
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,220
I'm just...

1008
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,120
doing my thing.

1009
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,180
I'm just doing my thing.

1010
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:52,980
I didn't know where it was at.

1011
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,460
I'm just...

1012
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,520
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

1013
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,560
Well, I golly, Stewart...

1014
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,460
Oh, you got us back into it, Phil.

1015
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,500
Jack the Ripper, the Boston Strangler, and Hitler did their own thing.

1016
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:16,880
And in view of this, the 62-year-old actor continued, all I can say to the law enforcement societies of our society is, I sincerely hope you will continue to do your thing.

1017
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,940
And I urge everyone to help you.

1018
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,900
That's correct.

1019
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,720
Six people know to be dead.

1020
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,320
It's 10 o'clock.

1021
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:40,700


1022
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,000
All right.

1023
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:46,860
Okay.

1024
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1025
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1026
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1027
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1028
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1029
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1030
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1031
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1032
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1033
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1034
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1035
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1036
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1037
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1038
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1039
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1040
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:46,860


1041
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:52,400
I was standing across the street and I heard a loud boom.

1042
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,440
I saw a Dutch cloud moving from the back of the store towards the front.

1043
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:16,280
It blew out the storefront window. There was about 20 to 30 people outside.

1044
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:26,380
Under the canopy, heavy rains were falling. They were there to stay dry.

1045
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,080
They were engulfed in a cloud explosion.

1046
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,640
We're standing at the next entrance. The entire structure came down on top of them.

1047
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:58,760
Cinder blocks. Steel beams.

1048
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,560
I saw a man sprawled across a car.

1049
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,820
He was covered up by cinder blocks.

1050
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:30,840
A woman in a hole of cinder blocks.

1051
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,260
Her arm was wedged up between a parking heater and a steel beam.

1052
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,340
I saw a man in a hole of cinder blocks.

1053
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:01,340


1054
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,240
I saw a man in a hole of cinder blocks.

1055
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:02,340
He was covered up by cinder blocks.

1056
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,080
He was covered up by cinder blocks.

1057
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:17,920
He was covered up by cinder blocks.

1058
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:25,560
Closed ass.

1059
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:27,760
Steph's door was opened.

1060
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,300
I didn't hear

1061
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:31,660
upcoming CORPS

1062
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:31,700
building noises.

1063
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:32,320


1064
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,620
First you grow a froth plant

1065
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,100
And you pick it when it's ripe

1066
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,100
You dry it up so fine

1067
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,480
You stuff it in a pipe

1068
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,080
Do the pop face boogie

1069
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,740
Do the pop face boogie

1070
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,700
Do the pop face boogie boogie

1071
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,040
Do the pop face boogie boogie

1072
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,940
Till you get slack

1073
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,360
Light it up so slow

1074
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,660
And then you lay back

1075
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,540
And take a big long fall

1076
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,800
And then you get slack

1077
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,560
Do the pop face boogie

1078
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,200
Do the pop face boogie

1079
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,140
Do the pop face boogie boogie

1080
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,280
Till you get slack

1081
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,320
I'll be right back.

1082
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:35,020
The Regional Commission itself admits there is no biological justification for Jerry Brown zigzagging across country moving north as spring came.

1083
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,200
He herded, wrestled, and behorned cattle.

1084
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:44,020
He went on to say that the earlier comparison to tobacco and alcohol was a disaster and that he felt badly about having contributed to that.

1085
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:53,300
Dr. Carlton Turner, who works for the government analyzing the chemical content of pot, told of finding more cancer-causing agents in a marijuana cigarette than in tobacco.

1086
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,920
Dr. Sidney Cohen, Director of Marijuana Studies at UCLA School of Medicine.

1087
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:58,160
Dr. Sidney Cohen, Director of Marijuana Studies at UCLA School of Medicine.

1088
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,440
told the NBC audience,

1089
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,580
it's entirely possible that youngsters who smoke lots of good pot over long periods of time

1090
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:08,540
support a constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget

1091
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,980
except in times of emergency such as war.

1092
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:16,060
He cited a UCLA study which proved that smoking just five marijuana joints

1093
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,960
has the same effect as smoking of a Big Mac, French fries, and a chocolate milkshake

1094
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,360
the Communist Daily Worker and the Soviet Embassy in Washington.

1095
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,800
I'll be right back.

1096
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:32,640
Dr. Sidney Cohen, Director of Marijuana Studies at UCLA School of Medicine.

1097
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:32,640


1098
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,800
Normal, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws,

1099
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,380
has campaigned for easing, if not actually eliminating, restrictions on sale and use of pot.

1100
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:46,600
But now Keith Stroop, Director of Normal Express, is worried that young people underestimate the danger in psychoactive drugs

1101
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,280
and he cautioned against making marijuana a habit.

1102
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,700
I've talked to many young people who defended pot

1103
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,200
and were able to quote all the statements ever made about the harmlessness of the weed.

1104
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,920
Somehow, they never seem to understand the importance of marijuana.

1105
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:57,920


1106
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,820
They seem to have heard the other side.

1107
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,820
Never heard, for example, that marijuana contains 300 or more chemicals

1108
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,680
and 60 of those are found in no other plant.

1109
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:14,900
70% of daily protein needs, 60% of niacin, 50% of calcium, 50% of phosphorus, 45% of vitamin B12,

1110
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,360
30% of iron, and substantial percentages of other dietary requirements.

1111
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,160
I'll be right back.

1112
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:28,900
Yes, here.

1113
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,100
199 shows on the air.

1114
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,080
199 shows.

1115
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,560
Nobody listens.

1116
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,740
Nobody cares.

1117
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,160
199 shows on the air.

1118
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,780
What it proves is that I don't like you.

1119
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:45,820
Yeah, no kidding.

1120
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,420
I know exactly how it feels.

1121
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,920
I'm going to break in here real quick.

1122
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,140
Just, you know, there's this Oingo, for you Oingo Boingo fans out there,

1123
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,060
there's one song of theirs that does have back masking.

1124
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:57,820
Subliminal?

1125
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,700
And I've always wondered about it.

1126
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,700
This afternoon, just before the show, I thought, I'm going to check it out,

1127
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,540
flop it on the four track, on the bottom two tracks, tracks three and four.

1128
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:14,300
Put them on that, flip it over, so that three and four become then one and two backwards,

1129
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,840
which backwards sounds like this.

1130
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:17,860
Backwards.

1131
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:18,220


1132
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:18,800
Backwards.

1133
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:19,580
Backwards.

1134
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,200
Backwards.

1135
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:20,260
Backwards.

1136
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:20,260


1137
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:20,260


1138
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:20,260


1139
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,020
Backwards.

1140
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:25,840
Backwards.

1141
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:33,800
Backwards.

1142
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:33,800


1143
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:33,800


1144
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:33,800


1145
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:33,800


1146
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:33,800


1147
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:33,800


1148
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:33,800


1149
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:33,800


1150
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:33,800


1151
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:33,800


1152
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,100
That's what Oingo Boingo did.

1153
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,780
When they got their chance to do a big back masking, they went in and praised the Lord.

1154
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,740
Uh-oh.

1155
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:45,940
Backwards.

1156
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,240
Backwards.

1157
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,180
Backwards.

1158
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,320
Backwards.

1159
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:50,860
Backwards.

1160
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,000
Backwards.

1161
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000


1162
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000


1163
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000


1164
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000


1165
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000


1166
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000


1167
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,840
I'm your boy and you're my girl

1168
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,800
And we're the most over in the whole damn world

1169
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,660
I can see us both and we're holding hands

1170
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:08,600
On a couple of bucks of golden sands

1171
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,820
Slack Talk

1172
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,700
Slack Talk

1173
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,380
Yes, dear friends, this is Slack Talk.

1174
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,320
Actually, Slack Talk by CUD.

1175
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,760
Uh, you were just listening to Frank Zappa,

1176
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,020
long instrumental there.

1177
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,260
Dear friends, we're getting an inordinate amount of calls tonight

1178
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,720
from people who, uh, apparently are listening to the hour of Slack

1179
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,960
for the first time.

1180
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:37,580
Slack Talk

1181
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:41,200
And, uh, and are wondering just what this is.

1182
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,800
Well, why it's the voice of the church of the subgenius, dear friends.

1183
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:46,360
You know.

1184
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,420
And if you don't, uh, we're gonna give you a post office box

1185
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,360
to write for free information from.

1186
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,520
You got your pencils ready?

1187
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,160
And we'll give this again at the end of the broadcast.

1188
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,660
Uh, free information on the church of the subgenius from Bob

1189
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:06,320
at P.O. Box 140306

1190
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:12,440
Dallas, Texas 75214

1191
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,100
That's post office box 140306

1192
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,980
Dallas, Texas 75214

1193
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:22,060
Slack Talk

1194
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:22,580
And, uh,

1195
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,000
Slack Talk

1196
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:26,100
We started off with Federation for the Blind by Kurt Kursteiner

1197
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:30,600
with the subliminal intro media barrage, uh, put together by Nancy Regalia,

1198
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:34,060
Reverend Ivan Stang, that's me, ha, uh, Arnold Mathis,

1199
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,860
Puzzling Evidence, Byron Werner, and Bob Hall.

1200
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,100
Um, subliminals interview there by Daughter Prell,

1201
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,080
Ivan Stang live in St. Louis,

1202
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,500
Bob Face Every Place by J. Period Erickson of Glass Madness.

1203
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,760
And, uh, we continue with...

1204
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,060
I don't see any submarines.

1205
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,000
Oh, I see some.

1206
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,200
I see some subgeniuses, though.

1207
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,100
It's, uh, old, rare, fire sign theater tape.

1208
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:05,380
A tape of their radio show from the late 60s broadcasts on KPFA, I believe, ironically enough,

1209
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:11,660
which also is where the, uh, the other subgenius show is broadcast from, KPFA and Berkeley,

1210
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:18,120
with Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Howell, uh, Gary Grogfran, and them other bad guys.

1211
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,180
Oh, what?

1212
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,040
Yeah, everything's okay.

1213
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:21,940
Okay.

1214
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:22,740
Uh, yep.

1215
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,300
That was Nancy Regalia they were talking to,

1216
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,460
who also threw in quite a bit of the Meteor Barrage material,

1217
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,220
along with Arnold Mathis,

1218
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:35,540
who sent the Bob and the End of the World, uh, radio show to be continued next week.

1219
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,200
Uh, I believe we also mentioned, uh,

1220
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,520
the sermon by Father Joe Mama,

1221
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:45,660
The Love of Bob,

01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,340
and Greg Keeler did the song No Dog Bathroom.

1223
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,780
This behind us is, uh,

1224
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:54,660
Cinderblocks in Brownsville by Onan Kenobite.
