1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,620
At last I have control of your radio tubes!

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,100
Uh, and I do too!

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,560
Good! This is Ren Hoak!

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,560
And this is Stimson J. Cat of the Ren and Stimpy Show!

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,060
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack!

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,820
Keep listening, you idiots!

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,140
Else I shall kill you!

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,280
Shane, look out!

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,800
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack!

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,940
If anything is excellent or praiseworthy,

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,140
we should find something else to do instead.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,120
Now you're starting to get odd.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,560
That's right. Watch it.

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,260
Oh!

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,540
The problem is, it's special.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,720
Hard of thinking of us.

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,320
I cannot.

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,860
You really tolerate it well.

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,440
And what happens is an old pan,

21
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,800
a pair of neon and old pizelle,

22
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,140
it thins skinless serrates,

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,100
and the back of it now comes critched.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,920
In fact, in there, in a gay spunner,

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,000
to live in a sea of pus.

26
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,060
The openings of this show, down there,

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,720
were by, all of them,

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,500
Fernanda Nande, Lee Murr.

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,000
More, of course, from him.

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,200
My friend, the Pope of all Europe!

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,600
Pope Dave Lee Black!

32
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,600
An exile from his own country in America!

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,140
Well, I'll tell you more about the conspiracy.

34
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,140
It is Pope Dave Lee Black!

35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,220
Praise Bob!

36
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,100
Hi-ya!

37
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,560
Hallelujah!

38
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,160
Now, before I get started,

39
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,560
I've noticed that most of you are standing in the back.

40
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,520
I think you need to come up here a little bit.

41
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,780
Come on, come on to the front.

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,120
Come on to the front!

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,980
Come on, don't stand in the back.

44
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,320
Step up, step up!

45
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,120
Step on up!

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,260
Don't be afraid.

47
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,580
Don't be afraid of this man,

48
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,460
this smiley man with a pipe in his mouth.

49
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,100
Come on, don't smile!

50
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,060
Okay.

51
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,720
Now, I want everybody...

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,080
He's not real! He's not real!

53
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,700
I want everybody to bow your hands.

54
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,980
Bow your hands in a moment of...

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,140
A moment of truly sacred...

56
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,500
Noise!

57
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,840
No!

58
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,260
Praise Bob!

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,920
Praise Bob!

60
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,860
Praise Bob!

61
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,620
Praise Bob!

62
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:32,980
Praise Bob!

63
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,680
No one wants to...

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,620
Woo!

65
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:34,680
Woo!

66
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,780
Now, I know most of you have been wondering,

67
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,800
what is this church of the subgenius?

68
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,380
What are you?

69
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,060
We're a...

70
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,540
Well, just to make it a little bit simple,

71
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,120
we are a sex, drugs, and rock and roll,

72
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,040
end of the world, UFO religion,

73
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,180
and the world's only true religion.

74
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,160
Praise Bob!

75
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,160
Praise Bob!

76
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,220
Praise Bob!

77
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,100
Praise Bob!

78
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,680
Praise Bob!

79
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,040
Praise Bob!

80
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,600
Praise Bob!

81
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:57,700


82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,220
I'm going to put Bill Money in place.

83
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,160
Allegation that I was...

84
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,920
I had been kicked out of America, this is true.

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,420
I am banned from America.

86
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,760
Because I am too slack for America!

87
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,180
And I bring slack and Bob to the shores of Europe,

88
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,320
and I want to...

89
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,160
I want you to look upon this...

90
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,040
You are Meat Loaf, kid!

91
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,320
I am Meat Loaf.

92
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,620
I'm the Meat Loaf of Bob!

93
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,880
Hallelujah!

94
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,260
Look upon this man, this man with the smiley face.

95
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,360
He is the Bob that we all choose to follow.

96
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Pope to Bob!

97
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,820
Point to Bob now!

98
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,820
Point to Bob now!

99
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,640
Point to Bob now!

100
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,220
Point to Bob in the holy photo opportunity!

101
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,400
I'm going to prove to you this is the only world's true only religion.

102
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,320
There were maniacs who flew planes into buildings in New York on the 11th of September.

103
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,840
And they flew these planes into these buildings with a promise they would go to heaven

104
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,280
and they would receive each 42 virgins.

105
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,880
Not in the Church of the Subjugates, my friends!

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,520
No!

107
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,400
You don't have to fly a plane into a building and get virgins.

108
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,840
Hell, who wants virgins?

109
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,000
The Church of the Subjugates for $30, you don't have to fly a plane and you get professionals.

110
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,140
Not virgins, but professionals.

111
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,000
Professional virgins.

112
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,860
Now, this is true.

113
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,820
There are other...

114
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:32,200
There are other popes in Europe, but I am the only pope in Europe that passes out condoms.

115
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,060
It's true.

116
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,100
That other pope won't even wear a condom!

117
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,760
As a matter of fact...

118
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,380
Give me one!

119
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,320
I'm a fan of condoms!

120
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,500
I'll give you one.

121
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,300
I'm not only the only pope in the world that passes out condoms, I'm the only pope in

122
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,060
the world that passes out used condoms.

123
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,300
There you go!

124
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,220
There you go!

125
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,880
I'm the only pope in the world that eats used condoms!

126
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,300
Hell yeah!

127
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,680
Ultima, Ultimata

128
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,680
That's our story, simple as can be

129
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,200
Though the plan is fraught with dangers and never guarantees

130
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,020
We might be eaten by dragons on the way

131
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,360
But we might prove indigestible, perhaps you'll agree

132
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,020
Illuminatus, Illuminatus, Immaculatus

133
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:44,520
Illumina, Illumina, Illumina

134
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:51,940
Illumina, Illumina, Illumina

135
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,680
Ultima, Ultimata, Ultimata

136
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,900
Bang, woo, bill smoking, yay

137
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,700
You live in Raleigh, North Carolina?

138
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,760
What's your, what, suddenly the economy gets a boost?

139
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,180
Fuck

140
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,460
No, I've been getting that look a lot lately

141
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,340
Because I started smoking again and performing abortions

142
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,400
So, you know, I mean

143
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,160
Everywhere I turn these

144
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,480
Sometimes I can hardly get out of bed

145
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,820
But I just love smoking, folks

146
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,640
I'm sorry, I went nine months without them

147
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,460
And, uh, man, what can I tell you?

148
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,700
The hook is fucking deep, man

149
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,020
I'm telling you, they just dropped the bait

150
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,400
Back in the water, boom, plop

151
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,580
They weighed me, you know, hung me up

152
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,800
Caught a big one

153
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,860
But I have this theory

154
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,160
Actually, it's a hope

155
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,920
That if that scenario, you know, is it all the same?

156
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:21,920


157
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,660
true when you die and you go to heaven and St. Peter meets you at the gate, if that's

158
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:32,740
at all true, I believe the first thing he's going to ask you is, you got a light? You

159
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:39,840
mean you all smoke here? Yeah, that's why it's heaven. These aren't clouds, this is

160
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:47,080
cigarette smoke, buddy. Hell is non-smoking. You want to look down at them for a minute?

161
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,580
Alright. I can't believe what they do to their body. It smells like an ashtray. I'm trying

162
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,720
to eat my food. Why would they want to do that to themselves? Do they know how stupid

163
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:02,220
that is? God, how hellish. No shit. Light up. Come on in. Hendrix is on harp tonight.

164
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:15,420
Let me stand next to your fire. Yeah. Man, no one beats Hendrix, man. Fuck Eddie Van

165
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,820
Halen. Fuck Steve Vai. No one beats, fuck. Hendrix was an alien, okay? The ship landed.

166
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,560
They started to fly. They started to fly. They started to fly. They started to fly.

167
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:21,940
They started to fly. They started to fly. They started to fly. They started to fly.

168
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:21,940


169
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,340
said, Jimmy, show them how it's done. We'll pick you up in 28 years. And you know what

170
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:32,860
Jimmy said? Alright! He plays his cock. Did you all know that? They just strung his cock.

171
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:45,660
He played it with his teeth. Does that make him gay? I love people that are dead, for

172
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,540
some reason. They're all my heroes are dead. Keith Richards, for instance. I don't know,

173
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,740
What do you say we do some comedy?

174
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,680
I always like to put some comedy in my shows.

175
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,960
Here's an impression of Keith Richards.

176
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,820
Some people are...

177
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,880
Start talking to him.

178
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,340
It's so real.

179
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,180
Keith!

180
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,860
Boy, Keith went over the edge years ago.

181
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,140
Went over the fucking edge, right?

182
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,240
And everyone thought, that's it.

183
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,800
Keith's gone.

184
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,600
And then they looked over the edge,

185
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,940
and there was a fucking ledge,

186
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,820
and he had hit and landed on it.

187
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,440
There's a ledge beyond the edge.

188
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,800
Keith was like, I hit a fucking ledge.

189
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,540
I'm all right.

190
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,460
Throw down me guitar, I got a song.

191
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,500
There's a ledge beyond the edge.

192
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,440
Keith landed on it.

193
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,300
Lucky bloke.

194
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,560
A lot of people miss the ledge.

195
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,620
I love dead people.

196
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,820
Ah, yes, dear friends.

197
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,480
Bill Hicks.

198
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,540
The great Bill Hicks.

199
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,360
Speaking of dead guys.

200
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,320
You know, we sent him a membership pack.

201
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,600
As an honorary subgenius minister.

202
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,980
One month before learning that he had just died.

203
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,140
Blubber Pigs 15.

204
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,040
Blubber Pigs 15.

205
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,800
Here we go.

206
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,280
Blubber Pigs 15.

207
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,420
Clean it up.

208
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,520
Blubber Pigs 15.

209
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,220
Did you ever ponder the movements of whales?

210
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,040
Whale.

211
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,020
Whale.

212
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,460
Whale.

213
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,260
Whale.

214
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,320
Ah, you're a whale.

215
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:46,900
Whale.

216
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,280
Stop.

217
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,700
Whale.

218
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,280
Stop.

219
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,260
Stop.

220
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,720
Whale.

221
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,280
Whale.

222
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,140
Whale.

223
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,540
Whale.

224
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:55,860
Whale.

225
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,480
Whale.

226
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,360
Whale.

227
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,580
Whale.

228
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,080
Whale.

229
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,540
Whale.

230
00:11:59,540 --> 00:11:59,760
Whale.

231
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,840
Lemur.

232
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:10,000
Am I the only one here who feels that tremor in the force?

233
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,740
Or did somebody just cut a fart?

234
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,480
Did someone just bite a tooth?

235
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,680
Did I just hear the moan of the trouser ghost?

236
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,780
Or did the pups...

237
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:31,300
just take a puff of Bob our guru Bob dogs does not smoke the pipe the pipe

238
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:38,400
smokes that pipe ever stop smoking that's when we're in real trouble

239
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,660
because you know here's what it really is all about this is the truth if you're

240
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,620
new to this subgenius thing and don't know and and really came here for an

241
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:59,320
explanation sorry I can't tell you it's like this this is the true subgenius in

242
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,680
slack

243
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:31,080
that's what the church of the subgenius is all about well Sundays some days

244
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,580
friends it's but see it's not about the intelligence it's about sense common

245
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:44,680
sense sense of humor the subgenius says dr. own and canna bites said is pre

246
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,520
targeted

247
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:55,920
free target you know we'd rather be stupid than their idea of smart we'd

248
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,180
rather be stupid than they're smart that's what jr. Bob said don't have

249
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,400
friends we get to see the world through rose-colored glasses and Bob holds them

250
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:12,880
up for us we pay for a subscription to what we really think and you know you

251
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,640
might say well that's why that guess that's why they call it subgenius

252
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,540
but really friends are the normals that much smarter

253
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:31,460
have you watched TV lately you know the less you watch it the more retarded it

254
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:38,960
seems when you do watch I don't have cable deliberately and but when I go to

255
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,580
a hotel I turn the cable TV on and then I'm locked in and I sit there switching

256
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,640
channels for five hours and doing thank God I don't have a TV

257
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,720
I don't have this cable stuff

258
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,580
I can't stop but you know it's gotten to the point where they're so

259
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:59,100
sophisticated the television producers and makers that you know they're they've

260
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:07,140
taken it like conceptually they they they go ahead they gloat brazenly at what

261
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:14,340
cows we are to watch their dumb crap this reality TV stuff actually I'm

262
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,320
surprised it took him so long to start

263
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,200
doing this because it's actually not a bad idea the average dumbass normal human

264
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,120
being is more entertaining than a lot of what they were scripting and putting on

265
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,080
and if you know they aren't following people around and with cameras as they

266
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,780
act stupid or day in danger themselves that's fine you know that's that's no

267
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,280
problem but it's almost as if it's like you watch Jerry Springer or so many of

268
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,900
these shows and you're going God this is so stupid

269
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,300
people must be really dumb to watch this

270
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,500
don't change the channel though

271
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,140
they're just so up front about it the television itself tells you how bad it

272
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,980
is they make fun of how bad they are and how dumb you are to watch them it's as

273
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,500
if they're saying break free of the matrix after this message

274
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,440
I I wasn't going to bring this up my son

275
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,260
sometimes they're inadvertently done

276
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
I saw an ad for Go Play yogurt that

277
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,140
they were saying they I guess it's like

278
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,660
every time you buy the yogurt they give

279
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,320
a little bit of money to breast cancer

280
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,780
and the announcer actually said together

281
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:33,340
we can lick breasts cancer and you know

282
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,660
that Anna Nicole Smith show and my

283
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,480
cousin by the way you watch that stuff

284
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,840
you go maybe everybody's doing that

285
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,740
maybe everybody's looking at the TV

286
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,820
saying man I can't believe how stupid

287
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,300
this is is they're on the cut so rivered by that autosil ski to see her and Miguel Luna who was there well someone who happens to be going down here forever now her partner was studying with these dogs and they were turkey cows at one point before she ran they이 malls with Electronic Black спокойr and they have been to Barcelona zoans as the Carl einhoender very Builtuni over the monitor and Amazon people tried toジ council without them and we get to the thing that's amazing

288
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,240
is. People watch this stuff?

289
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,060
Cool. Well, that group

290
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,200
must be stupid. I could sit here

291
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,980
forever looking at how stupid people

292
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,740
must be to be watching this stuff.

293
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,680
And I'm guilty of it, too.

294
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,000
But the ultimate reality

295
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,960
TV show, friends, started

296
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,140
this Wednesday. It's a great follow-up

297
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,620
to that miniseries from

298
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,180
91. You know,

299
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,840
they've got some new special effects. They've

300
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,080
improved all the graphics and things.

301
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,520
Reality

302
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,900
TV. They've certainly taken it

303
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,960
all the way, I guess.

304
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,720
Viewed

305
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,760
paleoanthropologically,

306
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,660
television paints quite

307
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,000
a visible picture of its very self.

308
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,280
Incredible

309
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,480
levels of talent dedicated

310
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,500
to the giant alibi

311
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,860
for pinkness!

312
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,680
And the dope rating of the language

313
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,660
itself, friends, changing words

314
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,620
to mean less and less instead

315
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,620
of more, and oddly enough, using

316
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,120
more words to do it, irregardlessly.

317
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,260
And the news,

318
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,920
my God, man, I swore

319
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,720
off the news totally for three years,

320
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,060
but of course on September 11th

321
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,020
we had to start tuning in again.

322
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,000
The news is either evil

323
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,960
or it is a sin. We don't know

324
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,900
which yet. But we know

325
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,680
that, uh,

326
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,560
well, maybe, even if the

327
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,400
revolution was televised,

328
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,080
television will

329
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,620
not be revolutionized.

330
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,880
And it is addictive.

331
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,740
And even, you know, I try

332
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,580
to fight back, but

333
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,680
you know, we're all slackers.

334
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,780
As the great slacker princess

335
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,720
we said once, I have

336
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,200
feist in me.

337
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
I have feist,

338
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,620
but it just can't be

339
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,820
sourced properly.

340
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,020
In order to fight,

341
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,480
friends, the subgenius

342
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
must have slack!

343
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,180
True slack, though.

344
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,300
And everybody knows that.

345
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,960
You know, I don't have to explain that.

346
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,800
And I'm with everybody who's anybody.

347
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,960
But not if it's for everybody,

348
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,020
because I'm cool, you know.

349
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,140
I'm not, I'm only into it

350
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,520
if it's only for everybody

351
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,100
who's anybody.

352
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,620
I'm too independent

353
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,160
to follow the big crowd.

354
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,180
I follow the small crowd.

355
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,180
Good. Real independent thinker.

356
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,060
And everybody knows that

357
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,960
everybody who's anybody

358
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,840
already knew that,

359
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,980
except for the nobodies.

360
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,600
Nobody who's anybody

361
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
doesn't know that.

362
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,420
I'm nobody's fool.

363
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,400
Not nobody who's anybody, anyway.

364
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,020
I'm the Ç'olgågu,

365
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,540
And I'm only one with Yaroslav,

366
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:34,620
It's just me and her fiancée

367
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,460
And me and her fiancée

368
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,320
Vichy and

369
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,380
Rebecca from Warwick,

370
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:37,380


371
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:37,380


372
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,220
I'm smarter than all others.

373
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,520
I barely even know

374
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,100
How to put on my own pants

375
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,760
But I'm a genius in France

376
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,820
Genius in France

377
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,280
Genius in France

378
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,940
I may not be the sharpest

379
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,000
Honka cheese

380
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,920
I got a negative number

381
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,620
On my SATs

382
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm not good looking

383
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,780
And I don't know how to dance

384
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,960
But nevertheless it is

385
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,580
Quite a de-evil

386
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,780
And I am so widely considered

387
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,380
To be a genius in France

388
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,700
Genius in France

389
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,000
Genius in France

390
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,400
People say I'm a geek

391
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,140
I'm a ronin little freak

392
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,900
And I'm not

393
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,620
With an unfortunate physique

394
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,580
If I was any dumber

395
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,520
They'd have to water me twice a week

396
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,860
But when the mademoiselles see me

397
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,500
They all swoon and shriek

398
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,040
They dig my mystique

399
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,600
They think I'm c'est magnifique

400
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,180
When I'm in Paris

401
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,780
I'm the chicest of the chic

402
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,740
They love my body odor

403
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,160
And my bad toupee

404
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,880
They love my body odor

405
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,940
They love my stripy shirt

406
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,660
And my stupid beret

407
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,900
And when I'm sipping

408
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,920
On a Perrier

409
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,860
In some cafe

410
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,360
Down in Saint-Tropez

411
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,420
It's hard to keep

412
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,880
The fans at bay

413
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,440
They say

414
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,020
Sign my poodle

415
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,300
Sibu play

416
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,360
Sign my poodle

417
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,820
Sibu play

418
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,000
Poodle

419
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,080
Poodle

420
00:21:39,880 --> 00:22:09,880


421
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,560


422
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,840
Stretches on the hill.

423
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,560
But when I'm in Reuvence, I get free croissants.

424
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Yeah, I'm the guy every French lady wants.

425
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,940
And if you ask them why, you're bound to get this response.

426
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,040
He's a genius in France, genius in France.

427
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,540
That's right.

428
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,460
He's a genius in France, genius in France.

429
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,260
You know it.

430
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,380
He's a genius in France, genius in France, genius in France.

431
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,880
I'm not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree.

432
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,920
But the folks in France, they don't seem to agree.

433
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,960
They say, bonjour, monsieur.

434
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,620
Would you take the picture with me?

435
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,420
I say, oui, oui.

436
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,040
That's right.

437
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,960
I say, oui, oui.

438
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,500
Oui, oui.

439
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,040
He says, oui, oui.

440
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm dumber than a box of hair.

441
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,280
But those Frenchies don't seem to care.

442
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,640
Don't know why I'm on france, but they love me there.

443
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,520
I'm a genius in France.

444
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,760
I'm a genius in France.

445
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,660
Gonna make a big splash when I show up in Cannes.

446
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,220
Gonna make those Frenchies scream.

447
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,080
Use a man, use a man, use a man.

448
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,820
Like a fine red war.

449
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,580
War.

450
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,860
I got that shit to say.

451
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,280
War.

452
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,000
War.

453
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,580
Like a fine red war.

454
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,980
Ooh la la.

455
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,760
I got that shit to say.

456
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,780
Qua, qua, qua, qua, qua.

457
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,580
Oui, oui.

458
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,640
Qua, qua, qua, qua, qua.

459
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,240
Oui, oui.

460
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,860
Qua, qua, qua, qua, qua.

461
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:03,980
Oui, oui.

462
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,120
Qua, qua, qua, qua, qua.

463
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,200
I'm a taco short of a combo plate.

464
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,600
But by some twist of fate all the frogs think I'm great.

465
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,720
Oh, the men all faint and the women scream.

466
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,120
They like me more than heavy cream.

467
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,460
When I'm in Versailles, I'm a popular guy.

468
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,520
My, oh, my.

469
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,920
I'm as French as apple pie.

470
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,460
Apple pie.

471
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,180
They think I'm awfully witty.

472
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,880
A riot and a half.

473
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,360
When I tell a stupid joke, they laugh.

474
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,660
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

475
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,240
And laugh.

476
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,520
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

477
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,280
People and friends have lots of attitude.

478
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,240
They're snotty and rude.

479
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,920
They like disgusting food.

480
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,520
But when they see me, they just come unglued.

481
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,360
They think that I am one happening dude.

482
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,120
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

483
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,200
I'm about as sharp as a bowling ball.

484
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,920
But they like me better than Charles de Gaulle.

485
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,200
André knew it's very true.

486
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,540
The room temperature's higher than my IQ.

487
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,120
But they love me more than Gerard Depardieu.

488
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,060
How did this happen?

489
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,440
I don't have a clue.

490
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,220
I'm not the greatest tractor on the farm.

491
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,500
I don't have any skills or grace or charm.

492
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,820
And most people look at me

493
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,260
like I'm all covered with ants.

494
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,720
But I'm a genius in France.

495
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,660
Genius in France.

496
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,220
Genius in France.

497
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,920
And I'm never going back.

498
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,720
I'm never going back.

499
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,860
I'm never, never, never, never going back home again.

500
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,820
I'm tearing up my return flight ticket.

501
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,800
Gonna tell the folks back home where they can't stick it.

502
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,420
Cause I'm never going back.

503
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,520
I'm never going back.

504
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,500
I'm never going back.

505
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,700
The girls back home never gave me a chance.

506
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,800
But I've shown off goddamn frogs and some kind of trance.

507
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,380
And I'm aware that it's a most improbable circumstance.

508
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,460
But great googly moogly.

509
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,320
I'm a genius in France.

510
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,160
Genius in France.

511
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,020
Just can't wait to kiss my feet.

512
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,820
Get in line, fuck her up, too sweet.

513
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,400
Pow diddy, pow diddy, pow diddy.

514
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,580
I'm getting even more famous by the hour.

515
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,360
I'm stuffed with pastries and drunk with power.

516
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,160
Now they're putting up my statue by the Eiffel Tower.

517
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,680
A little more to the left, boys.

518
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,200
A little more to the left.

519
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,380
A little more to the left, boys.

520
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,180
A little more to the left.

521
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,700
I'm the biggest dork there is alive.

522
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,000
My mom picked out my clothes for me till I was 35.

523
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:50,340
And I forgot to mention I'm not even welcome at the Star Trek convention.

524
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,960
But the Frenchies think that my poop don't stink.

525
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,920
I'm a genius in France.

526
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,320
Say, would you pass the Grey Poupon?

527
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,800
Merci beaucoup.

528
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:15,400
Weird Al Yankovic, of course, from the album Hoodle Hat.

529
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,720
I think that I ought to begin by saying that our subject today concerns silly.

530
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,140
Oh, let's take an example.

531
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,800
Probably the silliest personal emergency that can come to a man is his silly wedding.

532
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:30,520
Oh!

533
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,820
Rather than keep you in suspense any longer, the ladies will have to leave the room.

534
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,760
Thank you.

535
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,560
Are you all right?

536
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,580
I'll say that we are guilty, but also look silly.

537
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,160
No, no.

538
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,080
Oh, yes.

539
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,780
24 and a half.

540
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,740
9 and 3 quarters.

541
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,760
13 and a quarter.

542
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,760
24 and a quarter.

543
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,440
42.

544
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,580
42 and a quarter.

545
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,000
39.

546
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,720
43.

547
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,020
Well, I guess I'm in the way here.

548
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:58,880
So I see.

549
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,800
Good night.

550
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:14,300
La, la, la, la, la, Lee Moore did it.

551
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:23,140
And now, a puzzling evidence and glass madness about 20 years ago.

552
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,860
Whatcha gonna sing about at five o'clock in the morning?

553
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:28,860


554
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:28,860


555
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,460
Her name, her name, yee-haw.

556
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:36,300
Talking about Bob Dobbs and the church, everything in a whole big mess on the floor.

557
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,940
Just back, a disorganized first church, a disorganized mess on the floor.

558
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,900
You're a little intimidated.

559
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,640
I'm joining any kind of church.

560
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,440
You can call a church anything you want.

561
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,680
A foundation or a club or just something to look at.

562
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,760
We call it Church of the Fill in the Blank.

563
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,760
And Bob Dobbs is the biggest blank to fill in you'll ever see.

564
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,120
And that's all it is.

565
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,780
Friends and neighbors out there listening, please join us in a moment.

566
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:58,780


567
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:58,780


568
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:58,780


569
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:58,840
Friends and neighbors out there listening, please join us in a moment.

570
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,600
Tonight, we hope that you're putting your hands on the radio and getting the full impact

571
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,520
of this message that's coming down to you.

572
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,280
Face at the very fact of your eyes moving across the page at this very moment as you

573
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,520
try to read your radio as inevitably and sub-atomically decreed.

574
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,920
Your brain is working without your control.

575
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,960
You are locked into the machinations of a cosmic puppeteer who worked your strings so

576
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,220
skillfully you never knew they were there until now.

577
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,100
Feels good, doesn't it?

578
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,800
Oh, it feels so very good when I've got the strings bolt tight.

579
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,820
But we can show you where the strings are attached and how to single them out.

580
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,640
Wake up with a puppeteer.

581
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Will this say life after death, reincarnality, psychic powers, immortality, invisibility,

582
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,340
nirvana, communications, higher challenges, slack, slack, slack, so on.

583
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,400
They may be pink, but their money is green.

584
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,620
So I walked into the jaws of corporate sellout city today.

585
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,540
You did?

586
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,280
Did you lose your corn edge?

587
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,680
Yeah, I bent over and said, let me in the club.

588
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,680
You didn't say put it in here, but don't be gentle?

589
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,040
I said, you put it wherever you want.

590
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,960
Just let me in the club.

591
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,940
He doesn't even want it, gentlemen.

592
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,220
Let me in the dome.

593
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:58,820
Let me in the dome.

594
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,500
When they release the gas, let me in the dome.

595
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,140
Lube or no lube, don't matter to me, bub.

596
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,360
You let me in, you got your way.

597
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,600
That's why you got into it, man.

598
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,480
You don't like the lube.

599
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,640
You don't like the lube.

600
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,240
You like it rough.

601
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,840
So we'll see if I get called back into the sacred orb for round two.

602
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,400
Are you going to have to kiss?

603
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,660
Round two will be a showdown between three people, like Good to Bad and the Ugly.

604
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,180
Remember the Good to Bad and the Ugly?

605
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,440
At the end, it was three people.

606
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,320
Not a shootout between two people.

607
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,820
But a shootout between three people.

608
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:28,900
I'm not kidding.

609
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,620
Three people.

610
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,640
Job interviews are more and more like American Idol.

611
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,080
This was definitely like American Idol.

612
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,520
They are definitely all videotaped now, too, from the time you walk in the door.

613
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,440
They want to make sure there are no stains down there, you know, where I'm talking about,

614
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:42,700
too.

615
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,100
The feet are packed.

616
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,460
Well, you did great in the bathing suit contest.

617
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,520
I did really good in that.

618
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,200
You had to wear five pairs of socks on that thing, though, to get any kind of substantial

619
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:51,880
formate.

620
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,880
Oh, they all do that.

621
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,440
Oh, they all do that.

622
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,580
That's understood.

623
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,620
I did really good with the Motown song.

624
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,700
That goes with the rock and roll.

625
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,420
You sometimes take off that ten-point slide for too many songs.

626
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,680
The Motown song was good.

627
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,880
The R&B song was all right.

628
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,320
Somebody else.

629
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:05,880
What did you do?

630
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,560
Did you stop the name of love?

631
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,380
The Elvis song, though, was a little tough because I picked a hard one.

632
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,220
Which air...

633
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,020
I picked the American Trilogy.

634
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,640
Which air guitar tin did you pick?

635
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,620
Or did they assign one?

636
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,920
No, no.

637
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,900
That's coming up in round two.

638
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,320
Oh.

639
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,400
They're saving that for the big round.

640
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:26,920
Yeah.

641
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:27,820
They're saving that for the big round.

642
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,100
That's just a bunch of eye injuries and those things.

643
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,640
Man, they make sure that EMS is on call.

644
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,080
And make sure you're getting plenty of food and water.

645
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,860
And make sure your vacation time is clearly marked here on the digital cock.

646
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,960
I mean, clock.

647
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,100
I'm sorry.

648
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,180
Rocking...

649
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,940
It's only rock and roll.

650
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,340
Boy, talking about Freudian.

651
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,360
Yeah, I know.

652
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,080
Man.

653
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,240
That guy kind of climbed in my head, and now I can't...

654
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,600
I just...

655
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,040
I don't know.

656
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,540
That was pretty Freudian.

657
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,960
I'm still thinking about little kids.

658
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,660
I mean, super everyone.

659
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Just have my 12-year-old boys punching me in the eye.

660
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,020
The one listener is listening.

661
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,880
Because they don't get their way.

662
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,680
Look, Chaz, the one listener is listening.

663
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,440
Oh, cool.

664
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,520
He's calling again.

665
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,800
And his twin brother on the other line.

666
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,360
Come on, man.

667
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:03,580
It's okay.

668
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:10,000
You can call now, and you can express yourself freely, because damn it, we liberated this

669
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,540
zone for your protection and flavor.

670
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,980
Just relax, release, and just let it go.

671
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,500
Enjoy.

672
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,300
It's for your own good, man.

673
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,560
It's good for your own good.

674
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,600
Push, like you're trying to get one out.

675
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,780
It'll go in easier.

676
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,580
Come on.

677
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,660
Remember what mommy did so many years ago when she pooped a waterman?

678
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:27,660


679
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,120
I called it you, son.

680
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:34,680
And friends, of course, that was ESO Radio, Swamp Radio from WCSB, Cleveland, with Professor

681
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:41,000
Chaz Smith, the host, lonesome cowboy Dave, Princess Wee, and Yee.

682
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And now, Leigh-mer.

683
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
You got it.

684
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:53,900
Re-scanning the Earth, you can do it.

685
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:53,900


686
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:53,900


687
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,280
You got it.

688
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:54,560
You got it.

689
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,740
You got it.

690
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,320
You got it.

691
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:57,660
You got it.

692
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:57,660


693
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:57,660


694
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:57,660


695
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:57,660


696
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:57,660


697
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:57,660


698
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:57,660


699
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:57,660


700
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:57,660


701
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,640
Hey, you guys want to keep it down?

702
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,800
There's more than enough lame decor.

703
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,420
It doesn't have to be an entity.

704
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,780
Delicious frozen custard.

705
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,520
It doesn't have to be a custard.

706
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,940
It doesn't have to be an entity.

707
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,980
It doesn't have to have fibulations because its heart beats.

708
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,700
Listen, you can hear the sound of the pounding heart of the show from under the floorboards.

709
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,000
Has the pain ended?

710
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,500
Oh, God, look at that EEG.

711
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:42,940
It's incredible that it could be in a coma for this long, yet still it goes on and on like the vegetable it is and doesn't die.

712
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,880
Although when you purchase all three, it's only $16.98 per stew.

713
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,100
They try to clean up the song and make it feel good about itself.

714
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,680
They thought maybe then it would be over.

715
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,060
Maybe just a sense of bitterness was keeping it from dying.

716
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:09,780
The other members of the team kept ranting about other things while the song pulsated along behind them.

717
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,720
Unbeknownst to their very actions.

718
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,300
You know, go ahead, try to kill it, Hal.

719
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,860
Try to kill the song right now.

720
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,740
Take this gun and shoot the song.

721
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,240
Just try to cripple this song, Hal.

722
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,260
No, let it glide along.

723
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,280
Slow it down.

724
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,300
Hold on, we're trying to pull you up right next to our little spacecraft.

725
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,340
They cut off three of its legs, but look at it.

726
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,240
It's still chopping along.

727
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,220
There you are.

728
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,960
You're climbed on.

729
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,780
You're on, you're on.

730
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,620
You're in, you're in.

731
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:45,320
Dr. Philodrum, Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence on the KPFA Puzzling Evidence Show.

732
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,740
By the way, this music or sound in the background is from Negative Land,

733
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,460
whose show precedes the Puzzling Evidence Show on KPFA.

734
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:55,880
I don't know.

735
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,040


736
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,480
I don't know.

737
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,580
For the vivid subgenius imagination is in a churning turmoil of constant growth,

738
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,480
and it can make the wait blessed.

739
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,780
When starving, or contemplating unpaid bills,

740
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,720
the subgenius eats his imagination for breakfast and lunches on his own soul.

741
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,300
It invents more possibility of future pain and joy,

742
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,780
letting us see their immense range and depth,

743
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,200
and that they are subjective.

744
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,000
We then realize that duration is dependent upon mood.

745
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,240
Could we control our own rates?

746
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,680
We could shorten a paradigm,

747
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,660
and reduce the time to zero and apparent slack time infinitely.

748
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,280
Meanwhile, the subgenius must bravely face the bars of his cage.

749
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,880
Patience is the only form of time control,

750
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,940
at least until the time of now.

751
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,640
Now, go for a walk and keep walking,

752
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,160
until you stub your toe,

753
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,120
get mugged,

754
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,760
or until your feet really hurt.

755
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,660
This will remind you that what you have been reading is valid only hygenia your head

756
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,660
and just a bunch of philosophical crap to begin with.

757
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,520
There's no sense in getting permanently cosmic,

758
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:03,920
McHatted, even if you could and most yulgis are only faking it to themselves. You still have to eat, and your shit still stinks.

759
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:10,820
There is such a thing as getting too high, and death is a waste, though that is the only reason you should be afraid of it.

760
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:17,740
Religious yahoos can keep blabbering glib crap forever, us included, and it's a good flushing out of the brain-pen,

761
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,840
but that's all it is. The rest is between you and Bob. Good luck, suckers.

762
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:31,940
Time control outtakes from the subgenius book Revelation X, read by the author.

763
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:14,820
One of the most spectacular kinds of automobile accidents is the one in which a car not only gets banged up,

764
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,060
but bursts into flames.

765
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,980
What makes it really horrible

766
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:35,860
is the idea that a driver and his passengers, stunned by the accident, may be trapped inside the burning car.

767
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,460
Let me get up.

768
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,100
The National Safety Council says that, proportionately for most of us, this type of spectacular smash-up

769
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,420
is very rare.

770
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,280
The thing that stuns people inside a car...

771
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,000
Well, let me get up.

772
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,020
Artemia Salina did it.

773
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
And now,

774
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,840
Les Meux.

775
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,180
McCain, you've got a lot to learn about dirt.

776
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,200
That dirt, McCain.

777
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,760
I want you to look around, and you tell me who'll pick dirt.

778
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,860
That dirt.

779
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:34,540
But, if the marshal's dirt was the dirt, why Paul never throw that dirt in the dirt?

780
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,360
I don't know.

781
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,120
He's got too much dirt.

782
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,440
Because I don't believe in principles.

783
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,800
But it's important dirt. Very, very important.

784
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,940
Who is it?

785
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
Still awake, son?

786
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,600
Can't seem to get to sleep.

787
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,800
Well, maybe you can sleep if you think of something pleasant.

788
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,640
Not Michael or me!

789
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,460
Maybe.

790
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,220
Mark, I told you before.

791
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,760
You had no right to get away.

792
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,920
I'm sorry, Paul.

793
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,420
One thing is sure.

794
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,900
We're not your friend.

795
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,120
Mark, wait.

796
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,960
I'd be glad to.

797
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,320
Well, I guess I take the prize for stupidity.

798
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:14,800
I know.

799
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,440
I know the one you mean.

800
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,900
Don't you have at least 15 friends?

801
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,900
No, it's easy.

802
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,580
The problem is you get too many.

803
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:21,580


804
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:21,580


805
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,260
A range of friend stock.

806
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,620
Like 16.

807
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,880
We'd have to have a friend stock.

808
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,540
We'd have to have like more than 15.

809
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,160
We might have to have 16 friends.

810
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,760
We can rent some friends.

811
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,900
I know there's this place called Rent-A-Friend now where you can go in and you can rent somebody.

812
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,020
Rent-A-Friend?

813
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,600
Is that like where you can get a Russian bride?

814
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,840
They'll act like they've known you for a long time.

815
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,500
You'd give them like a bio sheet and they'll memorize your bio sheet.

816
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,980
And then like when they walk around with you, you know, they'll always be laughing at your jokes no matter how late.

817
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,500
I don't show any jokes.

818
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,080
I don't trust anyone in my bio sheet.

819
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,400
You know, you don't have to pay them too much.

820
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,100
You notice this scene looks a lot like the one in 2002 where the guy touches the monolith.

821
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,620
You pay their expenses and give them money.

822
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,380
I was enjoying the special effects but they just somehow didn't look very convincing.

823
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:08,260
But did you notice that when you have your Rent-A-Friend that they never say anything bad?

824
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,240
Yes. Well, that's their job, you see.

825
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,460
They never ever say anything bad.

826
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,600
I mean a good friend, a real friend will tell you bad news every now and then.

827
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,100
So...

828
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,460
When you rent one, it sort of like breaks down after a while.

829
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:32,320
And people can say, you know, people will notice, hey, I think that's Hal's Rent-A-Friend because he never says anything bad about Hal.

830
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:40,940
But there are natural culling factors which would remove me and him from any suspicion.

831
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,120
That boy needs therapy.

832
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,140
Psychosomatic.

833
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,520
That boy needs therapy.

834
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,660
You're psychosomatic.

835
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,880
That boy needs therapy.

836
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,040
You lie down on the couch.

837
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,260
What does that mean?

838
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:51,940
You're a nut!

839
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,080
You're crazy in the coconuts!

840
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,920
What does that mean?

841
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,260
That boy needs therapy.

842
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,540
I'm gonna kill you.

843
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,620
That boy needs therapy.

844
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,760
Granny gazoo, let's have a cheer.

845
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,080
I will not count to three.

846
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,780
That bro.

847
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,420
That.

848
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:03,920
That.

849
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,240
That.

850
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,560
That.

851
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:04,620
That.

852
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:04,760
That.

853
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:04,760


854
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:04,760


855
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,920
Boy needs therapy.

856
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,400
He was white as a sheet.

857
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,600
And he also made false teeth.

858
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,380
That's what I want to see.

859
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:15,380


860
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,460
That's what I want to see.

861
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,180
That's what I want to see.

862
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,420
And I want to see what you're looking for.

863
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,380
Frontier Psychiatry

864
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,820
Can you think of anything that talks?

865
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,580
Other than a person?

866
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,260
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

867
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,400
A bird?

868
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:39,940
Yeah.

869
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,180
Sometimes a parrot talks to me.

870
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,640
Sometimes a parrot talks to me.

871
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,720
And sometimes...

872
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,560
Sometimes...

873
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,720
The laundry talks to me.

874
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,820
And sometimes...

875
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,760
A little teeny piece of hardware talks to me.

876
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,440
And sometimes...

877
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,820
A little wax statue.

878
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,400
A little...

879
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,120
A person this big talks to me.

880
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,840
And we go dancing.

881
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,120
In a club in my own mind.

882
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,720
And I used to have friends.

883
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,020
And they used to be on the air with me.

884
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,660
But now they just sit around and drink little energy drinks.

885
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,640
And draw little smiley faces.

886
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,920
At times.

887
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:43,700
At times.

888
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,060
Yeah.

889
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,340
But people still think the show's funny.

890
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,560
They do talk about phantom planets that are actually planets in another dimension

891
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,280
that we can't see or anything like that.

892
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,820
Oh, come on.

893
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,260
The only thing that...

894
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,920
The only way we can tell they exist is through their gravitational...

895
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:13,100
The only messenger particles that could carry between the two dimensions would be gravity.

896
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,300
So would this explain dark matter and that stuff running out of Dave's nose?

897
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,060
Yeah, they're trying to...

898
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:18,800
Gravity waves.

899
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,740
Explain all kinds of stuff like that.

900
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,200
Now she...

901
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,460
Now I'm confused again.

902
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,820
Gravity is particles?

903
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,220
I thought gravity was waves.

904
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,700
Or maybe wave particles.

905
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:26,960
The graviton.

906
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,280
There's actually...

907
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,540
Did you ever hear about the graviton?

908
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,860
No, I have not heard of graviton.

909
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,840
It's all a bunch of fairy tale stuff.

910
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,300
What are these?

911
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,340
I find these to be odd.

912
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,580
I don't believe it unless I see it.

913
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,400
Fairy tales and children's stories.

914
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,620
I can prove the world's flat.

915
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,420
The moon is made of green cheese and the world is no more.

916
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:44,720
It's flat.

917
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,820
If the world was curved, then puddles would have a curve.

918
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,020
They're flat.

919
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:56,300
If the world was round, stank, we'd be able to dance all the way to the other side and back and never know the difference.

920
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,700
What do you think, Wee?

921
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,800
Well, the horizon is straight.

922
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,880
It's not curved.

923
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:04,680
It's straight.

924
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,760
So it must be flat.

925
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,000
Flat.

926
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,480
Flat as it can be.

927
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,860
Flat as your skull.

928
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,700
Sometimes it seems to go up and down and kind of curves at the sides.

929
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,220
Upwards.

930
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:17,640
Like...

931
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,460
There's something really wrong.

932
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,340
Stank, if the world was round, you couldn't go bowling.

933
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,960
The balls would go on infinitely and return back into your hand from the opposite direction.

934
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,280
That happens below the equator, right?

935
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,920
I don't know about blowing the equator or any of these other strange things you allude to,

936
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,180
but I know one thing.

937
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:44,040
If the world was truly round, you'd not be standing where you are right now.

938
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:44,820
All ready?

939
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,280
This lecture is about Guatemala.

940
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:48,800
Uh, heeem.

941
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:53,760
Guatemala is far more, uh, powerful than the CIA.

942
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:00,380
Before beginning the lecture, one point I should make is that when people think of this Guatemala,

943
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,140
they think of lawyers, they are gonna be front and center because

944
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,940
The Lord's law and the sons of our Lord,

945
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,720
which maps the un-made things.

946
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,100
I don't know what I'm doing.

947
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,100
It's difficult to give a lecture and not avoid Guatemala.

948
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,740
All by myself!

949
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,960
You look down, you see a Guatemala, Leon.

950
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:20,920
What's that?

951
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,160
You know what a turtle is?

952
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,020
Of course.

953
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,380
Same thing.

954
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,100
A little bit there by Reverend Jartow.

955
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,460
Uh, friends, you know, this show, it's not just you.

956
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,420
This show makes me feel weird, too.

957
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:34,780
In fact,

958
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,700
I'm feeling kind of weird.

959
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:36,700


960
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:36,700


961
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,060
I'm feeling kind of sick!

962
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,500
Do you need to go to the hospital?

963
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,900
No, take the camera out of the hospital.

964
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,400
Do you need to go to the hospital?

965
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,000
Do you need to the hospital?

966
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,260
I need the hospital!

967
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,820
I need to go to the hospital now.

968
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,200
Until I'm one of the current early middle aged.

969
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,020
Hey, can I take you to the hospital now?

970
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,940
Yeah, take me to the hospital, please.

971
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,140
I think you need to go to the hospital.

972
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:01,720
No, I don't.

973
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,620
Yes, you do.

974
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,600
No, I don't!

975
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,340
Yes, you do.

976
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,300
No, I don't.

977
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:05,980
Yes, you do.

978
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,020
Jews of the arcane period.

979
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:08,820
It's weird.

980
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,940
Go to the hospital.

981
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:13,720
Go!

982
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,600
Get up and go now.

983
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,660
Get up and go?

984
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,820
Or you just stand up and walk over

985
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,540
to the hospital? Yeah, just go.

986
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,420
Just get the hell out

987
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,660
and go to the hospital.

988
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,300
But I feel better now.

989
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,520
I don't think my heart is beating

990
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,140
too fast in that crash.

991
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,560
It's imploring my mind as bad

992
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:34,960
as it was.

993
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,440
Something is subtly wrong with me.

994
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,340
That's okay. The hospital is waiting.

995
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,040
They've staffed up for you.

996
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,440
They've added on new doctors

997
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,500
and new nurses.

998
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,020
And a whole army of volunteers

999
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,440
ready to meet your needs are waiting

1000
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,320
at the hospital.

1001
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,940
I don't want to go to the hospital anymore.

1002
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,840
I don't want to be more injured.

1003
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,580
That's okay.

1004
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,120
The hospital is free now.

1005
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,180
You go to the hospital.

1006
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,460
It doesn't cost any money.

1007
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,340
You just walk in.

1008
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,600
They'll start doing the tests.

1009
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,680
You don't have to sign

1010
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:04,940
any papers.

1011
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,380
You don't have to wait in the waiting room.

1012
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,740
They did away with the waiting room

1013
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,640
because there's no waiting.

1014
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:11,440
You just walk in.

1015
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,040
And there's a whole hospital

1016
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,620
dedicated just to you.

1017
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,380
A whole staff.

1018
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,080
Yeah, just for you.

1019
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,220
It has a whole staff of doctors

1020
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,480
and nurses, lawyers,

1021
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,840
all those other kind of people

1022
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,140
that are at hospitals

1023
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,020
to take care of you

1024
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,680
without any overlap.

1025
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,600
Without any

1026
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,400
focus on any other patients

1027
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,360
besides you.

1028
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,620
You are it.

1029
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,020
Yee-haw!

1030
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,340
I make electric chair

1031
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,040
at home in your own hat.

1032
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,220
Everybody's dropping out, man.

1033
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,340
Everybody's dropping out.

1034
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,540
Some of these blue and red...

1035
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,340
Can't fight the machine no more.

1036
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,920
And they're tuning out

1037
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,060
and turning out.

1038
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:00,920
That's right.

1039
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,000
And toning out.

1040
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,320
Did you ever try and make a...

1041
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,480
a homemade electric chair

1042
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,200
in your own home?

1043
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,140
Like you make the chair

1044
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:07,620
with the straps

1045
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,720
and you get like one of mom's

1046
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,560
aluminum pie pans

1047
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,380
to put on your head.

1048
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:10,820
Oh, sure.

1049
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,240
And then you get the, uh,

1050
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,580
you know, the battery charges

1051
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,540
and attach them to your

1052
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,120
nine, nine, nine, nine, nine,

1053
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,040
nine, nine, nine, nine apples.

1054
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:17,840
And then you...

1055
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,360
you just stick your feet in the water

1056
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,000
and you're good to go

1057
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,620
somewhere.

1058
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,700
We killed the neighbor's

1059
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,840
kid's bunny that way.

1060
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,560
You put him in the chair?

1061
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,240
You gave him the chair?

1062
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:26,940
A little fake chair

1063
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,200
and a car battery.

1064
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,100
Did you guys go through

1065
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,040
like a series of appeals

1066
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,140
or anything like that?

1067
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,300
No, no.

1068
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:31,960
No, you just...

1069
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,660
It was just cruel

1070
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,640
Pobucker kids.

1071
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,360
Not even a trial

1072
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,080
for the bunny.

1073
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,020
You didn't even try him

1074
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:37,880
or anything or charge him

1075
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,240
or anything?

1076
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,160
No, it was just,

1077
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,980
just cruelty to animals.

1078
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:42,900
That's what kids did

1079
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,080
in Fort Worth in the day.

1080
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:45,960
See, when we would...

1081
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,920
In the 50s.

1082
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,600
When we...

1083
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,340
The 1850s.

1084
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,160
Yeah, the 1850s.

1085
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:49,880
Who else was there

1086
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,200
to torture besides animals?

1087
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,040
You were a kid.

1088
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,880
We have a real police force here

1089
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,800
and they have enough

1090
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,260
M-16 toting criminals

1091
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,040
to deal with

1092
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,300
and without scooping up

1093
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,800
sub-dini's without table manners.

1094
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,660
Sidewalk lawyer G.G. Gordon

1095
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,500
had his hands full

1096
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,300
just trying to get

1097
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,480
us out in one piece

1098
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,000
because of that little dinner.

1099
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,420
Those jokers have got to go.

1100
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,020
Can't you burn their houses down

1101
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,580
like you did

1102
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,020
your buddy D. Burns suggested?

1103
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,660
Maybe then they'll see

1104
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,360
Stemo comes out here

1105
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,600
with the same fake accent

1106
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,320
they all use,

1107
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,160
all of you use,

1108
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,200
and slays no one.

1109
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,240
Jayner spouts

1110
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,380
that his lower extremities

1111
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,100
are aflame.

1112
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,120
That he wishes

1113
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,840
and asks

1114
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,080
that a member of the court

1115
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,500
at both the state

1116
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,560
and federal levels

1117
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,220
not to mention God

1118
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,140
to perform

1119
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,660
an evil,

1120
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,200
defiled,

1121
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,440
sex act on him.

1122
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,400
Just that he may hear

1123
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,260
the same washed out sound effect

1124
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,000
of an explosion

1125
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,040
that we all heard.

1126
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,760
Ha ha ha.

1127
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,240
I was mortally embarrassed

1128
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,280
to play that Midwestern drivel.

1129
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,580
But in the interest

1130
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,080
of salvaging

1131
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,820
some sort of a show

1132
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,600
from the muck,

1133
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,740
I bore on.

1134
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,080
Kids,

1135
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,180
I'm afraid I've

1136
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,280
I'm afraid I've

1137
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:04,280


1138
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:04,280


1139
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:04,280


1140
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,120
I've lost

1141
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,900
the most precious thing

1142
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,920
there is to me.

1143
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,160
My personal slag.

1144
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,620
All children,

1145
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,540
gather round.

1146
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,260
The older girls

1147
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,120
come closer.

1148
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,180
The ones who are

1149
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:17,940
starting to sprout.

1150
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,240
Are you missing

1151
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,380
your slag, brother?

1152
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,540
Have you no slag?

1153
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:23,480
Well,

1154
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,720
praise Don.

1155
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,460
Don brings slag

1156
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,160
to the slagless.

1157
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,160
If you down in your mine

1158
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,300
or your quarry

1159
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,640
have not enough slag,

1160
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,260
you're not going to have

1161
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,440
why R.L.

1162
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,140
Don Glods

1163
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,340
will bring you slag.

1164
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,040
Smooth.

1165
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,400
And he will teach you

1166
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,040
the story

1167
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,100
of the M-ists

1168
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,600
from outer space

1169
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,540
who will come

1170
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,500
down to Earth

1171
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,160
and save all those

1172
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,080
who spent their $31.

1173
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,360
Oh, yes.

1174
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,040
Praise Don.

1175
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,320
Praise Don.

1176
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,020
Don will let you play

1177
00:51:59,020 --> 00:51:59,940
with your thermometer

1178
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,740
in the rain

1179
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,400
unlike Bob Dobbs

1180
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:02,980
who will let you

1181
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,060
stand in hackneyed

1182
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:04,540
in short.

1183
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,420
He's the kind of man

1184
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,720
who visited his block

1185
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,440
and was like,

1186
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:09,760
whew,

1187
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,880
what was in that stuff?

1188
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,180
Is that stuff

1189
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,820
or is it just something else?

1190
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,700
Oh, that's that stuff

1191
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,280
we are Bob Dobbs,

1192
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,140
soldier, ain't it?

1193
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,300
He ate it?

1194
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,300
He ate it.

1195
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,240
He ate it.

1196
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,780
He can't stop thinking

1197
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,880
and hang down it

1198
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,280
all the time.

1199
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,540
It just goes like Bob.

1200
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,940
It gets into your brain

1201
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,480
and then it just

1202
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,600
scrambles everything up.

1203
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,280
Thank God we're into Don now

1204
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,960
and forgot that evil slag.

1205
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,700
Black Meister Bob.

1206
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,440
Trying to heal, you know,

1207
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,040
those who've been brainwashed

1208
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,380
by the Bob cult.

1209
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,540
Those we dare.

1210
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,520
We're recovering.

1211
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,560
Those poor people.

1212
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,260
Recovering cult addicts.

1213
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,600
That was about his mother, I think.

1214
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,080
His sainted mother.

1215
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,880
His sainted gray-haired granny.

1216
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,460
Well, you know,

1217
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,300
there's no replacing

1218
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,960
his gray-haired granny

1219
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,680
and his...

1220
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,420
blue-haired brother,

1221
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,440
brown-haired idiot uncle.

1222
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,200
His pet idiot.

1223
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,040
And his pet idiot.

1224
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:12,100
Can you believe

1225
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:12,980
that they allowed him

1226
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,140
to keep a pet idiot?

1227
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,680
Actually, to tell the truth, Chaz,

1228
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,820
I've been doing

1229
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,860
X-Day shows

1230
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,520
for Hour of Slack

1231
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,940
ahead of time.

1232
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:23,880
They're all done.

1233
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,580
So it's like

1234
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,200
anything we say about X-Day now

1235
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,380
would be used

1236
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,140
on next year's show.

1237
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,600
I can't stand the pleasure.

1238
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,740
Assuming that the world

1239
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:34,760
was still here

1240
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,460
and that our cult is, in fact,

1241
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,880
just a sad, pathetic joke.

1242
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,900
Well, that's true.

1243
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,620
Struggling tadpole out of the water.

1244
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,760
Never to grow.

1245
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,740
Never, ever to lose its tail

1246
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,620
and grow legs.

1247
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,160
Well, now, Reverend Stang,

1248
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,800
is it not true that you gave

1249
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,160
in the year 1980 itself,

1250
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,280
and it says here

1251
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,720
in my congressional rectify,

1252
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,820
says here that you gave...

1253
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,240
We tried to destroy the world.

1254
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,020
You tried.

1255
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,500
Well, you actually succeeded.

1256
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,020
You tried to destroy

1257
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,120
some parts of the world.

1258
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,620
Isn't that true, Senator Klebop?

1259
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:07,900
No.

1260
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,840
That was absolutely true,

1261
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,900
Senator Hedwig.

1262
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,500
That was the federal building

1263
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,840
in Waco, Texas.

1264
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:14,780
Well, it says here

1265
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,980
it was the Fezziwig building

1266
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,280
of the Imperial Literacy Towers,

1267
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,720
a place that doesn't really exist

1268
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,420
except for in your warped mind.

1269
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,100
Well, look, look.

1270
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,780
Almost every religion

1271
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,300
has an end-of-the-world prediction.

1272
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,900
Sir, are you...

1273
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,040
Fizzles are...

1274
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,820
You know, they try to end the world

1275
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,120
in their immediate vicinity.

1276
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,200
I cannot...

1277
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:33,640
We've got a...

1278
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:33,720
We've got a...

1279
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,900
We've got a virus this time, though,

1280
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,140
that we think is going to work.

1281
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,360
It's going to take a while,

1282
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,380
so, you know,

1283
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,120
the July 5th thing

1284
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,100
becomes sort of more of a symbolic...

1285
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,420
If my ears aren't burning now,

1286
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,240
I don't know so when my ears

1287
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,360
will ever burn again.

1288
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,640
You have said not only

1289
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,640
you've promised to hook

1290
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,660
the virus upon this land...

1291
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,240
It's done.

1292
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,540
...to visitate the pestilences

1293
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,420
and so forth.

1294
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,140
You've not only included yourself

1295
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:57,980
in this plan,

1296
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:58,900
but you call yourself

1297
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,200
a religion?

1298
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,180
What?

1299
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,140
I almost swore.

1300
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,600
In the name of the Lord,

1301
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,040
I can't...

1302
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,640
What kind of religion

1303
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,440
would you call that?

1304
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,360
Well, I'm...

1305
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,300
An above-average...

1306
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,940
Well, below-genius religion, sir.

1307
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,200
Your Honor.

1308
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,360
It's not...

1309
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:16,980
It's not...

1310
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,080
Just another...

1311
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,400
Just another end-of-the-world

1312
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,720
UFO sex weirdness.

1313
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,700
Well, these moon pants you've marked there,

1314
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,720
they're containing spent plutonium,

1315
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,740
much like the weapons

1316
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,480
we're using in Osaka, Japan.

1317
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,420
Sir, how can you be

1318
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,800
so cold-blooded?

1319
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,160
I know you have some

1320
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,520
lizard blood in you,

1321
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,620
but how can you be

1322
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,100
so cold-blooded?

1323
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,540
Who let the rooster in?

1324
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:40,900
Yeah.

1325
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,020
Well, the plutonium

1326
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:43,620
in the moon pants

1327
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,020
prevents normals

1328
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,300
from being born

1329
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,560
to subgenius couples

1330
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,860
who wear the moon pants.

1331
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,360
That's weird.

1332
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:50,920
Well, I...

1333
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,200
I never saw a rooster

1334
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,840
If my ankles are not

1335
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,920
covered with sweat

1336
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,700
and turning green right now, sir,

1337
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,520
I do not know

1338
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,480
if they ever shall.

1339
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,440
Now you've got

1340
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,740
the music to this.

1341
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,560
You've got the music to this.

1342
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,480
You seem to think

1343
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,100
you're some kind of big deal.

1344
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,280
God only knows

1345
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,680
where you get those ideas.

1346
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,120
You know you're nothing

1347
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,820
but a shield for the need-mill

1348
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,020
that you want you to

1349
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,280
make happy a bill.

1350
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,000
But everybody wants

1351
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,200
a slice of the pie,

1352
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,300
but I don't see

1353
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,420
who's watching through you.

1354
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,700
This Catholic tradition,

1355
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,280
it's a sin.

1356
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,860
It's a downright disgrace.

1357
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,400
It's a sin.

1358
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:34,060
You never thought

1359
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,720
I'd find out the big secret.

1360
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,520
Now you've got

1361
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,880
the music to this.

1362
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,660
You've got the music to this.

1363
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:58,300
You've got the music to this.

1364
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,840
The geeks at the boys

1365
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,000
know all about it.

1366
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,180
You've got to get out of town.

1367
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,080
You've got to take a platter with it.

1368
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,180
It doesn't look like

1369
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,920
you draw a lot of water with it.

1370
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,320
You don't have any say

1371
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,600
in the matter with it.

1372
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,660
Look for someone

1373
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,140
to throw the book at you.

1374
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,600
Take the world's last

1375
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,900
sincape off our heads.

1376
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,880
It's a shame.

1377
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,040
It's a sin.

1378
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,640
It's a downright disgrace.

1379
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,740
You never thought

1380
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,340
I'd find out the big secret.

1381
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,180
Now you've got

1382
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,540
the music to this.

1383
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:32,740
You've got the music to this.

1384
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,040
You've got the music to this.

1385
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:33,400
Now you've got the music to this.

1386
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:33,400


1387
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,680
You've got the music too

1388
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,400
Music

1389
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,680
You've got to face the music

1390
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,040
Face the music

1391
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,080
You've got to face the music this time

1392
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,400
You've got to face the music

1393
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,160
Think boys

1394
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,460
With Dr. X on vocals

1395
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:40,440
May he rest in peace

1396
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,260
Red Heights, Ohio

1397
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,140
44118

1398
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:10,360
Ah yes

1399
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:15,040
I am the bursar of

1400
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,320
Dumpstown

1401
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:44,280
Dumpstown, Ohio
