1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,000
Instead of making your dollars shrink by investing in United States savings bonds,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,540
why not make them grow with interest by spending needlessly when prices are high?

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,260
Here's the way it works.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,380
Seventy-five dollars invested now each month will in ten years turn into an income of one dollar

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,040
for as long a period as you forcibly fought forces of evil each month for a fact.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
But now...

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,720
The Soul Genius!

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,060
Our House!

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,800
The Soul Genius!

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,940
Savings Plan.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,960
What sort of life, if any, inhabits these other planets?

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,760
Human life like ours?

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,760
Or life extremely lower in the scale?

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,360
Or dangerously higher?

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,260
You know, our next guest is Reverend Ivan Stang.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,840
He's with the Church of the Subgenius.

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,040
And it's a church that's been around for quite a while.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,820
Saved a lot of people from...

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,620
I don't know what it saved them from, but it saved a whole lot of people.

20
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,040
I think it helped a lot of people get married.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,720
And helped a lot of people get married.

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,000
They are now claiming that the end of the world is coming soon.

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,480
And specifically, I think, on July 5th.

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,840
And just like any good organization, they're trying to make some money off of it.

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,920
And...

26
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:27,740
Uh...

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,780
So, I don't know.

28
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,700
We'll talk to the good...

29
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,240
Good Reverend, are you there?

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,500
Yes, I'm here.

31
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,220
Praise Jack.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,580
Thank you so much.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,040
The end of the world is coming.

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,160
It says the doomsday is coming for the 15th time.

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,480
I've missed the first 14 of them.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,780
I don't want to miss this one.

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,540
Tell me what I need to do to be there and be hip about it.

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,320
Well, Jack, I was just looking at...

39
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,020
At your description on Wikipedia and your website.

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,080
Uh-huh.

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,240
And I feel like I should be interviewing you.

42
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,760
You're certainly weird enough to...

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,000
I would think you'd probably get a free admission to the X-Day end of the world.

44
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,620
X-Day?

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,660
You know, it's going to happen everywhere, but we figure we want to be with our friends and sex partners or whatnot.

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,200
Right.

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,020
You know, when the world ends.

48
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,400
I do believe in theories, Doctor.

49
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,720
But when you tell me...

50
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,400
You're going to be flying to another planet as a possibility, you're out of the realm of theory.

51
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,340
You're in a dream world of the impossible.

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Even if the world were to end, would it be less unpleasant to die out in space than here on firm ground?

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,220
The world will not end.

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,260
Predicting the end of the world is an annual crackpot event in our society, an attempt to corner the newspaper headlines.

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,980
Read all about it!

56
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,640
End of the world!

57
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,760
Just around the corner!

58
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,520
Read all about it!

59
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:02,860
Get you!

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,020
People tend to let go of their inhibitions when they know everything is coming to an end.

61
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,860
Well, you know, I like to base everything on cartoons that I watch.

62
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,100
And one of them that I love to watch is called Squidbillies.

63
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,800
And at the end of the...

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,460
On their version of the end of the world, everyone got nude and all the Christians went up.

65
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,040
To heaven.

66
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,120
Rose up.

67
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,260
Now, the members of the Church of the Subgenius, will they float up nude or clothed?

68
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,560
Or will they remain on the ground to take care of business down here?

69
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,640
Well, that's a delicate subject.

70
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:57,020
What we suspect will happen, according to prophecy, is everybody who has bought a subgenius ministership, an ordainment in the Church,

71
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:04,200
it may be a little disconcerting because they'll all appear to be bursting into flames and screaming and yelling.

72
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,960
But their beautiful naked spirit will rise up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

73
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,220
Out of the flame.

74
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Which, by the way, are unichromosomal.

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,520
We call them goddesses because they can reproduce, but they can appear as anything you want.

76
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,560
So, you know, if you want your sex god or your sex goat, for that matter.

77
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:26,960
Right.

78
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,320
Whatever.

79
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:27,840
Whatever you want.

80
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,200
This is only available to dues-paying subgenius ministers, however.

81
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,000
Right.

82
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,380
I mean, we're crazy, but we're not any crazier than, say, the Jehovah's Witnesses, who have predicted the end of the world numerous times.

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,320
At least we do it on a regular yearly schedule.

84
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,620
And at a good time of the year and a good place, too.

85
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,540
You know?

86
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,780
It's in a campground in rural New York in Amish country.

87
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,400
Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,300
But the campground is regularly used by neopagues.

89
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,180
Oh.

90
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,360
And it's a nudist campground if you want to be naked.

91
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,980
Of course, only the ones who shouldn't be ever do, but that kind of goes with the territory.

92
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,320
Right.

93
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:15,700
And we will be in that territory soon enough, dear friends, because X-Day is a-comin'.

94
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:27,020
This hour of slack show, number 1,258, is composed almost entirely of people on other shows talking about X-Day.

95
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:34,400
We've heard some just now from the Jack Jett Show on Rational Radio in Dallas, Texas.

96
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:47,020
We'll also hear snippets from the Puzzling Evidence Show from KPFA Berkeley and from the popular British podcast called Right Where You Are Sitting Now.

97
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,940
Reverend Susie the Floozies, Bob's Slacktime Funhouse from WREK Atlanta will be exploited.

98
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,420
Used, as usual.

99
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,200
And, uh...

100
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,420
Well, you'll see.

101
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,100
Many of our listeners are unbelievers.

102
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,760
They think this show is cute or funny.

103
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,720
But they don't believe in Bob and they don't take X-Day seriously.

104
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,980
Maybe this upcoming recording will change that.

105
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:27,440
It was recorded at the 2002, or 2003, X-Day drill ceremony in Hamburg, Germany.

106
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,600
The epicenter of the Euro subgenius movement.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,160
Oh, no, what?

108
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,020
That's Amsterdam.

109
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:51,000
Anyway, this is an actual recording from Hamburg, Germany of a live subgenius devival sermon preached by the great minister, father, or rather, Papa Joe Mama.

110
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,440
I want you to pay attention to this.

111
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,440


112
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,440


113
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,440


114
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,440


115
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:07,080
Put your hands together and scream like maniacs for the infamous evil Papa...

116
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,860
Papa...

117
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,260
Evil...

118
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,860
Papa...

119
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:08,860


120
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:08,860


121
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:08,860


122
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:08,860


123
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,360
Papa Joe! Papa Joe! Papa Joe!

124
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,400
Mama kendi Natie!

125
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,280
Papa Joe! Papa Joe! Hallelujah, ladies and gentlemen!

126
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,660
Jeah of Dobs.

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,860
Uber Alice!

128
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,680
You asked what time it is, friends, and I'm here to tell you what time it is.

129
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,500
It's five minutes till midnight!

130
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:51,780
Aye!

131
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,400
Yes, dear friends, the end times are upon us.

132
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,460
The proof is everywhere around.

133
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,440
Despite the conspiracy's best efforts to comfort and reassure you otherwise,

134
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,420
their sinister control in existence is fast coming to a close.

135
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,640
Best of all, they know it.

136
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,840
Like the pilot announcing over the intercom that the engine trouble is nothing to worry about.

137
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,780
The more they urge everyone to remain calm,

138
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,080
the more obvious their own panic becomes.

139
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,120
They all see the fulfillment of Bob's prophecies unfold.

140
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,060
A world on the edge of Armageddon.

141
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,620
The conspiracy's desperate last-ditch efforts to pull itself out of its nosedive.

142
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:45,360
And Bob's bold plan to re-establish freedom and slack in the conspiracy's aftermath.

143
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,140
Do I hear a praise ball?

144
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,440
Praise ball!

145
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,220
Praise ball!

146
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,640
Who would have ever imagined

147
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,380
that the countdown to July 15th

148
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,380


149
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,460
would have begun on September 11th?

150
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,740
See how the world's armies converge upon the Middle East

151
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,860
in a futile attempt to maintain the status quo!

152
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,420
Who amongst us seriously believes a conspiracy will ever allow itself

153
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,600
to completely win this war,

154
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,120
then turn around and restore the civil liberties they so jealously snatched away?

155
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,700
Ah...

156
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,360
There shall always be a war.

157
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,320
There shall always be at least one terrorist who gets away.

158
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,040
One that's big enough and bad enough to justify the continuation of the newly expanded police state.

159
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,780
If not make it even bigger.

160
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,180
But we, the sub-genies,

161
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:50,540
we do not, and we are not, intimidated by a conspiracy show of force.

162
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,360
We recognize only one,

163
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,340
only one supreme authority,

164
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,900
not the faceless, nameless, men in black.

165
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,500
No, sir!

166
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,720
No!

167
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,460
But a smiling face,

168
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,100
named J. R. Bob Dorff!

169
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,140
Yeah!

170
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,000
Woo!

171
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,540
Woo!

172
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,360
We, we, we will follow that face to the ends of the earth,

173
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,960
and well beyond after this planet is no more.

174
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,860
That time is coming soon, my friends.

175
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,460
It's five minutes till midnight!

176
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,460
Yeah!

177
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,320
Look, I'm not going to be a fool.

178
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,320


179
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,320


180
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,100
Look at humanity,

181
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,860
and America alone!

182
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,200
The so-called land of milk and honey.

183
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,880
700,000 people owe 30 billion dollars in high-interest credit card debt.

184
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,720
Ha ha ha ha!

185
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,800
They'll never pay it off.

186
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,360
But of course they're not supposed to pay it off now, are they?

187
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:46,980
No, sir!

188
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,160
The conspiracy wants them to remain in debt perpetually, running down that endless treadmill.

189
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,380
Bob says no!

190
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,460
It's time to get off!

191
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,980
It's time to get off like you've never gotten off before!

192
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,820
It's five minutes till midnight!

193
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:02,520
Woo!

194
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,080
Woo!

195
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,700
Bob!

196
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,920
In the last month alone,

197
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,840
American Post delivered

198
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,340
three billion pieces of mail.

199
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,620
Three people died from anthrax from those legends.

200
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,020
So now the peak public

201
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,120
is terrified that

202
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,680
they are next!

203
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,680
That's a one in one billion chance

204
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
that you could get infected

205
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,100
and be killed.

206
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,940
More people have died from spontaneous combustion,

207
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,540
just unexplainably exploding into flames.

208
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,000
Woo!

209
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,040
Yet millions,

210
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,320
millions still believe that they're in desperate danger.

211
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,700
This is called mass hysteria.

212
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,580
The first step to complete social breakdown.

213
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,280
The rats are ready to flee the ship,

214
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,440
whether it's sinking or not.

215
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,960
It's five minutes till midnight!

216
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:58,680
Woo!

217
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,380
Woo!

218
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,960
He who knows the future owns it.

219
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,960
He who knows there is no future

220
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,660
rents it to others.

221
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,740
Woo!

222
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,900
Woo!

223
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,340
Ah, Bob Dobbs said, and I quote,

224
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,420
The world ends July 5th, 1998.

225
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,240
Woo!

226
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,140
Now the conspiracy believes that 1998 is over

227
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,260
and that they are now safe.

228
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,700
They don't believe in time control.

229
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,200
They don't believe in excess UFOs.

230
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,720
And worst of all,

231
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,220
they don't believe in Bob!

232
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,140
Woo!

233
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,860
And for that unforgivable blasphemy,

234
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,360
they shall surely die!

235
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,160
It's five minutes till midnight!

236
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,300
Woo!

237
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,240
Woo!

238
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,860
For centuries, humans banged their heads against the walls

239
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,300
trying to find the answers

240
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,340
to life, happiness and peace on Earth.

241
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,020
But that answer sadly never came.

242
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,200
You wanna know why?

243
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,140
No!

244
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,480
Because the answer's not here, friends.

245
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,860
They're looking in the wrong place.

246
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,720
That answer isn't on Earth at all.

247
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,200
It's on planet X.

248
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,780
Woo!

249
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,260
And there's only one way to get there, friends.

250
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,000
And it sure as hell ain't by brown-nosing the boss.

251
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,560
Or by trying to stockpile the most numbers in your bank account.

252
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,900
No, sir!

253
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,960
The only way to find paradise and avoid hell on Earth

254
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,000
is to possess a ticket aboard an X's flying saucer.

255
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,320
That ticket cannot be bought, friends.

256
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,940
It can only be bought if

257
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,620
you must trade true love and affection for Bob

258
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,500
plus a $30 love offering

259
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,180
to the subgenius foundation.

260
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,920
Now, some people wonder,

261
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,660
can I really afford it?

262
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,260
The answer, of course, is

263
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,500
can you not afford it?

264
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,020
Because, in the most simple of terms,

265
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,620
it's five minutes till midnight!

266
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,420
Ladies and Germans,

267
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,340
we cannot promise you

268
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,600
that you will walk out of here with all the answers.

269
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,480
But we're hoping to at least provide you

270
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,900
with some of the answers

271
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,300
to some of the more vital, life-changing questions.

272
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,260
One of them is this.

273
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,860
Do you wish to live after July 5th, 1998?

274
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:27,980
Yes!

275
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,640
If the answer is no, however,

276
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,500
just keep serving the conspiracy.

277
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,500
Those X's saucers will arrive here

278
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,200
and rain death upon you and all your pink friends.

279
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,020
But if, however, the answer is yes,

280
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,500
well, in that case, I suggest,

281
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,440
and that's assuming, of course,

282
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,200
you prefer an eternity of slack

283
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,640
and want to enjoy a space journey

284
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
aboard the pleasure saucers with Bob,

285
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,100
enjoying sex-star beautiful babes,

286
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,120
an abundant supply of have-a-fropped zippy-lops,

287
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,780
and, of course, good quality rock and roll,

288
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,240
and I'm not talking that 70s shit,

289
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,620
then turn your life over to Bob!

290
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,120
It ain't hard, friends.

291
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,040
It's easy and it's fun.

292
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,320
You'll get eternal salvation and slack at no extra charge.

293
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,040
But best of all, best of all,

294
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,820
you'll feel a thrill instead of a chill

295
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,420
when someone asks you,

296
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,980
uh, what time is it?

297
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,820
And the answer is, it's 5 a.m. still midnight!

298
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,220
Narrated the work of our great Bob Abin!

299
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,860
Hallelujah!

300
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,120
Hallelujah!

301
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,380
Hallelujah!

302
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,760
Are you scared?

303
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,340
Boy, I know I am!

304
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,560
I'm so scared, I think I'm gonna pay my $30 again

305
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,560
just to make sure I get on that Exit spacecraft!

306
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,200
I paid my $30!

307
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,300
Hallelujah!

308
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,520
Hallelujah!

309
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,500
The subcommittee didn't believe a word we told them.

310
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,840
At least they didn't ridicule us.

311
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,780
No one believes us.

312
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,180
How will we ever interest enough private capital?

313
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,040
It's hopeless.

314
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,140
I believe you, Bob.

315
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,480
I'll buy you a start on your rocket ship.

316
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,600
At my age, I'll settle for the satisfaction

317
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,660
that I contributed toward salvaging something from our old world.

318
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,680
Hey, I'm older and richer than you are.

319
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,360
I'll arrange a lease on a large enough camp,

320
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,440
one of the government's old proving ground sites.

321
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,900
Why, between Marston and me,

322
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,320
you'll have enough to start construction.

323
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,000
Wonderful, Spiro. Wonderful!

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,960
I'll arrange the details for our next meeting.

325
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,320
Right.

326
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,140
Hello, Reverend Stang.

327
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,480
Thanks so much for coming on the show again.

328
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,440
We really appreciate it.

329
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,260
Always good to have you on.

330
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,120
Praise Ken and praise Kim.

331
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:57,700
Ah.

332
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,680
Both co-hosts with one syllable names starting with a K.

333
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,220
Yep.

334
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,940
In order to confuse subgeniuses.

335
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,320
Yeah.

336
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,260
That's our cunning plan.

337
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,820
But you've...

338
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,280
Not really.

339
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,520
It's pretty easy to confuse.

340
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,300
I was going to say,

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
it's not even working very well, so...

342
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,560
Yeah, true, true.

343
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,940
We're not doing too well on that one.

344
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,060
So, we've just...

345
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,420
You've just finished X Day,

346
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:26,720
and I assume,

347
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,300
unless we're talking to you on some kind of interstellar Skype,

348
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,060
the sources didn't turn up this time.

349
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:32,700
Right.

350
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,820
This is actually the 12th time

351
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,620
that we've waited on July 5th,

352
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,800
12 years in a row,

353
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,800
at the ungodly hour,

354
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,500
7 o'clock in the morning,

355
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,680
waiting for aliens to come and

356
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
save us from this planet,

357
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,880
and let us destroy everything we didn't like on this planet,

358
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,380
for only 30 bucks.

359
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,840
But, once again,

360
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,700
it turned out just to be another drill.

361
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,560
Yeah.

362
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,680
Is that...

363
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,400
Nonetheless, I'm sure we'll be out there next time.

364
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,340
Next time will be Lucky 13.

365
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,240
Ah.

366
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,580
And, you know, you cannot shake the faith of the subgenius.

367
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,300
.

368
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,600
It's unshakable,

369
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,960
possibly because it's not even really there.

370
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:18,800
Ah.

371
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,060
That's funny.

372
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,620
Yeah, there you go.

373
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,960
But you'd think someone that was so keen on Slack

374
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,980
would arrange a slightly later date to pick up the subgeniuses.

375
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,660
Well, that's the thing.

376
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,680
You know, we don't...

377
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,220
I think Bob's lesson from this whole X Day thing

378
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,500
is that we know not the hour in which they will come.

379
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,140
And that means you better be ready.

380
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,260
And we have to give you the opportunity any second now.

381
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,200
The world could end tomorrow.

382
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,680
Do you have that subgenius minister's card in your pocket

383
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,620
that will provide you with eternal salvation

384
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,100
or triple your money back?

385
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,740
Yeah.

386
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,440
That's the question everybody must ask themselves.

387
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,580
You know, the fact that we gather like idiots

388
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,860
and wait at seven in the morning every July 5th

389
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,180
on this rainy campground for saucers to pick us up,

390
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,180
and then the saucers not picking us up

391
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,060
only indicates that this is not yet the year

392
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,460
that Bob predicted the saucers would pick us up, 1998.

393
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,720
This must be before 1998

394
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,680
and the conspiracy of the normal people

395
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,220
has obviously been diddling the calendars

396
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,220
for hundreds of years just to embarrass Bob,

397
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,940
our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

398
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,500
who predicted all this stuff.

399
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,000
And we still have faith in Bob, or FIB for short.

400
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,480
We steadfastly maintain the FIB.

401
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,240
The fib.

402
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,860
Faith in Bob, yes.

403
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,740
Have you considered that maybe aliens don't like early mornings?

404
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,620
Anybody has considered that.

405
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,940
I can guarantee you that the subgeniuses

406
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,940
really don't like to get up at 7.

407
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,500
Now, most of them have to get up at 7 in the morning

408
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,940
five days a week.

409
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,760
To go to work.

410
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,420
For me, that's the only morning

411
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,940
that I have to get up that early.

412
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,520
That's my sacrifice for the subgeniuses.

413
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,720
I get up there and let them throw rocks at me

414
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,260
when the aliens don't show up.

415
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,500
But I only have to do that one day a year.

416
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,320
So you might say I have a pretty good job.

417
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,700
You know, I want to see that one that was 60,000 B.C.

418
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,400
when there's really no humans that are really like humans yet.

419
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:34,760
Yeah.

420
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,980
They're almost human.

421
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,020
They're like ferrets.

422
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,400
People.

423
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,040
They're like cartons of milk.

424
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,100
This is the sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFC.

425
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,180
Each person has a face.

426
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,500
Their face is a carton of milk.

427
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,740
George, I don't think I'll ever listen to this show again.

428
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,800
No, no, you probably won't.

429
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,820
You know, I used to listen to this show, George,

430
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,340
to get my news and I'd get my relevant information for the day.

431
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,880
I would get my marching orders.

432
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,480
I'd be able to go out and face and cope with the world.

433
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,060
And yet...

434
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,660
George, when I listen to this show now,

435
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,420
all I get is confusion, chaos, and tumult.

436
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,700
But it's all together now.

437
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,640
Your obsequious tone is unfulfilling.

438
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,600
Yeah.

439
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,040
It's a funky bit of fun.

440
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:22,500
Oh, no.

441
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,760
It's a funky bit of fun.

442
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,600
I say eschew obsequiousness.

443
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,440
Okay, those are the magic words.

444
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Oh, yeah.

445
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,060
That's true.

446
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,380
They must pay the rent.

447
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,560
Oh, is that right?

448
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,560
Make a copy if you want.

449
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
It's the radio-cleared version of all the songs.

450
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,320
Oh, that's great.

451
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:54,780
Yeah.

452
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,720
So no bad words in there.

453
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,380
Oh, that's great.

454
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,500
With a 3D cover.

455
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,680
Delicious D.

456
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,180
Yeah.

457
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,680
The PG version.

458
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,040
Yeah.

459
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,500
Because they're a nice band, really.

460
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,140
They are a nice band.

461
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:09,720
Yeah.

462
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,560
Like Jimi Hendrix was a nice band.

463
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,100
Who is that?

464
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,440
Who is that?

465
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:16,960
Who is that?

466
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,620
That's Roger Waters.

467
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,780
That guy yelling?

468
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,360
Yeah.

469
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,280
Is that Roger Waters?

470
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:21,700
Yeah.

471
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,560
It's going back and forth between Roger Waters and Jimi Hendrix.

472
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,640
Get your...

473
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,120
Take care of the...

474
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

475
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,520
Yeah.

476
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:35,900
Yeah.

477
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,660
Let's do this!

478
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:55,960
Oh my gosh.

479
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,400
It's way easier with the4500!

480
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,400


481
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,520
The 15 opened the box with relocating launch.

482
00:22:59,520 --> 00:22:59,520


483
00:22:59,520 --> 00:22:59,520


484
00:22:59,520 --> 00:22:59,600
The one I lost there is the 90X taskbar.

485
00:22:59,600 --> 00:22:59,600


486
00:22:59,600 --> 00:22:59,600


487
00:22:59,600 --> 00:22:59,600


488
00:22:59,600 --> 00:22:59,860
I can probably play with you definitely, but.

489
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,700
Wow.

490
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,080
I'll throw you guys.

491
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,600
No worries.

492
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,020
That's fine.

493
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:12,240
So, uh, 8484425, that was a short home movie of Bob.

494
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,340
You could be sitting there listening to yourself talking on this crazy thing.

495
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,580
No, you're just sitting there, getting ready to push your own,

496
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,680
especially individually, version of the dump button.

497
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,020
Yeah, but not with Bo Derek.

498
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,760
Not with Bo Derek, no.

499
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,540
I guess she's dead.

500
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,760
The humans are dead.

501
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,300
Did I not make that clear?

502
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:46,860
So now, this X-Day is going to be in New York on July 5th.

503
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,220
Right.

504
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,900
And what will be taking place on that date?

505
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,440
Mostly a lot of stuff that I probably shouldn't talk about on the radio,

506
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,640
because we don't need the extra attention.

507
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,100
But there will be quite a few bands.

508
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,760
This year, it seems to be mostly what you would call Horror Billy.

509
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:05,900
Billy.

510
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,120
Man.

511
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,860
Okay.

512
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,920
We'll have the naked blood wrestling on a giant American flag.

513
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,360
That's kind of a tradition.

514
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,180
That's good.

515
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,460
We've had some injuries doing that, but we persevere.

516
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,000
We'll be doing live radio all the way to the bitter end, or whatever happens.

517
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,020
Remember, we go out to this campground every year waiting for the world to end,

518
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,340
and it's just under the expectation that maybe this year will be 1998.

519
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,200
This is like the Great Pumpkin.

520
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:34,500
You know.

521
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,440
Our guru, Bob, predicted that the world would end July 5th, 1998 at 7 in the morning,

522
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,240
and one of these years is bound to be the real 1998.

523
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,280
It will, and when that happens, you guys are going to get such awesome press out of it.

524
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,540
You know?

525
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,780
Mary Hart from Entertainment Tonight.

526
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,240
Everyone's going to want to interview you.

527
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,140
Gloria Compos.

528
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,260
Gloria Compos.

529
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,540
Olivia Newton-John.

530
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,420
I bet.

531
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:02,960
I can't.

532
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,420
You know, I'm jealous, Jack,

533
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:10,760
because I was looking at your website, and there were pictures of you with Charo, Sean Young,

534
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,940
the dueling bankheads.

535
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,960
Uh-huh.

536
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,800
I had no idea.

537
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,760
You've definitely explored the subterranean tunnels, haven't you?

538
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,820
Yes, I've been an aging TV gas bag for some time now.

539
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,460
Man.

540
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,880
For about 10 years.

541
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:34,320
I used to host a show with Sandra Bernhardt, and she is Jewish.

542
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,680
No.

543
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,320
Of the Jewish faith.

544
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,220
No way.

545
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,380
And I tried to convert her every day of my life.

546
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,660
I tried to convert that woman, telling her, you know, you killed the Jesus dude, and you're

547
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,360
going to go to hell.

548
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,280
And she is still just as catty as she ever was.

549
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,540
That's the way she is.

550
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,040
Do you know what I miss?

551
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,440
What were you trying to convert her to?

552
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,640
I didn't really know.

553
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,600
That was the problem.

554
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh.

555
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,040
I didn't have anything specific.

556
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,400
I was just trying to get her to go to hell.

557
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,260
I was trying to convert her to become a lesbian.

558
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,900
I was just trying to convert her away from the Jew business.

559
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,400
What I really miss about Sandra is Really Bad Cinema.

560
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:13,700
What?

561
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,780
Really Bad Cinema.

562
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,620
You've never seen that show?

563
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:15,900
No.

564
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:21,500
She used to host a show called Really Bad Cinema, and she would make these running,

565
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,660
goofy commentaries about all these 50s and early 60s vintage exploitation films.

566
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,320
Oh, that's good.

567
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,500
And it was flawless.

568
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,980
It was absolutely ... I mean, you would go out and rent these ridiculously awful movies,

569
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,620
just because Sandra Bernhardt ...

570
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,440
Well, I will tell you this about Sandra Bernhardt.

571
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,920
She has the prettiest girlfriend in the world.

572
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,580
Beautiful.

573
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,100
Beautiful.

574
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,620
Beautiful.

575
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,660
The type of species with which we've been experimenting is not satisfactory.

576
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,060
Size, strength, the will to live, essential in what we're trying to accomplish are lacking

577
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,680
in these animals.

578
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,080
We have at hand the very elements that could make possible the things we're trying to do.

579
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,880
I don't understand.

580
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,600
It's been proved beyond doubt that glands can transform things.

581
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:03,600


582
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:03,600


583
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:03,600


584
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,660
It's not just physical matter into any size, shape, or appearance.

585
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,720
Yes, that's true.

586
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:13,500
We have here in this sanitarium a rare case of follicular cyst, which induces the secretion

587
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,360
of unusual amounts of the sex hormones.

588
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,540
Miss Coleman?

589
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:18,780
Yes.

590
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,060
If we've been able to create through the medium of glandular extraction such specimens as

591
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:33,460
we have, what's to prevent us transfusing these glandular extractions from a human being

592
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:33,580
in the future?

593
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,780
Well, the only way to do that is to make them into a higher type of animal.

594
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,480
The authorities.

595
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,600
They wouldn't permit it.

596
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,640
I see you're not truly a scientist at heart, Miss Strand.

597
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,620
Nor a subgenius.

598
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,080
And Miss Strand will pay for that flaw.

599
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,620
John Carradine will transplant her brain into the gorilla woman body of Captive Wild Woman,

600
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,640
1943, the movie once that clip was ripped.

601
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,580
One of the lesser.

602
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:03,560
Yes.

603
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,240
One of the lesser Universal Monster movies.

604
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,800
But because of that, now all the more bulldada looking.

605
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,160
And the female star who played the egg woman, Aquanetta.

606
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,160
Oh my god.

607
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,460
Enough said.

608
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:25,420
Anyway, we have also heard clips from When Worlds Collide, the old movie, and from the

609
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,840
Buzzing Evidence show, of which more is coming.

610
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,560
But first, back to the British podcast of Right Where You Are.

611
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,560
My name's salt ist my 우다

612
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:38,560


613
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,320
Worst.

614
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,200
Worst.

615
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,020
Worst.

616
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,100
Worst.

617
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,320
Worst.

618
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,560
Worst.

619
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:56,940
the 5th of July lands, we usually end up going home dejected and sad and sick on Sunday.

620
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:05,420
But it's well worth it, just because you get to meet the other subgeniuses.

621
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,560
You know, in any given neighborhood, there may be plenty of other subgeniuses scattered

622
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,980
around, but you don't know them.

623
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,080
You don't know who they are.

624
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,780
You can't tell them by how they look.

625
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,440
They could be any age, any type of person.

626
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:26,660
And the smart ones don't wear subgenius t-shirts all the time, because that can affect your

627
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,200
income.

628
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:36,720
So X-Day is the chance for all of us to get together, and essentially it's a migratory

629
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,740
mating ground.

630
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,820
And the mating really does happen.

631
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,760
In the old days, we were accused of it being what you might call a...

632
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,960
Sausage Fest.

633
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,500
An all-boys group of geeks.

634
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:56,680
And it was in the early years, but we started lying and saying there were a lot of horny

635
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,500
girls around.

636
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,100
And build it, and they will come.

637
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:08,380
Pretty soon, there were lots of horny nerd girls around to meet the nerd boys.

638
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,360
And now there's little nerd children.

639
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,600
You know, we've been doing this for so long, there's a second generation.

640
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:14,940
Yeah.

641
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,400
Children who were raised in the church of the subgenius, most of whom have not been

642
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,320
taken away from their parents yet.

643
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,660
And even the one that did get taken away from his parents is now back with his parents.

644
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,720
Yeah, is that Rachel...

645
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Rachel Bevilacqua, or Reverend Magdalene, as we call her, and my former business partner,

646
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,680
Jesus.

647
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,480
They met at X-Day Drill in 1997.

648
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,160
They were married there in 1998.

649
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:50,260
And then the child custody case took them away from us for a long time.

650
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,120
How is that going?

651
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,220
But they did win the case, and they got the kid back.

652
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,640
They didn't exactly win it, but they have had the kid for a while now, and it's unlikely

653
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,820
that the biological father will be able to get the kid back, because he's even worse

654
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,480
than we are.

655
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,960
You were saying earlier on about the mating ground of the subgenius.

656
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,240
What would the mating call of the subgenius sound like?

657
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,920
It sounds...

658
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,840
Well, it sounds like this.

659
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,620
It's beautiful.

660
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,600
I find myself strangely aroused, and I'm not even a subgenius.

661
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,060
Well, it's not for amateurs.

662
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,760
You can hurt yourself making that noise.

663
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,100
And now, I did this inside of a house with the windows closed so that neighbors wouldn't

664
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,320
come flocking to me at night.

665
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,560
Just imagine them bouncing off the windows like birds now.

666
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:44,900
Yeah.

667
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:44,900


668
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:44,900


669
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:44,900


670
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,660
It's mostly bats right now bouncing off the windows.

671
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,820
They also respond.

672
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,800
Ah, yes.

673
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,160
But here on the show, this is the color of meditation.

674
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,040
Oh, well, is that a soothing purple?

675
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,160
Mm-hmm.

676
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,780
See, you can hear the sound of purple in the background.

677
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,000
Well, I'll be jiggered.

678
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,920
Into outer space.

679
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,160
At X Day, yeah.

680
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,860
At X Day.

681
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,720
Are you going to X Day this year?

682
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,060
I think so.

683
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,420
What about fuzzling?

684
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:14,900
Are you going to X Day this year?

685
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


686
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


687
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


688
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


689
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


690
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


691
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


692
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


693
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


694
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


695
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


696
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


697
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,440
I think so.

698
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,980
Yeah, that'd be great.

699
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,760
We'll ride out on the train.

700
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,420
Train to X Day?

701
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,080
There's a train that goes all the way to Erie.

702
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,040
Didn't you say you were going to?

703
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,640
And then you rent a car and drive 75 miles, and you're there.

704
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,300
Wow.

705
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,840
Then you have to have a car, don't you?

706
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,820
You have to rent a car in Erie.

707
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,100
Right by the train tracks.

708
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,060
You can rent a car.

709
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,640
By the train tracks, you can rent a car.

710
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,380
They'd be so happy to rent you a car because there's no business and everything's sad in

711
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,100
that part of the country.

712
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,900
But they don't know it's sad because they're going to be in the middle of the world.

713
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:44,900


714
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:44,900


715
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:44,900


716
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,200
They have a lowered, because of the toxic waste that's been in the area for so long,

717
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,780
they have a lowered sense of expectation there.

718
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,860
Well, you know, they...

719
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:59,280
What looks sad and austere to us is actually quite cheery and bright to them.

720
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,600
They lead very rich lives in Pobucker Junction, actually, which we can't even imagine.

721
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,100
They understand the concept of blissful ignorance.

722
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:07,940
That's true.

723
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,280
It's folly to be wise.

724
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,880
Best seen in the winter when it's gray.

725
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,880
And then you see the little eyes looking, staring at you.

726
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,480
Looking out from...

727
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,700
At the shiny car.

728
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,860
From the cars and from the...

729
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,000
They know it's a visitor.

730
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,920
From the windows and the homes.

731
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,040
Visitors have money.

732
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,620
And, of course, they're surrounded by Mennonites, Hutterites, and photosynthetic algae.

733
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,260
But in the country, there are the Amish, and an homage to them is in the works.

734
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,820
Omelets are available at the store in that little two-bit tank town.

735
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,580
I forget the name.

736
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,800
What is it?

737
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,480
Oh, Sherman, New York.

738
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,120
I own...

739
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,660
Yeah, that two-bit spit hole in the road.

740
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,840
That run-down, beat-up car paper...

741
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,120
Yeah, that bleeding piece of earth.

742
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:08,460
That smelly hole in the bucket of filth, we call...

743
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,680
That rhinestone in the rough...

744
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:10,800
Humanity.

745
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,940
Yeah, it's actually a lot of fun.

746
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,560
The...

747
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


748
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


749
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


750
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


751
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


752
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


753
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


754
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


755
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


756
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


757
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


758
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


759
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


760
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


761
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


762
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


763
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


764
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


765
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,560


766
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,580
poof.

767
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:25,380
day we had a special guest uh hal robbins also known as dr hal who is a um entertainer and a

768
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:32,000
cartoonist from san francisco we bring him in every year to prove that there's at least one

769
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:40,040
subgenius left who is still intelligent and if you ever listen to my radio show the hour of slack or

770
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:48,780
his radio show uh the puzzling evidence show or the ask dr hal show you'll see what i mean yeah

771
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:54,840
he just released a load of uh subgenius stuff didn't he for old videos and things he kind of

772
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:03,420
knows everything he has a nightclub act called ask dr hal he also performs it at x day but he

773
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:09,540
does it on a weekly basis in san francisco where he lives and you can ask that guy anything

774
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,020
anything

775
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,020


776
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:16,300
and he will answer convincingly you should really have him on your show at some some point yeah i

777
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,760
think we might have to later it definitely sounds interesting so tell us being sorry i thought being

778
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,840
hard working and uh super knowledgeable were disqualifying uh features of the church of the

779
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:32,040
subgenius no no isn't he breaking isn't he breaking all uh when when we talk about slack

780
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:39,520
and uh being a subgenius that doesn't equate with laziness and stupidity it equates with

781
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,000
freedom

782
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:48,520
and happiness which means for some of us working hard at what we wanted to work at is slack and i

783
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:56,120
think that would be true of dr hal and myself also some subgeniuses get slack from sitting

784
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:03,320
around watching television all day and others get slack from doing things but only the things

785
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:10,000
they wanted to do the conspiracy sets it up so that you have to do things you never would have to do

786
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:18,060
imagine yourself doing just to keep a roof over your head well as uh subgeniuses we object to being

787
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:24,840
forced to do that now that's about all we can do is object because most of us still have to have jobs

788
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:32,760
but the church provides a certain amount of slack in between i've noticed a lot of subgeniuses who

789
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:40,000
have day jobs log on to the internet during the day and uh check out alt.com

790
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,840
slack which is our news group when they're being paid to be doing something else and that's the

791
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:51,120
greatest slack you know stolen slack the whole black market for

792
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:57,460
hi again this message is for reverend ivan's name this is monica over at flash news

793
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:03,740
sorry i missed your call earlier i'm interested in writing up a short story about uh subgeniuses

794
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:08,640
um again coming up in july if you could please give me a call back soon as possible i'd really

795
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,840
appreciate it thank you bye

796
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:18,600
hello this is me bernard embrace with a second message that you know you and me those of us who

797
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:24,860
are like so-called subgeniuses and i have our names on the list you know you know see that

798
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:29,400
it's the end times it's possible that some so-called subgeniuses are going to be left behind

799
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:35,620
if you didn't have a dream that an alien invasion is coming and that you're going to be taken away

800
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,900
from it you might be as a subgenius left behind here with the rest of the

801
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,740
pinks to deal with the conspiracy but i've had a dream that i'll be taken and that an alien

802
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:51,560
invasion is going to take place so if you are subgenius and you haven't had a dream

803
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,640
i think that it's the end time that an alien invasion is going to take place and that's going

804
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:01,380
to be taken out of here then you might be left behind as a subgenius along with with the pinks

uh...

816
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,560
you hit it right there

817
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,080
it's the starter kit

818
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:04,320

some do that we don't supply that ourselves we suggest you go to your local catholic supply

824
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,240
house

825
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,900
those are fun to to

826
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,100
catholic supply houses yeah

sell weird stuff that you don't see at walmart

829
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:38,220
ladies and gentlemen the coordinates uh to this is one oh four point fifty six the exact

830
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:38,900
longitude

831
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:45,440
of uh... of the roswell christ site and thirty three point twenty eight multiplied by

832
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:45,660
pi

833
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,940
results in that longitude somebody knew the ancients knew this

834
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,720
and nineteen point forty seven times three point three point eight equals sixty four

835
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,020
eighty

836
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,820
between july nineteen forty seven

837
00:39:59,400 --> 00:39:59,980
listen to this now

838
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,120
between

839
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,960
july nineteen forty seven and march twenty twelve

840
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,140
there are exactly

841
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,000
sixty four point eighty

842
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,600
years

843
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,360
nineteen point forty seven times three point three point eight

844
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,800
is exactly sixty four eighty and that's the exact date

845
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,840
that takes you

846
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,460
from

847
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,780
july nineteen forty seven

848
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,500
to march twenty twelve

849
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,900
or sixty four

850
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,340
point eighty years

851
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,200
this is not a coincidence ladies and gentlemen this is significant that the united states

852
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,740
recovered the debris

853
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:55,360
that they've worked so hard to collect

854
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,360


855
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,300
and they gotta make sure we don't figured you know continue fight for life

856
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,380
he said

857
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,520
day

858
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,300
America itself was founded on the same date in 1776.

859
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:12,040
This year was chosen by the elite behind the formation of America for a special reason.

860
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:20,680
This reason being that 888 is the sum of the letters in Greek of the name of the Messiah.

861
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,180
Each Greek letter represents a number.

862
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:34,100
A second Messiah, 888, plus the first Messiah, 888, equals 1776, America's founding date.

863
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:42,740
1776 is a number representing a second Messiah or the king of the New World Order,

864
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,900
and it symbolizes the event of a God-man on earth.

865
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:53,160
According to the Illuminati elite, as the first Messiah came to space,

866
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,220
established the kingdom of heaven,

867
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,940
a second Illuminati Messiah will establish a New World Order upon the earth.

868
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:05,000
And that New World Order is this radio show,

869
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:12,580
the Hour of Slack, voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

870
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,880
Subgenius.com

871
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,980
But the word subgenius does not have an O in it.

872
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,620
By the way.

873
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:29,220
Friends, that clip just earlier was found by Mr. Fernand and Andy Lemur,

874
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,400
but that's all I know about it.

875
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,560
Therefore, it must be something sacred, something holy.

876
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,500
Yes.

877
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,500
Coming up, we also have such weird show mixes as puzzling evidence as a guest

878
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:52,360
on Reverend Susie the Flusie's Bob's Slacktime Funhouse Show on WREK Atlanta.

879
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,160
Atlanta.

880
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,860
Imagine that.

881
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,620
And more from our frequent caller, Bernard,

882
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:04,800
as well as a poem by Nenslow read by Dr. Howell of AskDrHowell.com.

883
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:13,540
But now, let us return to Reverend Ken and Kim from right where you are sitting now.

884
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,380
Can you tell us about some of the regular activities that happen the next day?

885
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:21,920
I mean, what can we...

886
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,720
Kind of like things that happen year by year, or is it just spontaneous?

887
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,940
Yeah, every year we have a baptism in the pool.

888
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,640
This campground is pretty developed.

889
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,560
It has a really nice indoor swimming pool.

890
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:42,920
And we usually, myself and some other preacher, Dr. Howell or Dr. Legume,

891
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,560
will get in the pool with all these mostly naked people

892
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,820
and dunk their heads under,

893
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,760
and we're going to baptize them.

894
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
And I'm going to say,

895
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:52,760


896
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,660
against the conspiracy,

897
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,260
and in the name of Bob,

898
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,260
I try to come up with a different little spiel for each one.

899
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,900
And we will go through 40 or 50 people in about half an hour.

900
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,740
It's a very...

901
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:10,260
It's an assembly line type of holy ritual.

902
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,340
And it's also unfilmable,

903
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,500
because as I say,

904
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,420
it's a lot of naked individuals.

905
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,060
You don't have to be,

906
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,620
but a lot of them choose to,

907
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,540
just because they can.

908
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,400
That sounds eminently filmable.

909
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,840
It was. For years we did do that.

910
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:41,860
And if you look at our website, subgenius.com, the photos of past X days up to about 2005, you'll see a lot of nudity.

911
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:52,460
After that, we discovered that the appearance of the nude photographs on the internet was cutting down on the number of ladies who would jump into the pool.

912
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,220
So since then we banned cameras from certain events.

913
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:08,500
Another thing we do besides the baptism and the 7 a.m. thing is we will have beer tasting parties, which can last quite a long time.

914
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,340
We had a gang war.

915
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:16,960
Last time, which none of the subgeniuses can form gangs.

916
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,580
Each individual is a separate gang.

917
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:29,220
So it ended up being just a bunch of kids using toy store weapons on each other until they got tired of it and decided to raid the beer tasting party.

918
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:41,020
So to some extent, it's a bunch of grownups doing childish stunts and looking for some hot action.

919
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,500
The VHF has been out of business since that time.

920
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,300
In a situation where they're likely to both get hurt and get laid.

921
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,240
And sometimes at the very same time.

922
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,680
Isn't there like a wicker man style burning of Bob as well?

923
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:07,000
We have an effigy of Bob that is usually hanging by the neck from one of the rafters where we do most of the preaching and where the bands play.

924
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,300
There's a lot of rock bands at X day.

925
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,460
There's a bonfire event.

926
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:16,800
at midnight on Saturday where we burn a wooden symbol of Bob.

927
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,760
It's kind of a logo icon thing we developed

928
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,880
because it's easier to make than a face of Bob.

929
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,420
It's kind of a stripped-down picto.

930
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,920
And we burn that and drum and dance around like the pagans do.

931
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,500
The pagans are a lot better at the drumming and dancing, I'll grant them that.

932
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,160
Probably less drunk, I would have thought.

933
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,320
And we have to depend on the pagans to start the fire for us.

934
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,760
We still haven't mastered the secret of fire.

935
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,740
You know, Mrs. Reverend Angry Larry finally picked herself a church name,

936
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,780
Reverend Lucy Van Pelt.

937
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,720
She was so nice this past year at Ex Day.

938
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,540
She took that naked girl out of my hands.

939
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,440
I could not get rid of that naked girl.

940
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,440
A lot of us have that problem in life.

941
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,700
You know, that girl wrote to me and asked me to take

942
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:07,980
the...

943
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,960
The pictures of her being a drunken naked girl down off the internet.

944
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,200
And I didn't do anything at all.

945
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,160
Woohoo!

946
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:20,020
I mean, she'd have to send another picture to show which one she is.

947
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,560
Well, you know, the thing is,

948
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,320
there was already somebody up on stage with a rehearsed,

949
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,400
a naked person on stage singing.

950
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,260
A professional naked person.

951
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,900
A professional singing naked person, Fat Mandy,

952
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,660
doing her act.

953
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,460
And then this amateur naked person comes up and starts,

954
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:46,420
you know, slurring and drooling and stumbling around and

955
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,240
flirting with the cameras.

956
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,340
I mean, she would, she would, was playing to the cameras and for her,

957
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:57,980
for her to then say, would you please not put my picture anywhere since I've

958
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:02,160
made you, since I got into all of your pictures against your will.

959
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:02,660
Right.

960
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,660
She walked in front of them.

961
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,960
It's like, no, we're going to fine you by letting your boss find those on you.

962
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,380
And you're not.

963
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:12,180
What it really comes down to though, is that Lucy, Reverend Lucy Van Pelt,

964
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,900
I could not get rid of naked chick.

965
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,360
And I went to her and I said, does this belong to you?

966
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,820
Because a lot of times things that get on the stage that don't belong there

967
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,420
do somehow indirectly belong to them.

968
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,660
And I said, does this belong to you?

969
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,960
And she said, who is it?

970
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,920
And I turned it around because it was, it was on kind of on my shoulder-ish.

971
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,400
And naked girl's on my shoulder.

972
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,320
She's looking, you know, at, at the butt.

973
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,660
And then she says, turn it around.

974
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,220
We turned around.

975
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:37,600
Okay.

976
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,340
She goes, nope, that doesn't belong to me.

977
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,240
I said, will you take it anyway?

978
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,420
And she said, sure.

979
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,320
That's what they all say.

980
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:45,800
Sure.

981
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,280
I'm just saying.

982
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,520
Will you take it anyway?

983
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,020
I mean, how many times have you heard that?

984
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,020
Well, it's not, it wasn't my naked girl.

985
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,980
It's everybody's naked girl.

986
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,840
It wasn't my naked girl.

987
00:48:59,100 --> 00:48:59,460
Honest.

988
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,980
I don't know how she got in the car.

989
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,320
I hear that all the time.

990
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,640
Well, then we'll have to take her into custody, son.

991
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:05,840
Son.

992
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,220
It's our naked girl now.

993
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,720
And that would have been funny.

994
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,420
It's just not my naked girl.

995
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,040
You know, I think my naked girl's a special.

996
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,600
Special.

997
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:17,840
Not special.

998
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,920
Not my naked girl sounds like a TV show.

999
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,120
Special.

1000
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,920
Michael J. Fox makes his dramatic comeback in Not My Naked Girl.

1001
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:33,100
There's some really, really tasteless jokes somewhere in there, and I'm not going to go there.

1002
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,420
However, I did make the suggestion to the rest.

1003
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:35,980
I hope you did.

1004
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,680
Hey, watch those horns.

1005
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,260
Yep.

1006
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,520
Okay, we're reloading now.

1007
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,380
Lock and load, kids.

1008
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,520
Fire in the hole.

1009
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,120
And they sure do, with the eagerness of the new year.

1010
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,060
Just a couple of hours into July 1st.

1011
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,220
Well, like I say, where I'm from, July, July.

1012
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,640
I mean, January 1st hasn't even happened yet.

1013
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,760
But I can cut that out.

1014
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,240
How July hasn't happened?

1015
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,460
How do you know it didn't happen?

1016
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,540
How do you know it will happen?

1017
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,860
Just because somebody told you.

1018
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,200
Just because you think you looked at a calendar last night?

1019
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:05,560
Dang.

1020
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,240
In the newspaper.

1021
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,160
Oh, yeah, I believe everything in the paper.

1022
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,160
Sure, you made a lot of plans.

1023
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,460
How do you know it's going to happen?

1024
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,840
How do you know it even came true?

1025
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,980
How do you know even X day is going to happen?

1026
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,180
Well, that's one thing you can depend on.

1027
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,540
And Y day.

1028
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,720
And Z day.

1029
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,940
They'll all happen.

1030
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,120
And you'll be there.

1031
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,600
And you'll wonder, why didn't I send that money in?

1032
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:29,240
Oh, there we go.

1033
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,540
Took care of that guy.

1034
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,420
Now we're just cruising down Central Avenue.

1035
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,540
Taking care of the storefront.

1036
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,380
And we're going to go out to Little 500 Point.

1037
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,680
And relax.

1038
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,860
Because it's New Year.

1039
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,620
Another day, another chance.

1040
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,860
Another drink.

1041
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,220
Another bout of self-delusion.

1042
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,580
Don't you just love it?

1043
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,160
Girl up in it like a hot dog in the fire.

1044
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,700
Just let them pour that mustard all over you.

1045
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,340
I don't understand it.

1046
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,240
Down here at the station, they're drinking the hair oil.

1047
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,680
And it's really hit the bottom now.

1048
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,840
It keeps our coats glossy.

1049
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,780
Yeah, it does.

1050
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,560
How do you crawl out of that skin anyway?

1051
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,860
It's got like a big tube top.

1052
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:19,680
Oh, yeah.

1053
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,820
See, Susie the floozy skins are over there on the other side of the station.

1054
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,960
I saved the skins I shed.

1055
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:25,560
That's right.

1056
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,520
It's disgusting.

1057
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,700
I can't even look over there.

1058
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,740
But they have a light on it here.

1059
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,700
So you have to watch.

1060
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,420
Wow.

1061
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:34,980
Yeah.

1062
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,200
Yeah.

1063
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:35,960
No one.

1064
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,060
Everybody thought the cheetah was the name of the woman.

1065
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,480
No.

1066
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,400
What is the monkey named Jane?

1067
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,600
Thousand people try to answer that one.

1068
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,220
Look at them.

1069
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,520
Hey, happy New Year.

1070
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,000
You too.

1071
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,460
We're up in the balcony here waving to the crowds outside WREK Atlanta.

1072
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:04,700
This is being simulcast to KPFA Berkeley, KPFA and KFCF in the wonderful Valley Mountain.

1073
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,500
And snow capped hills of Fresno.

1074
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,420
And KRAP in the Tri-City area.

1075
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,560
And KON in Dallas.

1076
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,260
The cities where they try anything.

1077
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,540
WFMU in New Jersey.

1078
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,220
Praise WFMU.

1079
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:24,000
I believe the first station to play some of these foreign tones.

1080
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,560
In the contiguous U.S.

1081
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,160
Yeah.

1082
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,060
Yeah, we must contiguous with what we're doing here.

1083
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,760
It's a show.

1084
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,080
Slugging.

1085
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:34,680
Trash.

1086
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1087
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1088
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1089
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1090
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1091
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1092
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1093
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1094
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1095
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1096
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1097
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1098
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1099
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1100
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1101
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1102
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,680


1103
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,840
I could call and I could hold the handset up to the microphone.

1104
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,820
You could be on the air.

1105
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,640
I don't even know what the number is down here.

1106
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:46,880
8-9-4-2-4-6-8.

1107
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,540
The problem is they're so slack-full they're just lying on the couch.

1108
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,740
And they can't get up.

1109
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,460
And they can't get over to the floor.

1110
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,740
Because here in California you can.

1111
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,880
But they love everybody.

1112
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,820
Oh, it feels so good.

1113
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,100
And you can't call the WREK number.

1114
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,620
You can just call 845.

1115
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,220
The year you mean?

1116
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:03,980
Yep.

1117
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:04,660
And you can't call the number.

1118
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:04,660


1119
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:04,660


1120
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:04,660


1121
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:04,660


1122
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:04,660


1123
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:04,660


1124
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,700
It never stops.

1125
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,340
Well, last year it stopped a little while ago.

1126
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,380
Oh, that's what they'll have you think.

1127
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,880
It's stopping right now in Missouri.

1128
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,660
And it will stop in just a few moments in Texas.

1129
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,640
And like I said, it's so sad.

1130
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,100
In California, they have hours to go before it stops.

1131
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,420
So where is the New Year starting exactly?

1132
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,400
I don't get it.

1133
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,800
Greenwich Mean time?

1134
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,360
How does time work?

1135
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,640
Greenwich Mean is a snake town.

1136
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:32,140
Starting up the building and we're driving down the street again.

1137
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,220
That worked.

1138
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:34,640
That worked.

1139
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1140
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1141
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1142
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1143
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1144
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1145
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1146
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1147
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1148
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1149
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1150
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1151
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1152
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


1153
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,760
We're driving a little north west from the Здесь we'll go and we're going

1154
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,920
to get armed and it's a wonderful place because at least they don't devestate on the

1155
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:43,920


1156
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,500
And it's a nice place to drive all the way to the Homestead and ask for a big 함께

1157
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:49,500


1158
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:55,280
And mouth-to-mouth, which is what I did with contacted sonos.

1159
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:01,460
I had a nice, nice, pink Sinadiidoύhe Miss Spanish over there.

1160
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,040
where a big and simple-culo Verde fellow guys brings his tod gevus with them.

1161
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,620
So you're welcoming a question not to run I think.

1162
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:08,520
in the skies. And I just want to say, I think that it's the end time. You know, that as

1163
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:14,400
a subgenius, you know, we know that the Church of the Subgenius is a UFO church, a UFO cult,

1164
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:20,140
or church, whatever you want to call it, or UFO religion. And that if you haven't had

1165
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:25,820
a dream or two dreams that an alien invasion is going to take place by now, and that you're

1166
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:29,900
going to be taken away from it, that you, as a subgenius, may be left behind with the

1167
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,220
pink to deal with the conspiracy.

1168
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:43,820
Now, here's a poem by young Reverend Nenslow, age seven, from Portland, Oregon. You might

1169
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:47,360
want to read it, or it's kind of long. You might want to read some of it.

1170
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,560
Good God, it's a Nenslow poem of endless verses.

1171
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,360
Well, it's an X-Day poem, though.

1172
00:54:54,280 --> 00:55:01,100
I'm filled with anticipation as I wait to go away. I'm going home to Planet X.

1173
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:10,400
For it's X-Day today. My life is put on hold as I throw away my past. I can't go on with

1174
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:17,620
my life. I give in to my fears at last. I never tried to chase a rainbow or tried to

1175
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:24,840
live a dream. I made very few mistakes. My heart was right, it seemed. Never wanted to

1176
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:31,200
be somebody. Just a soul, just passing by. I had no grandiose dreams. I had no dreams.

1177
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:38,060
Those visions were not aiming for the sky. But Bob had other plans for me. He yanked

1178
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:44,580
my feet up off the ground. He said, if you want to serve me, then take a look around.

1179
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:51,640
You see, there are many people in this stupid world, you know. And it's up to you to tell

1180
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:59,100
them exactly where to go. So you made a few mistakes, as oh so many do. But if you can

1181
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,760
send me thirty bucks.

1182
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:07,400
I can still use you. Exalt yourself and tell them of the mistakes that they have made.

1183
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:16,020
Then tell them of my smiling face and the price that you have paid. I will sell you

1184
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:21,080
purpose, provision, and a name. Your life will be confusing. It will never be the same.

1185
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:28,400
I have never been right here with you, even when life was hard. I knew you couldn't make

1186
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,200
it. I knew it from the start.

1187
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:36,880
So keep on calling my name whenever you need a hand. And your dollars you must send to

1188
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:44,100
me as countless as the sand. I always will forsake you. I will always leave you cold.

1189
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:51,180
Especially when you make mistakes and are growing very old. Now take my words and tell

1190
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:59,500
your friends of the message that I gave. And be my witness to the world. And dig your f***ing

1191
00:56:59,500 --> 00:56:59,740
grave.

1192
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,660
Reverend Nenslow, age six.

1193
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,000
Yes, that young man shows great promise in the poetic department.

1194
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:15,780
And you know his poos make better Dobbs heads than the ones that little Vredes paints with

1195
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,400
his paintbrush.

1196
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,200
I know, it really drives him insane too.

1197
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:31,200
When we were born into this life, we were destined to make it right. And it's been

1198
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:40,280
predetermined. And this is our fate. We're singing this song so you can read late.

1199
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:48,560
We are going to save the universe. We are going to save the universe. We are going

1200
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,160
to save the universe.

1201
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,420
This time.

1202
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:01,200
We'll take the train. We made it. We made it. We made it. We made it. We made it. We made it.

1203
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,120
The third time we're acting like men.

1204
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,740
It is no future in england streaming.

1205
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:20,360
No future, no future. No future for you.

1206
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:30,640
No future, no future. Прорваны Цельсия.

1207
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,200
No future, no future. No future, no future for you.

1208
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,200


1209
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,200


1210
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,860
There's gotta be a way of killing it. How? How do we do it?

1211
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,460
You can't.

1212
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,860
You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you?

1213
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:25,780
The subgenius power of...

1214
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:31,720
Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.

1215
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,080
You admire it.

1216
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,380
I admire its purity.

1217
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:42,980
By conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.

1218
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,840
I can't lie to you about your chances.

1219
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,400
But you have my sympathies.
