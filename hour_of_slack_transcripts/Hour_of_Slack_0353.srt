1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
They're here!

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,940
One minute.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:26,020
Ja, it is the hour of penultimate power before the awakening day.

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,000
Now it's the turn of the mind to adjourn,

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,420
and let that radio play.

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,800
The horrible, hideous torrent of noise

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,880
that occasionally mars our discourse,

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,560
though often a foe is quite often a friend

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,720
and scarcely a cause for remorse.

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,880
If you don't like our patented radio show

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,540
and object to its babbling din,

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,480
we respect your objection,

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,640
but why not, you know, change your habit of listening in?

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,780
The boings and the burps and the babies that cry

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,920
overwhelming our well-meaning show,

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,020
though always...

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,680
The nuisances are in great supply.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,040
It seems we may never run low.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,620
The temple of Bob is a back-breaking job.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,560
It's more work than digging a ditch.

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,960
Though we have our supplies of gobofram and lies,

22
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,940
we smell tar and the sun on the pitch.

23
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,440
So I'll say this to Stang and the rest of his gang

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,800
and the collars that lurk in the dark.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,580
Though the pace is uphill,

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,840
it still gives us a thrill.

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,560
So prepare one and all.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,820
To embark.

29
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,820
Baba!

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,620
Baba!

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,760
Welcome to Subgenius Radio Ministry.

32
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,380
Hour of Slack.

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,140
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,880
Out here, it's an incredibly different picture.

35
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,540
While you sit back at home listening to the radio show,

36
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,800
you can't imagine the terror.

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,620
These unfortunates are experiencing out here

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,940
at Ground Zero in the center of the show zone.

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,620
Huge mutant slugs lurch through the underbrush

40
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,800
as a damp, drizzly rain coats us all

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,040
with a mucilaginous, acidic slime.

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,540
Giant frogs bong like a thronging gong

43
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,260
in the swamp under us,

44
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,380
while slithering snakes depend from the trees,

45
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,180
sleazily sneezing on us snottily as we pass.

46
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,020
BONG!

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,800
Knee high in the damp grass.

48
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,640
registers shall vampires

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,940
This next record is dedicated to

50
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,600
some personal friends of mine.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,440
registers shall vampires

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,720
dictionary

53
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,020
computers

54
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,400
For every cop that has ever taken advantage of somebody,

55
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,480
beat them down or hurt them because they got long hair,

56
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,960
listened to the wrong kind of music, wrong color,

57
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,480
whatever they thought was the reason to do it,

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,180
I'd like to take a pig out here in this parking lot and...

59
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,700
...convince you how badly we and the station need your support.

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,100
Uh, we have a special, special form of slack in store tonight.

61
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,760
Instead of us giving you slack for once,

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,160
you're gonna finally give some back to us.

63
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,960
Of course, some of you have been doing so all along.

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,160
Praise Bob.

65
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,660
But for the rest of you...

66
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,240
I'm a cop you love, better you than me.

67
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,640
Cop you love, but tonight we get even.

68
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,600
You love Bob, you have to.

69
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,700
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

70
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,900
He'll kill you.

71
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,680
So Bob you out.

72
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,620
Bob you out, folks.

73
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,820
You heard it here first.

74
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,820
You don't love Bob, you'll Bob you out.

75
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,700
Bob you out, baby.

76
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,420
Ah, yes, dear friends.

77
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,140
Only if...

78
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:22,260
Well, you know, if you don't pledge, there's gonna be more and more and more reverent stangs.

79
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,740
Too many.

80
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:23,900
Forever.

81
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,360
Can you imagine?

82
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,240
Dear friends.

83
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,100
We need that money.

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,560
My gosh.

85
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,120
Let's get us some spirit going here.

86
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,620
Look at those phones light up.

87
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,560
Every time somebody lies...

88
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:35,980
Oh, yes.

89
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,900
You like that old joke, friends?

90
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,840
Shake it off.

91
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,480
Shake it off.

92
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,960
Can you imagine a world without slack?

93
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,320
A world without the hour of slack?

94
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,580
And even almost as bad, a world without...

95
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,020
Oh.

96
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,700
Oh.

97
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,200
Oh.

98
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:51,600
Oh.

99
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,420
Oh.

100
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:52,840
Oh.

101
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:52,980
Oh.

102
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,180
Oh.

103
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,280


104
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,580
Oh.

105
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:53,680
Oh.

106
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


107
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


108
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,160
Oh.

109
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,400
Bob Bob.

110
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:55,880
Bob.

111
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,400
Bob.

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,760
Bob.

113
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,160
Oh!

114
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,420
Oh!

115
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:02,800
Oh!

116
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,380
Oh!

117
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:03,700
Oh!

118
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,100
Oh.

119
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,980
Oh!

120
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:04,980


121
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:04,980


122
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:04,980


123
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:04,980


124
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:04,980


125
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:04,980


126
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:04,980


127
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,100
Oh!

128
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,100


129
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,100


130
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,680
Luver l aاف you need slack.

131
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,200
K nonsense your help.

132
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,800
Send in those pledges praise Bob.

133
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:17,480
Shh.

134
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,680
There's bat falls and I just want to say that I endorse barbers by running into Bob Bail lafaa

135
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:23,680


136
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,300
made in this year's election, and this is the Hour of Slack.

137
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,140
Hello, Bob, this is Father Guido Sarducci, formerly Pope Maurice of the People's Catholic

138
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,200
Church, and all of my fellow popes from the People's Catholic Church salute to the Church

139
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,280
of the Sabbath Genius.

140
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,520
Carry on.

141
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,160
Good.

142
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,740
This is Rand Hawkins.

143
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,760
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Rand and Stimpy Show.

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,380
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

145
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,320
Keep listening, you idiots.

146
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

147
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,780
Else I shall kill you.

148
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,460
Captain, you're the man.

149
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,640
Yes, yes, go on.

150
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,300
I'm trying to understand.

151
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,120
Is this supposed to be your little show?

152
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,440
Is this supposed to be your little jainer over there?

153
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,440
Is this supposed to be your comedy there?

154
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,140
You're supposed to be funny there?

155
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,020
Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a slight change in the program.

156
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,900
Whoa, whoa.

157
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,120
Sorry.

158
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,140
You can have your money.

159
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,140
This is very confusing.

160
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,460
I don't think I understand this.

161
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,300
Oh, no, no, no.

162
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:48,940
Bob?

163
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,080
Bob?

164
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,160
Bob?

165
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,200
Bob?

166
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,620
Bob?

167
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:57,620
Bob?

168
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,180
Bob?

169
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,820
Bob?

170
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,900
Bob?

171
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,100
Bob?

172
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,800
Bob?

173
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,280


174
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:04,680


175
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,300
Bob?

176
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,400
Bob?

177
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,800
Bob?

178
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,560
Bob?

179
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:06,640
Bob?

180
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:06,680
Where?

181
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,020
Bob?

182
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,320
Bob?

183
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,520
Oh, my God.

184
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:11,560
Oh, God.

185
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:11,860
Oh, my God.

186
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,800
Oh, my God.

187
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,880
Oh, my God.

188
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,220
Oh, my God.

189
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,900
I'm just...

190
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,400
I'm just...

191
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,740
I'm just...

192
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,300
I'm just...

193
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,880
I'm just...

194
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,300
I'm just...

195
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,520
I'm just...

196
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,500
If we let this go on now and everybody condones it, how long is it before everybody is stark naked?

197
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,200
Come on, Bob.

198
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,760
Tell us.

199
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,540
For what reason, Bob?

200
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,740
Tell us, Bob.

201
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,180
It's a mystery.

202
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,440
It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.

203
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
It's a mystery.

204
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:55,860
It's a mystery.

205
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,260
It's a mystery.

206
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,180
It's a mystery.

207
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,560
It's a mystery.

208
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,700
It's a mystery.

209
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,100
It's a mystery.

210
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,220
It's a mystery.

211
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,420
It's a mystery.

212
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,540
It's a mystery.

213
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,820
And hear the word of the Lord.

214
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,700
And now here's the host of the PCP Club, Jimmy Baker.

215
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,440
Hi, and welcome to the PCP Club.

216
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,300
Boy, what a show we have tonight.

217
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,720
I want to get right to it.

218
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,920
First, I want to remind all of you listeners that our panel of trained counselors is here to help.

219
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,680
So if you have acid psychosis and need someone to talk to while you're coming down,

220
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,480
or if you have anything to sell, or if you want to buy something,

221
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,940
call the number on your screen.

222
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,060
We'll take your message or lend a listening ear.

223
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,680
1-800-788-7888.

224
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,060
Remember, the PCP Club stays on the air through your contributions.

225
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,580
So if you want to keep the PCP Club on the air,

226
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,400
send your money or merchandise to the PCP Club in care of this station.

227
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,100
Well, let's get on with the show.

228
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,660
And our first guest, Mark Lane.

229
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,180
How are you doing tonight, Mark?

230
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,300
Just fine.

231
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,600
That's very good.

232
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,760
Mark, you have a fabulous story to tell.

233
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,620
I guess like most of us at one time or another,

234
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,060
although we're all ashamed to admit it,

235
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,980
you were an all-American boy before you degenerated into the drug field

236
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,500
and thoroughly.

237
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,880
And I'm sure you're in a very happy state you're in today.

238
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,560
Yeah, that's right, Jim.

239
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,540
And let me say that I feel sorry for people who are like what I once was.

240
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,540
They don't know what it's like not knowing if you're going to wake up in bed

241
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,220
or if you do wake up feeling like a useless blob of jello.

242
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,840
They just don't know the true meaning of life.

243
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,020
I've had so much pleasure waking up and knowing that I couldn't feel worse all day.

244
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,820
Isn't that amazing?

245
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,500
Absolutely amazing.

246
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,040
I've heard it said many ways, but that just about wraps it all up.

247
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,540
Well, I guess everybody's anxious to hear your story.

248
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,100
Mark, sir, why don't you tell it?

249
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:11,800
Okay.

250
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,180
Well, I was president of my fraternity.

251
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,180
I'd just finished my junior year with a 2.94 GPA.

252
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,300
Our fraternity basketball team and baseball team were first in their league in the past two years.

253
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,040
Things couldn't have been better, yet my life wasn't complete.

254
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,700
Something was missing.

255
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,600
Reality was becoming oblique, and my world was falling apart piece by piece.

256
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,980
I hungered for peace and happiness.

257
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,680
The Moody Blues performed with a great force,

258
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,160
and I was a powerful debt at our house one night.

259
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,340
The band members were all smiling.

260
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,580
I wanted to smile like that, too.

261
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:51,140
After the concert, a few of the band members shared their experience of peace and happiness with me.

262
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,840
Later that evening, we went to the marijuana house to talk.

263
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,900
They told me the words of Edgar Cayce, Hunter Thompson, Timothy Leary, and Carlos Castaneda,

264
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,880
and the powers of Mescalito.

265
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,460
It was then that I first chewed my first button of peyote.

266
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,500
Then, in a beam of light, I saw Mescalito.

267
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,900
He told me he wanted me to devote my entire life to seeking his ways of knowledge.

268
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,180
I crashed.

269
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,280
I woke up three days later in Toledo.

270
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,580
Man, I was happy.

271
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,640
After working two weeks in a restaurant to get enough money for a bus ticket back to Auburn,

272
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,140
I joined the marijuana house.

273
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,600
Since then, I have sought the ways of Mescalito's knowledge every night.

274
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,520
I now see that there is hope for the world.

275
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,700
Through the marijuana house, I have become closer to the physical joining with Mescalito.

276
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,880
My life is satisfied.

277
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,760
I am happy.

278
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,560
Amen.

279
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,480
Can we get an amen?

280
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,440
Amen.

281
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,520
Amen.

282
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:46,820


283
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm just stoned out.

284
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,980
Thank you for coming on the show tonight, Mark, and sharing such a wonderful testimony with us.

285
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,540
We'll be right back with more of the PCP Club after this message.

286
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:04,980
Hello, this is Timothy Leary, reminding you that just as you need slack, KNON needs your help.

287
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,560
Send in those pledges and praise God.

288
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,580
We'll be right back.

289
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,080
Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark.

290
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,120
As you can hear in the background, the zombies are chanting for slack.

291
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,320
We need slack.

292
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,880
The station needs slack, friends.

293
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Because they'll just go ahead and do whatever it is that they have in mind to do.

294
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,040
Well, that's just what we were afraid of.

295
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,360
What are you going to do, borrow whatever each or something?

296
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,140
No, I just expect you to listen.

297
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,100
I don't expect you to take it like a man and stop whimpering and whining.

298
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,440
I don't expect you to do anything.

299
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,080
You're not expected to do anything, that's all.

300
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,180
This show was made for talking, and that's what we're going to do.

301
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,880
One of these days, our doctor is going to show all over you.

302
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,060
Too late, son. That's past paying for.

303
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,960
Even the audience doesn't know that they should be awake at this time.

304
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:05,080
If they could take a three-dimensional rendering of the rings of Saturn and play it on a record player, what would it sound like?

305
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,380
It would sound like this show, young man.

306
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:07,920
Oh, oh.

307
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,940
Yes, please, there are listeners so unhip that he to himself could never quip.

308
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,040
This is my own subgenius show.

309
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,880
Bob's word for those who are in the know.

310
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,920
The church that moves by fits and hunches.

311
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,500
The powerhouse church that pulls no punches.

312
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:31,500
Let him who denieth this be passed beyond the reach of our broadcast and heaved upon a hill of dung.

313
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,080
Unwet, unhonored, and unsung.

314
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,100
I don't expect you to understand anything. I'm just trying, that's all.

315
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,080
You're not supposed to understand your silly twits.

316
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,740
Words, words, words, words are the key. I talk to you, you talk to me.

317
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,160
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

318
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,940
All right, all right, that's, uh...

319
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,640
Oh, you're listening to the subgenius show.

320
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,880
Okay, 8484425ers, get set to call the subgeniuses.

321
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,140
That's right, you can talk to some of the real people behind the Bob Dobbs.

322
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,880
Okay, now, why are you awake and listening to this show?

323
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,060
We follow the show.

324
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,400
Call the show, call the show.

325
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,520
Okay, we'll go away and you be the show.

326
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,100
Okay.

327
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,300
Yeah, the love show. We love everybody. We love you callers.

328
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,720
May I have your order, please?

329
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,800
We'll take Visa, we'll take MasterCard, we'll take American Express, we'll take bank drafts.

330
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,900
By which monthly payments are automatically withdrawn from your bank account.

331
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,540
You can call in tonight, set it up, you'll never have to think again.

332
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,540
And of course, a check or money order is always so much fun.

333
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,520
Work your magic twanger, froggy.

334
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,660
Higher, kid, higher, higher.

335
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,640
Yes, sir, Rudy Ritter's. This is Rudy Cazooty.

336
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,220
And so you notice how that plastic is lightly tinted?

337
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,580
That makes it much easier to watch our television show, even for your parents.

338
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,820
Okay, Ellen, see you a little later.

339
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,740
To help carry on our important work, I want you to join the Secret Squadron

340
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,660
and wear this official badge.

341
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,100
And have this secret decoder.

342
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,000
Okay.

343
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,520
Now.

344
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,060
We're going to sing some sump, Canyonne songs for you.

345
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,060


346
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:10,420
Bob days, Bob days, and a king and a win.

347
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,440
No.

348
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,720
Today, today, Bob, Bob, Bob.

349
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:23,380
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

350
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:29,060
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

351
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,400
I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death which brings me.

352
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,920
My dear friends, what's happening in your life?

353
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,540
Big pain?

354
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,780
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

355
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,840
Knows how Bob Dogs work?

356
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,500
It's a Bob world after all.

357
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,580
It's a Bob world after all.

358
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,360
It's a Bob world after all.

359
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,400
It's a Bob K-I-N-O-N.

360
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,900
This is for somebody.

361
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:10,020
Genius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

362
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,080
With a little car.

363
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,360
Hello, Rita Car.

364
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,840
It's about time you answer the phone, you f***head.

365
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,700
It's about time you did answer the phone, you f***head.

366
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,680
Hello, we're on the air.

367
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,300
Good morning, doctor.

368
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,300
Good morning.

369
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,760
In with a car, I think.

370
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,100
I mean, I need help now.

371
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,840
What sort of help can we bring you?

372
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,120
I'm suffering from a severe case of electronicus interruptus.

373
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,040
You mean, time-fettered signal.

374
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,600
Every time I begin a conversation with somebody on the phone,

375
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,160
especially a doctor that I need advice from,

376
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,200
the situation is, the power fails, and then I'm left...

377
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,180
Oh, yes, what is it?

378
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,300
Is Dr. Daniel Moore there? Dr. Hale?

379
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,300
I was trying to give a lecture on the practice of internment

380
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,600
for hydrotipia in the many nations of the Earth.

381
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,280
And Rosa, you interrupted me

382
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,020
with your poor aisle puddle of...

383
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,120
Oh, oh, sure.

384
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,300
What short rates, what?

385
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,160
Oh, 12.

386
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,140
I say, sir, get down before I cane you with my riding crop.

387
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,500
I'll court thee across the face.

388
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,440
Oh, San Francisco.

389
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,360
How you doing?

390
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:15,920
Oh, hell.

391
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,420
Somebody stop that old man.

392
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,960
Stop him.

393
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,720
I'm getting away.

394
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,720
He's just a guy.

395
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,600
He's got a cap.

396
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,420
We're just like that.

397
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,620
Well, then, why do you think you want to take up a lot of our time

398
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,800
with your mindless, mean-mouthed meandering?

399
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,940
You guys just have no shame, do you?

400
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,500
I beg your pardon?

401
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,080
Seems to be the trouble.

402
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,880
Well, you're begging and pleading for us to call.

403
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,440
It's just disgusting.

404
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,740
Simply reminding you of the many opportunities available

405
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,860
in this great land of ours.

406
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,280
But you would be listening to a collage made from pieces

407
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,300
sent in by Reverend Uncle Jimmy Joe Swaggart

408
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,160
right here in Dallas.

409
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,320
He did put together a lot of the very old,

410
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,260
and you'll hear a lot more of that coming up.

411
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,680
Nice little bites.

412
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,920
Soundbites.

413
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,600
Reverend Velveteen Sly and her partner,

414
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,740
Reverend Angus MacGamora, supplied the sort of sex line

415
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,320
there in the background that we had at points.

416
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,160
And the KPFA material you're not hearing

417
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,860
is from a best-of compilation by Dr. Phineas Narco.

418
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,420
A lot of it is KPFA Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence,

419
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,380
and even lies heard there.

420
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,640
Not in the background for you.

421
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,220
Please look at the interesting sneak peeks we made from test

422
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,220


423
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,120
For the first time, the

424
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,780
chamber's got a lower level size to the

425
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,620
hearing level of the patient's bronchial drum arrest.

426
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:14,260
It can attack them without yet making noise.

427
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,960
For the only time, the water can do deliberately

428
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:14,960


429
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:14,960


430
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,460
So as they found you, the camera was probably

431
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:15,520
showing an incorrect operation.

432
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:29,340
Whatever peace to the Lord, warranty their life and all their

433
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,360
ரcraối courts.

434
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,380
.

435
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:30,880
.

436
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,340
.

437
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,900
and thanks for your contribution.

438
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,140
All my family watched

439
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,440
many of the educational programs.

440
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,520
I like that feeling.

441
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,420
I like that feeling.

442
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,080
Police will pass an innocent weenie roast on the beach,

443
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,180
but should they know of your actions here,

444
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,200
that there's been a drinking party

445
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,820
and nude bathing

446
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,860
an investigation will surely take place.

447
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,800
These messages will now become subliminal,

448
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,680
but your subconscious mind

449
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,340
will be hearing and accepting

450
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,400
all of the positive messages.

451
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,660
Help me, please.

452
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,480
Help, Bob.

453
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,680
Or die, fools.

454
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,020
Oh, God.

455
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,040
This is just pathetic, man.

456
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,380
Back up that little boom.

457
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,540
I want you to keep your shenanigans down to a third.

458
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,360
Here we go.

459
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:30,700
Fine.

460
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,500
I don't want to hear your shenanigans

461
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,440
to the roughest room.

462
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,920
I don't want to hear one peep out of your kids.

463
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,580
Hi, guys.

464
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,860
How's it going over there tonight?

465
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,560
It's Rob Singlespar from KGO News Talk Radio.

466
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,220
Are you in the helicopter?

467
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,040
Can you see the traffic pattern from where you are?

468
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,920
Yeah, I can, but I heard you guys got

469
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,580
tipper goals in the studio tonight.

470
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,220
So I can get my hands on her.

471
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,700
You know what?

472
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,040
DJ just rolled tipper.

473
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,660
She was suddenly intoxicated and she,

474
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,740
well, she tipped over.

475
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,520
She was insensible.

476
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,260
Oh, my God.

477
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:00,980
Uh-oh.

478
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,780
We're gonna go get her.

479
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
That's what I'm doing.

480
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,680
As you can see on the monitor,

481
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,420
I'm applying cardiopulmonary regurgitation

482
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,720
right into her face there.

483
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,580
If that doesn't make her up, I don't know what will.

484
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,540
And we're punching her out using the

485
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,260
Lottky's Lamanis program.

486
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,660
Timber, wake up!

487
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,160
Timber, get up.

488
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,180
Smell this stuff.

489
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,220
We're holding volatile...

490
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,020
You've gotta get her back up.

491
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,180
...somany salts out of her nose.

492
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,180
I think she took too much.

493
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,760
You gotta go.

494
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,860
Get her out of here before six and get her out of here.

495
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,440
And we're putting hot peppers up her...

496
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,460
Come on.

497
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:28,860
Come on, Hal.

498
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,420
Stop that.

499
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,560
And we're...

500
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,400
I'm...

501
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,660
Okay.

502
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,720
Hold on, hold on.

503
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,520
You bugged your ball boss.

504
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,580
Needle nose pliers, but she doesn't seem to respond to the treatment.

505
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,140
Okay.

506
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,900
No, I think she...

507
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,640
Her eyes are opening.

508
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,520
Hello, Tipper.

509
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,200
This is the subject of this day.

510
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,880
Put a stupid kiss on her.

511
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,420
I'm afraid you've been had by all of us.

512
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,800
Okay, Tipper.

513
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,940
We'll play Tipper's song now.

514
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,540
Got you, love.

515
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,160
But tonight we get even.

516
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,180
Yeah!

517
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,260
Never mind what crickets and criminals do.

518
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,560
What kind of bacteria is good for you?

519
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,960
Well, the kind that makes me go boo, that's the kind.

520
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,680
Don't be cowed by such primitive propaganda.

521
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,740
We are going to save the universe.

522
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,360
We are going to save the universe.

523
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,480
It's so ironic because some of these false preachers

524
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,160
can raise millions and millions of dollars.

525
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,160
No problem there.

526
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,180
Well, I tell you what.

527
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,740
I challenge you, Jim Swagger.

528
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,040
I challenge you, Jim Baker.

529
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,160
I challenge you, Oral Roberts.

530
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,900
You see this hand here?

531
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,300
You see this hand in front of me, Mr. Jim Baker?

532
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,640
This is called the claw, and it's got the power of dogs in it

533
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,860
and the power of Bob.

534
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,060
And I challenge you to show your ugly face

535
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,540
here at this radio station and come forward.

536
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,340
Go ahead.

537
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,580
Come forward with all your millions.

538
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,120
I'm ready to have a match without rules.

539
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,520
No rules at all.

540
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,020
One will survive.

541
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:00,800
One over.

542
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,440
Only one minister will leave the match still breathing

543
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,180
if one of you goody-goody preachers has the guts to show up.

544
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,720
The end times get closer and closer every minute.

545
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,800
Imagine some guy or some gal driving around out there.

546
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,620
They're tired of listening to the same old music

547
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,900
on their conspiracy radio show,

548
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,680
so they try switching channels,

549
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,240
and they come upon this.

550
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,580
They hear these voices talking,

551
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,580
and they think,

552
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,240
now what is this, a talk show?

553
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,440
A church show?

554
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,040
A comedy?

555
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,460
I mean, oh my God, are these people serious?

556
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,580
It's too developed to be a joke.

557
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,880
Should I kill them, or should I pay them?

558
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,780
Which will it be, friend?

559
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,200
Which will it be?

560
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,260
Kill us or pay us?

561
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,460
Give to us something to live for.

562
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,640
Anything.

563
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,300
We need hope now, love.

564
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,540
I'm a robber and a son of a bitch.

565
00:30:59,540 --> 00:30:59,640
I'm a robber and a son of a bitch.

566
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,460
One moment, please.

567
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,080
I bring you a message.

568
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,840
Exactly six miles north of Skag Mountain

569
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,040
in the Valley of Pain,

570
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,960
there lives an evil devil monster.

571
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,000
His name is Bingo Gas Station,

572
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,200
Motel Cheeseburger with a side of aircraft noise,

573
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,600
and you'll be Gary, Indiana.

574
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,400
And he loves to hurt people.

575
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,520
The last time I saw Bingo Gas Station,

576
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,580
Motel Cheeseburger with a side of aircraft noise,

577
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,760
and you'll be Gary, Indiana,

578
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,540
he told me what he wants to do.

579
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,460
He wants to come down here and kill each and every one of you.

580
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,920
But I said to him, Bingo, wait a minute.

581
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,580
And the reason I said that is because I believe in you people.

582
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,080
I believe you can do the job.

583
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,020
I believe you can help each other.

584
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,500
I believe you can make this world a better place.

585
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,240
I believe you can make this world a better place to live in.

586
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,700
That's it.

587
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,020
Down, boy, down. Back, back.

588
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,980
I really do.

589
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,180
Oh, no, it's a good one.

590
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,880
Oh, I'm afraid we burned this little caller

591
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,080
on the roasting hell of telephone wires here.

592
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,480
I ain't the one who's yelling and helping.

593
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,100
Uh-oh, look, the little caller's burning up.

594
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,880
Hal, get the fire extinguisher.

595
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,500
Use the caller extinguisher.

596
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
I'm going to go whine when the baby's broody again.

597
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,660
Now, let's go over that again.

598
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,020
You say something short and long.

599
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,860
You say you saw some sort of monster.

600
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,440
You know cryomorphology is the part of the...

601
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:40,740
Oh, Monsieur.

602
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,840
...protein of the various processes and products of cold climates.

603
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,560
Captain.

604
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,460
There's one now.

605
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,020
Captain.

606
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,320
We are in the ear canal.

607
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,640
Everybody be quiet.

608
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,440
It can hear us.

609
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,120
Funny little itching thing in the ear, Captain.

610
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:54,980
I, it, it...

611
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,800
What about the other ear?

612
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,260
Ah!

613
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,380
It shrivels with antennas.

614
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,500
You put creatures in our ears.

615
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,300
They're in our bodies.

616
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,300
Well, you know, it was just a show.

617
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,980
They're show creatures, yes.

618
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,260
Hmm.

619
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,040
Captain, it was Stang.

620
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,600
He put the creatures in our ears to make us ruin the show.

621
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,820
Oh, no.

622
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,620
Really?

623
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,540
Well...

624
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,260
It's kind of neat.

625
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,500
Let's see what we can do.

626
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,900
Let's, okay, I'm going to pull the head of one of these little creatures out here, and

627
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,560
it'll talk to us.

628
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,920
It'll talk to us, little creature.

629
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,280
It'll talk to us.

630
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:29,620
Alright.

631
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:29,620


632
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:29,620


633
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,000
Look at these names, look at the souls lining up for the harvest, friends.

634
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,460
There's one.

635
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,640
Get it!

636
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,040
Squash it!

637
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,400
Aren't you supposed to say, help me, help me?

638
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,520
Kill it!

639
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,100
Kill it.

640
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,520
Kill it!

641
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,320
It's back in Tokyo!

642
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,120
Look at it!

643
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,120


644
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,080
Now, what was this about a monster?

645
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,180
Come on, you can't expect us to believe that.

646
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,720
Let's go over that again.

647
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,000
I believe you probably think you saw something.

648
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,260
You know, the human mind's a funny thing.

649
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,940
It plays strange tricks.

650
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:07,880
Uh, you guys try to tell us that aliens, beast monsters, are bringing on some kind of brave new world?

651
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,860
And they're gonna whip your butt real good.

652
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,460
But they're really pretty, so you won't mind.

653
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,920
Yeah, and they got big tentacles and flowers on their hats and everything.

654
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,440
Now let's go over that again.

655
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,920
So you heard some kind of show or monster?

656
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,880
No, no, monster, you've got to believe me.

657
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,200
What?

658
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,380
Don't you think I know how crazy this sounds?

659
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:32,100
Don't you think you're, I know you're thinking, well, this guy has to be locked up.

660
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,580
This guy has to be locked up.

661
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,220
Well, I didn't say that, mister, but you've got the general idea.

662
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,320
Don't you know there aren't any monsters in this day and age?

663
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,140
If God is honest, the national good of this whole town is lost, I tell you.

664
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,760
We put a man on the moon.

665
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,320
Time for monsters is coming and going.

666
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,940
I know it sounds crazy, but it's the truth.

667
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,060
You've got to believe me.

668
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,960
Well, now, this thing you say you thought you saw.

669
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,400
What?

670
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:55,860
Tentacles.

671
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,280
He was six feet tall and dripping slime and had tentacles and wings all over him.

672
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,520
Oh, that was Mobius Rex.

673
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,200
He's not here, though.

674
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,180
Oh, my goodness, look.

675
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,880
It's the March of the Monsters.

676
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,740
It's neat.

677
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,260
It's cool.

678
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:07,840
It's keen.

679
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,700
Oh, look, that big, icky green thing's hopping on one foot.

680
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,000
Hell.

681
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,120
And horrible little squishy, squiggly collars, too, cutting thousands of them.

682
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,520
And it's raining miniature frogs.

683
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,920
They're only a half an inch long.

684
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,280
Oh, I like those frogs.

685
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,200
They fall from the Sargassum Sea that surrounds the Earth.

686
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,220
Hello, you're on the air.

687
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
Oh, no, it's the monsters.

688
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:27,780
Go, go.

689
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,800
Here, climb under the shore to protect yourself.

690
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,160
Watch out for the Palolo.

691
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,480
Higher, higher.

692
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,540
Get up, get up, get up.

693
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,700
Get up, get up.

694
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,380
Oh, my God.

695
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,560
250,000 points.

696
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,960
Oh, thank God.

697
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,760
Look at those detonations.

698
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,980
A thousand points of...

699
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,960
Oh, my God.

700
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,520
That collar is nothing but a little...

701
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,600
Those are a thousand points of light.

702
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,020
They're going.

703
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:52,800
Oh, my God.

704
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,360
Oh, my God.

705
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,360


706
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,360


707
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,000
The Pakalolo works.

708
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,880
Okay, go ahead and ask me the monster question.

709
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,480
Oh, you should.

710
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,180
Okay.

711
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,900
Oh, my God.

712
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,620
Take your question, please.

713
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,400
Do the monster bit.

714
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,160
Do the monster.

715
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,600
Everybody do the monster bit.

716
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,820
Please take the brochure that came with this tape

717
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,340
and turn to pay the most.

718
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,180
There it is.

719
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,440
The guarantee.

720
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,460
Is that it?

721
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,540
Is that what you're talking about?

722
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:16,780
No.

723
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,000
Oh, do I have to spell it out for you?

724
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,920
Is there something else we're supposed to do?

725
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,760
Wave your tail and click the claws.

726
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,920
Now, let's go over that again.

727
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:25,600
Wave your tail up.

728
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,680
It'll scare you and everything.

729
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,920
Do it now.

730
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,820
Do the monster bit.

731
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,280
This is an amazing collage of

732
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,380
you say you saw some sort of monster bit

733
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,420
done by Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence

734
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,420
and other evil callers.

735
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,580
This particular collage put together by

736
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,520
Reverend Phineas Narco.

737
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,640
So, let's see.

738
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:54,820
What?

739
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,880
I do have also to play here

740
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,400
this wonderful piece by a doctor,

741
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,420
a friend in Denmark,

742
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,140
a subgenius in Denmark,

743
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,720
Reverend, actually we should call him

744
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,260
Saint Sverre H. Christensen.

745
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,380
Sverre A. Christensen.

746
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,900
Yes, he's a friend of Reverend Sheldon de Weers also.

747
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,140
And these are some Bob songs from the Danish doctor band.

748
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,140
Anus Presley.

749
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:45,980
Well, the death toll is, I mean, the death toll is up

750
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,880
and the death knoll is tolling.

751
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:53,360
And the show is not looking so good on the big pledge drive thermometer.

752
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,300
In fact, it doesn't seem to have climbed much past the halfway mark.

753
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:05,840
So, I guess we'll just watch the funeral of the Hour of Slack show carried in its glass coffin.

754
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,720
Its innards visible, spilling out all over the street.

755
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:19,160
Little reels of tape, broken cassettes, mic cords, frayed patch tables, and gate hairs in the cameras.

756
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,780
Half erased videotapes.

757
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,340
It got close to the camera.

758
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:23,340


759
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,060
Too close to the car engine.

760
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,800
And packages sent through the mail that never got where they were going.

761
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,860
Checks that bounced and pledges never paid.

762
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,380
Promises never kept.

763
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,260
And I'm not even reading from a script, friends.

764
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,880
I'm talking from my heart.

765
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,420
This is how you're making me feel.

766
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,800
Somebody called in a little while ago.

767
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,700
Apparently a real idiot.

768
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,740
There is not a phone.

769
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,440
You can talk, Trickster.

770
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,360
Your mic is up.

771
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,240
Give us money now!

772
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,360
823-7490.

773
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,200
A guy called up a little while ago.

774
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,660
Repeat what this fellow said, Sheldon.

775
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,620
Oh, no, don't repeat.

776
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,900
Well, yeah, yeah, tell them what the guy said.

777
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,780
The guy called up.

778
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,980
There was this guy who called up and he said, this isn't Robert Tilton.

779
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,660
And I said, no.

780
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,180
And he said, I couldn't tell the difference.

781
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,660
What a funny joke.

782
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,540
What a funny joke.

783
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:35,400
So now we, I, it makes you not want to bother with much of a show, you know, in a way.

784
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,760
It's just, oh.

785
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:47,080
Well, there's the funeral of J.R. Bob Dobbs still cranking along there.

786
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,420
I'm already putting my tapes away because I'm actually pretty insulted.

787
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,720
Bob, I don't want to do that!

788
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,160
It's glue in his k ultrasound.

789
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:11,980
Man's Gesicht.

790
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,760
It's from the

791
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:14,940
It's coming down.

792
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,800
It's coming down.

793
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,040
Looks like Bob!

794
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,400
I don't wanna do that.

795
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,240
This is a fight.

796
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,500
Or you'll have to cut up some flesh.

797
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,540
Shut up!

798
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,820
He's gonna die.

799
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,580
He's gonna die.

800
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,640
He's gonna die.

801
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,540
He's gonna die.

802
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,700
He's gonna die.

803
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,040
He's gonna die.

804
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,680
He's gonna die.

805
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,260
Signal of some Rotent's

806
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,080
Please the

807
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,880
VOICE of the

808
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:29,880

Thank you.

Thank you.

820
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,040
Bob World.

821
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,940
He is Bob.

822
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:29,900
He get for fun.

823
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,660
He wears a smile.

824
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,980
Everybody run.

825
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,500
I want you to put your hands out in the TV.

826
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,760
I told you.

827
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,340
I told you.

828
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,360
I told you.

829
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:04,760
This is Bob.

830
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,880
Welcome to the problem.

831
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,200
I'm not connected.

832
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,640
Bob, are you here?

833
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,700
I don't believe in this.

834
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,860
I don't believe in this.

835
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,740
Do not try this on your own. It is extremely dangerous.

836
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,420
Let's look at that again in slow motion.

837
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,220
And we've got a little more.

838
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,500
And we've got a little more.

839
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:07,200
And we've got a little more.

840
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,120
Would you like Bob?

841
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,000
Driver Parkhurst reporting for duty, sir.

842
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,180
All right, at ease, Bob. Stand easy.

843
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,740
Captain Blackadder, this is Bob.

844
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:19,920
Bob?

845
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,920
Good morning, sir.

846
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,900
Unusual name for a girl.

847
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,140
Well, yes, it would be an unusual name for a girl,

848
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,140
but it's a perfectly straightforward name

849
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,540
for a young chap like you, eh, Bob?

850
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,720
Now, Bob, I want you to bunk up with Captain Blackadder

851
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,060
for a couple of days, all right?

852
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:37,580
Yes, sir.

853
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,520
I think you'll find Bob's just the man for this job, Blackadder.

854
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,000
He has a splendid sense of humour.

855
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,680
He, sir? He? He?

856
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,740
You see? You're laughing already.

857
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:48,820
All right.

858
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,060
Well, now, Bob, I'll leave you two together.

859
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,200
Why don't you, er, get to know each other,

860
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,700
play a game of cribbage, have a smoke, something like that.

861
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,060
They tell me that Captain Blackadder

862
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,980
has rather a good line in rough shag.

863
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,960
Um, I'm sure he'd be happy to fill your pipe.

864
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:03,720
Carry on.

865
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,060
Sir, you're a chap, are you, Bob?

866
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,460
Oh, yes, sir.

867
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,320
You wouldn't say you were a girl at all?

868
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,700
Oh, definitely not, sir.

869
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,940
I understand cricket.

870
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,020
I fart in...

871
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:21,620
beds, everything.

872
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,120
Well, let me put it another way, Bob.

873
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,660
You are a girl, and you're a girl with as much talent for disguise

874
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,860
as a giraffe in dark glasses

875
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,860
trying to get into a polar bears-only golf club.

876
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,720
Oh, sir, oh, sir, please don't give me away, sir.

877
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,020
I just want you to be like my brothers and join up.

878
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,900
I want to see how a war is fought so badly.

879
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,120
Well, you've come to the right place, Bob.

880
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,600
A war hasn't been fought this badly

881
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,020
since Olaf the Hairy,

882
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,500
high chief of all the Vikings,

883
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,960
accidentally ordered 80,000 battle helmets

884
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,720
with the horns on the inside.

885
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,240
I want to do my bit for the boys, sir.

886
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,380
Oh, really?

887
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,620
I'll do anything, sir.

888
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,200
Yes, I'd keep that to yourself if I was able.

889
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,020
All right, Bob.

890
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,240
To end the show,

891
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,260
I'm going to play this tape

892
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,740
of a new, relatively new,

893
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,740
sister subgenius show.

894
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,060
It's at WORT,

895
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:21,340
Madison.

896
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,100
Hello, W-O-R-T,

897
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,740
you wonderful folks.

898
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,420
At that, at that,

899
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,760
oh, wait, I should be playing

900
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,780
some background music here.

901
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,280
Where'd it go?

902
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,140
Yeah, there we go.

903
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,600
Johnny Flash's, uh,

904
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,100
uh,

905
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,980
what is the name of that?

906
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,020
Johnny Flash,

907
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,640
Concordant Opposition,

908
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,200
Fountain of Slack,

909
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,260
here in the background.

910
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,240
My main worry is to keep

911
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,860
the real reason for this flight

912
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,760
well and truly secret,

913
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:50,920
and I'm sure that's not

914
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,240
what you're trying to tell me.

915
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,360
Well, I'm trying to tell you

916
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:54,680
that, uh,

917
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:55,220


918
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:55,220


919
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,960
I'm trying to make a deal.

920
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,060
The station, the station

921
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,460
in Madison, Wisconsin,

922
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,340
W-O-R-T,

923
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,980
has a show

924
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,120
operated by Reverend Velveteen Sly

925
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,600
and Father Angus McGamora.

926
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,140
And Reverend Velveteen Sly

927
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,820
is a great new preacher-esque.

928
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,080
She plays the Hour of Slack

929
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:15,820
on her show,

930
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,560
but she also has

931
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,520
surrounding material

932
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,280
that she does

933
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,500
for hours and hours.

934
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,740
And she has sent me

935
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,680
some excerpts

936
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,440
from her rantings.

937
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,540
I'm going to, uh,

938
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,760
end the show

939
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,560
with this,

940
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,820
a lovely piece

941
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,740
called Illuminations,

942
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,160
dear friends.

943
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,840
It is interesting

944
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,980
to note the progress

945
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,440
of a particular experience

946
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,720
in developing this subgenius,

947
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,380
or rather in stirring

948
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,720
the subgenius

949
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,020
into activity.

950
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,760
In the particular case observed,

951
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,140
the principal work

952
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,500
is done during sleep

953
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,280
and appears at first

954
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,480
to consist in the preparation

955
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,820
of the spinal passage

956
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,540
by moving slack

957
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,400
from the base of the spine

958
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,460
to the top of the head.

959
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,440
The individual out of the body

960
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,820
can do this work,

961
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,880
for though there are

962
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,680
physical effects,

963
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,100
the fire itself

964
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,420
is non-physical.

965
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,780
The globe or sphere

966
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,720
at the base of the spine

967
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,040
contains within it

968
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,060
the fire of slack

969
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,640
coiled spherically.

970
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,340
The prescribed concentration

971
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,500
upon the globe

972
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,960
and thus upon

973
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,820
the fire of slack within

974
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,660
begins to stir it

975
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,560
into activity,

976
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:39,940
provided the right kind of life

977
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,520
has been lived beforehand

978
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,280
for a considerable period,

979
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:44,780
which is to say

980
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,180
provided it is fed

981
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,100
with the right kind of fuel.

982
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:49,540
Fuel.

983
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,500
Even if the right kind of life

984
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,380
has not been lived,

985
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,920
a stirring may take place,

986
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,500
but the effect

987
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,180
of the premature stirring,

988
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,280
if any,

989
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,920
take place at all,

990
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,120
will be disastrous,

991
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,260
as has already been pointed out.

992
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,060
Assuming a stirring

993
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,140
takes place

994
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,840
along right lines,

995
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,140
there is a gradual

996
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,260
dissolution of the globe

997
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,400
caused by the frictional

998
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,960
energizing of the fire

999
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,200
of slack itself.

1000
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,960
The fire is fanned

1001
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,420
into bright heat

1002
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,660
and becomes active,

1003
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,540
forcing its way

1004
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,400
through the matter

1005
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,620
in which it lies embedded,

1006
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:35,980
burning it up

1007
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,180
and causing the globe

1008
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,940
to become a radiant sun

1009
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,460
instead of

1010
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,880
the dull,

1011
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,580
the glowing mass

1012
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,820
it normally is.

1013
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,540
This sun radiates

1014
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,240
radiates,

1015
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,000
in all directions,

1016
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,840
heat of slack,

1017
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,160
which is physically felt,

1018
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,800
especially in the surrounding areas

1019
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,420
of the physical yeti form.

1020
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,940
This subgenius sun

1021
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,920
would seem to rush upwards

1022
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,760
when it moves fast,

1023
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,080
as often it does not

1024
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,240
along the way.

1025
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:20,240


1026
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:20,240


1027
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,560
It is as fine as a bullet

1028
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,180
passes through a grooved gun barrel.

1029
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,720
There is something spiral

1030
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,860
about the movement.

1031
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,440
In any case,

1032
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,380
there seems to be a direct rush upwards

1033
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,300
without passing beyond the top of the head,

1034
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,300
but specially stimulating centers

1035
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,280
according to the individual's ray.

1036
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,220
The sensation is that of pressure,

1037
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,640
while as regards the center

1038
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,840
at the top of the head,

1039
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,220
unusual heat,

1040
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,840
will be felt.

1041
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,240
During the waking hours,

1042
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,220
this process may be continued,

1043
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,580
and from time to time

1044
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,920
it seems to occur of itself,

1045
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,720
so that a warm glow passes up the spine,

1046
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,920
producing a most interesting effect.

1047
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,080
A beautiful expansion of consciousness

1048
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,520
is physically experienced,

1049
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,440
so that the individual feels full of a glorious life

1050
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,920
and of a sense of,

1051
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,280
intimately

1052
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,800
of a다면,

1053
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:23,740
of the

1054
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:23,740


1055
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,680
Being in delicate, intimate的入面关系

1056
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:33,800
with what must be the developed intuitive subconsciousness,

1057
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:43,420
He or she imagines what life would be like if he could keep this experience constant

1058
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,220
instead of only intermittent.

1059
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:59,160
There is a fine sense of at-one-ment, of radiance, of contact with the real.

1060
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,680
The individual barriers seem to have been broken down so that the individual sees into

1061
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:10,060
the heart of things, no matter what they are, and sees them as growing entities.

1062
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:17,300
Their glorious future disclosed to he or she as embryonic in them.

1063
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:23,500
It is so difficult to describe this condition of consciousness, but the physical, indeed

1064
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,480
much more than the physical, seems transcended.

1065
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:29,120
And some veils at least are lifted.

1066
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:29,140


1067
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:38,060
So that he or she gazes upon a real, less hidden by the clouds of illusion.

1068
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:52,180
In the beginnings of this process, a certain amount of dizziness is noticeable.

1069
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,520
A new constituent has become active.

1070
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,700
It is as if a...

1071
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:05,920
A new dimension has opened out, so that a new world is entered.

1072
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:14,520
The dizziness is perhaps the physical expression of a new relativity, of a new adjustment.

1073
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:21,680
Other worlds than the physical begin to be opened to a gaze which the individual has

1074
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,700
not yet learned to control.

1075
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:28,680
So that he or she looks out, as it were, with a new world.

1076
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:28,680


1077
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:28,680


1078
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:28,680


1079
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:36,100
With all eyes vaguely open, instead of with those appropriate to the particular plane

1080
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,640
on which he or she happens to be dominantly functioning.

1081
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:51,020
Later on, he will be able to close the eyes he does not need, leaving open only those

1082
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,340
he does.

1083
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:58,680
And later on still, he will be able, perhaps, to use the eyes of the other.

1084
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:58,680


1085
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:58,680


1086
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:58,680


1087
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:58,680


1088
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:58,680


1089
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,800
All eyes simultaneously.

1090
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:11,980
Each eye dovetailing into the other's, so as to avoid distortion and flickering between

1091
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,780
one state of consciousness and another.

1092
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,620
The effect being the dizziness.

1093
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,640
The dizziness.

1094
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:47,840
The ever smelled vlog请多多 Брmaticard

a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready? Bob, Post Office Box 140306,

1102
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:18,900
Dallas, Texas 75214. That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214. Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1103
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:36,040
This is not political. This is not religious. An open letter to the American people.

1104
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:45,280
My fellow Americans, I, Ernest Warren, will swear an oath on the Bible that the information contained herein is the truth.

1105
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:52,320
Approximately 30 years ago, an article appeared in Reader's Digest about a young physicist who was working in his laboratory

1106
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,520
one day when he accidentally isolated a phenomenal ray.

1107
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,340
He experimented.

1108
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:58,680
In fact, he was able to find a way to find the ray.

1109
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:03,300
He found that he could control the actions of a mouse when the ray was focused on the brain of the rodent.

1110
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:08,720
When the full potential of the ray was realized, it was turned over to the U.S. federal government,

1111
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,100
which, in turn, entrusted the ray to the National Science Foundation.

1112
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,960
After all these years, what have the federal scientists been able to accomplish with the brain ray?

1113
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,980
Did they finally focus the ray on the brain of a human guinea pig?

1114
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:28,420
I, for the past 11 years, have been the human guinea pig,

1115
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,520
and I am the human guinea pig for the Federal Brain Ray Science Project,

1116
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,520
and will state, under oath, that the brain ray machine can perform miracles.

1117
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,460
Following are some things it will do, and this merely scratches the surface.

1118
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:50,100
There would be no alcoholics, no drug addicts, and hardened criminals would choose to live honest, normal, useful lives.

1119
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:54,020
Many retarded people could be helped toward living normal lives again.

1120
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,460
Many crippled could walk in a normal way.

1121
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,240
Many blind could get their sight.

1122
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:07,040
I have been blinded and regained my sight so many times that I can't recall the number of times it has happened.

1123
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,120
The brain ray induced glaucoma to my eyes.

1124
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,120
The pressure and everything was present.

1125
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:16,800
I was treated for weeks with prescription medicine, and then the brain ray cured my eyes.

1126
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,160
The true claims concerning the brain ray could fill a book.

1127
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:24,520
I am under complete remote control by the brain ray machine.

1128
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,440
The federal scientists know my every thought and every move.

1129
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,640
Every thought, every action, every conversation.

1130
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,620
They see what I see.

1131
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,220
They hear what I hear.

1132
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,180
Every night when I am sleeping, I see a short movie in my brain.

1133
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,080
The brain ray is a device that can be used to detect the brain ray.

1134
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,780
The brain ray is a device that can be used to detect the brain ray.

1135
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:55,100
This old-time radio program was originally aired live, long before the advent of high fidelity.

1136
00:59:55,100 --> 01:00:03,180
As a result, you may detect an occasional surface noise or volume drop due to transmission problems so common to old radio.

1137
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:12,140
We hope, however, that any variance in audio quality will not take away from your pleasure in listening to this, one of the all-time favorite shows.

1138
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:23,440
In the latter part of the 20th century, we human beings on this planet Earth were being watched.

1139
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,740
Our every move.

1140
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,380
Carefully scrutinized.

1141
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,940
And not just by our governments.

1142
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,780
Others were watching.

1143
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,540
Where were they from?

1144
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,220
What did they want?

1145
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,400
Does it really matter anymore?

1146
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:41,740
We have our signal back, so let's go down to Coach Grover Mill's post-game locker room show, already in progress.

1147
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,140
Coach, who do you think played well in today's game?

1148
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:49,100
I don't know if anybody played well in our side, Bob.

1149
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,400
I'm just going to have to take a look at the films.

1150
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,960
What about these reports, Fitcher?

1151
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,280
I think your wife was sleeping with the players while you were out recruiting last year.

1152
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,120
Oh, I don't know about that.

1153
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,840
We're going to have to take a look at the films before we make any judgment on that.

1154
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,960
Well, what was that?

1155
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,840
What's happening here?

1156
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,660
A huge glowing cylinder has landed on the football field, just barely missing the band.

1157
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,300
People are running and screaming.

1158
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,940
It's out of pandemonium now.

1159
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,160
It's down there.

1160
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:29,180
Boy, those college kids sure will think of some...

1161
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:35,280
Should the brain ray machine be real, then there are two logical questions to be asked.

1162
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:39,060
First, why was I chosen to be the human guinea pig for the project?

1163
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,820
There is no apparent answer.

1164
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:44,340
But there is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1165
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:49,640
And those last few tapes, as well as the PCP Club earlier in the show,

1166
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:54,840
were by the all-pro cavalcade force.

1167
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,560
Poor Bob. Praise the all-pro cavalcade.

1168
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,760
Thank you, and...

1169
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:08,060
This is a test of the emergency brah-sahana.

1170
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,380
Merge your lichen into the rudder of the broad-cawing pre-recorded announcement.

1171
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,760
I hope to die in a ball.

1172
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,560
Oh, it would be wonderful, George.

1173
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,340
We feel like Columbus when we discover the moon.

1174
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,420
Have you lost your mind, Gene?

1175
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,520
It's dangerous.
