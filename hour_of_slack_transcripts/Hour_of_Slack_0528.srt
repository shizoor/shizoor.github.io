1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
If I'm not getting it, then probably a lot of other people won't get it.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,580
No, you're...

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:12,160
And he just keeps learning more and more.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,840
This is gonna be your best birthday party ever, Bobby.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,540
We still have a few more decorations to put up,

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,180
but your sister's finished her breakfast now, so it's time to go sit on the potty.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,800
Okay.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,640
Must we stand amidst the scum and get the idea across?

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,700
These days, perversion gets a bum rap

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,980
because it's being given a bad name by all the amateurs.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,440
If you want to get the highbrow lowdown on all the subterranean hijinks

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,200
going on in the so-called real world you have to live in every day,

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,480
turn to us, the experts,

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,020
the unchained reverends of the subgenius hour of slack.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,540
Wouldn't you like to teleport your debtors into limbo,

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,460
smooth out the wrinkles in your brain that contain all your childhood phobias,

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,020
and learn how to make your car run on sheer gall?

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,200
Well, sure you would.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,760
And who, tell me who, is in a better position to do that

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,620
than the brighter...

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,460
than bright J.R. Bob Dobbs and his glow-in-the-dark henchman,

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,520
that most unspeakable Reverend Ivan Stang?

23
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,880
Why, no one but you,

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,460
after you've been exposed to an industrial storage tank

25
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,100
full of the subgenius hour of slack.

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,360
Every Sunday night at 9 on that sizzling source of nifty neutrons,

27
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,520
KNON, 89.3 FM,

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,480
and that runaway reactor of the great Midwest, Dallas, Texas.

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,620
There's a huge chasm between blazing truth and outright lies,

30
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,540
and you can learn to breakdance on the rope that stretches between them

31
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,560
by listening to the subgenius hour of slack.

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,620
You may have to...

33
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,540
You may have to get older, but you don't have to grow up.

34
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,360
Why, just look at what it's done for us.

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,900
Unimaginable wealth, girls, flying saucers,

36
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,420
and the best hip replacements money can buy.

37
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,000
Swap your oxygen bottle for some nitrous oxide,

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,440
and praise Bob!

39
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,520
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

40
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,160
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

41
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,320
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

42
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,020
Oh, nurse!

43
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,580
Nurse!

44
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,180
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,160
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

46
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,380
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

47
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,280
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

48
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,520
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

49
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Some material contained on this tape may not be suitable for children.

51
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:26,380
Some material contained on this tape may not be suitable at all.

52
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,200
Do not waste time blocking your ears.

53
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,100
Do not waste time seeking a soundproof shelter.

54
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,960
Try to get as far away from the sonic source as possible.

55
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,780
Do not panic.

56
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:41,800
Do not panic.

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,620
I am the first person to make this fabulous gesture.

58
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,860
But if you do not understand the force that protects you—

59
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,600
but if you must respond as you if you must respond in response to your

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
feedings and your children'sливоise military commands,

61
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,580
even if they areAKE ME!

62
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,000
If there is any hope today to ensure you can answer the wrong questions that를

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000


64

member camp by heart, on your remote pretty?

66
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:33,380
Astronomers can describe in elaborate detail what happened in a billionth of a second after the Big Bang.

67
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,660
They cannot say at all what happened a billionth of a second before the Big Bang.

68
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:05,000
Something tiny exploded into the reality of everything large that exists in the universe today.

69
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,980
The thing that you see today is a universe which is expanding.

70
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,560
My dad is a 15-year-old boy.

71
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,120
Everything that is in the universe today is compressed into an extraordinarily small volume.

72
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:27,560
So, every little thing that is in the universe now is a journey of終γ descon largelasts gj

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:27,560


74
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:27,560


75
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,460
measurable point in a void.

76
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,420
Where did the point come from?

77
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,700
The Big Bang theory now has a stature

78
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,400
comparable to Darwin's theory of evolution,

79
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,820
which is not going to be refuted.

80
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,680
It's one of the fundamental facts of life.

81
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,460
I think we live in a Big Bang universe.

82
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,200
If it's right, and matter, it all began

83
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,840
when matter was concentrated in the size of a point.

84
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,120
How did it get that way?

85
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,940
Was there another Big Bang long before that?

86
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,180
Something tiny exploded into

87
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,820
the reality of evolution.

88
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,200
Everything large that exists in the universe today.

89
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,900
The thing that we see today

90
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,260
is a universe which is expanding.

91
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,540
The point is that 15 billion years ago,

92
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,000
everything that is in the universe today

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,600
was compressed into an extraordinary,

94
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,540
small volume.

Was there another

Big Bang long

116
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,160
before that?

117
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,880
It's an amazing

118
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,820
philosophical puzzle,

119
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,140
isn't it?

120
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,640
Because you have to

121
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,280
try to imagine

122
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,480
what the universe

123
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,180
was like before

124
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,940
there was a universe.

125
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,620
Oh, yes, friends.

152
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,580
Yes, we'll get

153
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,240
a little bit more

154
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,420
down to earth,

155
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,140
I'm afraid.

156
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,400
It's

157
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,140
potty time!

158
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,520
Not over here.

159
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,220
That way,

160
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,680
I'll see you.

161
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,240
Let's get that

162
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,860
diaper off.

163
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,700
I use my potty

164
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,420
when I have to pee.

165
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,580
I use my potty

166
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,380
when I have to pee.

167
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,500
I use my potty

168
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,340
when I have to pee.

169
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,140
Now I am learning

170
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,980
how.

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,180
See what I mean?

178
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,620
It gets worse

179
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,220
and worse

180
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,700
and worse.

181
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:57,940
Well,

182
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,460
it's so much

183
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,360
fun to,

184
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:02,820

here at the

00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,720
Subgenius Foundation,

187
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,700
we've been

188
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,660
working on a new book

189
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,880
and for the last week

190
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,260
I've been, uh,

191
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:11,900
piecing together

192
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,900
the notes

193
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,000
for my very

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,660
favorite

195
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,100
chapter.

196
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,520
The chapter

197
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,020
about the hate.

198
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,200
The hate,

199
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,760
dear friend.

200
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,600
Friends of the

201
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,300
conspiracy.

202
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,880
All out hate

203
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,700
and paranoia

204
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,440
directed at

205
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,800
the normals.

206
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,560
Uh,

207
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,580
this chapter

208
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,600
will go into

209
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,800
explaining the

210
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,620
traits of the

211
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,520
subgenie

212
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,600
versus those

213
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,420
of the pinks.

214
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,160
The various

215
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,980
conspiracies,

216
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,320
uh,

217
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,080
political fundamentalists,

218
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,020
new age,

219
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,640
PC,

220
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:43,840
fashion,

221
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,880
et cetera.

222
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,600
Generally,

223
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,400
it's about the

224
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,280
the natural

225
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,940
inferiority

226
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,740
of the

227
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,180
human.

228
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,100
An entire chapter,

229
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,440
friends,

230
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,140
devoted to the

231
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,680
faults

232
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,540
of the pink

233
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,820
on what's

234
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,740
wrong with

235
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,180
them

236
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,800
and why we're

237
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,840
so much

238
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,720
better

239
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,560
than

240
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,540
him.

241
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,280
The pink.

242
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,400
And we were

243
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,940
thinking about,

244
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,320
uh,

245
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,760
titling the chapter

246
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,740
The Natural

247
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,780
Inferiority

248
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,680
of

249
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,820
the Pink.

250
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,040
Or we might

251
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,580
call it

252
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,860
Man and the

253
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,840
Subgenius.

254
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,240
Or we may call it

255
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,940
Revenge of the

256
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,140
Neanderthals.

257
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,680
But I think,

258
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:30,980
friends,

259
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,740
what we're probably

260
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,740
gonna more likely

261
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,780
call it is

262
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,980
The Difference.

263
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,100
Because that's

264
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,880
what we are

265
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,960
and that's,

266
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,200
uh,

267
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,160
what we can

268
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,720
certainly

269
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,600
hope

270
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,420
to make.

271
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,040
Oh,

272
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:45,780
uh,

273
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,060
hopefully I'll

274
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,160
do some sermons

275
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,860
from this chapter

276
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,360
and,

277
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:50,800
uh,

278
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:50,800


279
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:50,800


280
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,480
coming up.

281
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,560
It covers the crimes

282
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,420
of the conspiracy.

283
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,960
The types of pinks,

284
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
such as the,

285
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,140
the deep pink

286
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,180
versus the shallow pink

287
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,700
or the,

288
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,320
quote,

289
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,400
benign pink.

290
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,860
And the types of

291
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,860
subgeniuses,

292
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,040
yes,

293
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,820
and most important of all,

294
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,820
how to fight

295
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,340
the conspiracy.

296
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,040
Because, you know,

297
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,460
friends,

298
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,920
as, uh,

299
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
Pope Michael Flores

300
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,060
and a bunch of us

301
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,700
actually all said it once,

302
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,880
one,

303
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,560
uh,

304
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:20,560


305
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:20,560


306
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:20,820
the only thing

307
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:20,820


308
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:20,820


309
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:20,820


310
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:20,820


311
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,460
of the Lee Harvey

312
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,540
Oswalds

313
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,060
acted alone.

314
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,600
But,

315
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,160
moreover,

316
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,700
as Charles Baudelaire

317
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,120
said,

318
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,060
moreover,

319
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,040
to become serious

320
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,080
about a subject

321
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,320
that is as sad

322
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,900
as it is laughable,

323
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,920
is it not a really

324
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,340
stupefying thing

325
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,380
to see a nation,

326
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,760
several nations,

327
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,500
and presently all humanity,

328
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,320
say to its wise men,

329
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,100
its magicians,

330
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,800
I shall love you

331
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,540
and I shall make

332
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:50,540


333
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:50,540


334
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:50,540


335
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,100
you great

336
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,440
if you convince me

337
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,140
that we're all

338
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,140
progressing,

339
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
unconsciously,

340
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,680
inevitably,

341
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
while sleeping.

342
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,700
Rid us of responsibility.

343
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,060
Veil for us

344
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,980
the humiliation

345
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,840
of comparisons.

346
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,360
Turn history

347
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
into sophistries,

348
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,240
and you will be able

349
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,160
to call yourselves

350
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,300
the wisest

351
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,600
of the wise.

352
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,020
Or, as Charles Manson

353
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,860
once said,

354
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,540
the wise of the wise.

355
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:20,540


356
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:20,540


357
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:20,540


358
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:20,540


359
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:20,540


360
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,300
A free mind

361
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,600
creating thought

362
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,920
may seem

363
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,480
in raw form

364
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,940
to be mad.

365
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,180
Or, in the words

366
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,320
of our good compatriot,

367
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,800
Jaina Hyperpleet,

368
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,880
people laughed at me

369
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,680
as a prophet,

370
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,420
but many of the people

371
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,820
who laughed at me

372
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,380
yesterday

373
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,300
are not laughing

374
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,940
quite so loudly

375
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,580
today.

376
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,900
And many of the people

377
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,520
who are still

378
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,520


379
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,520


380
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,520


381
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,520


382
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,520


383
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,520


384
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,520


385
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,520


386
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,520


387
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,520


388
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,520


389
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,520


390
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,240
laughing at me today

391
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,520
perhaps will not be

392
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,600
laughing at me

393
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,540
quite so loudly

394
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,960
tomorrow.

395
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,160
When I was the skinniest

396
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,700
person in ninth grade,

397
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
many people chose

398
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,740
to laugh at me.

399
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,120
However, when I attended

400
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,240
the funerals

401
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,540
of these same men,

402
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,300
I found that the air

403
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,980
itself was burst

404
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,600
with the yetinsin

405
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,460
chorale

406
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,520
of modern

407
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,520


408
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,520


409
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,520


410
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,520


411
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,520


412
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,520


413
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,520


414
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:20,860
mocking,

415
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:21,980
braying,

416
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,360
sneering

417
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,120
laughter.

418
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,360
They used to push me

419
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,380
and shove me around,

420
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,600
but when Bob Dobbs

421
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,560
comes into power,

422
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,020
I will push and shove

423
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,960
them around

424
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,660
in box cars.

425
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,600
People used to smile

426
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,640
at me in point,

427
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,720
and they're still smiling,

428
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,940
for their flesh

429
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,880
is rotting back,

430
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,080
revealing the teeth

431
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,360
of the skull.

432
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,140
There are no frowning corpses.

433
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,400
Oh yes,

434
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,540
they're still smiling.

435
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,800
The only difference is

436
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,340
that now,

437
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,480
I am smiling

438
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
with them.

439
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,940
Uh, yes,

440
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,420
and friends,

441
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,300
as I said,

442
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,660
Bob's hierarchy

443
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,040
will pervert

444
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,900
the subgenius religion

445
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,040
just as Jesus's Peter

446
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,240
ruined Christianity.

447
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,260
And as our guru,

448
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,840
J.R. Bob Dobbs

449
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,360
said in 1954,

450
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,520
I am not a

451
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


452
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


453
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


454
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


455
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


456
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


457
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


458
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


459
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


460
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


461
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


462
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


463
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,520


464
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,620
fool,

465
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,480
forgive them first,

466
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,640
and then you can kill them.

467
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,880
And as some dumb idiot jerk said,

468
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,400
I hate them sub gum guys.

469
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,600
They said I was a dumb idiot jerk.

470
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,460
Or as my father,

471
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,060
Captain H.M. Stang said,

472
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,960
it's the bizarre idiots

473
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,240
that act smart.

474
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,160
And as Charles Fort

475
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,920
once said,

476
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,840
I think,

477
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,920
therefore,

478
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,980
I'm going to have breakfast.

479
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,240
And as Reverend Boxholder,

480
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,080
whoever he is,

481
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,880
once said,

482
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,080
what do you throw a pink

483
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,840
who's drowning in quicksand?

484
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,220
His wife and child.

485
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,240
And as an unknown subgenius,

486
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,780
said slavery under Dobbs

487
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,360
is preferable to freedom

488
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,520
under any government.

489
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,500
And as Reverend Mumbles

490
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,660
or Dennis Worden,

491
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,120
I think,

492
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,680
said,

493
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,620
have a nice day,

494
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,880
died for your sins.

495
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,180
And as bespoken by

496
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,240
the nihilist teen,

497
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,040
I am not,

498
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,480
therefore,

499
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,520
I don't think.

500
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,460
But as Bob Dobbs said

501
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,100
in Bobco's B-grade movie,

502
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,220
The Evilest Monk, 1959,

503
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,460
he was playing Rasputin.

504
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,640
He said,

505
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,460
if you have a pipe,

506
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,640
I will give you one.

507
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,640
If you do not,

508
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,180
I will take it away from you.

509
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,420
And as Master Control said,

510
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,180
any idiot can find something

511
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,300
wrong with anything.

512
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,300
That's what makes them idiots.

513
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,000
Because friends,

514
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,700
you know,

515
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,560
there's two kinds of people

516
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,320
in the world.

517
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,000
Number one,

518
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,360
there's those who say

519
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,560
that there's two kinds of people

520
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,040
in the world.

521
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,260
Those who say there's two kinds

522
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,120
of people in the world

523
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,060
and the other kind.

524
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,880
But friends,

525
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,000
the second type of person

526
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,060
is the ones who say,

527
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,240
Praise Bob!

528
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,580
Praise Bob!

529
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,160
Praise damn God!

530
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,700
Praise God, Bob!

531
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,480
Because you know how it is.

532
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,360
You look around and you wonder,

533
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,060
is everybody really that

534
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,120
shallow, stupid, ignorant,

535
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,820
and naive?

536
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,920
Or is it me?

537
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,100
Have I become something

538
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,380
so different, so twisted,

539
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,320
and warped by my lengthy sojourns

540
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,920
into my own interior landscape

541
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,200
that I'm no longer to empathize

542
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,780
or even communicate with most

543
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,100
of the human race?

544
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,460
Have I become such a mental mutant

545
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,140
that I alone know that I'm not

546
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,580
and feel this disgust,

547
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,320
even hatred for the pinks

548
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,080
who run our lives or try to,

549
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,280
and despair with those pink masses

550
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,360
who seem determined to be eternally dupes

551
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,260
of the shark boys?

552
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,340
Sometimes you think

553
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,940
it gets lonely in here,

554
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,920
but then I hear my fellow subgeniuses

555
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,780
agonizing over the same things

556
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,780
and I realize, yes, yes it is me,

557
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,220
and yes I am a mutant,

558
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,300
and yes they are all doomed,

559
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,180
and most of all,

560
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,920
I'm not alone in this way of thinking.

561
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,280
Other mutants exist.

562
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,980
And like Rob's dear friends,

563
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,900
it's the truth.

564
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,280
We're a shortcut in evolution.

565
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,500
That's what we are.

566
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,940
Let me make two points.

567
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,600
Number one,

568
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,640
the human race,

569
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,860
or Homo sapiens mediocritus,

570
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,200
has successfully halted

571
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,880
its own evolution

572
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,160
and is now working on its own extinction,

573
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,040
if not in body,

574
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,180
then in mind, spirit, and so forth.

575
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,880
Point number three,

576
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,160
the evolution of the semi-Yeti race,

577
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,840
that's us,

578
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,660
has been marred by ceaseless persecution

579
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:34,820
and repression

580
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,640
by these mongrel quasi-human race

581
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,800
anti-semi-Yetites

582
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,800
with their lightweight butt,

583
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,800
chicken-kissing code of normality,

584
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,260
or CON,

585
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,120
con.

586
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,100
Congratulations, humans.

587
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,300
You've managed to halt

588
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,800
your own evolution.

589
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,320
But what conspiracy are we talking about, friends?

590
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,020
Which conspiracy?

591
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,800
The conspiracy that we truly hate

592
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,260
is the overall conspiracy

593
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,640
of the normal.

594
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,400
The conspiracy that doesn't even know it's a conspiracy.

595
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,000
The confederacy of dunces

596
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,160
that is so vast and so broad

597
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,140
that it's the cause of all the lesser conspiracies.

598
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,460
And we can love those lesser conspiracies

599
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,180
because they're not quite big enough

600
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,660
to be worthy of our grandiose

601
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,440
and all-powering hate.

602
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,860
The JFK conspiracy,

603
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,260
the UFO bases,

604
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,520
Alternative 3,

605
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,220
fluoride in the water,

606
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,540
Iran-Contra,

607
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,840
the Republican conspiracy,

608
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,060
the Democrat conspiracy.

609
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,640
Those we can love in our hate

610
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,760
because we can get our hands on those.

611
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,900
They're apart from us.

612
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,860
They're not as constantly breathing down our necks

613
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,540
as the normworms

614
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,860
and the mere humes at large.

615
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,060
And then there's the liberal media conspiracy,

616
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,560
which is every bit as liberal as Westinghouse and GE,

617
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,840
which own the media.

618
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,440
So many, so many conspiracies,

619
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,340
and fanatics, my friends,

620
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,460
with their false explanations for reality.

621
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,860
False because they have explanations, period,

622
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,980
that they expect others to adhere to.

623
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,660
But, you know, whoever you are,

624
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,280
there's a conspiracy for you.

625
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,780
And what about those who killed

626
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,560
Jimmy, Janice, and Jim,

627
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,460
and John, and Malcolm,

628
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,020
and Martin,

629
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,620
and Jack,

630
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,200
and Uncle Sam?

631
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,200
And that's all just another tie-in

632
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,760
to the basic CIA conspiracy.

633
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,360
But then all the conspiracies are so interlocked

634
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,580
that when you talk about one,

635
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,680
you inevitably end up drifting into another one.

636
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,200
There should be a conspiracy for everybody

637
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,220
to sink their teeth into.

638
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,040
And the church provides this all-pervasive umbrella,

639
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,000
which will allow all of you misfits

640
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,640
to get together and compare notes.

641
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,720
There's certainly plenty of conspiracies to go around.

642
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,820
We've started hundreds.

643
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,720
We've got hundreds of them ourselves.

644
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,200
The important thing is,

645
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,960
don't keep this information to yourselves, friends.

646
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,920
Spread it around, because human politics

647
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,920
and the squabbling of nations

648
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,600
is only part of what the conspiracy manipulates.

649
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,680
It has no face.

650
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,700
We know it only by its desires.

651
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,860
The thousands of little conspiracies

652
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,080
within the big conspiracy are real enough,

653
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,140
but they themselves don't even know

654
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,260
who they're really working for.

655
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,580
Many of them even mean well.

656
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,200
But they're all just ravening mouths

657
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,020
for a vast hunger with no body,

658
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,340
with which the elder gods have infected the Earth.

659
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,880
Now, of course, this sounds like the product

660
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,440
of a diseased mind, but wouldn't it

661
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,220
if what we're saying is even remotely true?

662
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,400
And the conspiracy is also a great mirror

663
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,940
of disfigurement, friends,

664
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,160
reflecting what's wrong with all of us.

665
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,780
It's much bigger than Republicans and the Democrats

666
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,140
or presidents and interlocking corporate directorates.

667
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,140
It's everything from the school bully

668
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,740
to the wimp principal,

669
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,360
from zombie moms and embittered dads

670
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,420
to the Nazis who censor school textbooks

671
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,140
and to the subgeniuses,

672
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,980
who try to make this church

673
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,660
like all the others.

674
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,900
What you must remember, though,

675
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,660
is that more than anything else,

676
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,300
the conspiracy is an attitude, a fear,

677
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,080
an irrational distrust of anything unfamiliar.

678
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,980
This fear pervades our society,

679
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,720
and it's what lets the conspiracy

680
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,760
get away with real murder on a massive scale.

681
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,880
Oh, Americans love new things,

682
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,760
like Michael Jackson is new compared to The Beatles.

683
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,540
But if, say, a real Jesus were to show up,

684
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,120
why, it'd look just a bit too new

685
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,380
to be allowed to run loose for long.

686
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,920
Gangster computer god worldwide secret containment policy.

687
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,460
Made possible solely by worldwide computer god Frankenstein controls,

688
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,980
especially lifelong constant threshold brainwash radio.

689
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,200
Quiet and motionless, I can slightly hear it.

690
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,540
Repeatedly, this has saved my life on the streets.

691
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,500
Four billion worldwide population, all living,

692
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,820
have a computer god containment policy brain bank brain,

693
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,260
a real brain, in the brain bank cities

694
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,320
on the far side of the moon we never see.

695
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,980
Primarily based on your lifelong Frankenstein radio controls,

696
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,740
especially your eyesight TV,

697
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,980
sight and sound recorded by your brain,

698
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,340
your moon brain of the computer god

699
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,460
activates your Frankenstein threshold brainwash radio

700
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,620
lifelong, inculcating conformist propaganda,

701
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,840
even frightening you and mixing you up,

702
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,700
and the usual, don't worry about it,

703
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,820
for your setbacks, mistakes,

704
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,980
even when you receive deadly injuries.

705
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,020
This is the worldwide computer god secret containment policy.

706
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,800
Worldwide, as a Frankenstein slave,

707
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,400
usually at night, you go to a nearby hospital

708
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,900
or camouflage miniature hospital van trials,

709
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,560
you strip naked, lay on the operating table,

710
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,120
which slides into the sealed computer god robot operating cabinet.

711
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,920
Intravenous tubes are connected.

712
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,440
The slimy, vicious Jew doctor simply pushes the starting button.

713
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,000
Based upon your computer god brain on the moon,

714
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,360
which records progress in your systematic butchery,

715
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,920
your butchery is continued.

716
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,680
Exactly, systematically.

717
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,460
The computer god operating cabinet has many robot arms,

718
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,200
with electrical and laser beam knife robot arms,

719
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,020
with fly-eye TV cameras watching your whole body.

720
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,760
Every part of you is monitored,

721
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,800
even through your Frankenstein controls.

722
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,300
Synthetic blood, synthetic instant-sealing flesh and skin,

723
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,080
even synthetic electrical heartbeat to keep you alive

724
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,420
are some of the unbelievable computer god instant plastic surgery secrets.

725
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,080
You are the highest, most intelligent electrical machine in the universe.

726
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,280
Inevitability of gradualness.

727
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,220
Usually in a few years, you are made string-beam thin

728
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,620
or grotesquely deformed, crippled and ugly,

729
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,160
or even made over one foot shorter or one foot taller,

730
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,840
as the computer god sees fit.

731
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,960
Virtually all of the important instant plastic surgery

732
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,740
is done to you inside the computer god sealed robot operating cabinet.

733
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,860
Even unbelievable, impossible plastic surgery operations,

734
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,000
all impossible even for dozens of vicious kosher-bosher doctors

735
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,780
working around the clock for weeks.

736
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,760
The computer god sealed robot arm operating cabinet

737
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,980
can perform all of the above impossible plastic surgery operations overnight,

738
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,520
even dwarfing you over a foot or increasing your height by two feet.

739
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,940
This is possible because computer god robot operating cabinet

740
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,560
imitates your micro-miniature electrical current intelligence system in your body.

741
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,200
It even duplicates the micro-miniature electric currents

742
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,920
that soften your broken bones to create mending of them

743
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,280
and then creates stress either compressing the bones,

744
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,480
thereby shortening them, or stress to make the bones grow longer.

745
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,040
Spring 1984, Mr. Deck, lifelong would-be doctor and printer.

746
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,860
Insight to the worldwide computer god stratified closed society,

747
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,120
perfected by hospital birth, making possible lifelong Frankenstein controls,

748
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,680
and lifelong hampering human defense, containment policy.

749
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,080
Hospital birth lifelong gifts, example,

750
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:44,360
deformed, crippled, retarded, pox, hives, warts, moles, blindness, deafness, poor vision, etc.

751
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,660
Kosher-bosher containment policy work, good doctor's secret health example,

752
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,240
cataract, rheumatism, weak heart, damaged vision, epilepsy, fainting spells, paralysis,

753
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,060
loss of memory, trembling, gout, diabetes, many diseases.

754
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,520
The worldwide unbelievable lowest deadly gangster kosher-bosher

755
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,440
vicious medical profession, worldwide unbelievable instant plastic surgery

756
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,320
butchery of the body and brain, especially the face.

757
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:14,020
Wipe-on hormones and laser beam surgery causing instant ugly, deep, wrinkles, scars, age spots,

758
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,120
arthritis, freckles, blemishes, pimples, red, brown, black, or even sick white face and body.

759
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,140
Worldwide dark, negroidic colored male sex organs...

760
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,800
I use my body when I have to poop.

761
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,640
And I am earning.

762
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,020
Now...

763
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,300
It's OK if you don't need to go right now, Katy.

764
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,140
Just let me know when you do need to go to the party.

765
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,920
Ok... Ok...

766
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,900
On the floor.

767
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,540
Put it on the floor.

768
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,520
Gently.

769
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,940
Now just what could have happened to get such a piece of trifle?

770
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,380
You have no idea what I've gone through in the last three months.

771
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,360
And your conscious mind just doesn't see it.

772
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,880
Well, when they came out in 1956 with the subliminals,

773
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,500
there were two different people or types of people that went to Dr. Hal Becker right away

774
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,020
and wanted to use this subliminal.

775
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,880
And you can probably guess who they were.

776
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,240
They were preachers and they were politicians.

777
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,360
Because the preachers would love to get converts,

778
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,380
and the politicians would just love to get votes.

779
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,740
And a lot of politicians we would never vote for if we had any choice about it.

780
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,820
But they found if they used subliminals,

781
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,300
they could get votes from people who would never support them normally.

782
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,040
And the same thing with people teaching false religions.

783
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,840
That whole game, that whole game somewhere.

784
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,100
And the movies, the movies ain't doing but program your thing.

785
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,680
They say, put them all on dope.

786
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,000
And all the movies start glamorizing drugs.

787
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,300
Yeah, that's what Hollywood is about. Hollywood ain't about a trick.

788
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,220
Glamorize drugs.

789
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,840
The French Connection Academy Award winning.

790
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,620
And how many of y'all saw a movie called Midnight Express?

791
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,180
By the white boy over there and Turkey smuggling drugs and they caught him.

792
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,500
And the movie made the white drug smuggling the hero

793
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,780
and the Turks who caught him made them the pigs.

794
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,100
Grrr.

795
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,400
Grrr.

796
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,380
Grrr.

797
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,400
Grrr.

798
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,800
Grrr.

799
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,740
Grrr.

800
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,080
Later in the day.

801
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,380
Grrr.

802
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,340
Grrr.

803
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,700
Grrr.

804
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:30,720
Grrr.

805
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:30,720


806
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:30,720


807
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:30,720


808
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:30,720


809
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:30,720


810
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:30,720


811
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:30,720


812
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,220
Grrr.

813
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,180
Grrr.

814
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,220
Grrr.

815
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,700
Grrr.

816
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:32,700


817
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:32,700


818
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:32,700


819
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:32,700


820
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:32,700


821
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:32,700


822
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:32,700


823
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:32,700


824
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,420
Hey, wha-wha-whoa.

825
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,660
Bobby Worby sat in the wall.

826
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,360
Bobby Worby had a great fall.

827
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,780
A list of geniuses, horses, and men

828
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,180
couldn't put Bobby Worby back together again.

829
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:52,780
Grrr.

830
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,560
Grrr.

831
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,460
Grrr.

832
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:54,940


833
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:55,720
Grrr.

834
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,340
Grrr.

835
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:56,660
Grrr.

836
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:56,880
Grrr.

837
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:56,940
Grrr.

838
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,120
Grrr.

839
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,360
Grrr.

840
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:57,360


841
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:57,640
Grrr.

842
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,380
No graying and balding, even hairy buddy and furry buddy.

843
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:05,000
Mustached, bearded women, even wipe-on synthetic hormones causing cancerous growth.

844
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,600
Bloating, swelling, deformed big pickle nose, bulldog hanging cheeks and jowls.

845
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,500
From teenage gradual wipe-on, yellowing, browning and blackening of teeth.

846
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,460
And instant grinding and acids leaving hollow brown stumps.

847
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,880
So vocal cords are made raspy, aged.

848
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,040
Creating a wrinkled, ugly, gargoylic, clown booze face worldwide population by age 70.

849
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,000
Deformed, crippled, weak and brain damaged.

850
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,880
No, senile.

851
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,560
Lingering for inevitability of gradualness.

852
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:31,860
Extermination.

853
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,080
For your only hope for a future, do you know one word of pray for me, Francis E. Deck?

854
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:42,260
Computer God computerized brain thinking sealed robot operating arm surgery cabinet machine removal

855
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,240
of most of the frontal command lobe of the brain.

856
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,920
Gradually, during lifetime and overnight in all insane asylums,

857
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,160
after Computer God kosher-bosher one month probation period,

858
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:57,520
creating helpless, hopeless Computer God Frankenstein earphone radio parroting puppet brainless slaves.

859
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,640
Resulting in millions of hopeless, helpless, homeless, derelict,

860
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,180
and

861
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,460
In all Jerusalem, USA cities and Soviet slave work camps.

862
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,600
Something is implanted, an instinct, a blind compulsion to act for them.

863
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,280
But, Quatermass, if you're right, what's going to happen?

864
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
What's the ultimate object?

865
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,960
I hesitate to guess, Inspector.

866
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,480
First, a few of these things came here.

867
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:26,560
At random. Scattered. And then, expended themselves to a purpose. A year ago. Phase number two. The concentrated attack.

868
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:26,820
The concentrated attack.

869
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:27,800
The concentrated attack.

870
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:36,880
The next rule of the Church of the Subgenius is that the Church of the Subgenius will help you pull the wool over your own eyes.

871
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,840
That's right, children. Pull the wool.

872
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,860
What do I mean by this, children?

873
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,700
Well, ever since you were a little, bitty baby, ever since you were a little girl or a little boy,

874
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,960
you've been sold your family's wool, your church's wool, your school's wool, your governor's wool.

875
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,840
This is our land.

876
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,740
A land of peace and of plenty.

877
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,460
A land of harmony and hope.

878
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,920
This is our land.

879
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,100
Oceania.

880
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,360
These are our people.

881
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,560
The workers. The strivers. The builders.

882
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,860
These are our people.

883
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,040
The builders of our world.

884
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,540
The builders of our world.

885
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,160
Struggling. Fighting.

886
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,780
That's us, friends. Struggling and fighting.

887
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,540
And it's time now for me to tell you what you've been listening to.

888
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:50,280
Gosh, at the very beginning of the show, there was a wonderful piece, the perversion intro by Hell Pope Huey.

889
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,200
He's been doing all these wonderful hour of slack promos.

890
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,480
A miscellaneous media brawl.

891
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,700
A collage material from my collection.

892
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:07,740
A lot of cuts from Saint Joe Riley here in Dallas.

893
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
A wonderful little potty time tape contributed by Saint J. Condom.

894
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:21,340
Oddly enough, ironically enough, the author of P-Dawg, among other great works.

895
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:26,160
And of course, Francis E. Deck.

896
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,000
The great, great ranter.

897
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,240
Perhaps one of the most intense ranters who has ever existed.

898
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,240
Just short of this one.

899
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,740
Papa Joe Mama.

900
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,820
Hello, friends.

901
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,480
And welcome.

902
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,280
The sermon tonight is entitled, The Last Chance.

903
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,300
Yes, friends, 1998 is fast approaching.

904
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,260
And a lot of people out there have come to expect the church to start singing a different tune about the judgment day.

905
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,420
They say, hey, did you hear the news?

906
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,140
The Berlin Wall has fallen.

907
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,100
Things are getting better.

908
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,100
We say, is that so?

909
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,400
They say, hey, did you read the paper?

910
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,300
The Russians are now our friends.

911
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,620
Things are getting better.

912
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,820
We say, is that so?

913
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,400
They say, hey, did you see it on CNN?

914
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,060
We won the war.

915
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,300
Things are getting better.

916
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,660
Is that so?

917
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,340
And now they come a running and a cheering.

918
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,360
Saying, roll out the barrel.

919
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,980
We now have a new president.

920
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,580
The Republicans are out.

921
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,000
The recession is over.

922
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,460
It's the year of the woman.

923
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,520
Everybody get naked.

924
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,280
You poor, pitiful little pinks.

925
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,620
Do you really think an eternity of sin can be erased so easily?

926
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:40,160
Are we now supposed to embrace the conspiracy and call off the excess invasion?

927
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:47,580
Do you actually believe you can defuse an entire revolution with a few scraps of conspiracy compromise?

928
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,000
Never.

929
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,980
These petty little sidelines that have a nice day news don't divert our attention from the news.

930
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,540
They're not even the real issue.

931
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
Not for a second.

932
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,120
Dateline, Washington.

933
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,840
New conspiracy president sworn into office.

934
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,120
Promises new conspiracy health care plan to keep worker drones healthy and make more capable of serving the state.

935
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,160
More to follow.

936
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,460
Dateline, New York.

937
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,600
U.N. meets for conspiracy roll call vote of conspiracy agenda for global conspiracy world domination.

938
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:19,400
Renegade nations refusing to conform to new world order will be penalized.

939
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,280
More to follow.

940
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,880
Dateline, planet Earth.

941
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,980
Conspiracy in last instance.

942
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:34,640
A ditch effort to avert bloody overthrow attempts to utilize all arms of conspiracy propaganda machine to convince subgenius rebel rousers world is now A-OK.

943
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,400
Member for conspiracy high command states, quote, conspiracy no longer hostile.

944
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,800
Conspiracy now friend of little guy, end quote.

945
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,680
Well, well, well, the world is getting better.

946
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,360
We should just call off the invasion before it's too late.

947
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,140
Wrong.

948
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,280
You can fool some of the subgenies some of the time.

949
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,960
But you can't fool any of them.

950
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,500
You can fool the overmen any of the time.

951
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,740
They're much too in tune to the wily ways of the wicked one.

952
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,740
I'm talking about you, Mr. Pink Boy.

953
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,560
Yes, you.

954
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,460
The one with the firm handshake and the easy smile.

955
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,860
You're not tricking anyone with your bold new vision or JFK idealism.

956
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,240
We in the church go by one credo.

957
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,720
Ask not what the conspiracy can do to you but what you can do to the conspiracy.

958
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,940
And come July 5th, 1998, we're going to put that motto into simultaneous global orchestration.

959
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:31,160
We're overthrowing the conspiracy and we're executing the ringleaders along with anyone else who tries to stop us.

960
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,500
Now, to some, this may seem a little extreme.

961
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,040
That's perfectly normal.

962
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,780
To the average man in the street, witnessing a public execution of a criminal may also appear extreme.

963
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,820
After all, chances are that the man is unfamiliar with the crimes of the criminal.

964
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,920
He was too busy making a living to notice what misdeeds the condemned perpetrated on society before being brought to justice.

965
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,380
Add to that the criminal's emotional last words, his pleas for mercy,

966
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:03,480
his insistence of his own innocence and his reciting of all the good deeds he ever accomplished.

967
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,740
Then imagine the prisoner's family stepping forth, begging for his life

968
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:13,620
and witnesses filing forward to testify to the innocence of this great man so wrongly accused.

969
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,560
It should be no surprise that even an intelligent but uninformed person

970
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,960
would find themselves feeling sorry for the poor soul and wishing him a pardon,

971
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,920
if restored.

972
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,360
Expected newspapers were produced and showed article after article supporting the accused.

973
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,740
Even the most skeptical in the crowd would likely become sympathetic.

974
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,660
Why? Because they would see in that individual before them

975
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,560
not a criminal guilty of crimes against humanity,

976
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,360
but themselves falsely accused and condemned to death for crimes they never committed.

977
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:50,860
By now, the executioner should be more worried about their lives than the prisoner should his.

978
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,720
The crowd might well demand clemency,

979
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,880
and if refused, storm the guards and free the prisoner by force.

980
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,660
If you were part of this intervention,

981
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,980
you would probably feel proud for the good deed you performed

982
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,260
and the terrible injustice you averted.

983
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,220
But if a few weeks later you learn that the prisoner you saved was an insane serial killer,

984
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,600
that the witnesses that testified were all paid actors,

985
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,400
and that the newspapers you believed were all frauds,

986
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:20,840
you would be more worried about your life.

987
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:20,840


988
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,360
You might start to regret having been so compassionate.

989
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,320
Then by some quirk of fate,

990
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,120
if you stumbled onto incontrovertible evidence that the man you freed

991
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,340
had devoted his life to destroying yours,

992
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,640
that his new obsession was to capture you,

993
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,600
torture you,

994
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,760
and sell your loved ones into slavery,

995
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,860
well, you'd probably start to feel anger.

996
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,480
Anger at yourself for being fooled.

997
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,940
Anger at the actors who tricked you

998
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,900
and the newspapers that lied to you.

999
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,840
And anger at the people who lied to you.

1000
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,320
And anger at all the mental dweebs still running around out there

1001
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,640
claiming the bastard is really reformed and just misunderstood.

1002
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,640
This is how we at the church feel about the conspiracy.

1003
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:08,240
Each and every one of us at one time or another believed the conspiracy.

1004
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,740
Each and every one of us in one way or another served the conspiracy.

1005
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,380
And every single one of us in no uncertain terms knows that the conspiracy,

1006
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,840
is out to get us.

1007
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,560
Every day it tries to capture us,

1008
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,440
torture us,

1009
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,860
and enslave our kind.

1010
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,700
And every single time we get close to destroying the monster,

1011
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:36,760
some well-meaning but ignorant bystander starts whining that we're being too severe,

1012
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,060
too extreme.

1013
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,380
They say that the conspiracy is actually innocent.

1014
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,380
They say they know because they read all about it in the conspiracy newspapers,

1015
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,920
or saw it all explained to them on conspiracy TV.

1016
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,300
They say they think you know.

1017
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:51,620
They insist that theyonymize the word up with its programmer.

1018
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:51,620


1019
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,420
They insist that our allegations are exaggerated.

1020
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,940
That the conspiracy is getting better,

1021
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,460
and that we should just mellow out.

1022
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:04,400
They try to tell us that we are to give the conspiracy slack.

1023
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,820
Dear, dear friends,

1024
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,000
these poor misguided morons,

1025
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,240
may be in the dark now, just as we were before.

1026
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:18,200
And we may have acted back then just as stupid as they're acting now.

1027
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,760
But that doesn't mean we don't have the right,

1028
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,100
nay, the duty to destroy the conspiracy while we have the chance.

1029
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,440
Do not be taken in by any last-minute media blitz

1030
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,580
that tries to convince you that the conspiracy

1031
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,280
has suddenly turned over a new leaf, because it hasn't.

1032
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,100
The noose is around its neck.

1033
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,380
What do you expect the conspiracy to say?

1034
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,420
We deserve to die? Kill us?

1035
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,740
No, the conspiracy will look and act nicer now than it ever has before.

1036
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,560
So don't be fooled.

1037
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,760
If you hesitate, even for a second,

1038
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,700
you give the conspiracy a chance to win the crowd over.

1039
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,840
And if that happens, you may find yourself on trial

1040
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,700
with no more X's around to pull your fat from the firing squad.

1041
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,800
There's only one X day, dear friends.

1042
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,900
Don't blow it.

1043
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,680
July 5th, 1998.

1044
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,480
Kill the conspiracy.

1045
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,000
Cut off its head and launch it through the cosmos.

1046
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,100
Hearin' to the word of our praise, Bob.

1047
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,020
Amen!

1048
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,380
The builders of our world

1049
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,240
Struggling.

1050
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,440
Fighting.

1051
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,160
Bleeding.

1052
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,020
Dying.

1053
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,900
On the streets of our cities and on the far-flung battlefields.

1054
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,260
Fighting against the mutilation of our hopes and dreams.

1055
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,160
I've accidentally raised the powers of darkness. Please come!

1056
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,280
Oh, that's all right. Here, hold on, hold on.

1057
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,740
We'll get to you, we'll get to you.

1058
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,420
Okay, okay, okay.

1059
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:51,200
I'm sorry it is against my religion to operate the heat and the temperature.

1060
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,920
I'm fighting in the interior, my share.

1061
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,620
Oh dear, it's that other boring collar.

1062
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,760
But because we believe in the sanctity of all living things, we will let him come.

1063
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,460
I cut my penis in a coke bottle and I can't get it off.

1064
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,300
No, no, it wasn't a coke bottle, it was a can and it really happened.

1065
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,120
It did not. Fanny Arbuckle was absolutely innocent.

1066
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:07,920
No, it wasn't.

1067
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,840
Eventual brain lobotomization of the entire world population

1068
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,800
for the worldwide deadly gangster communist computer god overall plan.

1069
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,340
Children, politics is a dead issue and let me explain to you why.

1070
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,500
Why? Why?

1071
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,620
You can go to Poland and vote, children, if you want to vote.

1072
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,000
You can go to Chile and vote if you want to vote, children.

1073
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,560
And the people that live there know what they're voting for.

1074
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,960
And you know what they see as democratic freedom, children?

1075
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:34,860
What do they see?

1076
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,900
I'll tell you, you know what they want in Russia, children?

1077
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,900
What do they want? What do they want?

1078
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,420
They want Led Zeppelin albums and 501 blues, children.

1079
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,500
The products of a free society are now mistaken for the society which had the freedom to produce them.

1080
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,460
So nobody around the country, around the world is looking for politics, children.

1081
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,380
They want ghetto blasters as big as El Dorado.

1082
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,380
Big! Big!

1083
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,100
For slack!

1084
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,360
When you invest in pop culture, which is what you've been given,

1085
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,600
as a substitute for politics, children,

1086
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,940
you get bored in a hurry.

1087
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,920
And you get bored in a hurry so that you'll go out and buy more pop culture.

1088
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:16,620
More!

1089
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:22,220
And you're so convinced that your taste in rock and roll or art or movies

1090
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,980
is what defines you, children, that you buy and buy and buy to shore up that definition.

1091
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,040
And you're playing right into the conspiracy's hands, children.

1092
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,780
Right! Right!

1093
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,400
But as it turns out, children, you're also playing into our hands, children,

1094
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,960
because Bob is a savior designed for a consuming society.

1095
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,200
Bob is a short duration personal savior.

1096
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,280
That's right, children.

1097
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,660
Bob wants you to take him into your heart, to take him into your mind,

1098
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:54,920
to take him into your wallet, and then cast him out, children, and make your own church.

1099
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,200
And children, when you look around at the shambles that the modern world has become, children,

1100
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,700
don't blame Bob.

1101
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,020
He doesn't make history. He just exploits it.

1102
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,940
And if children, if you look at these subgeniuses, and you see how deep their devotion is,

1103
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,120
and how truly they believe, and how much Bob means to them,

1104
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,860
and you say, a joke is all that's left, children,

1105
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,400
yes, that's true, children, but it's a joke you can believe in.

1106
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,680
Can you say this was the eve of destruction?

1107
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:40,320
Surely, my friend, you must have been blind.

1108
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:48,120
I can see on the dawn of this morning

1109
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:55,220
a new ray of hope for mankind.

1110
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,420
And your dead men, they are marching,

1111
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,580
in legions to end things,

1112
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:10,200
the roads where the highways begun.

1113
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,820
And your young people are leaving,

1114
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,420
their candles like sunflowers,

1115
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:25,340
in darkness to walk in the sun.

1116
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,360
We are here tonight to talk about

1117
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,020
to preach a word of hatred for normalcy, children.

1118
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:42,140
Unlike the Namby Pamby Christians and the New Agers,

1119
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:46,920
the subgenius is a religion of hate.

1120
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,560
Now, we're not talking about just any old ordinary hate.

1121
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,100
You can't just talk about some mealy-mouthed, wimpy little,

1122
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,280
oh, I just hate President Reagan so much.

1123
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,920
You know, I just hate this society.

1124
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,760
Or, even worse,

1125
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,620
you know, I just hate myself.

1126
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,000
What we're talking about

1127
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,140
when we say hate

1128
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,540
is an all-encompassing,

1129
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,760
an all-empressing,

1130
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,320
an infinite hate.

1131
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,780
Hate, hate,

1132
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,620
I'm too busy hating.

1133
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:38,240
Hate! Because it is our hate of the peep boys, the normals, that gives us our unruly psychic powers.

1134
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,980
Yes, in the Church of the Sub-Jeez you can learn psychic powers.

1135
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,440
Learn to psychic and read your own mind.

1136
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,660
Predict the past and present.

1137
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,820
Become master of the universe while losing weight.

1138
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,620
Dominate yourself.

1139
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,320
Reveal yourself.

1140
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,460
Incorrect answers to questions you never would have thought of to ask anyway.

1141
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,160
The infinity series. Collect them all.

1142
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,940
But you might ask, who's this hate to wreck that, children?

1143
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:24,740
There are some men whose level of hideousness, protest, repugnance,

1144
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,600
reaches such levels that we have...

1145
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,800
coined a special phrase for these men.

1146
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,240
We call them idols of hate.

1147
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,640
Kill me! Kill me somebody!

1148
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,400
Can I get a witness?

1149
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,120
Can I get a witness?

1150
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,920
Can I get a hate?

1151
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,780
Can I get a hate?

1152
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,760
Can I get a kill me?

1153
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,180
Kill me somebody! Kill me somebody!

1154
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,560
Pull that one down and go, she ain't got no legs!

1155
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,780
My legs are fire round!

1156
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,600
Now who are some of these idols of hate?

1157
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,380
I think you know who we're talking about.

1158
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,560
Mr. Dishonest TV Evangelist, sir.

1159
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,880
Mr. Top 40 Radio Programmer, sir.

1160
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,460
Mr. Sleazebag Corporate Executive, sir.

1161
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,700
Oh, you don't even know what I'm talking about.

1162
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,100
You're just living through the channels.

1163
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,560
But by God, you don't hear me now, sir.

1164
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,740
Now what is another example of what we call...

1165
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,600
an idol of hate?

1166
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,220
Another example of an idol of hate is...

1167
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,980
the guy we call Mr. Just His Way.

1168
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,040
Oh, I'm sure you've met Mr. Just His Way.

1169
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,880
Is he totally cruel and obnoxious?

1170
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,180
Well, that's just his way.

1171
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,800
Did he pound your face in with two concrete blocks?

1172
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,260
Well, that's just his way.

1173
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,640
Did he try to exterminate an entire race...

1174
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,140
and enslave the entire earth?

1175
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,960
Well, that's just the beer talking.

1176
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:01,820
He's alright.

1177
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,620
And I can get into that.

1178
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,380
I think it's valid.

1179
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,600
But this is just my way.

1180
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,500
I'm just into making lampshades...

1181
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,600
from the flesh of Mr. Just His Way.

1182
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,300
I'm just into painting my kitchen...

1183
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,860
with the blood of Mr. Just His Way.

1184
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,820
Oh, I do like your kitchen.

1185
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,600
Do you really?

1186
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,100
Well, it's Central Arkansas redneck.

1187
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,180
Do you think it's really me?

1188
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,360
It's just the way I am, I guess.

1189
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,240
Now they've got themselves a colony.

1190
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,320
And all this went on for a year...

1191
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,260
and nobody said anything?

1192
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,380
But who knows how many infected people...

1193
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,440
they've got in high places.

1194
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,120
What about here?

1195
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,440
Can you be sure of all your stuff?

1196
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,080
I think so.

1197
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,620
I'll step up security in the morning.

1198
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,560
The next move is Hall's.

1199
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,420
We've got to break this conspiracy.

1200
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,480
The conspiracy of silence and secret orders.

1201
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:04,520
Your young men heard follow your teachings

1202
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:12,180
Now they know the wrongs you've done

1203
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:21,060
And they've heard all your two-sided preachings

1204
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,800
Now we know just what must be won

1205
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:32,240
And the sweet wine of life

1206
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,020
Flows freely and clearly

1207
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:41,900
Come break the spell while you can

1208
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,600
And form a great circle

1209
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,920
That shall not be broken

1210
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,380
Proclaiming the freedom of man

1211
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,740
Proclaiming the freedom of man

1212
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:03,220
Proclaiming the freedom of man

1213
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:13,780
Proclaiming the freedom of man

1214
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,720
Now you listen to me.

1215
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,100
I'll only say once.

1216
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,680
We are not sick men.

1217
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,800
No, not us, friends.

1218
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,080
We are not sick men.

1219
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:34,540
Thank you.

1220
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:41,140
And, yeah, there's some marvelous subgenius preaching there from some of the greats,

1221
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:45,340
the real greats, Pope David N. Meyer,

1222
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,980
Pope of the Great Pacific Northwest, Idaho and New York,

1223
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,880
preaching on the conspiracy of democracy products

1224
00:52:53,880 --> 00:53:00,340
and followed by St. Janer Hyperclete with the classic hate rant,

1225
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:06,400
Mr. Just His Way from, I believe, the Boston Babylon of preaching and friends.

1226
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:12,340
You know, you can learn more about that hate and where to pump your hate up

1227
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,140
by writing for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1228
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:22,240
And what happens when you do that is you get a little catalog.

1229
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,800
Basically, it tells you how much.

1230
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,940
Money you could spend later on.

1231
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:30,900
On books, tapes, and so forth and so on.

1232
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,060
And, friends, just write for that free information from Bob.

1233
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,700
You can just address it to Bob.

1234
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,440
You got that pencil ready?

1235
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:50,960
That's old Bobby at Post Office Box 140306.

1236
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,980
That's Box 140306.

1237
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,880
In mighty Dallas, Texas.

1238
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:03,340
Dallas, Texas, dear friends, 75214.

1239
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:08,840
And we'll be looking forward to hearing from you so, so soon.

1240
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:09,560
Bye.

1241
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,020
Bye.

1242
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,660
That was good.

1243
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:37,380
What you were about to see, you may find hard to believe.

1244
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:43,120
A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

1245
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,720
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P.

1246
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,900
Lizzie, before we leave for Bobby's party, you need to go to the potty.

1247
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,040
Okay, Daddy.

1248
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,240
You need any help?

1249
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,220
No thanks, I can do it myself.

1250
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,080
That's my girl.

1251
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:03,280
First I put my book away, then we'll go to the party.

1252
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:11,260
When I use the potty, Dad's so proud of me.

1253
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,600
There they go.

1254
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,480
We're really good at this, aren't we, Teddy?

1255
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:33,900
On top of your potty, you're sailing to poop.

1256
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:43,580
Oh, life is much better when your diapers don't work.

1257
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:43,580


1258
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:43,700
I'm glad it's true.

1259
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,780
But you have to be patient.

1260
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,800
Just sit there and smile.

1261
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:04,160
But instead of waiting, why not read for a while?

1262
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,600
I'm done, Daddy.

1263
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,460
Okay.

1264
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,180
Okay, don't forget to wipe, flush, and wash your hands.

1265
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,160
How often do you engage in unorthodox sexual practices?

1266
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,440
How often do you engage in unorthodox sexual practices?

1267
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,560
Come on now, break the silence.

1268
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,720
It's a sex party.

1269
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,780
It's an emotional breakdown.

1270
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,180
It's a sex party.

1271
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:38,280
It's a sex party.

1272
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,100
Walking through revolving doors.

1273
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,720
The system stays intact.

1274
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,700
Climbing walls.

1275
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,460
Your ass is mean.

1276
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,560
Fingernails claw at my back.

1277
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:59,900
Kagan forces cling to us as we slide in and out of time.

1278
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,080
It's a sex party.

1279
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,180
It's an emotional breakdown.

1280
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,560
It's a sex party.

1281
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,020
It's a sex party.

1282
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:28,020
It's a sex party.

1283
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:28,020


1284
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:37,520
Listen to me.

1285
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:37,520


1286
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:37,520


1287
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:38,920
It's all about the bias scared.

1288
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:38,920


1289
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:38,920


1290
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,100
Do what you gotta do.

1291
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:40,260
Do what you gotta do.

1292
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,480
It only works if you let it.

1293
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,400
I'm sure they'll finger snap you at your own small test.

1298
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,560

It's a sick party
