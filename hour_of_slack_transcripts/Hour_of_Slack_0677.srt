1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Managing pressures are frustrating now.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,200
Amateur scientist status.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,700
I have a story, safe as the basement,

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,540
but safe as any room in my house.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,140
I'm supposed to be allowed to grove.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,560
At least I have an oxygen case.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,520
I'm registered somewhat oxygen depraved.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,360
I may be quite a bit older than I appear,

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,620
and I've been having...

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,280
Managing pressures are frustrating now.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:47,340
Do you want to worship Adolf Hitler as God

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,360
and go to hell?

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,940
Or worship me, God and Jesus Christ?

14
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,780
Amen.

15
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,620
Amen.

16
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,880
Amen.

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,520
Amen.

18
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,160
Sponsored by the Church of the Sub-G.

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,980
You know, to most people,

20
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,100
that's literally a common recurring nightmare.

21
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,920
To me, it must just be another memory of a great weekend.

22
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,220
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,900
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,380
Yeah, I'm the guy that has my hearings in the front hall of Euclid High School in the 70s in Lentweisberg's room.

25
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,900
I'd already left a message.

26
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,940
And I had some legal notices in the paper.

27
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:35,180
I have a message from Gerardo, to whom it may concern, about those Norwegian beauties.

28
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,380
I read your legal notice several years ago, and you're on a screening process, of course.

29
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:49,320
You're supposed to be able to tell right away if a guy has either been cheated of his education or has a problem or deserves a second chance.

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,260
In the case of my hearings, I sued a Clemency policeman that was playing games with me.

31
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,880
I'm all the way back to the 60s with the cuckoo for Cocoa Puff policeman that kept telling me there was a shortage

32
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,740
and not enough for the district IQ champ to clear his mind to think.

33
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,180
I'm all the way back to the 60s with the cuckoo for Cocoa Puff policeman that kept telling me there was a shortage

34
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,180


35
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm all the way back to the 60s with the cuckoo for Cocoa Puff policeman that kept telling me there was a shortage

36
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,240


37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:20,440
I have made this recording of my own free will to urge those few remaining subgeniuses to come forward.

38
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:30,640
Our alien masters have kindly offered a general amnesty to all subgeniuses

39
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,720
who entered their local human reality.

40
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,120
The education camp.

41
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:48,840
A handsome premium is also offered to those who alert the authorities to renegade subgeniuses in their unit.

42
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,580
If you believe, you can leave.

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,460
The mighty depression's a frustrating mess.

44
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,360
Uh, yes dear friends, and no kidding.

45
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,720
It can be.

46
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,340
It can be that way.

47
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,300
Where are we?

48
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,340
Where are we?

49
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:07,640
Okay.

50
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:16,180
Thank you Susie the floozy, Jeff Beck here in the background, and Dr. Onan Kanobite,

51
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:23,500
who we just heard from, along with the legal notice guy, and other great manic depressives.

52
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
Ah, yes.

53
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,360
Actually, let's just listen to this music for a second.

54
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,580
Let's hear it.

55
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,680
It's right here.

56
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,740
Take a listen.

57
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:00,820


58
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,060
Drink it.

59
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,380
Drink it.

60
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:01,380


61
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,640
Drink it.

62
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,880
Well, you ain't no use to me

63
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,700
Hanging around

64
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,140
Music, sweet music

65
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,640
I wish I could rest

66
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,000
On my tenderness

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,540
Mighty depression

68
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,880
It's a frustrating mess

69
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Yeah

70
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,040
Oh

71
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,980
Ow

72
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,660
Music, sweet music

73
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,000
Music, sweet music

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,300
Music, sweet music

75
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:45,640
Uh, yes, dear friends

76
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,340
Um

77
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,900
Really ain't no use

78
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,480
Of us hanging around

79
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,120
So we are

80
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,440
Gonna get off

81
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,620
Folks, we must get off

82
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:57,960
Right?

83
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:57,960


84
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,300
Earth

85
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,380
First

86
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,060
And, uh

87
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,800
And we can, too

88
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,720
On X Day

89
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,880
July 5th, 1998

90
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,720
But, uh

91
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,240
In the meantime

92
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,480
There's a couple of really

93
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,140
Big subgenius

94
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,040
Devivals

95
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,880
Coming up

96
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,520
Uh

97
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,840
April 30th

98
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,880
In Boston

99
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,320
Another great

100
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,640
Boston Devival

101
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,500
In fact, I guess

102
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,060
You could say

103
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,080
It will be the last

104
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,020
Boston Devival

105
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,540
The Church of the Subgenius

106
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,740
April 30th

107
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,300
Friday night

108
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,740
At, uh

109
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,040
Uh

110
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,000
The Middle East

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,960
Club

112
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,460
Is the name of the place

113
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,340
Upstairs

114
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,740
Friday Jones

115
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,560
Is producing

116
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,020
And selling

117
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,520
This Devival

118
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,320
Which will star

119
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,000
Pope David N. Meyer

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,960
Uh

121
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,600
Papa Joe Mama

122
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,720
Brother Cleve Duncan

123
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,480
I think

124
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,220
Bill T. Miller

125
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,620
And, uh

126
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,140
Yours truly

127
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,360
Reverend Ivan Stang

128
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,420
And, uh

129
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,720
God only knows who else

130
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,240
Bob

131
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,500
May, in fact

132
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,460
Also know

133
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,860
So, uh

134
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,220
Friends

135
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,620
Write that on your calendar

136
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:57,960
You can find us on the web

137
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:57,960


138
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,680
At www.boston.devival.com

139
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,220
The link to the book

140
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:03,260
On the site

141
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:03,540
Is in the description

142
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:03,540


143
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:03,540


144
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:03,540


145
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:03,540


146
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:03,540


147
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:03,540


148
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:03,540


149
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:03,860
And the same

150
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,660
By the way

151
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,420
The same lineup

152
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,760
Is about a month

153
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,080
Later

154
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,060
In Seattle

155
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,860
Washington

156
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,480
At a place called

157
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,320
On Board

158
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,960
So watch the

159
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,920
Subgenius website

160
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,980
Or you can

161
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,800
Actually on the

162
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,680
Boston Devival

163
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,800
You can check out

164
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,180
www.fridayjones.com

165
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,360
And why not

166
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,960
Why not

167
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:36,240
Not, because there's a great gap in the mentality of those who fail to see,

168
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,680
to see deeply into the secret orchestra of Einstein.

169
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,420
Heard in the background here.

170
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,220
Playing at Winterstar.

171
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,720
There are great gaps.

172
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,260
And here's a little thing about generation gaps, friends.

173
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:04,320
Here's a list of things about people who started college this fall and were born in 1980.

174
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,520
The young folks, probably most of the people listening to me now, but those oldies like me.

175
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,740
Think about these young folks, folks.

176
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,940
There has only been one pope in their lifetime.

177
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,940
They were 11 years old when the Soviet Union broke.

178
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,240
It was a great time.

179
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,640
Beautiful, beautiful.

180
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,520
Well, let's flip that tape back to the middle and we'll see what's on in the background there.

181
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,940
Strange jamming.

182
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,700
Yeah, the kids of today, man, their lifetime has always included AIDS,

183
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,680
and it has always included the church of the subgenius.

184
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:44,480
If you were born after 1980, there's no excuse for you not to send your $30 to Bob.

185
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,720
It's always been around since you were born.

186
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,600
The Dallas Post Office box, 1403-06,

187
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,240
has been around since you were born.

188
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,720
It's been around as long as you have.

189
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,040
You have never had a smallpox shot,

190
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,160
and probably don't even know what smallpox is.

191
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,020
The expression,

192
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,140
you sound like a broken record,

193
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,260
doesn't mean anything to you because you never had a record player.

194
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,540
The compact disc came along when you were one.

195
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,320
To you, stamps have always cost about 32 cents, at least.

196
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,040
And in your world, there have always been answers.

197
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,400
The walkman, Sony Walkman was introduced the year you were born.

198
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,360
Popcorn has always been cooked in a microwave, hasn't it?

199
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,420
And you probably don't care who shot J.R.

200
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,160
and have no idea who J.R. is,

201
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,760
unless you're thinking of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

202
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,800
who was, in fact, shot by puzzling evidence,

203
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,800
the fiendish puzzling evidence,

204
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,020
actually real names,

205
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,440
the name Douglas Atwood Wellman,

206
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,500
yes, let's say the name of the worm,

207
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,480
yes, the worm,

208
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,020
who was actually, like so many assassins,

209
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,780
was originally military,

210
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,380
trained in the military.

211
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,460
And speaking of military,

212
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,460
my kids noticed there was a war on for the first time.

213
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,180
And to commemorate that,

214
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,680
and the killer of Bob Dobbs, J.R.,

215
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,020
I'd like to play these tapes from 19...

216
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,420
When was that war?

217
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,920
Anyway, one of those wars,

218
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,480
the first voice you will hear is Doug Wellman

219
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
of Puzzling Evidence,

220
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,280
when the balloon went up

221
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,460
for the last televised miniseries war that we had.

222
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,440
I hope you all can apply some of these lessons

223
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,180
to our modern-day predicament.

224
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,820
And then we'll be back to Einstein's Secret Orchestra

225
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,880
live radio and modern-day stuff.

226
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,060
In the meantime, for...

227
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,740
Hi, Honda.

228
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,480
Yeah.

229
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,560
Hi.

230
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,140


231
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,140


232
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,760
Hi.

233
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:48,880


234
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,420
Hi.

235
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:49,520
Hi.

236
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,540
Hi.

237
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:49,620
Hi.

238
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,760
Hi.

239
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:51,960


240
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:51,960


241
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:51,960


242
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:51,960


243
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


244
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


245
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


246
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


248
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


249
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


250
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


252
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


253
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


255
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


256
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


257
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000


258
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,140
Hi.

259
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,140


260
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,140


261
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,140


262
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,140


263
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,140


264
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,140


265
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,140


266
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,140


267
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,140


268
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,140


269
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,440
I'm afraid there's a lot more trouble

270
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
that we asked for tonight out here in...

271
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,320
...the Bob zone.

272
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,580
I have got a message from Bob for all of you.

273
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,560
Don't give up.

274
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,980
Yep, he didn't say what not to give up,

275
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,660
so I'll tell you what I'm not giving up.

276
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,780
I'm not giving up drugs.

277
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,640
I'm not giving up surfing,

278
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,120
and I'm not giving up coming down from this station

279
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,860
and being a bad noise in your ear.

280
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:29,680
And I'm also not giving up the hope that our boys over there in Malaysia will be able to assassinate Bob for once and for all and get rid of his kind before you become one of him.

281
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,900
And I'm afraid we'll not be able to take calls tonight.

282
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,740
In a wartime situation such as this, we just don't care what you have to say.

283
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,540
You can call the station all you want and we aren't going to listen.

284
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:52,580
Listen, it's time you got to realize that it's people like me are going to have to come up with the answers for you and that you're just going to have to live with our decisions.

285
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,540
We're taking a lot of notes here tonight, so we're going to be thinking about what you're thinking about.

286
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,380
And we know what you're thinking, believe me.

287
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:12,440
Tonight's show, unlike normally, we do have a sponsor tonight and we'll be revealing that sponsor.

288
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,660
Thanks, thanks. Out here in the horrid, horrid future.

289
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:28,520
The other doctors are reloading at this moment and it is expected they'll be storming the station.

290
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,140
I don't believe we're going to have a problem tonight with enemy fire.

291
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,960
I don't know what time we had a hill bomb.

292
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,460
Sorry, there has been an infusion of...

293
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,280
the what I refer to as my own personal enemy at this...

294
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,660
at this...

295
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,140
At this moment and like I said before, please don't give up. Don't give up drugs.

296
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,520
Don't give up going crazy and don't give up the hope that someday our nation will be run by people like me.

297
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,340
And of course people like Dr. Hal.

298
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,800
Well, you could do worse, I suppose, I suppose.

299
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,920
It all started a long time ago.

300
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,600
I'm not sure that I can even remember when that was.

301
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,560
So long ago and far away.

302
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,340
And I was a bold, strapping young thing.

303
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,220
So you'd hardly think that to look at me now.

304
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:28,440
I remember you, Doctor, dressed up in that uniform, marching back and forth, poking Dr. Freedy to the bayonet.

305
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,540
You were a fine man in those days.

306
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,640
Doctor, what happened?

307
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,460
You were a stateless person who had to be under the jurisdiction of the new order.

308
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,160
Well, I'm going to make my order right now.

309
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,620
Clams and eggs with a side of toast.

310
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,440
I'll have mine.

311
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,060
Hash browns with jam and a little...

312
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,480
What do you call those things?

313
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,160
Those little packets?

314
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,280
Oh, those are...

315
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,080
With some grape jelly in there.

316
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,780
Can I get a fresh squeezed orange juice with that?

317
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,280
Yes, just step right over here.

318
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,640
Incredible.

319
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,380
Not since the video...

320
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,020
Here, drink this.

321
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,340
Oh, okay.

322
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,480
Hey, Doctor, what was that, anyway?

323
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,520
That was water.

324
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:12,680
Water?

325
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:12,760


326
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:12,760


327
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:12,760


328
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,840
And then I drank more juice, and wasn't it good?

329
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,620
Mm-mm.

330
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,140
Boy, we're gonna be drinking up gallons of it tonight here on the Subgenius Radio Show.

331
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,580
Yes, sir.

332
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,860
And I have a feeling that Puzzling Evidence will be here tonight.

333
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,620
I think he's probably down in the reloading room right now.

334
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:33,440
Israeli tank crews operating in modified Soviet T-55 and T-62 tanks in the Sinai Desert Experience.

335
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,060
Certain technical difficulties, as usual.

336
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,660
Somebody's gotta lift the scab, the festering scab.

337
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,740
That is the batting.

338
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,140
Ay, ay.

339
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,320
I found it.

340
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,020
We ooh-ooh-ooh.

341
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,020


342
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,300
done this for four innings.

343
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,300


344
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,300


345
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,300


346
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,300


347
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:11,480


348
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,360
Sure thing.

349
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:12,520


350
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:12,520


351
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,620
Yeah, get rid of them as soon as you can, lady.

352
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,520
Look at it up to the light.

353
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,500
You see the metal stripping it?

354
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,780
That's a tracking device.

355
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,020
If you got any more of those at home, get rid of them.

356
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,220
Exchange them for good for some.

357
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,280
Because they'll follow you.

358
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,760
They know where every one of those hundreds is going.

359
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,720
Spending money.

360
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,540
Hey, you know what?

361
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,140
Black helicopters.

362
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,420
You heard about them.

363
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,720
The black helicopters, they're everywhere.

364
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,160
Yeah, they're on whisper mode.

365
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,300
You can't hear them until they've already gone.

366
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,380
You know?

367
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,920
This is Kennedy's pink suit.

368
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,700
There's a Secret Service man spread over the top of the car.

369
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,260
At this point, it looks like there's only one or two or even all of the people within the car.

370
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,780
They have been the victims.

371
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,040
They have been shot by shots.

372
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,660
We don't know.

373
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,580
I've heard some incredible theories about Kennedy's assassination since that movie came out.

374
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,860
Weirdest one I ever heard, but the most intriguing.

375
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,340
I heard the guy who shot Kennedy was the Secret Service man in the front seat of the limo.

376
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,000
Sounds ludicrous, but think about it.

377
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,360
Every time you've ever seen a Zabruder film, have you ever looked at the Secret Service man

378
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,660
in the front seat of that limo?

379
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,380
No.

380
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,300
It's like the ultimate magic trick of misdirection.

381
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,180
Because like most people, when I see the Zabruder film, I'm looking, you know, at Jackie's ass

382
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,540
when she gets on the trunk of that car.

383
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,800
Thank you very much.

384
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,760
Parkland Hospital has been advised to stand by for a severe gunshot wound.

385
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,820
And just now, we've received reports here at Parkland that Governor Connolly was shot

386
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,020
in the upper left chest.

387
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,360
And the first unconfirmed reports say the President's wife,

388
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,260
was hit in the head.

389
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,800
That's an unconfirmed report that the President was hit in the head.

390
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,140
There was definitely the President.

391
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,580
Mr. Connolly, Alan Bullock incoming.

392
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,960
And we're now speaking directly to Parkland Hospital.

393
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,020
The President of the United States is dead.

394
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,860
President Kennedy has been assassinated.

395
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,620
It's official now.

396
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,180
The President is dead.

397
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,560
Okay.

398
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
iao다는

399
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,720
I'm not doing anything at all.

400
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,740
I'm just getting away from that inane babbling.

401
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,060
I'm tired of listening to you.

402
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,360
You know how important my work is to me, Clarice.

403
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,800
You know how important the Anu-Anu statue and the amulets are.

404
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,420
You know that we are not alone.

405
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,320
I wish I was alone.

406
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,900
I wish I didn't have to hear this insensitive drivel every night.

407
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,160
You never...

408
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,460
When's the last time we did anything at all?

409
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,740
Well, we worked on...

410
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,780
Let's see.

411
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,580
We worked on the Polynesians first coming to the South American shore

412
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,220
and then the Vanduul people of the lower Amazon basin

413
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,560
moving all the way to Hawaii,

414
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,340
taking a sun-filled Hawaiian vacation.

415
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,380
Doesn't that sound right to you right now, Clarice?

416
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,760
Clarice, I'm dripping wet.

417
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,260
Please, you have to help me.

418
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,380
You're the only one who can.

419
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,200
I'm dripping wet.

420
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,560
I'm dripping wet.

421
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,460
But somehow it all seems to be the same.

422
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,840
Well, I've been on that ship before.

423
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,740
Yeah, you know.

424
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,220
I don't want to ever do it again, yeah.

425
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,080
So now, I really got to tell you how I feel.

426
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,640
I feel...

427
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,680
I feel...

428
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,120
I feel...

429
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,280
I feel...

430
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
I feel...

431
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,580
I feel...

432
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:03,820
I feel...

433
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,720
I feel...

434
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,620
guitar solo

435
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,580
solo

436
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,040
We'll return to the Simeon Waterline

437
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,340
with Mark Henben,

438
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,140
Lawrence Wenpen, and Earl Letkin.

439
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,740
We must drive away lotion horror.

440
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,080
We must build most dose.

441
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,080
I have the grey hand.

442
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,080
I have the grey hand.

443
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,420
We have the grey hand.

444
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,800
Now there's a real guy named Grey

445
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,460
who claimed that the governments,

446
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,800
the Illuminati of all the world governments

447
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,600
decided that they were going to try and build

448
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,760
a one world government by making everybody scared

449
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,460
of aliens that didn't exist.

450
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,900
Well, didn't you see that

451
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,860
on the X-Files? Or wasn't that the X-Files

452
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,880
second season or something like that?

453
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,460
I mean, that's hackneyed old.

454
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,580
Sure, that's true, but

455
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,980
what's the difference?

456
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,920
Everybody's watching it on TV thinking it's fiction

457
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,580
so it can happen right under your nose.

458
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,340
You go, oh, that's cool.

459
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,760
It's just like the X-Files, dude.

460
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,300
I saw that one show.

461
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,780
Yeah, I saw it too.

462
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,660
This guy's slant on it was that

463
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,380
guess who's behind it all? Not the Illuminati,

464
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,920
but the ancient ones of Sumeria.

465
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,000
Oh, in that case.

466
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,300
Oh, well, oh.

467
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,560
Oh, the ancient, oh, the ascended

468
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,280
masters of, yeah.

469
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,100
Okay, the Sumerians.

470
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,420
Well, no wonder Sumerians,

471
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,940
the Sumerian language has been getting trendy

472
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,800
all of a sudden. It is. I mean, I've been

473
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,600
into like them little cyber cafes.

474
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,240
There we go.

475
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,920
$130.

476
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,440
You could hear my heartbeat

477
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,140
throughout the recording on this

478
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,740
tape of a loud noise

479
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,640
in the background through my

480
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,020
electronic stethoscope

481
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,080
as I held the electronic stethoscope

482
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,940
to my eye.

483
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,380
To the top of my head, to the back of my head,

484
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,200
and to my ear

485
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,500
to get the, see if I can get

486
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,760
the angles to come through,

487
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,300
but it's too weak. I can't get them to

488
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,980
come through with voice

489
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,680
to be picked up by my cassette tape.

490
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,220
But you can hear

491
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,380
my heartbeat throughout

492
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,680
the entire cassette

493
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,460
recorded, and you can hear the loud

494
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:57,880
noise

495
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,980
of the computer

496
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,000
programmers and satellite

497
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,940
transmissions from the United States.

498
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,100
They tortured my cosmic mind

499
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,900
and my body like they have

500
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,920
ever since 1959.

501
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,020
Now I will let it be played

502
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,360
normally, and you can tell the difference

503
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,080
in the noise

504
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,820
and the quietness in this

505
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,100
being played now without any noise

506
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,780
coming over.

507
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,040
Come on, give me some.

508
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,280
But meanwhile, in a vacuum

509
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,980
room orbiting

510
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,080
the planet Nexo.

511
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,940
I was dreaming

512
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,920
again. I dreamed

513
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,640
I saw the dog's head

514
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,040
and the stand's

515
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,580
face.

516
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,800
I'd give anything to feel

517
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,860
gravity again, but I

518
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,080
understand it would crush my bones

519
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,220
after all these years in space,

520
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,420
Meg. It's probably best

521
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,060
that we just float around out

522
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,280
here in this vacuum.

523
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,960
How long have you been here?

524
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,680
I can't rightly remember

525
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,920
a lot. I don't know how old I am,

526
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,080
lost track of time.

527
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,480
I wish I could tell you

528
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,460
how long ago I lost track of time.

529
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,080
Don't mean much

530
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,880
to me no more.

531
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,000
Time, time, time,

532
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,900
looking to possibility.

533
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,920
That's a song, isn't it?

534
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,400
What would you call this, day or night,

535
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,280
Dave? The stars are shining

536
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,700
like suns.

537
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,180
Day and night at one time, it's black

538
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,640
and white. Black and bright.

539
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,820
Black and bright, yeah.

540
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,600
Hey,

541
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,220
I got an idea.

542
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,140
I got a chicken sandwich in my

543
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,160
pocket. Maybe we could

544
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,260
do more performance art like we did

545
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,700
the last 2,000 years

546
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,960
and make a bowel movement.

547
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,640
We could take

548
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,340
go down the gastrointestinal

549
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,320
tank all the

550
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,360
way to the stomach.

551
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,120
Dave, they removed

552
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,260
your bowels and your legs a long

553
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,240
time ago. You don't need legs and

554
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,220
bowels out here in space.

555
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,740
I got no bowels,

556
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,320
legs. Take a look down, Bubba.

557
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,960
How we did it for

558
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,940
four days to be.

559
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,520
That poor senile

560
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,040
old bastard forgets.

561
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,380
You can't walk either.

562
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,500
You don't got them either.

563
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,040
Tell me about it.

564
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,120
I never saw you before in my life.

565
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,680
Who are you?

566
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,780
Oh, I remember.

567
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,100
It's time for your medication, boys.

568
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,840
It's the new nurse.

569
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,420
Here, help me ride.

570
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,560
Here's your pill.

571
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,820
Please, honey.

572
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,600
I'm having slices right now.

573
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
And a sentence?

574
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,620
Oh, even mandibles.

575
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,480
You're gonna stick it right in here with the mandibles,

576
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,340
you cutie pie.

577
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:43,900
Can I have more of those?

578
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,400
Can I have more of them?

579
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:50,820
Can I have more of them purple ones?

580
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,360
You and the purples.

581
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,800
Lay off and you're gonna lose all your hair like me.

582
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,120
Hey, sweetie. You married? Hey, honey.

583
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,680
Hey, hey. Hey, nursing.

584
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,680
You took the wrong one, Stanky.

585
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,740
You took a yellow one you were supposed to take

586
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,640
to that, and now you're gonna hallucinate.

587
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,960
And then freely and peely in the, uh, what was it?

588
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,440
In this vitamin.

589
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,200
It's time now, boys, to pee deeply into the bag.

590
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,480
Oh, boy, that's my favorite part.

591
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,120
Me too.

592
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,820
It's a new nurse every day.

593
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,540
Thousands and thousands of...

594
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,940
She gets to watch me pee deeply into the bag.

595
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,480
The bag?

596
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,120
Oh.

597
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,540
This bag goes on for thousands of miles.

598
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,360
They say it's connected to a cyclotron accelerator.

599
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,940
I like this part where I have to unclutch my little tears.

600
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,960
Go right ahead.

601
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,280
Okay.

602
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,440
I remember when I used to pee out of the...

603
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:36,840
Where's my spuds?

604
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,000
I lost it!

605
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:38,540
What?

606
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,360
Hey, hey.

607
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,900
Nurse, do something with it.

608
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,340
Where's my...

609
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:41,940
Where's my...

610
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,300
You know what?

611
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,240
Give him his yellow pill.

612
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,940
Where's my tank?

613
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,420
He does this every day.

614
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,380
It's all right.

615
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,460
It's really all right.

616
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,940
I think my head was turned around.

617
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,340
I was looking at my butt.

618
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,480
I wonder if my kids will ever come visit me out here.

619
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,540
Stank.

620
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,640
I wonder if they just put us in orbit for good.

621
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,760
Dig it up.

622
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,260
Living off our own...

623
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,220
Drinking our own pee for free cycle.

624
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:02,560
We're silly fools.

625
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,600
Pee pee for water.

626
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,260
Give it up.

627
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:04,260


628
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,020
We're little robot nurses that don't even really exist.

629
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,500
Giving us pills.

630
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,140
It's not bad, actually.

631
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,000
It's my idea.

632
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,660
When I was a teenager, that's all I ever wanted to do.

633
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,780
Well, here it goes again.

634
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,100
No, I can't do nothing else.

635
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,720
I hate it.

636
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,680
I'd do anything to go for a walk in the park, on Earth, feel gravity.

637
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,580
But I understand it would crush my old bones at this point.

638
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,980
Oh, I think I already said that earlier.

639
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,440
Where Dan...

640
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,520
Speaking of...

641
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,680
Yeah, he's getting old as hell.

642
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,640
Speaking of forestry...

643
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,580
Wanna go for a ride?

644
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,420
Stanky, look, I've got a...

645
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,560
What are they...

646
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,540
I got a boner.

647
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,540
What?

648
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,700
I think it's from the gravity accelerator.

649
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,840
I think it's making...

650
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,140
That's that little feeding tube.

651
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:48,820
That ain't...

652
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,640
You ain't had a big thing to have a boner with for 150 years, Dave.

653
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,060
No.

654
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,240
That's just your little excretion tube.

655
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,420
Your colostomy bag just got filled up.

656
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,440
Call that nurse to empty it.

657
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,500
Nurse!

658
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:03,800
Nurse!

659
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,260
Nurse!

660
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


661
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


662
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


663
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


664
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


665
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


666
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


667
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


668
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


669
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


670
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


671
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


672
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,260


673
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,500
Come here and take care of Dave.

674
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,300
I made a mistake, man.

675
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,020
God off the man.

676
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,440
Horrible.

677
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,900
The gravity in here just...

678
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,800
The gravity in here just...

679
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,040
It needs fixing.

680
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,300
It needs fixing.

681
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:12,700
What's happened?

682
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,080
He's mutated.

683
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,180
He's developed himself a new organ.

684
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,460
He thinks he's...

685
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,040
Have a seat, sir.

686
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,240
Look, Stanky.

687
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,640
He's been smoking the rhino cigarettes.

688
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,200
Doctor, look.

689
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,240
Stanky, look.

690
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,640
It's a real...

691
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,280
Oh, my God.

692
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,760
It is real.

693
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,140
Look, Doctor, look.

694
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,480
Just like when I was a boy.

695
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,720
He's grown himself a new organ.

696
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,560
How did this happen?

697
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,700
What's the explanation, Doctor?

698
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,020
Those rhino horn cigarettes must work.

699
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,260
I don't know.

700
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:34,260


701
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,620
It's the Bobcob.

702
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,020
Who's got the lighter?

703
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,940
The Goblin Goblin God from the Bobcob.

704
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,720
Give me one of them cigarettes, Dave.

705
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,480
I want to grow one of them.

706
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,720
I used to have dozens of them things.

707
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,100
Stank, we don't have lungs.

708
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,420
Remember, we can't smoke.

709
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,380
How we gonna get the...

710
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,600
How did we?

711
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,820
Now, we put it in here, I think.

712
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:54,820
No?

713
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,660
Maybe we put it in here.

714
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,820
Dave, just shove it in that hole in your chest.

715
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,640
What are some of these holes?

716
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:00,980
Is this...

717
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,060
In my heart?

718
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,240
No.

719
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,240


720
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,240


721
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,240


722
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,240


723
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,240


724
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,240


725
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,240


726
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,240


727
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,240


728
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,240


729
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,240


730
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,240


731
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,500
I think starting to melt around the edges a little bit, Stanky.

732
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,400
That was the yellow pill, Dave.

733
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,080
Just lean back and enjoy it.

734
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
It's like the weather.

735
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,480
It's like rape.

736
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,340
Ha ha, that's a joke.

737
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,740
What if we were...

738
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,780
I could have been governor if I hadn't have told that joke that one time in front of the

739
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,380
press corps.

740
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,520
Stank, you were the governor.

741
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,180
You were the governor of the entire rocket ship.

742
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,400
I was the governor?

743
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,220
You were king of the planet and you were emperor of space, remember?

744
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,240
I was the...

745
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,240


746
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,240


747
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,240


748
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,240


749
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,240


750
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,240


751
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,240


752
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,240


753
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,240


754
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,240


755
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,780
I was king of the hill there.

756
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,800
I was the damn top...

757
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,200
And queen.

758
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,980
You were so pretty in the suit and the hat and the pants and everything with the long,

759
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,220
long hair and the weird eye-bomb face.

760
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,740
I was the little tin pot dictator I was.

761
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,680
Thought I was chosen by mob.

762
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,940
Yeah, chosen.

763
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,760
All right, chosen me as fall guy.

764
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,060
Now, here I am...

765
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,640
I'm gonna stop.

766
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,480
As far as I can tell, the damn things are starting to accrue consciousness.

767
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,600
Go figure.

768
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,800
Yeah, yeah.

769
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,160
What do you mean accrue consciousness?

770
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,240
There's no way these things could make you feel better.

771
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,240


772
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,240


773
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,240


774
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,240


775
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,240


776
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,240


777
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,240


778
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,240


779
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
They're just a machine.

780
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,020
It's a machine, man.

781
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,720
Listen, you start talking that talk to me again.

782
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,820
You're my understudy.

783
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,920
You understand what I'm saying?

784
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,980
We talk alike.

785
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,800
We look alike.

786
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,540
We act alike.

787
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,760
Only you're the junior.

788
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,960
You do as I say.

789
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,540
Now, put your hand up over the box.

790
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,520
Yeah, I left my name and number yesterday.

791
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:32,920
So anyway, I had my legal notice in the newspaper for a grant and I thought I had my hearings

792
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,960
in the 70s.

793
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,620
I have another legal notice.

794
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,740
Some cop was playing with my brother and I.

795
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,960
We have repeated stories.

796
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,320
They disbored us at the source.

797
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,860
They registered us to 3%.

798
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,280
We're entitled to agricultural grade, minimum of 25, or you need 25 or 30%.

799
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,160
His minimum, I'm also entitled to 99, pain reliever.

800
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,960
Then there's a story some cop's been playing with me in the charts, not letting me release

801
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,220
my stress on a daily basis.

802
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,620
I got backed up stress just to tease me for when I get my pain reliever.

803
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,760
Then I have my degree tree stolen in the 60s.

804
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,900
It's in my hearings and a house of evolutionary study.

805
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,300
I have one of the best trees going in the board of education.

806
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,460
The Euclid's responsible.

807
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,340
I got permission to search the board.

808
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,360
Let me just ask you this one last question.

809
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,220
Do you think that it's rather curious that you're not a lawyer?

810
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,220


811
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,220


812
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,220


813
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,220


814
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,220


815
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,220


816
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,220


817
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,220


818
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,220


819
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:41,560
You were a witness to the assassination from a roof of a building overlooking Dealey Plaza.

820
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,220
You gave your statement to the Dallas Sheriff's Department the very day of the assassination,

821
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,600
and yet the commission, which was investigating the circumstances of the crime, never bothered

822
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,800
to call you as a witness to testify before them.

823
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,520
I can't answer that, sir.

824
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:04,200
Of course, I think I've seen this about as many times.

825
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,200


826
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,200


827
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,200


828
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,140
I've seen as much of the assassination as anyone around this area.

829
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,520
But as to why I wasn't called as a witness, that's beyond me.

830
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,780
But it doesn't make me any different.

831
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,740
On November 22nd, Mr. Dodd, what did you see and what did you hear?

832
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:31,260
Well, I seen the president roll over and slump over in his seat, and then I saw Governor Conley slump over.

833
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,180
He was a little accordion player in his little club.

834
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:34,180


835
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,920
He was a little robot monkey.

836
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:40,800
That's not strictly accordion to Hoyle, Gary, because you know monkeys aren't permitted to hear in this airless room.

837
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,840
Boy, I think I'll get some of these foreign girls pregnant right now.

838
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,560
How can you do that without a little raincoat on your speculum there?

839
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,100
Oh, wait a minute.

840
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,420
I, uh, these excavations...

841
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,140
Bring their families back to California.

842
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,140
Well, I will as soon as I finish excavating this extraordinary ruin.

843
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,280
Apparently the tomb of some famous person.

844
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,900
Yes, the tomb of the uncircumcised soldier.

845
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,440
Oh, boy, look at that. It's a mess.

846
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,440
Well, yes, but they bred like rabbits and multiplied like a bug bunny back there.

847
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,940
Hmm.

848
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,480
Here we are.

849
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,060
It's scary here. The moon and the war.

850
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:17,900
Operation...

851
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,740
We're not even scheduled.

852
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,400
It's the target city of all target cities.

853
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,240
The mommy of all wars.

854
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:25,820
Mommy!

855
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,300
Mommy, I had a war.

856
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,340
This isn't even enough.

857
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,700
We interrupt our regular programming for this news bulletin.

858
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,080
Apparently Saddam Hussein is about to give his address.

859
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,520
1452 Desert Lane, apartment 3, Iraq.

860
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

861
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,960
I don't think he's ever understood any of this stuff.

862
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,320
Besides, all we gotta do is change the names around, do a search or a search.

863
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,580
We'll replace things on all the computers.

864
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,560
Change Bob to Satan.

865
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,740
It's all interchangeable.

866
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,880
You change Christian to queer, queer to Christian.

867
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,520
Jesus to Bob.

868
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,440
Or anything.

869
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,080
And they all still...

870
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,860
Or mostos to X-Day.

871
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,820
And you still get the same...

872
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,460
It all comes out in the end.

873
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,540
Every prediction I make will come true eventually.

874
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,900
And I predict that everyone here will die.

875
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,340
And if that's not true, God, strike me dead right this minute.

876
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,240
See, it's all real.

877
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,800
Cheap sleight of hand.

878
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,500
Too bad Magnus couldn't be here.

879
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,580
Because at least he had the kind of magic you could sink your teeth into.

880
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,660
As long as you weren't standing backstage.

881
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,440
No, actually, even then, that was the thing.

882
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,740
I was told that if you watched the Prestidigita...

883
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,020
If you watched magic from behind the magician,

884
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,540
you would see that it was all prestidigitation and careful training.

885
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,840
Well, I find that a lot more hard to believe than just making things appear out of thin air.

886
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,720
The stuff I've seen people do with their fingers and mind is...

887
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,180
That's magic to me.

888
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,320
I was the little tin pot dictator I was.

889
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,360
Thought I was chosen by Bob.

890
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,540
Yeah, chosen.

891
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,400
All right, chosen.

892
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,420
I was chosen to be this fall guy.

893
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,900
Now here I am stuck up here in this damn tin can with you.

894
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,820
And here I thought I was gonna be the big cult leader.

895
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:36,860
I'm nothing but an old, forgotten old, old exile out in space on the way down for Centauri.

896
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,540
Sting, wait.

897
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,340
I tortured you on the radio for years.

898
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,040
And it's ironic the way it ended up in reality like this.

899
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:49,580
Sting, the head plate is shifting from Miami Beach to West Virginia again.

900
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,200
What are you mumbling about now, you senile old...

901
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,180
Call that nurse.

902
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,700
Your anti-flagellant medicine.

903
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,360
Smells like a hospital in here.

904
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,660
Smells like a hospital across from the kindergarten.

905
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,260
I'm drooling over.

906
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,740
I smell human urine.

907
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,920
It's disgusting.

908
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,760
Look, it works.

909
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,720
Why don't my kids ever come visit?

910
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:12,740
It works.

911
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,980
Why don't my hateful, useless kids ever come visit me up here?

912
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,220
You sent me off for that.

913
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,060
The sub-demons is...

914
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,380
So that all the jewels...

915
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,540
Can just land on it.

916
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,000
Instead of being all over the place like this now.

917
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,220
At the height of his power, the Reverend Nighting Stan controlled a vast empire.

918
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,760
Consisting of thousands of Malaysian slaves in the tiny village of Dobstown.

919
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:45,100
A micro-fortress of sorts, a techno-village surrounded by walls of invisible gas.

920
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,180
I loved stuffing that damn wall with gas back then.

921
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,380
As he receded into obscurity...

922
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,220
Well, I'd do anything for a Merit ultralight.

923
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,460
As his limbs became timeless.

924
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,160
As he drifted from this world into old age.

925
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,100
As Stan drifted further into...

926
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:07,940
Simility.

927
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,500
I vaguely remember...

928
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,660
Deciding I wanted to live to be 90.

929
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,140
My God, I wished I could have died at 250.

930
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,520
Here I am, just spinning on...

931
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,260
How far are we from Alpha Centauri, Dave?

932
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,760
There is a lonesome cowboy Dave to see you, Reverend Stan.

933
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,340
And when is there not?

934
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,020
Hey, buddy!

935
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,900
Oh my God!

936
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,820
It's the young ghost of cowboy Dave Past!

937
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,660
No, no, man, it's me!

938
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,240
It's the real lonesome cowboy Dave.

939
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,140
I done took the treatments.

940
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,540
Hey, who's the old guy you're babbling to?

941
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,100
Dave, what? Look, look!

942
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,320
I sure don't even breathe, man.

943
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,040
Hey, listen to me.

944
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,600
What now?

945
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,240
Oh my God, he's dead!

946
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,640
What, you killed him?

947
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,900
You young Dave, you killed the old Dave!

948
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,040
No, he's not dead!

949
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,240
He looks like he's been dead for years.

950
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,780
You've been talking to a dead man for about five years now.

951
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,560
He and I have been having sex together for the last hundred years.

952
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,760
It's all we had.

953
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,440
Calm down.

954
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,420
Calm down, you little geezer.

955
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,080
Wait a minute.

956
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,660
Come on, little fella.

957
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,480
You're kind of cute.

958
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,480
You look smoother looking than that old buzzard.

959
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,060
Yeah, yeah.

960
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:12,900
Save!

961
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,600
I took the treatments, Stan.

962
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,180
You're the old Dave.

963
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,080
Stan, I didn't know you was twisted that way.

964
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,500
Now, you just calm down, little fella.

965
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:19,660
I think I can tell.

966
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,620
I've been out in space for 300 years now.

967
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:22,620


968
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,140
I didn't die on something like that.

969
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,420
Come on, let me show you around the room here.

970
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:26,440
Hey, hey, old buddy.

971
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:26,540
Hey, Pop.

972
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,540
Come on, calm down.

973
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,220
You don't mean to tell me them beautiful nurses, them cyber nurses walking around taking care

974
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,200
of your every wish and command ain't enough for you?

975
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,740
No, they won't even let me fart.

976
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,800
Every time I lean over, they're setting me back up again.

977
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,800
Stan, I can't believe you aren't allowed to flatulate.

978
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,520
That's one of the things you've done best of all.

979
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,520
They won't let you pee.

980
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,460
Those nurses not only ain't real, but they won't let you pee.

981
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,600
They pee freely anywhere except in that bag.

982
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,600
Oh, yeah.

983
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,520
The bag.

984
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:53,980
Yeah, well.

985
00:38:54,100 --> 00:39:00,100
Speaking of bags, say, you cute young Stan, look in my bag here.

986
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
Oh, my gosh, Stan.

987
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,480
What the hell is that?

988
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,200
It looks like a...

989
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,040
Well, it's where my lower torso used to...

990
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,880
That's where all my lower half used to be was in that bag.

991
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,840
It looks like a smoky or slim gym.

992
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,140
What the hell happened to you, bro?

993
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,540
Does it work at all?

994
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,240
What do you mean work?

995
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,860
I mean, can you rotate through it or have sensors on his arms?

996
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,140
It's good.

997
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,260
Nothing but a plug now.

998
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,200
Now, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

999
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,480
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1000
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,480


1001
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,480


1002
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,480


1003
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,480


1004
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,960
Nothing but a plug.

1005
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,780
Oh, nothing but a plug.

1006
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,300
What have we been listening to, friends?

1007
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:36,960
Of course, that was Einstein's Secret Orchestra recorded in the studio, the swamp studio.

1008
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:45,340
The senile, old, lonesome cowboy Dave and poor Reverend Stang in their tuna can in

1009
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,060
outer space on the way to Alpha Centauri.

1010
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,600
It's the first time the old Stang ever came out.

1011
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1012
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1013
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1014
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1015
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1016
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1017
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1018
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1019
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1020
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1021
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1022
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1023
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1024
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1025
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1026
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,600


1027
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,600
It's the first time the old Stang ever got stuck there like that.

1028
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,540
Oh, gosh.

1029
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,620
How can I go backwards on this list here?

1030
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:07,620
We had a little bit of recording from the Winter Star, the subgenius D-Vival with Chaz

1031
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,640
and me preaching and yanking on them keyboards.

1032
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,920
Bleepo Abernathy and Billy West with Saddam's Address.

1033
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:22,040
We've heard a lot of the subgenius show, the old subgenius show on KPFA.

1034
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,580
Oh, yeah.

1035
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,800
In Berkeley with the Tomb of the Uncircumcised Soldier.

1036
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,060
That's mostly, almost all that we've heard has been Gary Gabrog, friend, and Dr. Howell.

1037
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:39,140
The JFK-related stuff was collaged by Reverend Susie the Floozy.

1038
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:47,280
And of course, we've heard a lot of mental or manic depression from various characters

1039
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,400
such as the legal notice guy.

1040
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,360
He comes from a tape.

1041
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,400
That Jesus, well, it was the answer machine.

1042
00:40:54,580 --> 00:41:01,860
It was left on the answer machine, 90 minutes of it, on the answer machine at the Hemp Store

1043
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,040
in Cleveland where Jesus used to work.

1044
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,840
Pee Deeply Into the Bag is the name of the skit there from Einstein's Secret Orchestra

1045
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,080
and us in the live studio.

1046
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,760
We also heard the great kook Dan Ashwander.

1047
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,340
Much of that material is in the tape.

1048
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,300
We've heard a lot of the material taken off of the Hour of Slack number 272, which came

1049
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:31,960
from Ken DeVries, Orton Nenslow, and Donna Cossie collected the kook ramblings of the

1050
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,240
angel telepathy material of Dan Ashwander, the old crackpot there.

1051
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,560
We heard a little bit of Bill Hicks talking about JFK.

1052
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,780
And well, I think that's been somewhere.

1053
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,500
Now we come back into current time.

1054
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,400
Into the...

1055
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,080
Small time.

1056
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,300
We've been in the big time.

1057
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,340
No, no, we've been in the small time.

1058
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,640
Now we're about to go back into the big time.

1059
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,860
I'm sorry, I get confused.

1060
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,600
You know, I don't really have a real radio station anymore.

1061
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,660
All we have is this treehouse.

1062
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,160
Tarzan's radio station, we call it.

1063
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,320
But we do have Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1064
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,320
Tarzan, Einstein, and Bob all hanging or swinging from the treehouse.

1065
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:21,320


1066
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,600
In the trees eating ham sandwiches.

1067
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,680
Uh, eating spam sandwiches.

1068
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,240
Christ, Bob.

1069
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,100
Hello, you're on the air.

1070
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,260
The show's back.

1071
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,080
All right.

1072
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,320
I'm sorry.

1073
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320


1074
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320


1075
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320


1076
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320


1077
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320


1078
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320


1079
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320


1080
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320


1081
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320


1082
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,180
I made your make-up.

1083
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:52,360
Almost.

1084
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,340
Put some beef in, when a man...

1085
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,080
Just a wee broth of a color.

1086
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,400
I don't say anything too funny.

1087
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,480
Well, I don't know why not.

1088
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,040
After all...

1089
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,800
Yeah.

1090
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,660
earth and the world teetering on the edge of nuclear annihilation.

1091
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,760
Oh, come on.

1092
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,660
It's not that bad.

1093
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,100
Well, it's not really that bad.

1094
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,580
It is.

1095
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,060
Oh, yes.

1096
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,420
It's just about to happen.

1097
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,560
No, you don't realize.

1098
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:11,720
You think so?

1099
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:11,980
Yeah, we're all doomed.

1100
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,660
Yeah, it's all about to happen.

1101
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,400
I'll tell you, if Saddam Hussein flips through his arsenal the way you're flipping through

1102
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,780
this magazine, we're all in trouble.

1103
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,380
He's got a sharper image catalog that he's...

1104
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,480
Yeah, it's...

1105
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,360
Oh, it's not that much showing.

1106
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,160
Cut it out.

1107
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,380
Over there.

1108
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,200
Oh, wow.

1109
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,120
I think Gary got it.

1110
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:29,440
Ouch.

1111
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,920
That really hurt.

1112
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,780
Can somebody get me one of those...

1113
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,060
Here on issue...

1114
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,640
One of those...

1115
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,540
I can't say it.

1116
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,960
Biomechanical arms over there, and I'll put it on...

1117
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:47,200
They're called Waldos, Waldo, but on this issue, I'd like to say that it shocks and

1118
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,360
concerns me.

1119
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:56,540
Our servicemen over there are plain people that are lingering in desert memories, etched

1120
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,000
in sand.

1121
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:03,160
You can see how quiet it is when I'm not using my electronic stethoscope to bring in the

1122
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:09,320
loud noise from these computers and satellite transmissions from outer space and from Earth.

1123
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,680
And Russia and the United States torture my God from out of my body.

1124
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,520
It's real quiet, Dad.

1125
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,760
I'll let you...

1126
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,560
I'll leave it...

1127
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,480
I won't say anything.

1128
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,560
I'll let you listen to it now.

1129
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,780
I heard you guys...

1130
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,580
I just want to do a become plain clothes subgenius in the...

1131
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,340
Get out of your uniform.

1132
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,260
So I wear plain clothes.

1133
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:32,940
So what?

1134
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,360
I make a fashion statement.

1135
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,500
Well, I'm wearing airplane clothes myself right now.

1136
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,580
We'll all be wearing airplane clothes in the future.

1137
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,260
You can see the wings right along the elbows.

1138
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,760
It'll be the only way to travel because it's government regulated.

1139
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,000
The hands only have four amounts of...

1140
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,020
The shoes are the landing gear.

1141
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:51,180
Every citizen will have to be checked in 19 security checks from his door to the airport.

1142
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,880
Good morning, ugly sedan!

1143
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,560
Um, yeah, the American Armed Forces are here.

1144
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,140
And this war has become radioactive, if you know what I mean.

1145
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:11,520
Oh, yeah, we got an oil barrel full of stupid song parodies sent to us by every goofball radio station back in the good old United States.

1146
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,080
Oh, we've got knock, knock, knocking on Saddam's door.

1147
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,660
Knock, knock, knocking on Saddam's door.

1148
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,420
Ooh, how about this one?

1149
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,540
Sweating in the desert.

1150
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,100
Waiting to kill Hussein.

1151
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,640
Yeah!

1152
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:30,220
It's up to us, the disc jockeys, to win this war with dumb songs.

1153
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,320
Hell, we got a president up in Maine going,

1154
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,600
No wonder I'm not catching any fish.

1155
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,220
This is a golf club, Barbara.

1156
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,420
Oh, and this is my favorite song right here, Bomber Rack.

1157
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,880
Bomber Rack!

1158
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,940
You must know what a ride!

1159
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,160
Oh, and don't forget, who'll stop Hussein?

1160
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,540
Who'll stop Hussein?

1161
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:56,760
He's a man.

1162
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,680
Yeah, that one was sent to us by four different radio stations at the same time, claiming they were the first ones to do it.

1163
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,420
Ah, ah, ah, ah, we're Americans.

1164
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,680
We've got ingenuity.

1165
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,660
Yeah, let's bomb Iraq, all right, with dumb songs.

1166
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,300
So, in the words of Casey Kasem, hey, wait a minute, I'm an Arab.

1167
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,920
Until next time, good morning, ugly Saddam!

1168
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:25,900
Oh, by the way, Dr. Drummond, I did what you prescribed and, uh, have been drinking it.

1169
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:30,220
I'm gonna have to get a couple more cups of that blood to fend off the spasms.

1170
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,000
Although, uh, it certainly is expensive, especially now.

1171
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,600
I had to trade a tank of gas to get this, this, these five cups of blood.

1172
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:50,280
KPFA, when I came into the station this morning, nobody handed me the instruction, uh, sheet on how I'm supposed to, um,

1173
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,400
Oh, this, this is, this is my opinion.

1174
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,860
Yeah, this is my personal opinion.

1175
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:55,880
Not all people can do anything.

1176
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:55,880


1177
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:55,880


1178
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:55,880


1179
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:55,880


1180
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:55,880


1181
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:55,880


1182
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:55,880


1183
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:55,880


1184
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:55,880


1185
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:55,880


1186
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:55,880


1187
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:56,780
All right, if you...

1188
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:04,880
Written right down here exactly what my opinion is supposed to be concerning the, um, the demonstrators and, um...

1189
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,600
Those demonstrators have to be taken out and horse-whipped.

1190
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,280
Automatic car watch.

1191
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:17,120
Now, we don't want the, uh, subscribers to think that they necessarily would be forced into, uh, thinking the way KPFA thinks.

1192
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,060
They can't think.

1193
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,000
We will be...

1194
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,880
But, uh, we've learned that both, uh, subscribers and people who work in the, in the station creep into clothing and, uh, wear clothes.

1195
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:25,880


1196
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,300
And, uh, they can't even choose and that they can survive by eating kangaroo rats and lizards.

1197
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,740
But I don't know what you're talking about.

1198
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,700
But as usual, you will have to decode the show.

1199
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:41,900
Well, the lessons learned from the subgenius show training exercises over the years include the fact that the station is death on tires.

1200
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:51,160
The recurring problem is that there is no institutional memory by KFP, KPFA troops today of what it is like in the station.

1201
00:47:51,160 --> 00:48:03,700
The comforting thought is that the subgeniuses, the so-called Jones people from the watery confluence of the Mendocino coast will find KPFA just as stark and unforgiving as the Americans do.

1202
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,660
Thank you.

1203
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:10,860
That was a hard-hitting editorial from the huge object, the boyfriend, in our studio tonight.

1204
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,200
It's just the show.

1205
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,980
Filling in the dead time.

1206
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,040
While Baghdad prepares for yet another...

1207
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,020
Oops, there it comes through the window and there's another big ouch.

1208
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:21,140
Oh, no.

1209
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,200
Believe me, I've heard those.

1210
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:22,440
Four ouches.

1211
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,640
We are on a secret mission for the Caliph of Baghdad.

1212
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,420
I've got to find somebody.

1213
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,040
I've got to find somebody.

1214
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,660
Oh, no.

1215
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,420
I thought it was the cauliflower of Baghdad.

1216
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,120
Oh, no.

1217
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:09,160
I thought it was the cauliflower of Baghdad.

1218
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,500
Oh, no.

1219
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,560
I thought it was the cauliflower of Baghdad.

1220
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,760
I've got to find there.

1221
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:32,780


1222
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,720
I'm serious.

1223
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,520
Where did you get it?

1224
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,160
Aşamay.

1225
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,380
Katharine impossible on campus.

1226
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,140
I know.

1227
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:39,140


1228
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:39,140


1229
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:39,140


1230
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:39,140


1231
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:39,260
Come on, home, Home-게요, I'm here for you.

1232
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:39,260


1233
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:39,460
Here's a photograph of my family.

1234
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,080
My dad and also my toot 창, my step sister.

1235
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,540
For performs.

1236
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,980
Nastya and Halleen died five months with her grandfather.

1237
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,660
Most researchers have recognized sure his father was a refugee.

1238
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,600
Recently, his father became a gay.

1239
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:55,720
table with a masseuse over here. It has a barbed wire window outside. I do have some stale bread

1240
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:01,000
in one of them little holders. It looks like, I guess it's a guy in a sombrero or something like

1241
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,840
that. It looks pretty old. It's got a lot of like packing grease on it. And I think I'm supposed to

1242
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:12,900
eat these things here too. Be careful of the things that you eat, Dave. Well, they're woolly.

1243
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,220
I don't know if I should eat something that still has hair on it. They usually take the hair off.

1244
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:20,680
Is the hair moving? That's what I want to know. No, it's kind of wafting in the breeze though.

1245
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,520
It's moving, I think because of the convection near the furnace there. Usually when it's moving,

1246
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:31,280
it's not a good sign and it might be kind of a wise idea to just watch it on those things that

1247
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,480
have the moving hair. I mean, it's not just, it could be just moving its hair from the wind,

1248
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,660
you know, so I could eat it technically, right? You could, but you know, you might be taking a

1249
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:44,980
chance. Just think about it. Really think about it, Dave. Well, I'm not going to play harmonica

1250
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,200
with it. I think I'm just going to move it.

1251
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:52,760
Okay. That's a good idea. I'm not hungry anymore. Let's step into the chapel here, Dave.

1252
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,600
Well, I never noticed that we had a chapel. You guys have the same one I do?

1253
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:02,260
Big red door. It looks like one of them Chinese temples and stuff. You go in like a Kung Fu

1254
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:08,320
temple or something and it's got three steps. The chaplain has the most updated Pentium 666

1255
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,480
processor. I can't see nobody in here yet. There is a monitor.

1256
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,520
I can see you though.

1257
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,760
Well, I'm feeling a little bit more at peace with myself. They can't come in here, can they?

1258
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,460
Oh, sure. Anytime they want, but why would they? It smells awful in there.

1259
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,200
You are a good consumer.

1260
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,420
Breasts, breaths.

1261
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:35,500
Well, I think that's why we got the sanctuary in here right around the breasts and stuff is so we

1262
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:42,260
can come in and not get chomped. Think about where we've been and what we've done so far.

1263
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,640
What do you think?

1264
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,600
Well, we passed Ganymede.

1265
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,580
And we tried to make out with a pair of breasts with teeth.

1266
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,780
Consumption is being standardized.

1267
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,260
Now the rectum reappears trying to tell me I should consume more stuff.

1268
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,700
Let's see. I don't know.

1269
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,100
Please refrain from speaking about the rectum.

1270
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:06,960
Look.

1271
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,160
Little teeny dancing maidens coming out from behind the furniture parlor.

1272
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,420
Those are the go-go termites.

1273
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,060
Watch out.

1274
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,000
For the mandibles.

1275
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:17,940
Go, go, go termites.

1276
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,140
Look a little closer.

1277
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,180
Go, go, termites.

1278
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,140
I have some good moves, but...

1279
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,280
Yeah.

1280
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,160
Look at this.

1281
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,780
Everything sexy around here bites you.

1282
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,180
This is kind of like an anti-sex hell world.

1283
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,800
Oh, oh, you notice all...

1284
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,980
Well, an anti-sex hell world.

1285
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,740
How about that?

1286
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,140
Well, he...

1287
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,800
Gosh, I wonder how that could have happened.

1288
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,260
His perceptiveness pill is kicking in.

1289
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,660
Yeah, remember Hogan's goat, Dave?

1290
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,300
No, he probably doesn't.

1291
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,560
Oh, my God, Hogan's goat.

1292
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,860
What does that ring a bell from?

1293
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,120
Well, he screwed up.

1294
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,940
I was a panacea rose back in the ancient days of Greece, and I used to wear one of them

1295
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,780
funny hats and curly horns on my head and I used to...

1296
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,160
Your name was Wabango.

1297
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,320
I was a goat.

1298
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:58,860
That's right.

1299
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,100
I was Wabango a goat.

1300
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,980
And I was compromised.

1301
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,720
I think it was somewhere like...

1302
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:09,900
But eventually you did evolve into the Wabango bonobo.

1303
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,860
This is worse than the bad Le Parrain novel.

1304
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,640
I can't figure half of this stuff out without looking at the paper.

1305
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,460
Running around with your erected self, flashing it in front of every other Wabango bonobo you

1306
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,000
could find.

1307
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,340
And other species waving it in their faces.

1308
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,300
Including humans.

1309
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,640
Foddering the lonesome cowboy Dave Rice.

1310
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,260
Reigning over the lonesome cowboy empire.

1311
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:44,300
A short-lived empire since most of them were homosexuals who did not reproduce.

1312
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:44,620
I'm sorry.

1313
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:44,620


1314
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,100
I'm sorry.

1315
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,640
Sitting at the head of the lonesome cowboy round table.

1316
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:55,000
They had great fun rotting there in the fields in their goatish, swinish way.

1317
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:55,900
What is the law?

1318
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,360
Whatever happened to that bug woman you had, Guinevere?

1319
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,460
She died so long ago.

1320
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,580
I was on a caravan in those days.

1321
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,320
I was a happy troubadour with a gang of baboons.

1322
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,700
We used to sing cowboy tunes.

1323
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:13,400
And one day we rolled into a town, I guess it was one of them middle ages vacuum empires,

1324
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,700
which you got over on the other solar side of the system.

1325
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:21,060
And next thing I knew, these guys were trying to like get into a sword fight with us.

1326
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,860
He definitely didn't have his shots.

1327
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,820
We were just too long for the ride.

1328
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,820
And of course, most of us not only didn't have our shots, we had been repulsive for

1329
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,700
long enough that they just kept us under the net.

1330
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,360
And sometimes they'd throw fish to us, but most of the time they wouldn't even talk to

1331
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:34,540
us.

1332
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,020
And next thing you know, here we are in a great traditional vacuum cleaning house, you

1333
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:39,440
know what I'm thinking?

1334
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,380
With people standing around asking us if we want to actually come in and do something.

1335
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:43,380


1336
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:43,400
And we're like, no, we're not going to do anything.

1337
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,820
We're going to go inside and take the final, final test.

1338
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,000
To come is to believe.

1339
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,720
I never thought that all I have to do is just like press my fingers together and push them

1340
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,060
against my nostrils like so.

1341
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:01,340
And push up on that area between my eyes and I could see everything so clearly.

1342
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,300
It is a form of prayer, you know.

1343
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,800
It's a form of getting yourself right with the powers of being.

1344
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,880
It's a form of mental masturbation, Dave.

1345
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,600
Grow up.

1346
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:12,900
Dave.

1347
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,880
Shave your palm.

1348
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,260
My God.

1349
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:18,380
Dave, what day this weekend are you going to come and get yourself right with the powers

1350
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:18,740
that be?

1351
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,000
The day of Kronos.

1352
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,680
Let us know which day.

1353
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,880
On the day of Saturn.

1354
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,240
Saturn.

1355
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,280
When it looks used to.

1356
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,140
Oh, Dave.

1357
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,520
It's so, you know, just getting Dave to say Saturday is so tough.

1358
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:37,380
But friends, quickly, the post office box for information on Church of the Subgenius, of

1359
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,820
course, is post office.

1360
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,500
Just write to Bob, friends.

1361
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:41,860
At the post office.

1362
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:48,800
At the post office box, 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1363
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:58,400
That's box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1364
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:04,220
And that's, of course, www.subgenius.com.

1365
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:09,820
And you can look for Book of the Subgenius or Revelation X in better bookstores.

1366
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,540
And Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1367
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:18,540
The secret orchestra is post office box 81555, Cleveland, Ohio.

1368
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,300
Again, that's P.O.

1369
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:26,540
Box 81555, Cleveland, Ohio, 44181.

1370
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,700
44181, Einstein's Secret Orchestra and the Church of the Subgenius.

1371
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,280
And it just never.

1372
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,640
Oh, it does stop.

1373
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,500
I guess it does.

1374
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,820
It does finally.

1375
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,040
It does finally.

1376
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,520
It does finally.

1377
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:41,520


1378
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:41,520


1379
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:43,100
Finally.

1380
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:43,400
Finally.

1381
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:43,700
Stop.

1382
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:44,400
Where?

1383
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:44,860
What?

1384
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,140
What?

1385
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:45,820
What was it?

1386
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,080
Oh, this.

1387
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,140
That's right.

1388
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,740
This guy that hates staying.

1389
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:56,620
Because somebody's going to have to get that evil potentate in Dallas off the air.

1390
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:56,800
Too much.

1391
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,460
Yeah, I don't know either.

1392
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:01,620
I don't really understand if he understands how much we understand.

1393
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,220
He's the Caliph of Dallas.

1394
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:07,360
We've got a lot of the California forces around Dallas.

1395
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,680
I don't know if he just quite understands exactly where he is.

1396
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,180
He's the Caliph of Dallas.

1397
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:11,500
He's the Caliph of Dallas.

1398
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:11,500


1399
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:11,500


1400
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:11,500


1401
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:11,500


1402
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:11,500


1403
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:11,500


1404
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:11,500


1405
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:11,500


1406
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:11,500


1407
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,500
You know, even if he does decide to cut him into Mexico or something, I think we'd only

1408
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:18,220
see the darnedest Church and Destroy mission that the Subgenius wouldn't ever see.

1409
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,180
Yes, what a Church and Destroy mission it was.

1410
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:20,440
Yeah, but no.

1411
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,300
I don't think mature audiences would go for it.

1412
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,160
No, he doesn't need any help.

1413
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:23,780
No, no.

1414
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,920
That kind of scenario really isn't going to carry through.

1415
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:26,220
...the final stage.

1416
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:26,640
...the final stage.

1417
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,060
Suggested for Victor Matur audiences only.

1418
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,320
Well, I think Einstein is well aware of that fact.

1419
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,820
and whether or not he cares about it or not.

1420
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:37,560
I think, actually, given the options that he does have before him,

1421
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,320
I suppose he may choose the marketing role.

1422
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,680
I suppose if you're going to be squashed like a bug,

1423
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:49,340
you might as well try to pick up a few sympathetic angles for history.

1424
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,460
Well, how sympathetic are bugs anyway?

1425
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,160
Yeah, really.

1426
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,000
The first unit fires when tested in a distant cave.

1427
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,480
This is the show that tries been sold.

1428
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,580
I don't know, but I think we better turn the plot around

1429
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,900
and see if we can draw this one accurately before we...

1430
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:15,140
Almost makes me sad sometimes.

1431
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,000
It's King Nenslow again.

1432
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,060
Till I open those letters and see all that green stuff.

1433
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,280
All those fat green bags that's rolling out.

1434
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,980
I know exactly what he knows.

1435
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,540
This is where I belong.

1436
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,000
That's why we don't worry about those.

1437
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,460
This is what I want.

1438
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,360
That's what I was called to do.

1439
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,240
Those geeks.

1440
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,880
Master Control reached down its...

1441
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,540
tendipods and handed me the shears and said,

1442
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,300
there is your flock, my son.

1443
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,180
Go to it!

1444
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,480
Yes, sir.

1445
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,440
And I'm doing it, too.

1446
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,640
Doing the best I can.

1447
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,400
Just going up there and clean them out.

1448
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,700
Empty their pockets.

1449
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,460
Give them a pat on the...

1450
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,340
and say, okay, go grow me some more.

1451
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,780
Yeah, well, it gives them...

1452
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:09,440
I feel that it really gives them a purpose.

1453
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,360
It gives them a feeling of accomplishment.

1454
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,260
To know that...

1455
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,860
to believe...

1456
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:18,520
to believe that they're helping out something important.

1457
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,740
Something bigger than they are.

1458
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:26,220
Face it, it's the only mark most of them are ever going to make in this world.

1459
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,460
It's the only thing...

1460
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,640
thing that they'll ever be part of other than...

1461
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,740
social security.

1462
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,560
Or paying their taxes or...

1463
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,400
or filling up a spot in the local cemetery.

1464
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,860
It's just like...

1465
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,480
moats of dust.

1466
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,940
Whirling in the sunlight.

1467
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,920
They're here for a moment and then they're gone.

1468
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,580
And we give them what little we can.

1469
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,440
And they give us...

1470
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,200
everything we can get.

1471
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,700
Oh, brother.

1472
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,180
What a life.

1473
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:09,940
What a life.

1474
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:17,380
Four billion worldwide population, all living, have a computer god containment policy brain bank brain.

1475
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,340
A real brain.

1476
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,020
In the brain bank cities on the far side of the moon we never see.

1477
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:28,420
Primarily based on your lifelong Frankenstein radio controls, especially your eyesight TV, sight and sound.

1478
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,440
Recorded by your brain, your moon brain of the computer god.

1479
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,820
Activates your brain.
