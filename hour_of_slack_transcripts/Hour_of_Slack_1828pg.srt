1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,060
Ah, yes, there.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,500
You see that coin?

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,440
That is insured for $10,000.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,100
See how it seems to gather the light and draw the eye?

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,020
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:26,700
I get great repose from these things of age and beauty.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,940
They soothe one and seem to induce sleep.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,060
Sleep.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,920
Close your eyes, my friend.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,060
Sleep.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,100
Sleep.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,260
Sleep.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,340
Hello, everybody.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,700
Look out!

15
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,580
Shut up!

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,420
Shut up!

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,760
Come in.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,440
Shut up!

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,220
$772,000.

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,920
Shut up!

21
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,200
$772,000.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,500
Shut up!

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:15,940
$341,000.

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,440
Shut up!

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:17,900
$341,000.

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,800
Shut your face!

27
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,300
Is that correct?

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,320
Yes, it is.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,240
$61,000.

30
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,020
Thank you.

31
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,640
Shut up!

32
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,900
That will be all for the present.

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,080
Very good.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,980
The Subgenius Powerhouse.

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,200
Watch.

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,580
Excellent.

37
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,480
And at the top of the show, we've got a very interesting guest to be sure.

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,080
Reverend Ivan Stang.

39
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,000
He's the founder of the Church of the Subgenius and the book,

40
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,660
The Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack, the Bobliagraphon.

41
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,280
That's right.

42
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,760
Stick around.

43
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,860
You're going to say, what?

44
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,480
Of course, the question is, who's Bob?

45
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,940
Well, Bob's an interesting guy.

46
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,100
He gets high on the real thing.

47
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,280
A full tank of gas and a clean windshield.

48
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,540
All righty then.

49
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,760
First off...

50
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,900
Worried about covering the lower half of your body?

51
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,360
Here's Bob One for A1 Slack.

52
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,080
Things go better with slacks and trousers.

53
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,620
Things go better with slacks.

54
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,000
Hi, this is Bob One.

55
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,980
And I wonder how many of our go-go-now-generation-action-man-on-compass realizes

56
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,360
how important it is to keep the lower half of your body covered

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,140
without disguising the fact that it is indeed the lower half of your body.

58
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,680
Well, there's nothing like a pair of trim-fitting A1 slacks.

59
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,660
They're better than skirts and a lot warmer, too.

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,060
Thank you, Bob.

61
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,500
You're welcome.

62
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,620
And now, back to our movie.

63
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,080
Looks like we're going to find more and we expect it.

64
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:42,880
Bob.

65
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,760
Bob.

66
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,460
Bob.

67
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:47,780
Bob.

68
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,380
Bob.

69
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:49,800
Bob.

70
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:51,920
Bob.

71
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,120
Bob.

72
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,620
Bob.

73
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,260
Bob.

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,720
Bob.

75
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,000
Bob.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,320
Bob.

77
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,400
Bob.

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,600
Bob.

79
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:54,620
Bob.

80
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:54,660
Bob.

81
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:54,960
Bob.

82
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:54,960


83
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,040
Bob.

84
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,340
Bob.

85
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,440
Bob.

86
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,120
Bob.

87
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,660
Bob.

88
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,300
Bob.

89
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,420
Bob.

90
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,200
Bob Mom.

91
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,160
Bob.

92
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


93
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


94
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


95
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


96
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


97
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


98
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


99
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


100
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


101
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


102
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


103
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


104
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,160


105
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,220
Babm!

106
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:09,760
Ba!

107
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:09,760


108
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,020
Ibam!

109
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,020


110
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,620
Ah!

111
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,020
Jizz!

112
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,260
But Terry Pratchett went first.

113
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,800
Thanks to Lee Murr for the song and intro,

114
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,120
Reverend Zontar for the ancient fire sign theater actual radio ad,

115
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,560
and Frankenstein1970 from 1959.

116
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,540
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1143,

117
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,960
a Bob Renewal reintroduction to that most important thing in the world,

118
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,220
for those who might have briefly forgotten.

119
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,460
The first in a series of shows using categorized bits of the recordings

120
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,580
from a dozen recent Lives of Genius outreach events,

121
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,860
hither and yon, which it has taken me many days to chop up.

122
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:18,400
Besides the collage work of Noor El-Pref, Lee Murr, and yours truly, Reverend Stang,

123
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,700
we'll also be hearing from the Winter Star Devival of March 1, 2008,

124
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,100
John Hell's show on Pirate Cat Radio from last December,

125
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,420
a puzzling evidence show from Berkeley on February 22,

126
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,720
and a radio synesthesia show from WCSB Cleveland on March 9,

127
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:49,000
and a Denver, Colorado talk show excerpted from Rick Barber's show on KOA Denver,

128
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,040
and also some real radio ads from the fire sign theater, more of those,

129
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
prompted by Zontar.

130
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:03,040
We're hearing Bonobo's Convergence in the background, recorded live last X-Day.

131
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,140
And I think that's all.

132
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,160
Oh, Bonobo's Convergence will be at next X-Day, Drew.

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,260
We've been on the road a lot, friends,

134
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,680
and I've just now chopped all this audio into millions of tiny bits.

135
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,940
And also tonight, I'm working in some audio swipe from a great movie called Slipstream,

136
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,160
directed by Anthony Hopkins,

137
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,660
which makes David Lynch look like Michael Bay.

138
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,220
And we even have some new songs.

139
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,140
And next week or two, it'll be all politics on the show, friends.

140
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,480
Yes, I'm afraid so.

141
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,880
So let's bask for now in pure, untainted bobbery, at least for this week,

142
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,740
starting with what the curious heard as they approached the giant subgenius circus tent

143
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,540
at Winter Star 2008.

144
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,900
Last March 1st.

145
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,240
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up.

146
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,240
Welcome to the subgenius medical curiosity show.

147
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,600
It's all real, all here, all alive.

148
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,340
And it's all on the inside.

149
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,360
See the smart boy who can't keep a job.

150
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,360
See the pretty girl who can't get a date.

151
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,700
Alive and on the inside.

152
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,940
We have diseases that are spread through sexual...

153
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,400
Congress.

154
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,280
We have debates settled by fisticuffs.

155
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,700
We have people famous for being famous.

156
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,000
And they're all inside.

157
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,900
Alive, alive, alive.

158
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,000
See grown men and women talk to an invisible monster that lives in the sky.

159
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,580
See your own body become ever more fragile before your very eyes.

160
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,900
Feel the horror as schools turn innocent children into innocent adults.

161
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,820
Listen to shock.

162
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,580
Listen to shocking tales wherein you pay to work.

163
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,240
They're all here on the inside.

164
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,100
We have pictures of a salesman who smokes a pipe.

165
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,400
What other religions charge all worldly goods for what we offer at a discounted and guaranteed low rate?

166
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,280
Eternal salvation or triple your money back?

167
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:22,160
Read words on a cathode ray tube and attend amateur religious satire performance art.

168
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,660
Get slacked and feel alive.

169
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,580
Alive on the inside.

170
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,560
Praise.

171
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:43,960
I wish I could say that I wrote that, but actually that was recorded outside a freak show by Dr. Onan Canobite.

172
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,400
I don't think they ought to live for that one.

173
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,180
Anyway, that's what happened on this date in history.

174
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,240
Well, we're going to talk about something that you may not know about.

175
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,840
And those of you who have heard of it, you might find this most interesting indeed.

176
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,120
The Church of the Subgenius, founded in 1953.

177
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:08,360
And although its current popularity is traced to the publication of Subgenius pamphlet number one in 1979,

178
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,240
it's found quite a bit of acceptance, especially in underground pop cult circles,

179
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,060
embraced on college campuses, in the underground music scene, on the Internet.

180
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,940
And because the tenets of discordianism, the Church of the Subgenius is often described,

181
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,800
as a syncretic offshoot of the belief.

182
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,360
However, members state that the organization developed on its own with the publication of Subgenius pamphlet number one,

183
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:38,300
also known as The World Ends Tomorrow and You May Die, by Reverend Ivan Stang, who is our guest.

184
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,500
And Reverend Stang, good morning.

185
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,540
Well, I praise Rick, praise Bob, and happy birthday, Dan Quayle.

186
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,980
Dan Quayle.

187
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,920
It's not true, but it's alleged that, of course, you know, he was head of the space program

188
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,220
during Daddy Boy.

189
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,940
Bush's era.

190
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,700
And there was...

191
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,220
Appropriate.

192
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,560
Yeah.

193
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,520
And there was...

194
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,800
And there was...

195
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,920
There was this...

196
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:10,900
This kind of this, you know, almost underground, shall we say, legend that Dan thought it would

197
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,440
be a good idea to send a mission to the sun, but because it was so hot, he thought we'd

198
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,060
do it at night.

199
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,640
There you go.

200
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:16,940
See?

201
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,900
And that's my kind of guy, you know?

202
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,100
All right, Dan.

203
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,420
We always considered him a sort of an honorary subgenius.

204
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,220
Well, he...

205
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,100
Even though he never officially joined up, he somehow...

206
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,780
He definitely was not a genius.

207
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,700
He certainly not.

208
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,240
So we knew that he would qualify for our august organization.

209
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,680
Indeed.

210
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,140
Tell us something about the Church of the Subgenius.

211
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,300
And by the way, who is Bob?

212
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:51,220
J.R. Bob Dobbs is our guru, and sort of, you might say, the god of the subgeniuses, and

213
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,960
of strippers, I'm told.

214
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,560
Cool.

215
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,220
Cool.

216
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,180
Yeah.

217
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:04,740
Bob, some of your listeners may be familiar with his face, which you see tattooed on kids

218
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,860
and spray-painted on cars and so forth.

219
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:14,380
He looks like the 1950s version of the all-around good-guy dad on sitcoms.

220
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,960
That's right.

221
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,740
And if you look at any old magazine, it'll be full of ads of these square-looking, happy

222
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,680
guys with pipes.

223
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,500
They're always smoking a pipe.

224
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:23,920
Right.

225
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,060
Laying in a hammock while somebody else mows the yard.

226
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,680
Right.

227
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:36,920
And we, my partner and I, Dr. Philo Drummond and I, had noticed that the same figure popped

228
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,120
up in all these old magazines and in old movies.

229
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,180
We thought, it must be the same guy.

230
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:52,320
And at that point, Bob revealed himself to us through weird coincidences and messages

231
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,080
and things.

232
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,340
Yeah.

233
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,060
And we went to the newspaper and we found out that not too many people have actually

234
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,260
met Bob in person and survived.

235
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,400
In other words, you cannot look upon the face of Bob.

236
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:09,360
Well, he's so lucky, I think he manages to avoid most of his followers without even trying

237
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,720
to.

238
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,280
I'm looking at the picture of the Kababala.

239
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,840
We owe a lot to other religions.

240
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,560
It's true that we...

241
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,800
When we were...

242
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,640
Trying to put the Church of the Subgenius structure together, we, as Bob directed us,

243
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,640
we studied all the great religions from Zoroastrianism all the way up to Scientology.

244
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,160
And we picked all the good parts, you know.

245
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,880
Yeah.

246
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,740
When you were a kid, you'd find your dad's secret stash of paperbacks and look for the

247
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,360
good parts.

248
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:43,880
Uh-huh.

249
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,960
That's what we did with our dad's holy books.

250
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:47,720
Nice.

251
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,180
I was always looking for my own stash of Mad Magazine, which my father would hide.

252
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,620
Well, you just mentioned one of our true holy books is Mad Magazine and their great publisher,

253
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,120
William Gaines, and the great Alfred E. Newman, who is a cousin to Bob.

254
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,100
I always thought there was a kind of a connection there.

255
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,360
Yeah, he's...

256
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,160
Well, Bob's better looking.

257
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,580
But, yeah, they are related.

258
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,640
I think Alfred E. Newman was more like the country cousin.

259
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,000
And he's a little older than Bob in real life.

260
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,700
They both are.

261
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,560
They're ageless figures.

262
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,760
Now, the...

263
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,580
And by the way, I'm looking at some of the names that involve high-profile names like

264
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,320
Paul Rubens, Pee Wee Herman, who placed a picture of Bob in every episode of Pee Wee's

265
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,760
Playhouse.

266
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:44,940
David Byrne, Mark Motherspaugh, Penn Jillette, Penn and Teller, Robert Wilson, Robert Anton

267
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:51,260
Wilson, science fiction writers Rudy Rucker, John Shirley, actor Bruce Campbell, and even

268
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,060
Frank Zappa.

269
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah, so far, all of those are true.

270
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,740
I don't think any of those are lies or exaggerations.

271
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, I'm almost certain it's probably true, especially in the Pee Wee Herman stuff.

272
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,080
Well, you could see it.

273
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,680
But he had Pee Wee in his title sequence every Saturday morning.

274
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,400
All the kids of America saw Bob leering over Pee Wee's shoulder during the titles.

275
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,640
Pee Wee never paid for his membership.

276
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,260
He left a phone message asking us to send him an ordainment package.

277
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,220
He could be a minister.

278
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,180
But he never, and he said, Bill me.

279
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,880
And we did, but he never paid up.

280
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,760
In our church, really, it's a pretty major sin.

281
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,380
But I figure putting Bob on CBS for a year was worth at least $10.

282
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,980
Well, at least.

283
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,800
Yeah.

284
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,480
I mean, and afterward, you had to give the guy some slack.

285
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,020
Yeah.

286
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,140
Yeah.

287
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,760
Yeah, poor Pee Wee.

288
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,980
He really is.

289
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,160
It's a shame.

290
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,040
It's a shame what happened to him.

291
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,340
Well, yeah, I always wondered, you know, all you got busted for doing what?

292
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,080
It's a big deal.

293
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,280
Try your 13-year-old kid.

294
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,980
Like the old T-shirt used to say, we're pulling for you, Pee Wee.

295
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,660
You betcha.

296
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,800
Bob, if he isn't done.

297
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,540
Bob, if he isn't done.

298
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,020
Bob?

299
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,640
Bob?

300
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,980
Yeah, I dig you, Bob.

301
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,400
Bob.

302
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,340
Oh, Bob.

303
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,340
How long will it be?

304
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,360
How long will it be?

305
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,680
Bob, I'm gonna miss you.

306
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,700
Bob's a bad influence on me.

307
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:15,980
Bob!

308
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,560
Oh, Bob, he's so charming and continental.

309
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,600
This is Bob.

310
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,180
I know Bob.

311
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,820
I know Bob.

312
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,800
Oh, Bob, I don't know when I've been so hungry.

313
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,620
Bob, you really shouldn't have given me yours.

314
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,180
Oh, Bob, I don't think I can eat one.

315
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,680
I'm full of greens right up to here.

316
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,420
Fill me up.

317
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,680
I got pot.

318
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,020
You naughty, naughty boy.

319
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,320
Bob, would you like to buy some information?

320
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,600
I've got it, Bob.

321
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,240
Oh, Bob.

322
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,560
So, what is the Church of the Subgenius?

323
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,240
Good question.

324
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,180
We're still trying to figure that out ourselves.

325
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,460
It's like, well, is this a joke or is it a real religion?

326
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,460
And our answer is, why not both?

327
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,120
We are probably one of the only serious religions

328
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,340
that admits that we're completely full of crap.

329
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,440
And as such, possibly the only true and honest religion.

330
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,800
Doesn't that just figure?

331
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,220
You know?

332
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,540
But we have the problem.

333
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,360
We have the problem of bobbies.

334
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,460
They're the ones that want to, they're so excited about it,

335
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,260
they immediately want to start telling all the inside jokes,

336
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,000
and they haven't even gotten the outside joke yet.

337
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,400
And some of them, I mean, really need luck getting that.

338
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,120
But basically, back in 1953,

339
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,480
this man,

340
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,800
this young man, J.R., Bob Dobbs,

341
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,580
and by the way, the J.R. doesn't stand for anything.

342
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,040
It's on his birth certificate,

343
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,960
even with quotes on the name Bob.

344
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,000
Bob was a mere salesman.

345
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,380
Well, not a mere salesman.

346
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,480
He was actually the greatest salesman the world has ever known.

347
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,060
And he was pretty, but he was a very young man,

348
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,300
and he was just starting out on his road, his path.

349
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,340
Religion had nothing to do with it.

350
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,700
He was just interested in money.

351
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,880
Like any sane person.

352
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,420
But he was tinkering with a TV,

353
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,360
he was trying to build his own TV set.

354
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,300
And he was in his basement, standing in a puddle,

355
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,940
and suddenly he had this, he was seized up in the spirit.

356
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,400
He had this epiphany,

357
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,120
which we call the divine immaculation of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

358
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,360
And in this timeless moment,

359
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,300
Bob was communicating with an alien,

360
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,520
an alien,

361
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:51,520


362
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,480
an alien intelligence calling itself Jehovah One.

363
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,540
You may have heard that name before.

364
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,780
This creature had been masquerading as God

365
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,900
to many cultures for centuries.

366
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,860
And it revealed to Bob that throughout history,

367
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,380
there had been a conspiracy.

368
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,860
Not the kind that kills Kennedy or gets Bush into office

369
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,980
or hides UFOs and so forth.

370
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,740
None of that stuff.

371
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,460
This was a conspiracy of plain, ordinary, garden variety,

372
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,240
normal.

373
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,140
Human beings who didn't even know they were part of a conspiracy,

374
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,680
but just automatically out of the fear of anything different,

375
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,260
uh, had been keeping down and oppressing the slack of all the

376
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,720
weirdos, the abnormals, the different people,

377
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,300
uh, the disbelievers,

378
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,880
and most importantly, those who will believe anything.

379
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,120
And that is when the church of the subgenius was formed,

380
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,020
not on a solid,

381
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:51,520
solid,

382
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:51,520


383
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:51,520


384
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:51,520


385
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,720
rock like some of our more prosperous competitors,

386
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,080
but on a shifting sandy beach of pure hypocrisy.

387
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,540
Hypocrisy friends.

388
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,240
That is the beach our church is built on.

389
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,660
Every there's,

390
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,200
we have a million rules,

391
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,880
uh, which can all be read in our three books,

392
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,280
but there's only one that really counts.

393
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,220
And,

394
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,600
um,

395
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,780
since there's no one here,

396
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,560
but children,

397
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,160
I'll say it in full,

398
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,620
uh, full,

399
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,560
uh, vulgar English.

400
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,420
The one,

401
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,880
one rule of the church of the subgenius is,

402
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,120
f*** them if they can't take a joke.

403
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,600
So if you are feeling tender today,

404
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,120
you should perhaps leave.

405
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,700
Uh,

406
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,820
but

407
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,520
the Bob show brought to you by Bob's show.

408
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,280
I'm Bob permanent,

409
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,640
perfect,

410
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,100
permanent,

411
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,480
perfect.

412
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,760
And here he is.

413
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,200
Bob.

414
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,220
Smile,

415
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,000
stop,

416
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,720
smile,

417
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:00,800
stop.

418
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,300
You bet your life.

419
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,360
You bet your life.

420
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,940
There is heaven right here on earth.

421
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,760
There is heaven right here on earth.

422
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,060
Yeah.

423
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,060
Yeah.

424
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,080
Yeah.

425
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,640
Yeah.

426
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,280
Yeah.

427
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,740
Yeah.

428
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:17,920
Yeah.

429
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,020
Yeah.

430
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,080
Yeah.

431
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,080


432
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,560
Yeah.

433
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:18,560


434
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,080
Yeah.

435
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,720
Yeah.

436
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:21,660
Yeah.

437
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:21,660


438
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:21,660


439
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:21,660


440
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:21,960
Dick jazz.

441
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,140
So come on guys and gals.

442
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,900
No fussy Frizzy curls for.

443
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,700
This smart girl.

444
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,380
She has a Bob the perfect permanent,

445
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,320
permanent tight,

446
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,480
kinky with a Bob,

447
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,260
because Bob is so easy.

448
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,420
You can do it yourself.

449
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,800
Just regular pin curls and gentle Bob motion.

450
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,740
That's all.

451
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,900
You need a Bob,

452
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,220
a Bob,

453
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,960
new body.

454
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,620
Make your next permanent.

455
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,500
Uh, Bob,

456
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,480
Bob permanent, permanent.

457
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,960
My mamadon told me, my mamadon told me.

458
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,940
My mamadon me.

459
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,620
My mamadon me.

460
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,400
A worrisome thing, a worrisome thing.

461
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,940
Train it, train it, train it, train it.

462
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,460
My mamadon, my mamadon me.

463
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,020
You'll just love Bob

464
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,700
Be sure to listen again next week

465
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,040
When Bob Perfect for Today

466
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,080
Again brings you

467
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,940
The Bob Show

468
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,320
From Bobby Wood

469
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,740
This girl knows that

470
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,220
Bob is the essence of romance

471
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,380
Who tonight?

472
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,500
Then did Norrell Preff

473
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,540
Dot com

474
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,200
Is the essence of collagery

475
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,600
As most of the subsequent

476
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,840
Collages will continue to demonstrate

477
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,220
And just as

478
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,920
Fernanda Nandeli-Mur

479
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,960
Is the killer of Bob

480
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,820
You'll have to get rid of him somehow for good

481
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,820
But how?

482
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,740
Suddenly you found the answer

483
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,540
It's as simple as kill Bob

484
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,680
Kill Bob

485
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,440
If he contacts you, don't try to help him

486
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,100
He's dangerous

487
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,740
Bob

488
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,600
Hello?

489
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,660
Did you hear the news on the radio?

490
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,300
They say I killed Bob

491
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,380
Guess that's when I must have fallen asleep

492
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,520
Bob

493
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,740
The only person I can kill

494
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,120
I can kill Bob

495
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,320
First thing I saw was Bob's body

496
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,800
Then the gun beside me and I killed Bob

497
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,140
Are you sure?

498
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,860
I'm afraid so, Bob

499
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,480
I don't think the police will believe it

500
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,500
But it's the truth

501
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,240
I killed Bob

502
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,460
Yes, Bob

503
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,520
Yes, Bob

504
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,560
You've got to answer it, Bob

505
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:37,820
Hello?

506
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,800
Hello, Bob

507
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,060
Oh, darling

508
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,200
Listen to me, Bob

509
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,660
She was in love with Bob

510
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,580
Oh, no, Bob

511
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,520
I was at the party

512
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,500
I actually did it for her

513
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,380
I thought I could kill Bob

514
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,740
Where did you go after the party last night?

515
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,740
Somebody set up a boob trap in your cabin

516
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,180
It was a dark one, Bob

517
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,820
Then it did just that

518
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,460
I said I could kill Bob

519
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,980
She meant that boob trap for you

520
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Don't look away, Bob

521
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,840
Perhaps I did kill Bob

522
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,860
Doesn't that make sense?

523
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,300
Well, yes, yes, it makes sense

524
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,260
Yes, Bob

525
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,920
Bob

526
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,500
Listen, Bob

527
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,540
I was talking about Gavin, but he's a little stressed

528
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,480
Okay, but hell, he doesn't have to be stressed

529
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,260
I'm going to jump down my throat

530
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,460
Does he have a family or relatives?

531
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,420
Yeah, I have a wife and a child

532
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,940
You know, the deceased, what's his name, Dobbs

533
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,520
Does he have a family?

534
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,260
Yes, he does

535
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:28,940
He has a family

536
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,280
He has a wife and two young kids

537
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,340
I think they're divorced

538
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,680
His kids are divorced?

539
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,920
What is wrong with you?

540
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,420
Do you laugh at anything?

541
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,020
I mean, do you just laugh at anything?

542
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,820
A man has died

543
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,600
She thinks this is fun

544
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,880
Are all you movie people like this?

545
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,420
Go, go, go

546
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,200
Here's Bob

547
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,760
Bob won for A1 Slacks

548
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,180
Hi, this is Bob won

549
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,560
Years ago, my grandfather Abner won

550
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,920
Known for short because he was

551
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,240
Invented the A1 Slack

552
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,280
However, today's go-go action now generation man on campus and off

553
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,800
Wants a little more out of life

554
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,320
So we added another leg to our super slim trim fitting A1 Slack

555
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,180
And came up with super slim trim fitting A1 Slacks

556
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,180
A1 Slacks, the two-legged action slacks for the two-legged action man

557
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,920
Thank you, Bob

558
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,360
You're welcome

559
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,720
And now back to our movie

560
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,180
Looks like we're going to find Bob

561
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,960
And we've, over the years, because of the church

562
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,580
We went public in 19, actually July, January 1st, 1980

563
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,840
We printed the first sacred subgenius pamphlet

564
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,260
And have been misunderstood from that day on

565
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,540
But you know, as they say

566
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,780
Those who know don't say and those who say don't know

567
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,740
So we should all just shut up

568
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,040
But look here, we keep blabbering on

569
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,180
And we're not going to do that

570
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,340
Is it the drugs?

571
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,300
That's what the Cleveland Police Department might tell you

572
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,520
In fact, a friend of ours sat in on a lecture

573
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,900
To the Cleveland Police Department

574
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,080
By a cult expert

575
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,980
Who explained that Bob was assigned for Satan

576
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,320
And drugs and stuff

577
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,440
But obviously, friends, this is a religion

578
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,380
Bob is here to replace the drugs

579
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,180
Just look at that

580
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,340
Just looking at his face

581
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,620
Eats up more brain cells than most of your drugs

582
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,900
If you're doing it right

583
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,200
Like a real subgenius

584
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,220
If you can meditate upon the dots

585
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,840
Every little dot

586
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,100
So many of you have done this, I know

587
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,700
You just focus on that thing

588
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,520
And after a while

589
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,820
You feel so much slack

590
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,320
It's like heroin combined with PCP

591
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,300
Combined with DDT, LSD

592
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,140
And you're like, oh my God, I'm so drunk

593
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,140


594
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,140


595
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,140


596
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,140


597
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,140


598
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,140


599
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,140


600
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,140


601
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,980
And marijuana, as my father puts it

602
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,640
But what Bob's preaching is

603
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,600
The joy of drugs

604
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,620
But not necessarily with the drugs

605
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,220
Although those can certainly enhance everything

606
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,560
For the first ten minutes

607
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,780
But what Bob preaches is slack, friends

608
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,940
And slack is so simple

609
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,960
That I can't explain it

610
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,600
Because it's different for each person

611
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,180
Everybody has their own form of slack

612
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,560
Some people get their slack

613
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,220
From sitting on their ass watching TV

614
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,260
And drinking beer

615
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,100
There's nothing wrong with that

616
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,220
The conspiracy of the normal people

617
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,040
Would love for that to be the only way

618
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,700
You feel you're getting slack

619
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,720
We're here just as a pep talk

620
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,900
Just a reminder that slack

621
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,220
Slack is whatever makes you feel

622
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,220
Like you're doing what you were supposed to be doing

623
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,260
And that could be anything

624
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:58,160
For our friend Dennis Murphy here

625
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,760
Slack might be

626
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,900
God, I can't even begin to imagine

627
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,160
Maybe I should have picked a different

628
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,440
Some people like bird watching, right?

629
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,700
Some people like pornography

630
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,900
Some people like movies

631
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,000
Some people like people

632
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,200
And just hanging out and talking

633
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,620
Can be your purest form of slack

634
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,080
And you can steal that slack

635
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,520
While on the job

636
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,660
As you've learned around the coffee machine

637
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,440
I'm sure

638
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,360
As my good friend and speechwriter

639
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,440
You might say, Dr. Onan Kanabite put it

640
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,460
Slack is the oomph in uncomfortable

641
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,660
That's it

642
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,900
See he has

643
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,180
He has some stage

644
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,620
He has

645
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,820
He says slack is the oomph in comfortable

646
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,280
He says oomph is accompanied by a gesture of vigor

647
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,740
From the hips among adults or a pumped elbow on US TV

648
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,480
So it could actually be slack is the oomph in uncomfortable

649
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,100
Why do I keep wanting to say uncomfortable?

650
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,460
I don't know

651
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,020
And as I said, slack can come when you throw good money after bad

652
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,180
And bad money after Bob

653
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,420
And that's why that sales table is out there

654
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,820
This, oh, and we have a new book out

655
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,380
Intelligent Design for Dummies

656
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,960
Our new publication

657
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,100
So be sure if you think you've already bought

658
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,140
All the accessories that go with Ken and Barbie

659
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,680
There's some new accessories out there

660
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,300
So

661
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,900
So you know Bob has many death days

662
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,640
What's his birthday?

663
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,660
Bob has had so many lives

664
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,840
So many past lives

665
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,820
That by chance, you know, one of almost every day of the year

666
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,260
Is the birthday of a Bob

667
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,740
Where is Bob now?

668
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,860
Is there somebody that we should be looking towards?

669
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,460
Where is Bob?

670
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,500
Is he mayhats fishing on Lake Titicaca

671
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,700
With G. Gordon Gordon?

672
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,900
Is he perhaps selling ice to an Eskimo somewhere in Alaska?

673
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:23,640
Is he perhaps selling hypocrisy to a subgenius in San Francisco?

674
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,020
But Bob is a traveling salesman

675
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,940
And resides at no fixed address

676
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,100
Unlike the god of the Mormons

677
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:38,800
Who is known to be on a planet circling the star Koloff

678
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,220
Having sex with his many spirit wives

679
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,160
He's a star about a guy named Smith on Terrapin Pieces

680
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,200
Although we don't know where Bob is now

681
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,460
We know that Bob is coming

682
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,220
And when I say that I don't mean

683
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,300
It's not like when Jesus is coming

684
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,980
That usually means Jesus is on his way

685
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,800
He's due to arrive

686
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,140
When we say Bob is coming

687
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,620
Bob is literally

688
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,040
That is what Bob is

689
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,400
Is always coming

690
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,180
And it's true, but isn't he sometimes there

691
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,400
And then at other times not?

692
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,880
When you come tonight you will see Bob

693
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,460
I'll be looking for him

694
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,460
About an hour and a half

695
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,860
That's terrible

696
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,120
I'll be home by then

697
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,660
And you can't move

698
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:26,260
I know, but I just don't want to see him during that thing

699
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,760
You don't want to be everywhere

700
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,120
But don't you think you'd understand it all at that point?

701
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,360
Or maybe not

702
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,440
I think that's when the shark bites you

703
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,980
That's the part I thought about

704
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,660
You're out there swimming around and a shark bites you

705
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,020
Because you're being distracted

706
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,840
Yeah

707
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,500
If you're together enough to understand that last big organism

708
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,940
Then you're pretty well set

709
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,280
Instead of music stopping

710
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,420
You're just left out there

711
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,420
Like some amateur show

712
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,360
It's now that Bob's coming your way

713
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,660
He is?

714
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:52,960
Ah!

715
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:53,920
Oh!

716
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,160
Karunch?

717
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:56,680
Bob!

718
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,860
I mean, no, I said oh God

719
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,400
I mean, oh Bob, I did

720
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,340
Well, there are no atheists in foxholes

721
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,080
Not 저기

722
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,840
Bob's coming

723
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,160
You're just right

724
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,980
No I mean, don't you think

725
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,060
Bob's coming

726
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,140
I do

727
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,820
Oh, I wish you Let's preach

728
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:38,820


729
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:38,820


730
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,240
It's called In the Name of Bob.

731
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,760
Around Robert Downey Jr.

732
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,520
Plan B Productions, I think, is slated to produce that.

733
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,500
There's that Lithuanian actor.

734
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,840
Johnny Depp plays the young Ivan Stang.

735
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,220
And Jim Carrey plays Violet Drummond.

736
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,620
I don't know who else has been cast yet.

737
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,580
But Bob would be Andy Serkis.

738
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,140
The guy that played Gollum and Kong.

739
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,080
Right, Andy Serkis.

740
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,620
That would be good.

741
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,720
So he would basically be a performance capture.

742
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,060
And Mike Myers is the voice of Cthulhu.

743
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,200
You can see we've been thinking about that.

744
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,660
Very true.

745
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,720
Any love interests in the film?

746
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,180
Yeah, the hero would be Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

747
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:33,320
And I think he'd be courting popular bull girl Dave Vina.

748
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,120
He's voiced by Lindsay Lohan.

749
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,340
And I think he'd be courting popular bull girl Dave Vina.

750
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,140
In a bikini.

751
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,640
Just because.

752
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,720
And they're all penguins, right?

753
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,040
Yeah, I love them.

754
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,980
That's right.

755
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,640
They're all CGI penguins.

756
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,900
Thousands and thousands.

757
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,820
And then there's the Spielberg Saturday morning TV show, Little Subgenius.

758
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,060
Dear Subgenius!

759
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,980
I said Lil.

760
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:56,840
Lil.

761
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,400
Lil Subgenius.

762
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,100
With Pip and Squeak.

763
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,980
Well, we've been waiting for the remake.

764
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,340
That was the Sid and Marty Croft production.

765
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,840
What, the remake?

766
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,920
That was a great remake.

767
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,780
Original, Lil.

768
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,500
Second big feature was another one of my favorites.

769
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,340
I never saw the remake.

770
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:16,980
What is that about?

771
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,040
What is this thing?

772
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,320
It stinks.

773
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,200
That was a joke.

774
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:22,860
That was a joke.

775
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,940
It stinks.

776
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,740
What is this thing?

777
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:30,760
The second big feature was a possible name for a Subgenius feature.

778
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,340
What was the name?

779
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,560
Second big feature.

780
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,340
Second big feature.

781
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,820
I thought they were like a real band.

782
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,200
Second big feature?

783
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:37,620
Yeah.

784
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,800
But Philo disabused me of that notion tonight.

785
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,980
He said it was just negative land.

786
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,360
The Swingin' Love.

787
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,380
Wait, write that down.

788
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,620
That's a good name for a band.

789
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,080
Yeah.

790
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,260
Not negative man.

791
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,140
Negative land.

792
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,320
Nobody expected what happened next.

793
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,500
Sensational career.

794
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,020
I'm Bob.

795
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,600
I'm Bob.

796
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,020
I'm Bob.

797
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,200
So why are so many people flocking to, to, to, to, to?

798
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,620
My message is that God is a hoe.

799
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,020
That he'll take us places we've never dreamed of.

800
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,600
It's hard.

801
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,580
You may be misleading some people.

802
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,340
So big.

803
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:20,980
Being gay.

804
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,160
Gay and generous.

805
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,840
Leading them to some false god or something like that.

806
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,660
Deluding and dumbing down.

807
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,620
You know.

808
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,400
Right up there with gardening.

809
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,020
Bam.

810
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,200
Bam.

811
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,960
There's a hit.

812
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,920
Great, great, great, great, great, great.

813
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,100
Wait, you're saying that.

814
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,760
Great, great, great, great, great, great.

815
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,360
Oh my God.

816
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,000
Nothing.

817
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,160
Make beautiful women fall all over you.

818
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,160
No doubt there.

819
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,020
Take steroids.

820
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,080
Slack, slack, slack.

821
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,520
Cut, cut.

822
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,080
I'm weak.

823
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:02,700
Now, a lot of people say that some terms that are in the, in the, as you say, the

824
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,020
Bobliagraphon, the, the, the, uh...

825
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:12,400
the, the, the, the cyclopedia, uh, it kind of, uh, uses, uh, notions similar to, not the same

826
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:18,240
as, but, but in the same area as Scientology, or kind of a New Agey, but, but, but in a fashion

827
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,880
that, that's almost Dadaesque.

828
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:28,100
Well, um, you know, any religion or priesthood is, uh, based on impenetrable jargon.

829
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,920
Lawyers, doctors, for instance, and we get a lot of, of, uh, lawyers and doctors joining

830
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,000
up because they appreciate it.

831
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,000


832
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:44,160
They appreciate that impenetrable obfuscation, uh, and, and, uh, invented words and, uh, words

833
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:49,400
that have been recombined so as to, so that when you're reading this stuff, you feel like

834
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,140
you're really part of a secret army.

835
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,660
And, and the great thing is, you are.

836
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,120
It's, it's not much of a, I mean, it's still a secret, so it's not that much of an army.

837
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,240
Not much of an army, yeah, right.

838
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:00,540
No.

839
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,820
But, you know, it's kind of like they, what they used to say about Fight Club.

840
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,720
Yeah.

841
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,020
Yeah.

842
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,600
First rule, don't talk about it.

843
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,280
Don't talk about it.

844
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,500
Yeah.

845
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,540
Of course, naturally, everybody talks about it.

846
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,460
Uh.

847
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:15,180
Well, and, you know, the Hell's Angels used to say, those who say don't know, and those

848
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,200
who know don't say.

849
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:16,880
Mm-hmm.

850
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,820
And we should probably just shut up.

851
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,320
Well, yeah, and, and this show will go right to hell.

852
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:27,140
Um, I, I like one thing about it, and I always say, you know, this has got to be the best

853
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,700
deal in organized, uh, shall we say, religion or, or church.

854
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,800
And that is, uh, guaranteed.

855
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,300
Salvation or triple your money back.

856
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,040
That's right.

857
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,380
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

858
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,320
That's a, that's an offer that no other religion makes.

859
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,460
Well, I, you know, I, none of them do.

860
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,560
And, and I'm thinking, you know, now there's one you can, you can grasp.

861
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,100
That, that's the kind of church I can get behind.

862
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:51,880
Right.

863
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,780
Or in front of.

864
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,860
It costs to join.

865
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:01,340
And that means that if you, at the end of time, find yourself in the pit of hell, uh,

866
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,400
we will gladly refund your money.

867
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,800
We'll give you $90.

868
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,700
Now there is a little book that you can, that Bob sells down there called, uh, hell on five

869
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,640
cents a day.

870
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,580
Well, I think it's 89, 95 nowadays.

871
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,040
Yeah.

872
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,280
And a day lasts a long time in hell.

873
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:20,860
Yeah.

874
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,780
Normal hell.

875
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,680
Now subgenius hell is kind of like a endless party.

876
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,700
Well, that's my idea of a good idea.

877
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:27,700
Right.

878
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,140
Yeah.

879
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:32,680
Now we, I, you know, this, it's possible.

880
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,380
Some people think the subgenius thing.

881
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,120
It's just a joke.

882
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,500
And I mean, some people compared to what though?

883
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,020
Right.

884
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,420
Exactly.

885
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,260
You know, everybody's religion is going to be a joke to somebody else.

886
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:43,540
Yeah.

887
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,540
One of them has to be true.

888
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,240
What if it was this one?

889
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,960
Who knows?

890
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,600
Who knows?

891
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,160
Crazier things have happened.

892
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,320
I know.

893
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,340
Look at the inquisition.

894
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,380
Look at the news.

895
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:54,920
See?

896
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,460
Yeah.

897
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,340
You know, I, so I wouldn't be surprised at anything, uh, that would happen.

898
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:03,920
Although we're.

899
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,800
We are kind of behind Scientology.

900
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,660
We got started a little bit later.

901
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,560
That's all right.

902
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,480
So did L Ron Hubbard.

903
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,600
Hold on a second.

904
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,620
If you will, uh, Reverend, we're going to take a quick break here.

905
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,940
Reverend Ivan Stang.

906
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:20,920
He is the founder of the Church of the subgenius and talking more about the

907
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,640
Church of the subgenius for those of you out there who've never heard of it.

908
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,700
Well, here's a chance to find a religion you can really get behind or next to or

909
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,580
in front of her.

910
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,480
Yeah.

911
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,640
Something.

912
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,620
I'll put it over.

913
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,040
Me.

914
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,440
I'm serving it now.

915
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:33,720
Feed it.

916
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:33,920
Now.

917
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,220
Feed it.

918
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,800
You've known him.

919
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,460
I see it for you.

920
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,080
I'm McBarber.

921
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,000
You're listening to radio.

922
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,160
85 K away.

923
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,960
Kids just don't understand.

924
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,520
What's that horrible stench?

925
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,880
The laughing lemur.

926
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,000
Is there much communication with other worldly subgeni?

927
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:59,360
Well, there's, um, of course on other continents, there are the Euro subgeniuses.

928
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,400
There's a Euro subgenius.

929
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:01,720
Yahoo.

930
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,380
Very much.

931
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,260
They're busy.

932
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,180
They're busy.

933
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,260


934
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:10,720
And, uh, you know, oddly enough, as the dollar becomes more, less and less valuable compared

935
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,200
to other countries money.

936
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:19,540
We get fewer memberships and ordainments here in the U S but we're making a mint off of

937
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,080
all of a sudden in euros.

938
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:28,700
People in Europe are joining up and Australia, all the English speaking world, but, uh, we're

939
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,460
also starting to hear from Russians.

940
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,380
And oddly enough.

941
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,900
A lot of Nigerians.

942
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:33,900


943
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,680
Keep offering us a huge fortune.

944
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,280
As long as I give them your bank account number.

945
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:40,820
Yeah.

946
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:49,660
It's, it's, it's definitely one of the world's fastest growing religion, but it's not a snack

947
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,080
religion.

948
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,440
Well, it is a sac religion.

949
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,520
No, a snack.

950
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,860
Oh, you sure?

951
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
It's a snack religion.

952
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,360
Okay.

953
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:57,860
Very good.

954
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,400
First short.

955
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,740
We push Bob as a short duration personal savior.

956
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,880
We don't expect you to cling to him.

957
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:03,880


958
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:03,880


959
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,520
We don't expect you to cling to it forever.

960
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,260
It's we don't want you to use Bob as a crutch rather.

961
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,360
We want to let you should let Bob use you as a crutch.

962
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,680
You are Bob's crutch.

963
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm interested in your information.

964
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,680
I'd like to subscribe to the newsletter.

965
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,560
Wait, I already do.

966
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,440
You go to subgenius.com and click on the news button.

967
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,740
It's actually all very logical.

968
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:33,240
There used to be a hard copy, but a famous publication, the stark fist of removal.

969
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,480
But in the cyber age, it doesn't come out very often.

970
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,040
We allow special members to print out the online version.

971
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,740
Well, you know, and, and, and Dobbs made most of his important deals in strange places when

972
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,300
he first started out like a waffle house in Haightville, Georgia.

973
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,360
I thought it was Ellicott city, Maryland.

974
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,440
It was a Stucky's in Texas.

975
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,260
Well, there were several.

976
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,060
He knows all this stuff.

977
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,580
Right.

978
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,640
Where, where was it?

979
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,060
I don't know.

980
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,220
I don't know.

981
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,220


982
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,220


983
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,220


984
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,320
I don't know.

985
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,320


986
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,320


987
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,620
He fell asleep.

988
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,100


989
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,160
Um, I think, I think he's suffering the wounds of crates.

990
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,160
Hey, you know, I got a joke.

991
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,820
What's the, what's the difference between Jesus Christ and a picture of Jesus Christ?

992
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,200
Are you guys talking about me?

993
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:27,320
We were saying we're, uh, I was actually, uh, uh, was, I'm in the process of flipping

994
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,340
a, a tape.

995
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,080
So, uh, are we supposed to be funny?

996
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,200
No, we're not.

997
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,200


998
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,200


999
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:33,840
No, no, no, no.

1000
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,380
No, I don't think so.

1001
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:40,160
No, we wanted to know the connection between the Raelians on the one hand, Dr. Sinister's

1002
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,060
show and Bob's hardest sell, not anything to do with primate arrest.

1003
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,540
So what is, what's the difference between, what's the difference between Jesus and a

1004
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,080
picture of him?

1005
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:49,340
I don't know.

1006
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,080
Oh yeah, that was it.

1007
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,500
Yeah.

1008
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,420
What's the difference between Jesus Christ and a picture of Jesus Christ?

1009
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,200
You only need one nail to hang up the picture.

1010
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,420
Oh, Hey, what's the, what's the difference between Jesus Christ and a picture of Jesus

1011
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:00,760
Christ?

1012
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:00,980
Jesus Christ.

1013
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:01,940
Jesus Christ.

1014
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,780
The picture is real.

1015
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,380
Oh, keep going.

1016
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,680
Oh, but Bob is real.

1017
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,700
Bob is real.

1018
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,800
You should be careful.

1019
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,860
You know, you, you don't want to offend the Arabs saying Bob is real.

1020
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,920
Bob is real.

1021
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:24,600
And there was a waitress in, in, uh, Hapeville, Georgia who, who told, I can't say this stuff

1022
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,160
on the air.

1023
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,040
Sure you can.

1024
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,980
No, I can't.

1025
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,200
Um, it, it, it, it, it, I get in trouble.

1026
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,920
Did somebody found a Dobbs head in a pancake?

1027
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,840
No, no, no, no, no.

1028
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,620
It's much more complicated than that.

1029
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,060
Um, when I met her, I was, it was about three o'clock in the morning and she was waffle

1030
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,920
house waitress, which she knows pretty normal.

1031
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:50,220
And uh, and she started telling me I had on a Dobbs shirt and she said, I've seen him.

1032
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,400
He was here with these weird guys.

1033
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,980
And she tells me this long story and I can't really tell it on the air to not giving, I

1034
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,340
don't want to give away too many secrets.

1035
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,260
Like the guys weren't really guys.

1036
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:07,180
They were like aliens or, you know, what's, what's the, but she had met Bob just that

1037
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,800
she had met Bob.

1038
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,640
Oh, she had served Bob a cup of coffee.

1039
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,920
That's not unusual.

1040
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:19,700
Uh, Bob often has been where a sub genius arrives just before the sub genius got there.

1041
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,080
You hear that all the time.

1042
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,700
So actually I've seen him arriving just as Bob has just has left.

1043
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,480
I've seen him a couple of times actually.

1044
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,860
People wonder if he's a memory or a premonition.

1045
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,380
Cause the, it's so fleeting and they're just aware of something having happened.

1046
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,860
I've seen him driving away twice.

1047
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,960
I've seen him getting Bob on the highway at least twice.

1048
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:44,500
Actually I saw him get thrown out of a coffee shop actually cause he wouldn't put his pipe

1049
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,120
out, you know, and they, they threw him out and like exactly.

1050
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:52,040
And then I, I, but I figured I'd just leave it then, you know, hands off more chance,

1051
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,300
you know, and uh, I don't know what exactly it was, but the people in there got really

1052
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,960
upset about something.

1053
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,500
They forcibly threw him out.

1054
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,320
Like literally threw him out.

1055
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,340
And right as soon as he threw him out, a big bus came by and hit him right as he threw

1056
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:04,820
him out there.

1057
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,360
And then he was gone.

1058
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:13,400
You see, all I saw left behind was like, there was like some, uh, like a smoldering of the,

1059
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,500
uh, of like a broken pipe there.

1060
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,420
But then again, you know, next week I saw Bob again, you know, he was fine.

1061
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,320
Yeah.

1062
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,000
Well, you know, it's funny.

1063
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:26,980
The reason the waitress was asking about the shirt I had on is that Bob never paid his

1064
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,320
bill.

1065
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,660
Oh, yeah.

1066
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,680
I mean, why is it always the rich ones?

1067
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,140
That's how you know it really was Bob.

1068
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,680
Why is it always the rich ones?

1069
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,840
Well, if you tell me, it was like the first night they were open at this particular location.

1070
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,340
So this had to have been back in like 58 or 60.

1071
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,600
And she still remembered the guy cause he stiffed her.

1072
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,020
You know?

1073
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,300
Well, you always remember the person who stiffed you.

1074
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,020
Yeah.

1075
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,540
Especially if they look like that, you know, they're grinning while they do it.

1076
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,260
Your first night getting stiffed.

1077
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:54,640
Yeah.

1078
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,840
We always remember that.

1079
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,180
Has anybody delivered a pizza to Bob?

1080
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,300
And you know, I don't know.

1081
00:43:59,300 --> 00:43:59,300


1082
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,080
13 cents tip.

1083
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,500
Get the idea.

1084
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,460
Wow.

1085
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,680
A whole 13 cents.

1086
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,000
That's pretty good.

1087
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,920
Bob doesn't tip to drivers either.

1088
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,760
That's happened.

1089
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,060
I know a driver who delivered to him and Bob doesn't tip.

1090
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,280
Bob says, let me give you a tip.

1091
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,600
Don't get screwed or something really dumb and witty like that.

1092
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:18,940
Yeah.

1093
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:23,620
He grabs the food and it's the same thing to every pizza delivery guy.

1094
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,800
Yeah.

1095
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,920
My dad does that too.

1096
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,300
Do you know how leprosy he is?

1097
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,700
He's got a leper leaves a tip for a hooker.

1098
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:31,580
Oh.

1099
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,760
We can stop there.

1100
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,100
Man.

1101
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,260
That was a quick one.

1102
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,820
That was quick.

1103
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,340
It's old.

1104
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,500
Yeah.

1105
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:44,720
Yeah.

1106
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,520
Old like me.

1107
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:52,020
You know, and when I get home, I'll chop up another three shows out of this one real fast

1108
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:58,300
and take off for Texas, to Stang County, where we go every December.

1109
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,280
That's right.

1110
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,280


1111
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,280


1112
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,280


1113
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,280


1114
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,280


1115
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,280


1116
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,280


1117
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,280


1118
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,280


1119
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,280


1120
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:07,260
We're building a big cult compound in Stang County, Texas.

1121
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,640
You don't want to go down by Stang County, son.

1122
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,820
It's near Dead Branch Pass.

1123
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:21,160
Actually in Stang County has a nuclear power plant that serves Dallas.

1124
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,760
It has a really big tax base.

1125
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,000
We have a lot of tax money because of that.

1126
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,100
Yeah.

1127
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,060
Yeah.

1128
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:33,500
And my family is very involved in city politics, county politics and so forth.

1129
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:39,620
So we've been able to go forward on construction of this underground bunker.

1130
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,820
Started as a missile, an abandoned missile silo bunker.

1131
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:44,660
Even better.

1132
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,120
There are a lot of those in Texas.

1133
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,440
They've done the digging for you.

1134
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,040
Yeah, that's right.

1135
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,140
I saw something a while back about people living in these, in the bunkers, owning them,

1136
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:52,380
right?

1137
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:52,920
Yeah.

1138
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,480
In their home.

1139
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,200
We did that.

1140
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:54,280
We did that.

1141
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,180
And we also have extensive tunneling going on.

1142
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,060
To the mall.

1143
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:04,160
Luckily there's uranium, raw uranium on the land of Stang.

1144
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:04,440
Bridge.

1145
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,620
And goats.

1146
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,280
Like every good compound.

1147
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,160
Why goats you may ask?

1148
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,740
Well, because there was a drought.

1149
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,660
Why a goat?

1150
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,720
And the cows, there wasn't enough grass for the cows or the zombies.

1151
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,920
Goats in Jehovah.

1152
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:21,560
Yeah.

1153
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,120
But the goats, the goats are happy.

1154
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:28,240
We actually have a cult compound in Texas with goats.

1155
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,200
Slightly radioactive goats.

1156
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:30,620
Yeah.

1157
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:34,220
Machine gun, you know, encampments.

1158
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:34,920
The horns glow.

1159
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,720
It's a terrible thing.

1160
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:48,800
So we, most of the time the other members of the Stang clan run the ranch.

1161
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,700
I just go down there every now and then to oversee.

1162
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,060
The Stang.

1163
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,100
The Stang.

1164
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1165
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1166
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1167
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1168
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1169
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1170
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1171
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1172
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1173
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1174
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1175
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1176
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1177
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1178
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,100


1179
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,020
Stang stomping ground.

1180
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:54,300
The killings.

1181
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,700
Stang likes to go down to supervise the killings.

1182
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,380
We're going to build a big TV studio there.

1183
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,820
And a crystal cathedral.

1184
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,680
And a drive-through crystal cathedral so that, and a creation.

1185
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,540
Drive-through.

1186
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,820
Drive-by.

1187
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:14,680
And we're going to have a special museum about the way evolution really worked.

1188
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,720
Where subgeniuses really came from.

1189
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,340
Where they'll be displayed.

1190
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,040
Audio animatronic yeti.

1191
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:21,360
Yeah.

1192
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,640
Arrival of the exes.

1193
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,740
The creation of the humans by the yetis and so forth.

1194
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,280
That's actually my favorite part of the episode.

1195
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,240
Audio animatronic Stang and Grover.

1196
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,320
The guys talking and their arms kind of moving.

1197
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,360
Are you familiar with the creation of the humanoids movie?

1198
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,320
Yes.

1199
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,540
Most certainly.

1200
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,460
That's a great film.

1201
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,660
The creation of the humanoids.

1202
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,500
Mandatory subgenius feeling.

1203
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,120
Why doesn't he listen to you?

1204
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:44,520
What's his name?

1205
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,240
Gavin.

1206
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:45,520
Right.

1207
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:45,940
Garvin.

1208
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,160
Right.

1209
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,120
I can never remember his name.

1210
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,600
So why doesn't he listen to you, huh?

1211
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,340
Because I'm a human.

1212
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:51,340


1213
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:51,340


1214
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:51,340


1215
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:51,340


1216
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:51,340


1217
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:51,340


1218
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:51,340


1219
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,620
I tend to rattle his cage.

1220
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,780
He doesn't like it.

1221
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,620
Well, was it like this before the actor?

1222
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,180
What was his name?

1223
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:56,620
The one who died?

1224
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:57,480
Dobbs.

1225
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,000
Yeah, Hobbs.

1226
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,040
What was going on then, huh?

1227
00:47:59,400 --> 00:47:59,720
Anarchy.

1228
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,160
Dobbs was rewriting the script.

1229
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,180
He'd call script conferences every morning before shooting.

1230
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,080
It made everyone crazy.

1231
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,280
Well, we already had a script.

1232
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,360
What was the problem, huh?

1233
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:08,880
He was an actor.

1234
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:09,820
What can I tell you?

1235
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,660
He wasn't even good at it, you know?

1236
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,900
He was the look at me scratch my school of acting.

1237
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,180
Oh, such asses.

1238
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,600
I asked this guy, Dobbs.

1239
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,520
I asked him last week.

1240
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,740
I said, why are you doing this?

1241
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:20,440
What did he say?

1242
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,340
He said it was a joke.

1243
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,480
It was a generational thing.

1244
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,320
And what's that mean, huh?

1245
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,600
Beats the hell out of me.

1246
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,860
Little puke.

1247
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:27,800
Come on!

1248
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,380
You couldn't do anything to stop it?

1249
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,560
What could I do?

1250
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,300
Gavin had no control.

1251
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,480
He was terrified.

1252
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,680
Couldn't make decisions about anything, even about breakfast.

1253
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,420
It could have helped me, you know?

1254
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:41,600
Works.

1255
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,560
Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs.

1256
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:44,960
Colts, Colts.

1257
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,080
Just out of time.

1258
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,280
Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs.

1259
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:47,880
Went off.

1260
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,360
The incredible last wrong committed.

1261
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:51,340
The incredible last wrong committed.

1262
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,000
Committed.

1263
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,920
Now you do know, Colt.

1264
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,820
You know, with ADHD and, you know, just kind of, you know, you know, just kind of, you

1265
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,020
know, you know, uh, you know, um.

1266
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:09,300
You know, uh, put your arm around these young men.

1267
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,180
Watch it.

1268
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:10,640
Watch it.

1269
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:15,020
You know, but, Colt, I, I, it's my Colt.

1270
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:19,360
I, uh, you know, you know, Secret Life on the Internet, Colt.

1271
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,600
Uh, uh, uh, well, doody, doody.

1272
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,360
Uh, uh.

1273
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,580
It doesn't make any sense, you know.

1274
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,280
Action.

1275
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,100
And so we were, you know, coming.

1276
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,740
You know, it's, you know, you know.

1277
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,740
Hmm, hmm.

1278
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,220
So we got off, you know.

1279
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:37,960
I'm really deeply involved in girls and boys and girls today.

1280
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,020
Mm-hmm.

1281
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:39,940
In a cult.

1282
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,620
Perfect.

1283
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,360
Gone down the wrong road, but beautiful.

1284
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,440
Crazy things get said.

1285
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,160
Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs.

1286
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,340
Back again.

1287
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,100
We're up right against the top of the hour and, of course, a news update.

1288
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:59,120
But want to, uh, get some final details from our, our, our good guest, the Reverend Ivan

1289
00:49:59,120 --> 00:49:59,760
Stang.

1290
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:04,280
He's, uh, uh, the, the, uh, head, head, headmaster, I guess.

1291
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:04,880
And.

1292
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,420
No, uh, my, my, uh, title is Sacred Scribe.

1293
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,060
Cool.

1294
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:09,680
All right.

1295
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,760
Sacred Scribe number 273.

1296
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:17,300
Uh, Bob Dobbs is the living avatar of Slack.

1297
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,140
Wow.

1298
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,860
That's his official title.

1299
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,320
Not to be confused with the other Dobbs down the road from us.

1300
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:28,820
Um, uh, for those who wish to find out more and, or get your books and your, and your

1301
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,480
DVD and, and also, by the way, that, that hell on five cents a day kind of thing.

1302
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,000
Um, how does one do this?

1303
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:43,580
If you're on the internet, the simplest thing would be to look at subgenius.com.

1304
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:44,480
Mm-hmm.

1305
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,960
And I'll, uh, uh, subgenius does not have an O in it.

1306
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,120
Oh, okay.

1307
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,740
I have to say that because there are a lot of subgeniuses out there.

1308
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:58,940
It's S-U-B-G-E-N-I-U-S.com.

1309
00:50:59,560 --> 00:50:59,760
All right.

1310
00:50:59,760 --> 00:50:59,980
All right.

1311
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:00,520
Very good indeed.

1312
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,880
And Reverend Stang, I'm going to, by the way, I'm going to put you on hold.

1313
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,860
My producer, Steve, needs to speak with you, but, uh, I want to thank you so much.

1314
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,400
It's been a lot of fun.

1315
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,820
Thank you very much.

1316
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:11,800
I'm just, I'm a little concerned that I'm going to have those Monkees songs stuck in

1317
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,440
my head for the next three days.

1318
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,300
An ear bug is the worst, isn't it?

1319
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:15,440
Yeah.

1320
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,040
Thank you very much.

1321
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:17,380
Indeed.

1322
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,480
And thank you very much.

1323
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,080
Okay.

1324
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,140
And please stay there, Reverend, but thanks very much indeed.

1325
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:21,940
Praise Rick.

1326
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,480
And praise, praise Ivan.

1327
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,400
Anyway, we're going to take it up to the news.

1328
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,160
From PR News in Washington, I'm involved in a prostitution ring.

1329
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,860
President Bush says the U.S. will help Poland modernize its childhood obesity.

1330
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,360
Mr. Bush says health officials are overweight.

1331
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,240
I'm optimistic that we'll be able to live in deprivation and fear.

1332
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,020
Health officials say children and teenagers are not immune from congressional and congressional

1333
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,020


1334
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,020


1335
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,020


1336
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,020


1337
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,200
subpoenas, as claimed by the Bush administration.

1338
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,820
The president also said today that this is PR News in Washington.

1339
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:59,580
A thanks to Leimur for that and PR News and laughing.

1340
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,460
This has been Hour of Slight Number 1143 with Dr. Hal Pasling, Evidence, Philo Drummond,

1341
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:12,320
John Hell, Mongoloid, and Kay Rob in San Francisco, Dr. Sinister and Princess Pisces, and Lonesome

1342
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:17,000
Cowboy Dave on WCSB Cleveland, and Governor Ratnar, and No Money Mark, and Dr. Robert

1343
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,000


1344
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,000


1345
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,040
Lowe, and the movie soundtrack that is so weird is from Slipstream, and the background

1346
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:27,680
music is Bonobo's Convergence from Last X Day and Next X Day.

1347
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:32,440
And now, from Norell, this message.

1348
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,480
For the safety of your smile, see your dentist twice a day.

1349
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:44,340
The Bob Show, starring Bob and his guest star, Lone Thrill.

1350
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,580
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?

1351
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,180
This is Bob.

1352
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,540
I was so glad to be back, I went down to the blood bank and gave a pint of blood.

1353
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,700
W.C. Fields was there, too.

1354
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,540
He donated a fifth.

1355
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,320
Trip the Light, fantastic.

1356
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:10,380
Have you tried going a little buggy with a girl and a horse with a horse?

1357
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,220
The horse wants to go out for a little buggy.

1358
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,300
Get a horse, black or brown or gray.

1359
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:16,980
But a horse wants to go out for a little buggy.

1360
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,100
Get a horse.

1361
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,860
Robert, quit putting it in your pipe.

1362
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:21,440
Jugs.

1363
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,980
I thought you used your nose for that.

1364
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,500
You talk like I was a freak.

1365
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,540
I was a freak, freak, freak.

1366
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,940
Father, I'm down here with a nice young man.

1367
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:30,940
Get a horse.

1368
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,000
Hello.

1369
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,100
Wrong number.

1370
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,520
Uh-oh.

1371
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,140
Hello.

1372
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:35,800
Hello.

1373
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,140
Remove that film.

1374
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,860
Quickly, easily, safely.

1375
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:39,960
No one.

1376
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,280
No one.

1377
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:40,800
Get a tube.

1378
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,380
Get a tube.

1379
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,760
Ladies and gentlemen, you really like the girls, don't you?

1380
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,240
Yes, Bob, I do.

1381
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:46,920
I'm a little bit scared.

1382
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:46,960
I'm a little bit scared.

1383
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:46,960


1384
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:46,960


1385
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:46,960


1386
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,200
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce one of the reals of genius.

1387
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,040
Thank you very much.

1388
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,200
I presume you're Bob the genius.

1389
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,440
I'm becoming known as the Bob of this generation.

1390
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:58,480
Bob.

1391
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,360
Magic Bob.

1392
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,160
I know, Bob.

1393
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,340
Why do I stand here reading this stripe when I can get a good job at Lockheed?

1394
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:04,440
I'm Bob.

1395
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,340
Sit down, Bob.

1396
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,520
I'll read your future.

1397
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,880
I can tell you who's going to be in the White House.

1398
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,880
I do a lot of deep thinking.

1399
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:12,540
Get loaded.

1400
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,360
So, uh, someone died?

1401
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:16,900
Yeah, died.

1402
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:16,960


1403
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,300
Ah, Dobs.

1404
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,880
You wrote the part of Ray for an African American, right?

1405
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:21,960
I did.

1406
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,160
Yeah, man.

1407
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,080
What's wrong with you?

1408
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:24,720
Are you on drugs?

1409
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:25,420
No.

1410
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:25,580
No.

1411
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,180
I'm not on drugs.

1412
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,320
Ray, the character that Dobs was playing was black.

1413
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,620
Dobs wasn't a black actor, man.

1414
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,520
He was white, like her.

1415
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,140
Oh, my God.

1416
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,480
Why did you kill me off feelings?

1417
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,320
Barbara.

1418
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,800
I was just a script supervisor.

1419
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,820
That's all I was.

1420
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,800
Miss Barbara.

1421
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,680
Now, you have no continuity.

1422
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:46,960
You have no authority.

1423
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:46,960


1424
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:46,960


1425
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,400
Nothing makes sense anymore.

1426
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,240
It's so unfair.

1427
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,160
It's just so unfair.

1428
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:03,220
So unfair.

1429
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:04,780
Go, go.

1430
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,480
Mommy.

1431
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,180
Mommy.

1432
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:19,520
In dealing with supernatural reanimated mummies that play the old age home.

1433
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,060
Just like DJs at Pirate Cat Radio, ladies and gentlemen.

1434
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,140
One day they are going to mummify us.

1435
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,220
And it will be an honor.

1436
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:33,500
Your encrusted sarcophagus, rich with jewels and hieroglyphs,

1437
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:38,700
will be lowered into your own personal vault and sealed by the sands of time.

1438
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,040
I want to be frozen in loose art.

1439
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,400
Like Bob did.

1440
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,300
Bob is, one of the Bobs is in loose art.

1441
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,520
To be frozen in the ice.

1442
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,800
Scott Scraper in Dallas, which we lost.

1443
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,140
Lost? Where did it go?

1444
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,360
Well, I mean, we lost ownership of it.

1445
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,820
But that's where Bob is? One of the Bobs?

1446
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,000
The one that puzzling evidence shot.

1447
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,580
Damn you.

1448
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,240
But he's like a...

1449
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,740
Was a real flesh and blood Bob, that Bob.

1450
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:07,600
Wow.

1451
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,120
The scary Bob.

1452
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,160
When I introduced...

1453
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,300
When I introduced people to that Bob, they would...

1454
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,680
I remember where I was that day.

1455
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,680
...do a great big double take.

1456
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:20,240
The last thing you expect is actually to be introduced to Bob.

1457
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,740
A small Bob.

1458
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:28,520
But then came that terrible day, the Victoria Theatre Show.

1459
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:35,800
The anniversary of the beheading of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.

1460
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,080
The assassination of Bob.

1461
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,160
Yeah, we all remember Bob.

1462
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:41,160


1463
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,160
We all remember where we were that day, don't we?

1464
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,240
I know where I was.

1465
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:43,620
In Indiana.

1466
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,940
And it's on videotape to prove it.

1467
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,060
So, we have one Bob buried in Dallas.

1468
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,360
Is that right?

1469
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,460
Well, if you go back over the Hinkey Commission hearings,

1470
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:08,900
the entire official answer was sort of cobbled together out of variant strains of rumor and innuendo.

1471
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,740
Where's the director?

1472
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:11,460
No!

1473
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,200
Let's get on with it!

1474
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,000
Cut! Cut! Cut!

1475
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,440
Cut! Cut! Cut!

1476
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,100
Hey, Harvey!

1477
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,840
I didn't know you were...

1478
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,760
It's his money, isn't it?

1479
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,480
Well, I'm sorry, but you got a shot.

1480
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,520
Hot shot! What are you talking about?

1481
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,160
What are you doing?

1482
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,580
I gotta get out.

1483
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,020
I'm gonna get out of here.

1484
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,260
What are you doing?

1485
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:42,780
I'm going to get back.

1486
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:42,780


1487
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:44,860
I'm sorry!

1488
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:45,240
Oh, my God!

1489
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,520
I've gotta get back.

1490
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,380
It's four o'clock.

1491
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,140
It's four o'clock.

1492
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:48,960
My time's up.

1493
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,200
My time's up.

1494
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:50,840
I've gotta go back.

1495
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,960
Please, don't be crazy.

1496
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,740
My time's up.

1497
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,520
I've gotta go back.

1498
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,500
I've gotta get back.

1499
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,380
I've gotta get back.

1500
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,260
I'm almost home.

1501
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,000
I'm here to hear it.

1502
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,120
Please, don't hurt us!

1503
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,040
We're not gonna hurt him.

1504
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,040
What's wrong?

1505
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,380
You have some kind of medication?

1506
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:02,840
Hey!

1507
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,440
Wait, wait!

1508
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:04,660
Oh, my God!

1509
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:05,940
Oh, my God!

1510
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,220
Oh, my God!

1511
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,100
Oh, my God!

1512
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,180
Oh, my God!

1513
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:08,360
Oh, my God!

1514
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,900
Oh, my God!

1515
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,420
What's that, dear?

1516
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,800
Oh, yes, I heard.

1517
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,120
I heard.

1518
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,200
Poor old Felix.

1519
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,040
Cut!

1520
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,940
That's lunch, everyone.

1521
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,060
That's it.

1522
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:32,620
Good.

1523
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,340
Take care.

1524
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1525
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1526
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1527
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1528
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1529
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1530
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1531
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1532
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1533
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1534
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1535
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1536
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1537
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1538
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1539
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1540
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1541
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1542
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,340


1543
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,740
Now I will count three.

1544
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,860
At the count of three, you will wake up and remember nothing.

1545
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,020
One, two, three.

1546
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,720
Ten thousand dollars. What do you know?

1547
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,720
Yes, beautiful, isn't it?

1548
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,760
Ah, this castle is filled with rare old treasures.

1549
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,900
Feel free to browse, my friend.

1550
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,420
Thank you very much.

1551
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,160
A pleasant good evening to you.

1552
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:08,980
Thank you.
