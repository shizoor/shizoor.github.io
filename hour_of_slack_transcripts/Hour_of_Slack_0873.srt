1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,180
Life dropped by the fantastic bag. Well, welcome to the hour of slack.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:17,000
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag. Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,720
Whoa. Oh, man. Don't take that pill.

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,240
What about the New Fuzzlums we have to worry about? The people...

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,340
The people from New Fuzzland?

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,400
Yeah, the people from New Fuzzlums.

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,660
With the new fuzzles, with the big cyclops eye on top that you're talking about?

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,760
They're self-created people, much like the old Bodhi Dharmas of old.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,580
And, you know, they just spring into existence.

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,660
You can always sharpen things to a fuzzy focus or blur them to crystal clarity.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,660
Thank God for that.

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,160
No, I don't think you can.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,440
You were right.

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,980
You are not in control of the train.

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,040
I debuked everything.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,980
You debuked it fully.

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,080
I debuked everything.

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,320
And he rebuked it.

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,180
Thank you, Tim, for bringing it up, too, I might say.

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,560
And rightfully so, because, you know, we're hip.

21
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,040
You know, we're beatnik rabbits.

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,700
You can't...

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,500
You ain't gonna control the fuzziness or the sharpness or focus or anything.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,560
Have any of you two fellows ever heard of Madcap Jack?

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,120
We're just down there for the ride.

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,280
Just admit it.

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,600
Madcap Jack, who was shortly around the same time as Jack the Ripper,

28
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,620
who might have been a time traveler.

29
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,240
He would, like, appear on London streets and squirt people.

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,780
He would squirt guns and then bound over hedges and stuff.

31
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,600
Oh, Spring Heels Jack.

32
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,660
Spring Heels Jack.

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,400
Yeah.

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,960
Yeah, that's his name.

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,720
Spring Heels.

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,600
That was the same...

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,420
That was the grandpappy of the Spring Heels, the crop circle maker.

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,720
Now, you've really heard of Spring Heels.

39
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,640
Crop circle making Jack, I mean.

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,660
But nobody ever discovered who Spring Heels Jack really was.

41
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,540
I'm telling you, it's the same family that does the crop circles.

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,060
And they mess with people's minds.

43
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,980
That's what they do.

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,300
They're descendants of Sonny Bean, the Scottish serial killer and cannibal,

45
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,820
who really got a bad rap.

46
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,940
And they're now a clan of secret scientists

47
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,860
who do the crop circles and cattle mutilations and so forth

48
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,360
just to keep the CIA scared.

49
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,640
Trash, he says, old Kenny got a bad rap.

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,140
It's the old Outer Limits routine of the, you know,

51
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,080
the secret scientists getting together to scare the governments

52
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,280
with a fake alien.

53
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,900
Yeah.

54
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,120
Yeah.

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,940
Richmond and have...

56
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,520
It was another example of that.

57
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,760
But the Church of the Subgenius is not.

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,160
These aliens are real and they are going to destroy the world.

59
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,820
Why even care if they have an alien or not?

60
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,820
Huh?

61
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,180
Why even care if they have an alien or not?

62
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,900
Well, it is sort of out of our control.

63
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,080
They have one or they don't have one.

64
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,560
Who cares?

65
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,100
He's into oblivion, man.

66
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,040
He's a beatnik tonight.

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,140
You know, he's like...

68
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,040
No, no, no, no.

69
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,080
It don't matter.

70
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,260
Blessed, blessed oblivion.

71
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,640
Man.

72
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,740
The sweet smack, the horse riding over the top of your hooves.

73
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,500
There's nothing to climb for, man.

74
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,620
That's true.

75
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,560
The rat race is self-exceeding.

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,500
What about more money and more things?

77
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,360
That is the self-exceeding rat race

78
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
that climbs in and out of your colon on a daily basis.

79
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,360
You know, he hit guys with the most toys wins.

80
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,160
That's what I was always...

81
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,140
Or was implied by the pink world anyway.

82
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,000
I was told the one who dies with the most tools

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,180
is the quickest one.

84
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,100
He dig his way out.

85
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,180
The Pharaoh told you that, didn't he?

86
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,280
Yeah, Pharaoh told me that he did.

87
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,580
Back in the day, man.

88
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,840
Yeah, he was working for the Pharaoh back in the day.

89
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,720
He who dies with the most slaves wins.

90
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
And he who slobbers the most

91
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,060
and his pancreatic juices

92
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,840
is the one who wins.

93
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,240
Well, I'm working on that.

94
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,120
Do I have to be buried with my cats?

95
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,320
Because they're just going to use me...

96
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,100
What do you mean it's a litter box?

97
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,520
No, you build a separate sarcophagus for them

98
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,060
that looks like a pyramid or a finx.

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,860
You have them mummified too.

100
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,140
Or it's only it's free.

101
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,580
They use freeze-drying now.

102
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,580
Yes, they've been freeze-drying cats

103
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,140
for quite some years now.

104
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,260
I've got several of my little dogs

105
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,660
and one goat done that way around my house.

106
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,060
So you have some jerky to eat in the afterlife.

107
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,360
Yep.

108
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,400
A snack for the supernatural traveler.

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,300
Yeah, to take with you.

110
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,300


111
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,300


112
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,300


113
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,300


114
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,300


115
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,300


116
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,120
And that's what this show is, dear friends.

117
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,920
A little something for the supernatural traveler

118
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,940
to take with you.

119
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,140
This is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

120
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,940
And I'm so sick with this cold

121
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,880
that everybody has that I'm not even standing up

122
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,280
over at the mix board.

123
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,780
I brought the microphone over to my computer.

124
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,300
I don't even...

125
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,840
I don't even care.

126
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,560
Don't care.

127
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,040
Don't care.

128
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,520
I'm too tired and snotty

129
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,220
to make a special mix of a show

130
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,380
with all the wonderful new contributions

131
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,480
from strangers that we get.

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,320
I'll have to do that next time.

133
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,640
I just don't have it in me to mix it up, man.

134
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,300
Luckily, in previous weeks,

135
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
we were healthier and mixed it up live

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,720
on various live broadcasts,

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,100
such as we just heard ESO Swamp Radio

138
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,520
from WCSB Cleveland.

139
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,300
And also tonight, we're going to be hearing

140
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,740
lots and lots more of the subgenius business retreat

141
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,160
conclave recordings from KPFA

142
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,460
last December 2002.

143
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,160
KPFA Radio in Berkeley

144
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,300
allowed us to do that.

145
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,900
Over the edge and puzzling evidence

146
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,200
to provide this smattering

147
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
of earthly entertainment.

148
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,640
Praise St. Stupid.

149
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,020
We'll take a short break

150
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,140
and let's have a little entertainment.

151
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,900
And you can call in

152
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,380
4425 at the 510 nickel and dime code area

153
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,100
so you can...

154
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,960
Call us.

155
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,780
The Church of the Subgenius

156
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,980
and the First Church of the Last Life

157
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,340
is the most powerful religion

158
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,860
right here to answer your spiritual

159
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,300
and financial questions.

160
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,940
Thank you.

161
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,200
Thank you.

162
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,820
Give us a call.

163
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,980
Another 100 years of this?

164
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:45,920
That's right.

165
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,880
Coming your way.

166
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,640
I think that's the Not You Gary microphone.

167
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,360
Oh, okay.

168
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,920
Not you.

169
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,160
Oh, is it not on or something?

170
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,280
Oh, no, wait a minute.

171
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,300
Not me.

172
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,540
Yeah, he's there at the Gary Cool Lounge.

173
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,340
The Lizard Lounge.

174
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,500
Yes, flat on my stomach.

175
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,140
My butt in the air getting a little sun-shiny.

176
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,860
That's what they do down in Santa Cruz.

177
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,900
How much does it cost to become cold-blooded?

178
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,320
And how extensive is that operation?

179
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,400
Or those operations?

180
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,120
It's not much.

181
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,280
It's not much.

182
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,280


183
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,280


184
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,280


185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,280


186
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,280


187
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,280


188
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,280


189
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,280


190
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,280


191
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,280


192
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,280


193
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,840
It's covered under our...

194
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,160
Well, most faculty members actually are cold-blooded.

195
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,440
Really?

196
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:35,980
Yeah.

197
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,180
It doesn't really mean anything.

198
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,100
You mean like Eohippus Love Child?

199
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,780
Obvious in the face of it.

200
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,000
The poor little Eohippus that couldn't come here.

201
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,260
No, she's a dick.

202
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,980
She lives a life of freedom and happiness in the pasture.

203
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,780
You do what you do because you love to.

204
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,080
I do what I do because my mom told me to.

205
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,780
Copyright 1981.

206
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,920
Dr. Slovak.

207
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,080
That's your turn.

208
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,340
It's your turn here on the show.

209
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,440
So 848-VAL.

210
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,160
Who's going to roll for the call?

211
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,620
And the caller?

212
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,100
Go right ahead.

213
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,900
Don't call.

214
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,900
I dare you.

215
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,080
I dare you to call.

216
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,540
I dare you to drive with your knee as you call on your cell phone.

217
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,300
508-4825.

218
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,160
I like the don't ask, don't call talk.

219
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,400
Give it a try.

220
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,260
We are going to lose a caller out there.

221
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,720
Go ahead.

222
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,280
Come on in.

223
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:22,920
Ornate?

224
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,920
Are we Nate?

225
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,960
We're Ornate.

226
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,720
Ornate?

227
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,300
Yeah.

228
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,180
That's friends from real Clinton.

229
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,280
That's a good one.

230
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,280


231
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,280


232
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,280


233
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,500
I'm going to join the church of the genius.

234
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:31,920
Okay.

235
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,660
How much do you got?

236
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,160
I got a pound of grand here and a grand there.

237
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,780
Okay.

238
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,140
Well, it sounds grand to us.

239
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,620
Hello?

240
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,320
Why don't you go out and invest in crispy green donuts and bring them on down.

241
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:43,900
Hello?

242
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,160
Don't do grand dives.

243
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,540
He's doing a backwards call in which he says hello and hangs up.

244
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,520
You talk about your grand there and your grand there and you hang up the phone.

245
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,520
He's a contrarian just like a little big man.

246
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,680
It is true that there is a thing I do not understand.

247
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,260
What?

248
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,000
There's a pain between my ears.

249
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,060
That's your life, Reverend.

250
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,040
It tastes just like chicken.

251
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,880
When did it start?

252
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,440
That's how I felt.

253
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,560
I thought it was the show actually.

254
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,740
When did that show start?

255
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,400
It is.

256
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,720
It's the show that's the painful thing in your ears.

257
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,860
Lean closer to your radio.

258
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,220
Look in the little tiny speaker slid.

259
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,320
Put your hands on the radio.

260
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,860
Look deep inside the bowels of your radio.

261
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,240
Do you see that tiny little glow?

262
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,500
And now stand up and feel the power of the show coursing through your body.

263
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,860
So call 848-445 right now.

264
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,180
510-848-445.

265
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,200
Okay.

266
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,860
Here's a caller.

267
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,500
And help us pick all of it.

268
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,120
It is as if they are walking out.

269
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,260
First of all, I want to thank you for being here.

270
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,780
The first thing we're going to do is push you in the deep end.

271
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,160
It's like the old days.

272
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,920
I'm moving to the dock to go to Carrie.

273
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,720
It is like the old days.

274
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,020
The first, the very first subgenius show on the 26th of June, 1982, was a five-hour show.

275
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:40,780
Really?

276
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,740
Who was on it?

277
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,700
Lies, Dr. Albert Tsang, and Palsy Nevins.

278
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:54,380
And I had these special pills that were white on one side and blue on the other.

279
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,840
So I cut them in half and distributed the white parts and we yacked and had fun all night.

280
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,200
That's right.

281
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,000
Four o'clock I just rooted the blue parts.

282
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,500
Oh, good.

283
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
And you go out and hold it.

284
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,000
That's right.

285
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,260
Yeah.

286
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,640
That was back in the day before you had to pee in your refrigerator every night.

287
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:14,960
That's right.

288
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,380
That's right.

289
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,340
Yeah, just to open it.

290
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,000
Come on down.

291
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,140
Later in your life.

292
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:18,700
You may not open.

293
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,440
You may not access your own beer.

294
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,320
There's two callers now.

295
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,060
Two callers.

296
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,620
Two callers.

297
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,100
Yes.

298
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,440
One.

299
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,060
Kill them.

300
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,640
Caller number one.

301
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,520
Kill the callers.

302
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:25,720
Kill.

303
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,800
Wrong pee prep.

304
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,020
Cannot open.

305
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,480
Authorization not given for refrigerator.

306
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,740
What about 21 years?

307
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,440
Nor toilet.

308
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,840
You've been listening for 21 years?

309
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,600
Running around your apartment full of big tubes.

310
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,880
Nothing's opening up for you.

311
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,080
None of the files will open.

312
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,100
You've been listening for 21 years?

313
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,380
I do.

314
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,420
If I piss, the whole place will go up.

315
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,360
I haven't been in the chat for 21 years.

316
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,360
Man.

317
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,200
I've got too many sensors in my suit.

318
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,340
The government will know right away.

319
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,740
Don't, don't pass out.

320
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,460
Please don't.

321
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,720
No.

322
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,440
Don't stop.

323
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,760
I won't pass out.

324
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,180
I've got to.

325
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,980
I've got to.

326
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,900
I've got to.

327
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,460
Yeah.

328
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,460
I've got to.

329
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,560
I've got to.

330
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:56,800
I've got to.

331
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,500
I've got to.

332
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:57,880
I've got to.

333
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,380
I've got to.

334
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,880
Get down, damn it!

335
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,000
Slow 10.

336
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:01,860
It is.

337
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,600
It's slow 10 time.

338
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,380
So I may speak again about this nonceless babble that speaks within my mind.

339
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,020
Babylon.

340
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,320
Babylon.

341
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,240
So now I must draw comics and send them to homeless people where they look at me crazy

342
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,900
and call me weird as much people do because I walk around with underwear on my head.

343
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,460
Anyway, when I do that, they look at me and they call me the do.

344
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,980
So what does hooki do mean when I'm hooki do?

345
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,400
You're on break for 21 years.

346
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,520
Well, silly, I'm using a paper.

347
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,400
Watch your language.

348
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,580
Watch your language.

349
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,760
Even late at night, little kids could be listening in on their earphones.

350
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,380
They fell asleep listening to Britney Spears.

351
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:33,940
See what happens?

352
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,640
A special tone kills the bad word.

353
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,960
In their subconscious, like you're bleeding into their ears.

354
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,800
You said that word.

355
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:43,900
Government?

356
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,780
We're in love with all the callers.

357
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,240
Don't forget.

358
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,020
Yes, friends.

359
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,600
The church of the subgenius is a church of love.

360
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,540
Guaranteed.

361
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,740
We reach out with love.

362
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,500
We love you.

363
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,220
We love the holidays.

364
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,860
Hate squared might as well be love in this church.

365
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,020
That's right.

366
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,480
That's right.

367
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:06,220
When we talk about all that hate and killing, what we really meant was love and sex and sweet talk.

368
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,520
What's the connection between this church and the bonobo business?

369
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,040
Well, if you kiss a bonobo before the dissection.

370
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,060
Really?

371
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,760
Is that the problem?

372
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,960
Kiss the bonobo before the dissection?

373
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,060
Robin refused to kiss the bonobo before she dissected it.

374
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,220
Oh.

375
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,140
What kind of wimp is she?

376
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,120
God.

377
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,180
Is that a chance?

378
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,520
It's a frozen bonobo.

379
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,040
It came from, it had to come all the way from the San Francisco Zoo.

380
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,760
Before she dissected it.

381
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,740
It was driven down to Santa Cruz.

382
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,640
She has a tough and weird.

383
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,240
Maybe the lips had kind of like thawed out and she was kind of like.

384
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,860
Yes, these are the kind of people that throw up and weird.

385
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,600
These are our church members.

386
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,820
And you could be a member of our church too if you call MD484.

387
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,980
Our name is bigrigindustries.org I think it is.

388
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,220
No, it's ststupid.com.

389
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:53,800
Ststupid.com.

390
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,840
It kind of looks like aliens.

391
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,280
So if you're curled up in your bed with your laptop.

392
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,760
Ststupid.com.

393
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,220
Ststupid.com.

394
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,120
I hope you're not curled up in your bed with your laptop.

395
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,280
Yeah, do it.

396
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,680
It's better you're fried.

397
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,480
Dot com.

398
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,580
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-I-N-O.com.

399
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,000
You have all kinds of dreams that are happening in your mind.

400
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,620
You know, you're visiting different states and you're thinking of religion and bonobos.

401
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,360
And you're starting to drift and you're thinking I got to not fall over because I'm going to

402
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,020
fall face first into the chili or the cereal and spill it right on the keyboard.

403
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,760
Or the dashboard.

404
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,580
Why did I put it on the bed like this?

405
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,040
I better remind myself to get up.

406
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,620
I'm driving with my knees while I call you.

407
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,220
You're not in bed.

408
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,260
You're in your car.

409
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,180
You're going 70 miles an hour.

410
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,840
I'm going 70 miles an hour.

411
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,980
Wake up!

412
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,120
Up and forward.

413
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,020
Add digital sound effects at this time.

414
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,460
We can fix that in post production.

415
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,280
It is true there is a thing here I do not understand.

416
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,000
Do you know all the more why I'm here.

417
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000


418
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000


419
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000


420
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000


421
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000


422
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000


423
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000


424
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000


425
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000


426
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,780
There is a pain between my ears.

427
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:04,280
And so the confused initiate was led to Dockstock, Dobstown itself.

428
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,160
Dobstown Malaysia, where he was shocked to discover the most primitive possible living

429
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,560
condition.

430
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,480
As I entered the bedroom, there were two elderly albino women robed entirely in black.

431
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,760
Lavinia's insides were all torn up.

432
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,580
Now, uh, now, uh...

433
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,960
Bizarre.

434
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,300
Yeah.

435
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,500
It's kind of funny, too.

436
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,060
Minimal brain dysfunction.

437
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,080
I'm that kind of a guy.

438
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,620
Uh...

439
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,880
Questionable.

440
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,880
Ejaculation.

441
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,440
Unemotionally.

442
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,060
Ejaculation.

443
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,220
You know, we have met your sons and daughters.

444
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,120
Earth was inhabited by, uh, species.

445
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:49,740
Uh...

446
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,720
Species from another dimension.

447
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,340
With certain chants from the book, sacrifices.

448
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,700
This race, the old ones, can be brought back.

449
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,560
And mankind?

450
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,880
Destroyed.

451
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,760
A sizeless, shapeless spirit manifestation of pure evil.

452
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Pure evil.

453
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,880
Not evil.

454
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,940
Not pure evil.

455
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,740
But pure evil.

456
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,040
Much like old Spring-Eels Jack, he was.

457
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,400
He'd, uh, disappear and never reappear.

458
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:29,740
Spring-Eel Jack.

459
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,820
Now, you know...

460
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,540
Spring-Heels.

461
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,020
Heels.

462
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,300
I couldn't hear it.

463
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,320
Oh, Spring-Heels.

464
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,060
Hey, did you guys hear about Bigfoot?

465
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,120
No, we smelled him, though.

466
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,220
Bigfoot's a man who...

467
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,320
He died.

468
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,080
...who was most responsible for certain Bigfoot evidence.

469
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,400
Most of them.

470
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:45,580
Died.

471
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,400
And his...

472
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,860
Just some Bigfoot evidence.

473
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:47,860


474
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:47,860


475
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:47,860


476
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,620
And some of that evidence that people have been seeing Bigfeet for centuries.

477
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,960
Yeah, but he got, like...

478
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,280
Was he crushed?

479
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,220
He hired, like, townspeople.

480
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,900
Like, this one lady came forward and said that she was Bigfoot one time in one of the

481
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,220
videos.

482
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,300
And she was, in that slap-happy kind of Arkham sex way.

483
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,800
She was big everywhere.

484
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,100
Well, it was like a town joke.

485
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,400
It wasn't like his own joke.

486
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,600
It was like a town joke.

487
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:14,020
The conspiracy wants to convince the humans that there's no such thing as yetis, for good

488
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,640
reasons.

489
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,840
I think that's great, that it was a town joke, that Bigfoot was a freak.

490
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:17,840


491
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:17,840


492
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,600
I think it was a freaking town joke.

493
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,980
As it should be.

494
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,300
You know, a community who's got their own pet who lives and eats grubs and nuts.

495
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,660
Now, just because, you know, one little old man is Bigfoot and does all the crop circles

496
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,400
doesn't mean that all the Bigfeet are that same little old man.

497
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,120
That's true.

498
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,420
So you're saying the same man who was...

499
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,940
Is Bigfoot to the small community?

500
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,340
The Yeti actually live...

501
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:40,780
Crop circles?

502
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,620
The Yeti live on today in the form of you, Dave.

503
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,480
Well, they live...

504
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,220
And you, Chaz.

505
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,920
They live on rice and beans when they have to.

506
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,280
Now, what proof is there of that?

507
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,100
Wild oats.

508
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,540
You're gigantic peckers.

509
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,600
Gigantic peckers.

510
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,620
This is not a Tex Avery cartoon.

511
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,040
And your huge personalities and egos are proof of Yeti descent.

512
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,180
So that's what it takes, huge organs and huge egos.

513
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,660
Well, no, or in my case, real short legs and a real large head and long arms that kind

514
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,080
of drag across the ground.

515
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,300
Well, for Mike's...

516
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,380
I mean, there's various different traits of the Yeti.

517
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,400
But yeah, I mean, the Yeti is certainly still around.

518
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,620
Yeti's our president was an old saw.

519
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,580
I remember that very vaguely because of what happened last night.

520
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,300
I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.

521
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:39,420
The back of my head, once again, keeps on getting the brunt of every...

522
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,260
You ever strike yourself more than once in the same day and you think you're cursed by

523
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,520
some...

524
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,940
Oh, I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave.

525
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,940
It is over again.

526
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,980
You can never leave.

527
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:47,980
You can never leave.

528
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,940
We can never leave because we have never arrived.

529
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,340
We're in here.

530
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,300
Yeah.

531
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,840
Yeah.

532
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,900
So now we're driving high above Berkeley.

533
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,520
You can look down and see the city.

534
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,640
You can see Gary's hair from up here.

535
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:10,960
Wow.

536
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,120
And the hospital.

537
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,260
It's beautiful the way it ruffles in the wind.

538
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,700
I think we can rock out now.

539
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,280
It's hard to see.

540
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,680
It's hard to tell his hair from the highway.

541
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,380
It sure is cold.

542
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,020
Some of the stress is...

543
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,800
Make the bass player come back.

544
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,180
Which one's Cowboy Dave?

545
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,400
Which one's Chaz?

546
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,700
Chaz is the skinny one and Dave is the upside down one.

547
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,240
Oh, okay.

548
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,580
Little icons here on the top.

549
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:32,940
I see.

550
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,620
You go over here and you can...

551
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,480
No, no.

552
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,160
Don't go over there.

553
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,860
That'll crash the whole thing.

554
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,600
Oh, jeez.

555
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,860
I think Saint Stupid's rubbing that harmonica on his leg like a cricket.

556
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,280
I think he's rubbing it on his leg.

557
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,280


558
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,280


559
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,280


560
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,280


561
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,280


562
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,660
It's the same as his.

563
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,940
Is this what they call an experience?

564
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:51,880
Yeah.

565
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
Or is this one of those happenings?

566
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,240
Yeah.

567
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,800
What do you call it?

568
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,600
What's this a thing?

569
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,020
The show changes entirely in 11 minutes.

570
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,000
Just completely.

571
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,020
Oh, that's right.

572
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,180
Because that other show starts.

573
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:02,680
Yeah.

574
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,680
And you won't be able to...

575
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,320
I mean, you'll just...

576
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,020
It's mind blowing.

577
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,400
The whole thing's just mind blowing.

578
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:07,880
Is it another show?

579
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,760
There's more than a name and less than a dare?

580
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,640
Yeah, less than a tape or something, yeah.

581
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,280
Oh, yeah.

582
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,040
More than four hours.

583
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,540
Tape of a tape of a tape of a tape.

584
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:15,860
That's true.

585
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,260
That's true.

586
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,260


587
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,260


588
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,200
Of an MP3.

589
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:17,660
Yeah.

590
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,460
Of 20,000 hours of MP3 on one CD.

591
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,600
You can't ever listen to it in your entire life.

592
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,660
But it's every show ever done, so you keep it in your library anyway.

593
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,040
That's right.

594
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,060
Just so you can say you have it.

595
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,020
Yeah, I have every show ever done, yeah.

596
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,240
I do have every show ever done.

597
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,320
On your pop pod?

598
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,440
But it's not on MP5 or anything.

599
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,900
It's not on some little file, man.

600
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,620
Every show.

601
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,700
It's on a big, bulky thing.

602
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:47,760
Ever done by anyone will be on this one holocube owned by this man in the U.S. government.

603
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,380
He's got your name.

604
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,480
He's got your number.

605
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,520
And he's sharing it with everyone else.

606
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,200
It's President Michael Jackson.

607
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,480
He owns everything.

608
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,760
And here he is.

609
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,760
Information is finally free.

610
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,980
Looks just like him, doesn't it?

611
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,580
Please follow the yellow line.

612
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,680
I feel so much better.

613
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,160
Better now.

614
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,580
Man, it's been weird ever since the pigs started driving those yellow submarines.

615
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,780
Submariners once.

616
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,880
Submariners twice.

617
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,300
Holy jugglers, Jesus Christ.

618
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,580
We go up.

619
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,640
We go down.

620
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,700
We don't even fuck around.

621
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,260
Submariners!

622
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,960
What you gonna do?

623
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,900
Last line is just silly.

624
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,180
Whoa.

625
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,700
Whoa.

626
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,320
Whoa.

627
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,000
Whoa.

628
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,580
Whoa.

629
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,420
Whoa.

630
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:39,600


631
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:39,920


632
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:39,920


633
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:39,920


634
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,080
Whoa.

635
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:40,920


636
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:40,980


637
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:40,980


638
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,060


639
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:41,560


640
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:41,640


641
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:41,640


642
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:41,640


643
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:41,640


644
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:41,680
Whoa.

645
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:41,680


646
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:41,680


647
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:41,680


648
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:41,680


649
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:41,680


650
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:41,680


651
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:41,680


652
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,100
Whoa.

653
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:42,940
Whoa.

654
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,360
Whoa.

655
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,940
Whoa.

656
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,120
Whoa.

657
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,120


658
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,120


659
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,760
I liked it last time I was here in the 80s.

660
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,980
Yeah, things have changed in the intervening 20 years.

661
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,500
Rip.

662
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,540
Rip Van De Broek, man.

663
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,160
A man, a stone age man from the past resurrected.

664
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,200
He was one of the creators, the inventors of the stone show.

665
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,880
Can I get my typewriter fixed?

666
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,020
Anybody here know how to...

667
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,680
How to...

668
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,360
How to use a hammer?

669
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,340
Gary.

670
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:13,940
Hey, look.

671
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,800
The Iceman.

672
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,660
Princess Wee is doing a howl.

673
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,960
Is that...

674
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,480
Like this.

675
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,520
Will you fall asleep on the show?

676
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,740
Joining the listener in blessed slumber.

677
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,840
Because it is so relaxing.

678
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,200
From Princess Wee.

679
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:40,500
Well, Mr. Gabro Fran, having been resurrected from your icy sleep for at least intervening

680
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,680
20 years.

681
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,460
Or sleeping or whatever you were doing.

682
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,860
What changes do you find especially remarkable in the show and society around it?

683
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,140
Well, one thing is you don't have to wind up the show anymore before you use it.

684
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,300
It has a battery now.

685
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,040
That's really good.

686
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,120
You know, I remember back before the show, you had remote controls.

687
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:11,160
You had to push actual buttons on the physical show.

688
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,680
You couldn't do anything.

689
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,760
You couldn't stand across the city from it and activate the controls like puzzling evidence

690
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,560
is doing now.

691
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,820
We used to have to subdue Mobius Rex before we could actually...

692
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,620
There's no Mobius here to subdue.

693
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,020
Do not resist.

694
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,800
There's no nattering neighbors.

695
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,400
No nattering neighbors.

696
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,520
How can you have nine babies on the new show?

697
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,520
I'm so sad.

698
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,380
The show is a living...

699
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,380
The rugs of nattering maybobs.

700
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,200
This whole show.

701
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,320
I've tried to be as much of a...

702
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,960
God, every time I watch that, I want to shoot myself.

703
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,960
Is that that ghost again?

704
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:53,820
Yup.

705
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,420
No.

706
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,040
Those things that drift in from outside.

707
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,780
The old rock bands are better than the new ones, you know.

708
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,700
The old rock bands...

709
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,020
Negi loves the old ways back.

710
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,200
It's one of those old...

711
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,580
It's one of those old...

712
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,120
Old...

713
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,600
Narnunu and rules.

714
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:12,600


715
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:12,600


716
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:12,600


717
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,760
In front of Pebbles.

718
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,660
You know, it's funny.

719
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,240
My dad said the same thing.

720
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,500
He said the old rock bands were the best.

721
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,580
Yeah, I mean, he meant the really old ones.

722
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,580
Yeah, he was talking about Bob Wills.

723
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,860
I'm talking about like, you know, Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix and, you know...

724
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,660
Well...

725
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,180
They're really good.

726
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,000
You know, they had to die to be good.

727
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,300
Yeah, you know, they fought...

728
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,840
Now, when you die, you'll be good.

729
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,620
The bands that fought the system are dead, you know.

730
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,260
They're long dead.

731
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,300
Maybe they're all rest in peace.

732
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,660
Yeah, the Miles and Bob is...

733
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,620
What does that tell you?

734
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,400
If you...

735
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,020
If you want to be good...

736
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,000
Die!

737
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,580
Don't sell out.

738
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,960
That's what I was saying earlier.

739
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,920
Oh, yeah, and die too.

740
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,420
But, yeah, don't sell out, you know.

741
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,140
Two keys?

742
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,140


743
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,120
Increase sales.

744
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,760
Kill the deal.

745
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,520
Don't become part of the beast.

746
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,580
Don't sell out.

747
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,740
You know, that's why I enjoy shows like this because, you know, it's untouched by that

748
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,940
media crap, you know.

749
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,300
Untouched?

750
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,620
Well, you know what I mean.

751
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,100
Why?

752
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,100
It's not like...

753
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,260
I think he means I didn't wipe well enough or something.

754
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,880
Yeah, I think so.

755
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,780
I could tell that.

756
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,240
I think so.

757
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,660
Well, do you have a question for the Clean Up UFOs?

758
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,460
Uh...

759
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,260
Huh?

760
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,980
We're just feeling a little bit sick back here.

761
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,300
What?

762
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,960
I don't feel so well, but please, ask any questions to the Clean Up UFOs that you'd

763
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,280
like to ask.

764
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,400
Oh, look, he became shy.

765
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:26,640
Chill, man.

766
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,180
That happens when you're up against a superhero.

767
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,400
But, acids were the most likely to sell because they were sexy.

768
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:35,920
Oh.

769
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:36,980
Wow.

770
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,720
Mm-hmm.

771
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,400
Not you, Gary.

772
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,220
Potential big deal.

773
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,360
Yeah, I was gonna say, like, I'm not gonna lie.

774
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:40,360


775
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:40,360


776
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,840
The big dick buyers began lining up as soon as we indicated interest in selling.

777
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,180
This is so funny.

778
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,180


779
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,780
I think it looks like a flop.

780
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,820
But the contest quickly boiled down...

781
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:49,820


782
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,340
...to police-area's big dick contestants.

783
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,180
What, are you having a, uh, um, uh, um, um...

784
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,320
Now we gotta go further.

785
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,240
There's some kind of peppygasm happening over there across the bay.

786
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,660
Oh, yeah, I see.

787
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,420
Peppygasm?

788
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:02,580
Peppygasm.

789
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,260
You know, I thought it was.

790
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,980
There's that other guy that plays on Telegraph Avenue.

791
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,980
Yeah, I heard Saddam Hussein has Pepe gas stockpiled.

792
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:16,300
The butcher of Baghdad has an army of Pepes.

793
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,980
Ready to fly over his much vaunted berms.

794
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,480
The street price.

795
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,980
Saddam's much vaunted berms.

796
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,100
I think he's referring to the missiles.

797
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,440
Are no match for our Republican moms.

798
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,240
At the time I bought the company.

799
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,740
At the price.

800
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,480
Hey, K-Rock.

801
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,880
And if it does, how much?

802
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,660
Cereal.

803
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:44,920
Juice.

804
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,700
The company was a steal.

805
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,080
Yeah, it's like juice.

806
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,120
But with the cereal gone.

807
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
And you just have that sugary milk.

808
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,640
With dextrose and pieces of cereal and milk.

809
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,900
Oh, it's not milk.

810
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,300
It's soy.

811
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,760
It's upstairs.

812
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,780
In this jar.

813
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,600
And you can have some.

814
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,420
It's from Korea.

815
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,060
It's called.

816
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,500
This is called Power Plus.

817
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,680
Are you guys beat?

818
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,420
This is theft.

819
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,480
The other one of my favorites called Five Cereals Drink.

820
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,740
That man is singing back there.

821
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,960
It's not a man.

822
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,260
Provoked to react.

823
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,520
He thinks he's entertaining.

824
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,140
He thinks entertainment is entertainment, man.

825
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,520
Bob said that entertainment would become entertainment.

826
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,840
He went beyond McLuhan.

827
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,680
Bob did.

828
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:43,080
When he declared that entertainment eventually, finally, after the internet took over,

829
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,520
entertainment would become entertainment.

830
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,400
So, what?

831
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,300
McLuhan then was brought full circle.

832
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:59,980
And the full meaning of that great Canadian philosopher's ultimate statement was made clear.

833
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,900
Oh, yeah.

834
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,180
Oh, sure.

835
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,500
Cool.

836
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:02,740
Yeah.

837
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,900
Is this religious stuff?

838
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,920
I thought we were doing business tonight.

839
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
What's that white stuff for?

840
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,540
Sorry.

841
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,900
I just got so excited when you were talking about business and religion together.

842
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,780
Well, how do you think this whole thing started?

843
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,640
And I was not going to be denied.

844
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,560
Well, the Frommaster 2000 was started first.

845
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,960
And then the church started about an hour after that.

846
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,600
Did you stop the Frommaster?

847
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,480
Not the Frommaster.

848
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,420
The Frommaster.

849
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,740
Remember those commercials?

850
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,940
Late night TV.

851
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,180
With the Frommaster.

852
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,080
Yeah.

853
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,480
My honest.

854
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,060
Spirit.

855
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,160
And Tibulator.

856
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,100
The first time they started calling.

857
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,660
On TV?

858
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,180
On that 1-800.

859
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,520
Well, it was toll free.

860
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
It was before 1-800.

861
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,020
Yeah.

862
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,760
We sold the Frommaster first.

863
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,620
And then when they started actually dialing in with their money, sending the money in

864
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,320
in the credit card numbers, we had to come up with, you know, the instruction booklet

865
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,280
for the Frommaster.

866
00:27:52,540 --> 00:28:00,180
And that was where, that was what finally prompted Philo to get off his ass.

867
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,580
And go to the hospital.

868
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:01,920
Right.

869
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,720
And Frommaster.

870
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,660
And finally go to the hospital, which is where we met.

871
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,840
And that's how the, uh...

872
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,700
There we go.

873
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,180
We see Philo walking up to receive his award.

874
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,240
Let's wheel Philo up.

875
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,160
Would you believe this man is 86 years old?

876
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,160
He doesn't look a day over 60.

877
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,220
I have a very diversified portfolio of...

878
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,000
No, that's from living here in beautiful Northern California.

879
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,700
Here we go.

880
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,960
Philo will tell you, Northern California is heaven.

881
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,600
But what about...

882
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,360
Caller, where is heaven for you?

883
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,600
Yeah.

884
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,800
Hello?

885
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,660
Hello?

886
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,020
Hello, hello, hello.

887
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,620
No, he's talking about hell.

888
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,720
No.

889
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,300
He is in hell.

890
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,860
Yep, I'm in my own deep hell.

891
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,840
And the little...

892
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,920
Dealing in my own paranoia.

893
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,200
And stressed out negativity.

894
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,020
I love to do one.

895
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,460
No, that was the other show, Negativity Land.

896
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,220
Ah.

897
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,580
Yeah, it's quite...

898
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,360
Yeah, this is positive land.

899
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,640
This is a new...

900
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,660
We're the new approach.

901
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,920
We're the new...

902
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,740
The new school.

903
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,020
Positive.

904
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,140
Yeah, negative land.

905
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,860
That was for the old geezer people.

906
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,180
Being positive is like being nice to people.

907
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,880
And that's not nice.

908
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,300
Yeah, exactly.

909
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,360
Yeah, positive land.

910
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,440
In our CDs, we send you helpful stuff.

911
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:14,800
It's fun pointing out stupid people, though.

912
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,960
Not little things.

913
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,480
It's positiveland.com without the E.

914
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,080
And then there's this other place where they...

915
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,460
When negative land dropped the E, it got stuck every place else.

916
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
So it's always e-commerce.

917
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,300
Well, everybody thought it was a typo.

918
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,760
Is that what happened to that E?

919
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,540
Yeah, it was a typo.

920
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:31,800
Yeah.

921
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,500
They always correct me.

922
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,140
When I put it down.

923
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,100
So I'm trying to figure out what that means in a hundred years from now.

924
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,740
When everything...

925
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,280
The entire countries are called E.

926
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,580
And if you remember, that was a nickname for an intimate partner.

927
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,660
Like when we met.

928
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,040
That's right.

929
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,360
Before it was a drug.

930
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,840
And E was...

931
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,100
E-girl and E-boy was our moniker for each other at that time.

932
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,360
That was before we changed the slang, the official slanguage.

933
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,140
Slanguage doesn't work now anymore.

934
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,500
Well, we changed the alphabet.

935
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,960
And that affected the codes.

936
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,280
The codes.

937
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,960
What did they do with the extra 16 letters in the alphabet?

938
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,220
Um...

939
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:07,800
What?

940
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,120
Byron has those.

941
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Byron has them.

942
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,140
If you want them back...

943
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:19,100
I think it was either Byron or Gordon has the other 16 letters.

944
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,880
Maybe that Gordon has eight and Byron has eight.

945
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,560
But they've got your letters.

946
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,100
I was having a hard time spelling the impossible words without them.

947
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,620
Oh, when's breakfast?

948
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,200
This show should be over by now.

949
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,580
Finally!

950
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,780
It's the end!

951
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,540
Because Gary said on the radio it's over.

952
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,400
It is now a completely different new show with all new people.

953
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,060
It's about a very, very big dick.

954
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,280
And that certainly describes me.

955
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,160
I do have a big dick.

956
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,600
I've had, uh...

957
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,940
I've been depilated and I had a few inches added where it's necessary.

958
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,940
So, I don't feel like I'm available.

959
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,540
I'm not a victim of science or that I'm some sort of unnatural miscreant.

960
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,780
I feel like I'm quite viable as a subgenius.

961
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,340
You know what I mean?

962
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,140
Hey, for all you know, you're just somebody's prank.

963
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,940
Like that big foot.

964
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,440
But we keep on missing the ass crack of the joke.

965
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,260
The brunt.

966
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,580
The dig.

967
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,100
The final punchline is never there.

968
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,040
And we never get to enjoy it.

969
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,980
That's what I wonder about.

970
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:30,760
Now, just because this old po-bucker in Oregon or Washington...

971
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,860
Or wherever...

972
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,180
This old po-bucker.

973
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,520
Walking around faking Bigfoot tracks...

974
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,800
Doesn't mean that those Sherpas were tricking all those expedition leaders in the Himalayas

975
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,660
with Bigfoot track boots.

976
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,060
I told you they'd take a slut to the Himalayas.

977
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:52,820
So, as they keep expedition leaders coming back and buying Yeti skull caps and so forth...

978
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,600
They sold Yeti skulls on the market?

979
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:00,460
You see, the Yeti themselves set up these obvious hoax situations.

980
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,000
Because it's not really the conspiracy that doesn't want people to believe in Yetis.

981
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:09,300
It's the Yetis that do not want people to believe in them.

982
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,940
That's as obvious as a slice of rhubarb pie with a piece of cheese on the side.

983
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,200
I say this to ensure disbelief.

984
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,420
Because I'm saying it on this entertaining little college radio underground thing.

985
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,860
So that, you know, of course, it's all wacky, crazy stuff.

986
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,240
But, in fact...

987
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,840
It's horrible to keep you from ever believing in it.

988
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,100
And as does the Yeti and the... the saucerman.

989
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,460
Well, you are a master of disinformation.

990
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,800
And that's all I can get out of that.

991
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,920
You've made Chaz cry.

992
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,920
You've made me wet my pants.

993
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,440
And I'm...

994
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,420
That's what the blues is all about, baby.

995
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:50,940
Right.

996
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,040
Sucking your thumb and wetting your pants.

997
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,660
You just lay back and just give up.

998
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,100
Give up and just hand it all over to Bob.

999
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,920
Give him all the credit.

1000
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,380
All your money.

1001
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,280
Give him your will.

1002
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,380
Give him your... your, uh, uh, power of attorney.

1003
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,200
Give him the hair on your hands.

1004
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,420
Give him your children.

1005
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,720
Give him your mind.

1006
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,800
Give him the smile on your lips.

1007
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,740
Give him your soul and your spinal cord.

1008
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,740
Give him your spinal cord and your epiglottis in a bag.

1009
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,520
Donate your blood.

1010
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,680
Give him your sperm samples, your eggs from your uterus, your...

1011
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,480
He made a cycle clear.

1012
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,500
You give them to him.

1013
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,480
Cut things from your fingernails so he can do voodoo.

1014
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:30,900
You cannot do what he says.

1015
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,420
You must think of Bob Dobbs on the phone and think your card.

1016
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,840
Shave off all your hair and give it unto Bob.

1017
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,680
But start with the wallet, of course, because of all those things I've mentioned, your money

1018
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,520
is the most important to you.

1019
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,900
And always wash your hands.

1020
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,100
Always wash your hands.

1021
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,700
Don't forget.

1022
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,940
Oh, you can't forget to do that.

1023
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,400
And don't forget to disinfect the moon pants.

1024
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,720
And it didn't work out at all that great, so...

1025
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,880
You washed your hands and they washed you.

1026
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:00,880


1027
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,600
Much in the same way we've all been washed clean.

1028
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,260
What?

1029
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,980
Now, that's true subgenius, I think.

1030
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,340
Yes, but we're supposed to say, well, pull it out of your butt and show it to us.

1031
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,900
Is that the way our courts system works?

1032
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,160
That's not very patriotic, you guys.

1033
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,360
This movie is tough.

1034
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,060
And that was never more clear than in 1987.

1035
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,260
What has our glorious experiment come to?

1036
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,540
If you're listening to KPFA, KPFB, and PNP, you shouldn't think about these things at

1037
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:25,720
all.

1038
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,880
What has become of Bob's glorious experiment in slack and humor?

1039
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:30,880


1040
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:30,880


1041
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:30,880


1042
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:37,480
Has it devolved into a mishmash mush of audio masturbation?

1043
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,200
Pull it out of your butt and show it to us.

1044
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,360
Swallowed by the overman, Dr. Philo Drummond.

1045
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:55,640
Now, Dr. Drummond has taken the second half of the pill, the prophesied other half, and

1046
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,720
now a third half.

1047
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,000
A third half.

1048
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,780
The clear half.

1049
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,740
There's four halves.

1050
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:00,860
There's four halves.

1051
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,480
There's four halves.

1052
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,340
There's four halves.

1053
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:02,360


1054
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:11,000
Dr. Drummond's mouth hole has been infested with halves of pills, wizened, wrinkled, old

1055
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,680
pills.

1056
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,080
Friends, not these new chemical pills.

1057
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:24,780
These are the pills that God created in Eden in the day, the real day, day one.

1058
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,300
What?

1059
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,260
The pills were here.

1060
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,660
I hear Satan trying to call.

1061
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:30,860
I hear Satan trying to call.

1062
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,340
I hear my walls talking to me.

1063
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,880
It's inside you.

1064
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,120
You will be dead within weeks.

1065
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:35,720
I don't hear the dead.

1066
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,280
The walls are prophesying.

1067
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:37,660
Yes.

1068
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,800
The Baron went home.

1069
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,620
Be careful.

1070
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,960
Only little Gary is there.

1071
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,740
The prophet howling lonely –

1072
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,880
Yeah, one of those guys.

1073
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,920
Damn well.

1074
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,100
Street preachers, we'll call them.

1075
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:49,460
Yep.

1076
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,160
You're on I thought it was spirits.

1077
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,520
Down the hill.

1078
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,580
Where do they got streets?

1079
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,200
Get yourself inoculated now.

1080
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,340
Get yourself inoculated now.

1081
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,200
Get yourself inoculated now.

1082
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,120
Get yourself inoculated now.

1083
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,420
Get yourself inoculated now.

1084
00:35:59,420 --> 00:35:59,420


1085
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:00,860
He's a-

1086
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:06,300
He's practicing for his barker job outside the strip joints.

1087
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:12,180
If we had more write-offs, we wouldn't have these prophets to deal with.

1088
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,420
Well, you know, actually, we rarely have any of those prophets to deal with,

1089
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,420
and we have plenty of write-offs.

1090
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,120
There has been a great rise in write-offs.

1091
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,440
Is that what happened to LeGoo?

1092
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,300
He was written off?

1093
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,780
No, no.

1094
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,280
Doctor, like, he just went on to the Internet.

1095
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,080
That's sort of like disappearing.

1096
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,980
You vanish into cyberspace.

1097
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,280
Into a digital self.

1098
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,300
Yeah, which is, it's not actually real.

1099
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,900
I used to think that it was sort of real, and then I decided it wasn't.

1100
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,600
But then I decided it was the Internet.

1101
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,420
But now I've pretty much arrived at the conclusion it's not really real

1102
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,580
until you get the credit card expiration date,

1103
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,200
as well as the credit card number.

1104
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,080
Then the Internet, at that moment, becomes real.

1105
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,600
I'm going to have to reformat my site before I can even eat again.

1106
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,460
Did you guys really tell David Meyer to call?

1107
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,320
Because I don't even know where to call David Meyer to tell him to call.

1108
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,140
Well, I emailed him, actually.

1109
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,540
He had sent me.

1110
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,500
He sent me some email, and I returned this email with instructions

1111
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,720
that he should be right here right now.

1112
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,680
Oh, well, you check your email.

1113
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,320
He might be on the show by email, and you don't even know it yet.

1114
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,360
I'm so stupid.

1115
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,880
He's behind.

1116
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,700
No wonder you guys don't allow me to do any of the good stuff.

1117
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,300
Why don't you just download him?

1118
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,180
Well...

1119
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,460
Oh, you probably can't deal with binary attachments.

1120
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,480
You can't download your emotions in a PowerBook.

1121
00:37:59,280 --> 00:37:59,760
Oh.

1122
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,540
Oh.

1123
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:00,880
Oh.

1124
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,700
You have to have the actual full screen.

1125
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,240
Well, you can get a kind of...

1126
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,660
those choppy emotions, the ones that are kind of low-res.

1127
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,300
Yeah, pixelated feelings.

1128
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:20,840
Yeah, kind of a rough-edged happiness or anguish, depending.

1129
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,200
This is about the only two emotions I can do.

1130
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,320
What about all the anti-alising?

1131
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,300
Why is no one...

1132
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,520
Oh, I think our boats are...

1133
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,980
Some people are, actually.

1134
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,120
But it's an acquired taste now.

1135
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,180
It's the way people used to be.

1136
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,500
Back in the day, everything was not anti-aliased.

1137
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,100
It's only in the last ten years that anything was anti-aliased at all,

1138
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,320
and yet people don't even see the change.

1139
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,320
It happened so gradually that we think everything was always smooth.

1140
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,520
Mind you, I'm all wrong.

1141
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,120
But in our grandfather's day, everything had that stair-step edge to it.

1142
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,120
I remember when I used to have to cut all the photographs up into tiny little squares

1143
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,940
to make them look pixelated.

1144
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,200
Right.

1145
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:13,440
Remember how your grandpa used to look with the tiny jagged lines around the edge?

1146
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,920
Yeah, but it took hours to cut those pictures.

1147
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,220
I'm not talking about the pictures.

1148
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,060
I mean grandpa.

1149
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,560
Well, grandpa...

1150
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,660
He himself has...

1151
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,340
Rough edges.

1152
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,400
Those blocky squares defining him.

1153
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,580
I thought those were cigar edges.

1154
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,320
I thought that was a sweater.

1155
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,560
I thought that was kind of a sweater thing he had going on.

1156
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,980
You know, he always had to be a guy.

1157
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,820
He always had to be an old man, and he died.

1158
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,680
Well, see, that's what I'm saying.

1159
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,740
You guys can't even...

1160
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,100
You didn't even detect when they started anti-aliasing everything.

1161
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,060
And now it's all smooth around the edges.

1162
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,600
And then it seems normal to you.

1163
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,460
Like, oh, this is the way it's always been.

1164
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,840
But it quickly became apparent.

1165
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,880
It's frog water syndrome, man.

1166
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,320
You know, it's like frog water.

1167
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,000
You put a frog in it.

1168
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,200
You know, like in some water, man.

1169
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,260
You know, and you're like...

1170
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,980
If it's boiling water, the frog hops out, man.

1171
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,780
You know, but...

1172
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,660
Oh, how many millions did they spend on that study?

1173
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,560
But, you know, like, man, like frog water.

1174
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,920
Like, if you put, like, in cool water, and then you slowly bring it to a boil, then...

1175
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,500
And then you add some salt and some butter, and they're really good.

1176
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,360
Cool.

1177
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,980
I like it, man.

1178
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,740
It's frogs, you know.

1179
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,080
It's like nature.

1180
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,400
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go home and make sure that I wasn't joking.

1181
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:24,900
Save the frogs.

1182
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,560
Whatever, man.

1183
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,360
Save the frogs, man.

1184
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,380
Yeah, it is like nature.

1185
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,400
It's naturish.

1186
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,340
They told us nothing.

1187
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,160
I know.

1188
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:31,960
It's frogs.

1189
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:32,880
It's frogs.

1190
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,220
You gotta know your frogs.

1191
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,600
You wanna know the future?

1192
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,780
Study the frogs.

1193
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:41,100
Joey, when you're afraid, do you lay on the ground and put your feet against your tail?

1194
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,740
Get really flat?

1195
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,820
No, I usually just stick my head up my own butt when I'm really afraid.

1196
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,340
I wish I could do that.

1197
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,440
Yeah, you can.

1198
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,260
You can call 844-44-GRAD.

1199
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:56,340
You can call 844-44-GRAD.

1200
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,960
I'm gonna go to the park and...

1201
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,180
It's the ostrich position.

1202
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,800
...and do that.

1203
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,320
That's right.

1204
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,240
It's the ostrich position.

1205
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,540
You better listen to me.

1206
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,560
Uh-huh.

1207
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:09,180
Like an ostrich eating his pizza with his head stuck in the ground.

1208
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,720
Uh-huh.

1209
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,880
Uh-huh.

1210
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,020
Uh-huh.

1211
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,380
Uh-huh.

1212
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,500
Doctor!

1213
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,620
Doctor!

1214
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,520
Doctor!

1215
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,200
Dr. Bob!

1216
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,460
Doctor!

1217
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,320
Doctor!

1218
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,840
Dr. Bob!

1219
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,140
Doctor!

1220
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,060
Doctor!

1221
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,560
Dr. Bob!

1222
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,800
Doctor!

1223
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,880
Dr. Bob!

1224
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:25,880


1225
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:25,920
Doctor!

1226
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,720
Rel당히 여�

1227
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:48,500
Don't do this anymore!

1228
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,780
Directed by

1229
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:55,780


1230
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:14,260
And something's pretty clear. Every one's a Bolivian here.

1231
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:30,320
And there's almost nothing to fear. Cause we got everything we want right here.

1232
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:39,800
We got great big heaping buckets of Bolivian here.

1233
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,560
Bum, bum, bum.

1234
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,340
The water's here.

1235
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,960
Yeah, we're singing a praise to Fox.

1236
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:06,000
Cause he's done a mighty fine job.

1237
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:13,260
Cause I'm slopped up and silly like a rip-headed slob.

1238
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:21,120
And all I got to think is Bob and Ivan Stagg.

1239
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:26,560
And all I got to think is Bob and Dr. Doo.

1240
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,780
And all I got to think is Bob and everybody.

1241
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,340
You can call it a win a date with Dr. Drummond.

1242
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,260
I understand that that's been done frequently.

1243
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,240
That Dr. Drummond has been using or abusing this show.

1244
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,400
And the public airwaves for purposes of sexual procurement.

1245
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,980
Oh, has he scored big time?

1246
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,220
I hope his sons and daughters aren't listening to this.

1247
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,940
Numerous sons and daughters all birthed on this show.

1248
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,760
Not all sporting the name Drummond.

1249
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,580
I had my last baby on the show.

1250
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,420
Really? Yeah?

1251
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,980
Yeah, but it was before Philo lived here. So it was a secret.

1252
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,520
And what's the baby? How old's the baby now?

1253
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,100
Seventeen.

1254
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,080
Seventeen. What's it doing?

1255
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,160
What's it doing?

1256
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,160
Um, um, um, you know, what a seventeen year old baby does.

1257
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,720
What babies do, you know.

1258
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,320
What babies do.

1259
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,260
You don't want to talk about it on the radio.

1260
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,720
Pooping, you know, sucking.

1261
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,460
Pooping and breathing. Poop, breathe, suck. Poop, breathe, suck.

1262
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,020
Okay. Boy, those were the days.

1263
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:32,900
Oh, I remember that.

1264
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,360
When they talk about the day, that was the day I was there.

1265
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,840
Man, I remember those days. Do you remember those days, Collar?

1266
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,200
When everything was simpler.

1267
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,400
When everything was less...

1268
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,640
...complex than it was now.

1269
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,140
I know. Now it's poop, eat, suck, surf.

1270
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,920
Poop, eat, suck, surf.

1271
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,640
Jam.

1272
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,580
You do a lot of web surfing, do you, Gary?

1273
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,160
Yeah, with my tarantula.

1274
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,600
Clears the airwaves.

1275
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,260
Oh, there's your tarantula just wiped out.

1276
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,100
Yeah, I know.

1277
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,060
Swims fast with those eight legs.

1278
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,660
Runs on the water.

1279
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,620
I'm a fan of 13 years.

1280
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,660
And he will be your...

1281
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,840
Nice music. How come the band couldn't play this?

1282
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,620
And the show has won.

1283
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,320
It's the Beatles.

1284
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:23,860
Overthrown.

1285
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,760
And the fate of one who dares to underestimate the power of woman.

1286
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:31,680
For tomorrow's door of arc will lead womankind into rebirth.

1287
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,380
And then will come the golden age.

1288
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,280
Power of woman.

1289
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,220
Boy, that Jimmy Swaggart sure could prophesy, couldn't he?

1290
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:39,740
Yeah.

1291
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:43,080
Every time he made a bid, they raised their big dick bid by a quarter.

1292
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:50,560
There are some serious problems in our country when we let the media control what you think and what you believe.

1293
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,060
Tell us, Bob. Tell us, Bob.

1294
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,700
Yeah, that was...

1295
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,300
Bob's telling us.

1296
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,580
The mighty...

1297
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,600
The mighty Bob Tilton.

1298
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,560
Dallas preacher Bob Tilton.

1299
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,640
I think that will give a whole...

1300
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,380
The windy preacher.

1301
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,700
Hamanishnemena, Hamanishnemena, Hamanishnemena.

1302
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,520
Shalakundalee Basoya.

1303
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,760
Shalakundalee Basoya.

1304
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,480
I love it, speak it in tongues.

1305
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,020
The language that God speaks in heaven.

1306
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,360
Sow your seed.

1307
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:16,660
When you're seized up in the spirit, you will actually talk God's language.

1308
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,540
And I don't mean California announcer accent.

1309
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:27,440
I don't mean down home old Texas whittling front porch man accent.

1310
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,400
There's the accent God speaks.

1311
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,220
I'm going to gulag heaven.

1312
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:34,960
Televangelist.

1313
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,520
B-C-D-E-T-L-O-B-O.

1314
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,420
Shikad personal image , shitadelae e tekkabo.

1315
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,400
Yellow mucho?

1316
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,600
Play that backwards friends.

1317
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,460
Let's do it's necklace.

1318
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,540
I actually cannot.

1319
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,900
What is Bob saying?

1320
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,660
When you play it backwards...

1321
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,140
DeAh Nicole

1322
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,220
Kle Line

1323
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:52,220


1324
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,620
It's right.

1325
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,420
LaDah basonya.

1326
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,620
LaDah basoya.

1327
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,640
Lodge

1328
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:03,540
Basoya is uh heaven talk, for frog.

1329
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,020
Hey.

1330
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,140
5,2,4,4,4

1331
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,000
LaDah basoya.

1332
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,940
That's the heavenly frog.

1333
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:08,820
015.

1334
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,760
Are you guys actually inviting strangers to call?

1335
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,420
We're inviting strangers to come down and marry Faso on the air.

1336
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,560
I mean, is this station like a glory hole for you?

1337
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,360
Oh, yeah.

1338
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:21,980
You should like it.

1339
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,960
About this time, you get the guys riding around the hood.

1340
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,400
They deny they spoke to you the next day.

1341
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,040
Calling us on their cell phones and talking about who you guys are.

1342
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,840
You ever see a caller walking down the street and you grab the caller and then they deny that they spoke to you?

1343
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,480
No, I don't.

1344
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,480
They would always deny, you know, by definition.

1345
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,940
99% of the people I grab and shake on the street deny that they spoke to me.

1346
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,920
They say they've never called.

1347
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:50,960
They weren't that caller.

1348
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,980
They weren't that caller.

1349
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,540
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1350
00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:00,120
No, no, actually, I don't usually don't want to deal with any of the callers.

1351
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,520
You don't grab strangers and try to dump their listening habits right out of them?

1352
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:04,980
I don't call them.

1353
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,520
No, I never have.

1354
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,400
There are Clevelands behind the times, always.

1355
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,020
You wouldn't happen to have one of them smallpox inoculations to spare, would you?

1356
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,140
Boy, this is kind of environmental.

1357
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,540
There's plenty of spare inoculation.

1358
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:24,480
For an old soldier?

1359
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,740
Ah, we have plenty to spare.

1360
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,040
Come and sit aboard the back of the truck here.

1361
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,140
Relax that wounded leg.

1362
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,460
It looks like it may be coming gangrenous.

1363
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,840
Oh, that ain't nothing.

1364
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,240
I just wanted to give me one of them smallpoxes.

1365
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,320
No, no, no, no.

1366
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:44,180
You've just been wounded by a piece of shrapnel and let it to wedge out them feces for the

1367
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:44,680
last weekend.

1368
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,800
It's become biotic.

1369
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,680
That's just about organ wound.

1370
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,460
Don't worry, your organs swing back like our wings.

1371
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,200
They are broken into the dark time.

1372
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:02,960
What does it mean when the stock starts coming out of other parts of your body besides your

1373
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,400
nuts?

1374
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,100
Nose and mouth.

1375
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,040
What now?

1376
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:12,420
What does it mean if the angel snot starts coming out of other pores of your body besides

1377
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,820
the nasal and the lungs?

1378
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,940
It means the indus neish.

1379
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,320
It means the indus neish stain.

1380
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,760
I think you know what that means, don't you?

1381
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,860
I don't know what anything means anymore.

1382
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,580
I'm so debilitated.

1383
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,780
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the indus neish.

1384
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,900
The man I'm talking about is of the spirit by

1385
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,180
his looks and noce.

1386
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,260
The man I'm talking about is Mr. Philooooo Inivatte.

1387
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,420
Stretchy, stinky, closed mouth.

1388
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,140
Nothing at all to say.

1389
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,220
All бっл.

1390
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,280
That was the ultimate joke.

1391
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,080
Cecil was a puppet?

1392
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,660
If Cecil the sea serpent was a puppet,

1393
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,580
then how can you believe anything is real?

1394
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,500
For all we know, Bob could be some made-up character.

1395
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,000
For all we know.

1396
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,040
Bob could be Beanie.

1397
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,620
Bob could be Beanie himself.

1398
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,440
For all we know.

1399
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,820
Do we really know anything?

1400
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,560
Has cultural relativity stripped us of all solid knowledge?

1401
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,000
You cannot know anything.

1402
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,160
Are we now on a shifting, sandy beach of hypocrisy,

1403
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,120
even in science?

1404
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,460
You can't not know anything.

1405
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,920
Once you know something, you can never unknow it.

1406
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,480
You can't not know it.

1407
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,060
Only an overman can not know.

1408
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,560
You can unknow it.

1409
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,560
No, you can't unknow it.

1410
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,340
I know that.

1411
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,740
You can't unknow it.

1412
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:41,120
You have to talk much closer to this microphone.

1413
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,720
Oh, is this the screaming microphone?

1414
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:43,580
Yeah.

1415
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,060
That's what I like to think of.

1416
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:46,360
Yes!

1417
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,200
Reverend Stang's special screaming microphone.

1418
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,340
Yeah, that's the Linton Raven microphone.

1419
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,400
You can't not know what you don't really know,

1420
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,820
and what you never really wanted to know in the first place.

1421
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,120
Those are the kind of paradoxes that the philosopher enjoys,

1422
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,160
that the philosopher seeks out,

1423
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,860
to test his understanding,

1424
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,840
this logical understanding of how the instructions look

1425
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,420
for the whole world really works.

1426
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,700
I think that goes back to the ancient Greek.

1427
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,560
There's no going back.

1428
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,900
Once you do see your own mind, you can't quit.

1429
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,260
You have to go forward.

1430
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,180
Once you have begun that journey inside your own mind,

1431
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,100
you cannot ever turn back and go back out.

1432
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,140
You can't erase the horrible knowledge

1433
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:39,420
that you have acquired in your inner journey.

1434
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,220
What's the use?

1435
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:41,280
So true.

1436
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,600
You cannot erase it!

1437
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,640
You cannot erase the shock!

1438
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,160
The horror!

1439
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,140
Yes, you can.

1440
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,060
Oh, wait.

1441
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,200
Right over there.

1442
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:50,700
Oh, they just...

1443
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,000
Oh, okay.

1444
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:52,800
I take it back.

1445
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,240
Doctorate in erasability.

1446
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,160
I guess you could erase it.

1447
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,080
In fact, you might even...

1448
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,920
If you forget to hit record...

1449
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,100
Erasability.

1450
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,840
Then it might as well have never happened.

1451
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:06,520
That's right.

1452
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,180
Can you prove it didn't happen?

1453
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,700
It didn't happen.

1454
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,100
I'm talking about...

1455
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,740
What will happen in the future when there's no tape?

1456
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,360
How will we know if...

1457
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,240
I predict.

1458
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:17,700
...we can prove it?

1459
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,700
In the future, there will be no more audio tape,

1460
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:26,180
and everything will be recorded on tiny, flat, shiny discs.

1461
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,500
Oh, that's so sad.

1462
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,580
Can you prove it won't happen?

1463
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,520
I'm lying in bed, you guys.

1464
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,060
Oh, no!

1465
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,260
I'm doing this exciting radio show from bed.

1466
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,500
Bob Dorgan.

1467
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:53,060
In his most disgusting dream is the 175th dream.

1468
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,620
This might as well be a bad dream.

1469
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:05,500
I'm lying in bed, hearing this weird music in my head.

1470
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,700
This horrible sound.

1471
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,980
Lonesome cowboy Dave muttering.

1472
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,700
Princess Wee coughing.

1473
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,060
Fittingly.

1474
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,240
Pitifully.

1475
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,260
Faces appearing in the Luxor windows.

1476
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,800
The orphans whining.

1477
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,320
A sound in the attic.

1478
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:27,260
Cracks in the space-time fabric are appearing and disappearing in front of your eyes, left and right.

1479
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,100
The lost souls are moaning.

1480
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,160
That old genitalia is making the earth move and shifting time for you.

1481
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,160
Some people down this story don't like the noise and may call the police,

1482
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,260
but you don't care.

1483
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,800
Why could you? How should you?

1484
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,100
You've been there before.

1485
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,260
You know any day is blast-off day.

1486
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:55,760
You know the code. You know the right mix of chemicals in your own body.

1487
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,180
Get ready. Blast off.

1488
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,660
The perfect thing to last a day.

1489
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,220
He's speaking in tongues. It's the language they spoke in Bible days.

1490
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,820
It's what the angels speak.

1491
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,700
Bible days.

1492
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,700
I remember the Bible days.

1493
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,460
The Inukian, the Enochian, the Pebble of the Star People.

1494
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,480
The dog-faced Anunnaki.

1495
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,360
God loved me then.

1496
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,360
Back in the day.

1497
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,000
God loved me.

1498
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,140
He wanted me. He loved me back then.

1499
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,420
He don't love me no more.

1500
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,720
God lost his mercy after Waco.

1501
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:37,660
When they killed David Koresh, that's when God lost his mercy for mankind.

1502
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:42,040
He lost his vibrator after Tuesday night's debacle.

1503
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,520
They went too far.

1504
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,760
Too, too far.

1505
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,560
Ever since then, God first went after the ATF.

1506
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,280
Now he's after all the rest of America.

1507
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,120
Now you don't want that on you.

1508
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,880
No, no, not that blue fungus.

1509
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,560
It came from Koresh's place after the bomb blasts.

1510
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,420
Don't you know?

1511
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:03,920
America has fallen short.

1512
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,640
There it went.

1513
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,880
Five feet short.

1514
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,640
Another one fell in the bucket.

1515
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,420
Gone.

1516
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,420
You little bucket.

1517
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,020
I guess it's time to elongate.

1518
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:15,960
Why not?

1519
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,220
Right into the bucket.

1520
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,620
Let's get it as big as we can get it.

1521
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,500
Because before two elongate.

1522
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,640
Well, till next week.

1523
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,720
My long john's back on here.

1524
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,060
Not since the days of the old Hitler.

1525
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,080
Keep your hat on tight.

1526
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,240
You're back to the winter and you're sacking the saddle, you dang old son of a bitch.

1527
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,980
I'm just gonna roll over and go back to sleep.

1528
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,460
Is it the loneliness that I'm gonna cry myself to sleep?

1529
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,700
You old son of a bitch.

1530
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,500
My heart is saddened like the morning.

1531
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,680
Go back to bed, you old son of a bitch.

1532
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,320
It's the old diseased coo-roo-yo.

1533
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:56,900
The diseased old coot, son of a cootin' bitch.

1534
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,220
Is lonely through the seas.

1535
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,440
Dave gotta go pee or something.

1536
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,320
He's gonna pee.

1537
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,080
He's still smokin'.

1538
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,180
He's gonna smoke that one cigarette for 45 minutes.

1539
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,280
He's dunkin' this place up.

1540
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,660
If you take a break for a half hour, it's okay.

1541
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,540
You don't have the smoke in a half hour's time.

1542
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,240
It's all right.

1543
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,220
I am ill.

1544
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,840
I swear to you.

1545
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,980
I'm in front of my narrow head.

1546
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,200
I'm a paraplegic god.

1547
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,780
I swear to you.

1548
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,560
This is all for naught.

1549
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,380
This is all a bunch.

1550
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:52,040
The principles elongated on this broadcast are not the opinions of anyone living or dead.

1551
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,880
It may be considered too incidental.

1552
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,940
Some characters are composites.

1553
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,980
Other characters are compositional.

1554
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,460
And other characters are full and yet to be grown.

1555
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,480
Here they are, King Cole of Love.

1556
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,940
All the happiness is slowly flying by.

1557
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,060
Uh, yes, dear friends.

1558
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,980
I'll just listen to my voice.

1559
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,180
I've...

1560
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,540
...had a bit of a cold.

1561
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,600
And, uh...

1562
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,460
What better time to record the credits with...

1563
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,300
...no background music.

1564
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,960
Friends, we've been listening...

1565
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,660
...because it was easy to do it this way...

1566
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,180
...to, uh, some, uh...

1567
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,260
...live subgenius radio shows...

1568
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,740
...from two different places, of course.

1569
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:46,880
WWW.CSB Cleveland with ESO Swamp Radio, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Professor Jazz Smith.

1570
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:56,560
And the, uh, subgenius business retreat marathon five-hour over-the-edge sh...

1571
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,360
...and puzzling evidence show...

1572
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,520
...engineered by Don Joyce of Negative Land.

1573
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,260
And puzzling evidence...

1574
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:15,280
...with Dr. Philo Drummond directing on KPFA in Berkeley, California.

1575
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,440
You are listening to...

1576
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,180
...a compendium of those subgenius shows.

1577
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:24,800
The subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

1578
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:29,340
Praise Bob for...

1579
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,900
...more information.

1580
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:36,900
Check out www.subgenius.com

1581
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:37,920

1582
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,020
Write to...

1583
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:48,280
Post Office Box 204206 Austin, Texas 78720.

1584
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,160
Praise Bob.

1585
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,100
Wake up.

1586
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:08,220
If you want a picture of the future, imagine a pipe smoking in a human face forever.

1587
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,000
Word up.

1588
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,320
Throw off your pants, unroll in your mistakes, get dirty for Bob.

1589
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:23,960
Word up.

1590
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,140
Heart Ignition.

1591
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:27,140


1592
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:27,220
Heart Ignition.

1593
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:27,620
Word up.

1594
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:27,620


1595
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:27,620


1596
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:27,600


1597
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:27,600


1598
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:27,600


1599
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:27,600


1600
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:27,600
