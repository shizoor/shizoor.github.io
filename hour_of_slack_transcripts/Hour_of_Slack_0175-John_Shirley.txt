We ain't got no legs.
That means I ain't got no legs, you ain't got no legs, and them men in there ain't got no legs.
Now what does that sound like to you?
The self-genius.
Our health.
We like.
It gets up and kills.
The people it kills get up and kill.

Is anyone who differs from everyone else easy enough to think about there?
The overwhelming majority of normals do not even know that they comprise a conspiracy.
A conspiracy. A small percentage, however.
The controllers are conscious and active as a conspiracy.
Intent on robbing you, me, and even our leader, J.R. Bob Dobbs, of our rightful inheritance of slack.
Look, I know how this sounds. I know everybody says this.
But you've got the wrong man. I'm not the guy.
Anything you do to me is going to waste your time and energy because I don't know anything.
I'm not one of those people. I mean, I'm not one of those. I'm really not.
One of which people? You seem to think we've brought you here for some specific reason.
You seem to know why you're here.
No, I absolutely don't. I don't. I mean, I know that you people are the man.
I mean, I know that you're the company police and the ones who look for...
Well, I know what you look for. I mean, everybody knows. It's no secret.
And I just want you to know I'm not one of those people.
I'm not one of those people.
I'm not one of the ones you look for.
Who told you what we're looking for?
Well, I don't know. I was just a kid.
I mean, the other kids would talk about the company police, the special police.
People just talk about it. I mean, you know, they just gossip.
Well, not with disapproval. I mean, it's something...
I guess it's something you have to do. People have to do that.
I mean, it's not like we disapproved. We just talked about it.
Literally.
And how do you know we have to do it?
Well, you're there. I mean, you're doing it, so it must be necessary if you're doing it.
I guess.
You know, you're talking differently now.
Well, different for what?
You're talking as if we're a good thing.
As if you're not worried about us.
Well, what did I say before?
Well, yesterday in the cafeteria, you said that we were taking people away for no reason.
You thought nobody was listening, but we have a recording if you'd like to hear it.
You said that we were taking people away.
What was it you said?
To maintain an atmosphere of terror.
I believe that was it.
Oh, I...
Did I say that?
Well, did I say it was a bad thing for you to be doing that?
I mean, if that's what you're doing...
I'm not pretending I know, but I mean...
I assume you have to keep people on their...
What's that for?
Now look, this is really pointless.
You don't have to use that.
If you want me to sign a confession...
If you want me to sign a confession, I'll do it.
I'm ready for rehabilitation if you think it's necessary.
Okay.
I mean, if I said the wrong thing, I didn't realize it.
Look, don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.
If you break that, I won't be able to work.
I won't be able to work if you don't do it.


Look, it'll cost the company money.
It'll cost money.
Don't.
No.
Use the micro-3.
And maybe the micro-2.
Well, no. The micro-2 is a bit too dilatory.
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!
The spinal fluid can damage the mechanism.
If... Yeah, that's a bit...
better.
Yeah, the micro-3 is really more
suitable for this.
Oh, there. That's it. He's responding very well.
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!

AAAAAAAAHHHHH!
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!
Now, how is that?
This is not
necessary. This is really pointless.
I want
to know why you're doing this for no reason.
I want to know what... I mean, there's
no reason!
I thought you knew everything.
You were talking as if you knew everything.
Why, you know
all about us, don't you?
You were the great expert on us.
Did you know about this?
This... makes you
afraid of your own hands and feet.
I mean, it's just an
injection. It's just a chemical.
But it's funny
how an injection can change everything.
Now, there.
Look, don't!
Look, I...
AAAAAAAAHHHH!
The house left.
Open.
Untie his hands.
I believe it's working.
Give him the saw.
Give him the saw.
Give him the saw.
Give him the saw.
Give him the saw.
Give him the saw.
Give him the saw.
Give him the saw.
Give him the saw.
Give him the saw.
Give him the saw.

AAAHHHHHH!
You give him the saw.
You give him the saw.
Friends, that was John Shirley with Michael Chachalach or Chachalax or...
I really don't know how to pronounce it exactly.
But, yeah, John Shirley.
Now, and friends, this week's Hour of Slack is a spotlight on John Shirley.
Now, most of you have read 1984.
Or else you will after I have just now told you to do so.
Every generation has its George Orwell.
And part of the duty of our church, of the subgenius, our church, the People's Temple Agricultural Mission,
P.O. Box 893 Georgetown, Guyana, South America,
is to bring to the attention of our members anything that they must know.
No matter how painful.
How awful it may be.
During the last year, I've been reading nothing but Russian history and John Shirley.
John Shirley is a cyberpunk sci-fi author.
If you were going to pigeonhole him, it doesn't really apply anymore.
But part of that gang of wacky Zenos and depressing, horrible prophets,
including William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Lou Scheiner,
who are all the same.
Who else?
Huh?
Yeah, Rudy Rucker, reverends, all.
In fact, the most, probably the best John Shirley book you could just go out and pick up
would be one of the Eclipse series.
Eclipse, Penumbra.
For the first one is Eclipse.
They're about the conspiracy, dear friends,
and how the conspiracy does tend to get in a...
onus.
I'm gonna read excerpts from Shirley's stuff,
but what mainly spurred this focus on Reverend Shirley is a new tape I got from him
with lots of keen, keen, ranting, horrible songs.
But the conspiracy, for those of you new to the Hour of Slack,
the conspiracy is them.
Not us.
Them.
Them.
Them.
The they, theym who took away your real slack.
Of course, you're not one of theym, are you?
Never were, either.
Not even when they made you wanna be.
In fact, that's why they wanted your slack.
It's why you had slack in the first place.
They did manage to steal most of it,
but they obviously haven't gotten it all.
They haven't gotten Bob, or else you wouldn't be listening to this show,
as long as there's one free Bob among us,
their system cannot be complete.
Because, by nature, it's a closed system,
and if we can keep their system incomplete,
it'll close down all of its own accord,
by their own law, the law of normality.
The conspiracy, friends,
that which forms the background of your entire life,
it's your inferiority complex,
your delusions of grandeur.
It's the reason for all your problems.
The thing that lives in Washington,
its weight makes the planet groan.
The thing that lives in Washington,
is a kind of living stone.
The thing that lives in the temple,
the temple with five sides.
The thing that lives in Washington,
takes children for animal hides.
The mound incubates power,
with that, the heart is diamonds.
The word remarks of the hour,
well, it's just the clock that's crying.
The thing that lives in Washington,
it's got a thousand whims.
The thing that lives in Washington,
oh, don't you recognize him?
Cause you know his name is Legion,
and you know his name is Trust.
Would you like to take a meeting?
Would you like to lunch with us?
Would you like to smile on TV,
as you smile with blood and pus?
Yeah, there are razors on the wind,
there's a shining cloud of ages.
While satellites slowly spin,
and the turn keys check their gauges.
And the therapist is closing,
and the interface engages.
And you hug your shrink-wrapped skin,
as they pay you out your wages.
One division of Illusion

Lyrics available link in the description
If you're watching now and not yet刹
Tell the band I didn't kill anyone.
No, I'm just trying to have me some fun.
Well, yes, on the one hand, I guess I would assume that it is.
But for the life of me, I can't understand how a group like Iggy Pop and the Stooges
or some other group like that, how they are really a reflection or a mirror of what's really going on now.
Well, they have to be.
No one would buy their records.
No one would see the rock acts.
Well, if they're a mirror of the young generation, then we're in bad trouble, aren't we?
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit up your poop chute.
Whatever.
Mock worst.
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit up your poop chute.
Sausage.
Mock worst.
No time for relationship.
Skip the whole day.
Little bit.
Gotta keep it up.
Ah, yes.
Dear friends, you are listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack,
originating here from Dallas, Texas.
God only knows where all it's going to.
I'm going to, continuing with our focus on the writings,
mainly of John Shirley.
Not only because he's a friend of the church, but just because, I mean, even if he wasn't,
we'd still owe it to you to tell you about him.
And this, of course, you can pick his books up in different places,
but he's written some things just for the church.
In fact, there's a book I've been trying to put together,
collecting anecdotes for, called Bummers.
It's what you might call it.
It's all a book about what can go wrong with drugs.
And John Shirley wrote this for Bummers.
By the way, everyone who wishes to is welcome to submit their own Bummer tales
for inclusion in this book whenever and if ever we sell it.
But here's what poor John had to say about cocaine.
Cain.
About ten years later, I'm quoting, once again, I'm quoting John Shirley.
About ten years later, I'd given up psychedelics, mostly,
because I tended to dissolve into my environment if I took them.
It didn't take much.
Even now, when I look at a blank wall closely,
it swims around a little, looking missable, shifting with subtle patterns.
Never had a flashback, though.
But I was living in New York and was making money writing,
and my wife was doing other things.
Four.
Moolah.
And we tended to blow it on cocaine.
Sometimes heroin and cocaine, but mostly coke.
Sometimes I mainlined it.
I tell this story with reluctance.
I don't like to think about it.
I've been off cocaine, off drugs.
Well, I'd take a little mild mescaline or MDMA if someone offered it and have done,
but mostly I steer clear now.
And coke was the only hard one to get away from.
I'm convinced that, at least relative to man,
good and evil are quite real,
and that there are good drugs and evil drugs.
Good drugs can become bad drugs if they're misused.
I learned a great deal from psychedelics,
but one mustn't take them too often or under the wrong circumstances.
And you shouldn't use them at all if you can't handle a car that drives the mental freeways at top speed,
pressing its own accelerator to the floor.
But evil drugs are always evil drugs.
Cocaine, heroin, and PCP especially.
The TV is a good place to be.





It's a TV commercial that shows the rat dosing itself to death on cocaine is no bull dookie, so to speak.
Some people have more resistance to coke addiction than others,
but anyone will duplicate the fate of that white rat if they have enough coke.
Cocaine will rewire your brain.
It'll push your pleasure buttons.
We'll use reward conditioning to make you its Pavlovian lab rat.
It pretty much ate through the bonds with my wife,
and the marriage fell apart.
I remained faithful to cocaine, however, and got deeper into shooting up.
One day, I went rabid with it.
I had two good grams and a fresh needle, and I got feverishly into sticking myself.
The needle became as important as the drug.
I associated the needle with the indescribably powerful rush of cocaine pleasure,
so that the needle was lasciviously desirable.
I was queer for the needle.
I wanted the needle, the hard needle shoved in a new aura,
as one of the many sex change cuts I was making on my arms and legs, my thighs.
I was babbling, gasping, buzzing beyond searching for a vein.
I had a heavy dose of it in me, and I was hallucinating from it.
Yes, you hallucinate from heavy cocaine.
So I couldn't see a vein anyway, just a writhing nest on my arm.
I shoved it in at random, and I couldn't feel the pain of the clumsy jabbings,
because cocaine is an anesthetic.
I was freezing out.
I wasn't getting off as good now,
and I was suddenly deep down, bone marrow scared,
because I knew that the coke crash was on the way.
A bad cocaine crash, especially the sort you get from mainlining,
is the worst thing I've ever experienced.
It makes my other drug bummers paradisial by comparison.
It makes you wish you were dog poop so that you could be something higher than you are.
It's the profoundest depression combined with unendurable weakness and pain,
and every individual nerve ending.
Every single one like a short-circuiting socket, smoking and sparking and turning black.
It is exactly as I imagined hell would have to be for Adolf Hitler or someone worse.
I'm using no hyperboles here.
No need for exaggeration.
The crash is a welcome mat for suicide.
I was terrified of it, and the only way to put it off, since I didn't have any downers,
was to try and stay up.
Keep shooting.
It wasn't just my fear, though.
I couldn't have stopped then, even if there was no crash.
I was in the programmed cycle the white rat was in.
I was trapped in pushing the button.
Pushing the button made me push the button, made me push the button,
but the cocaine ran out.
My heart was beating so fast it was all blurred into one beat.
The distortion of my sight was so thick I couldn't see past an arm's length.
Beyond that, it was sort of a hurricane of color and shape.
I was blowing up.
Only, it was taking forever, exploding as if I'd swallowed a hand grenade, but in slow
motion.
I felt like the guy in Scanners whose head gradually explodes from psychic attack.
But I kept jabbing, trying to glean some coke from the floor, from my bedspread, from the
scrap of foil it had come in.
I added water to those things, trying to get the last little bit, shooting up dust from
the floor.
Miracle, I didn't get an embolism or something.
I was in a state of shock.

I was babbling, jabbing myself randomly, only now my hands would no longer hold the
needle.
They shook too much to hold it, but the jabbing didn't stop.
There were needles all over me.
There were needles jabbing themselves viciously into my flesh, all over my body.
I could see them.
They were like plastic steel big mosquitoes the size of hypos.
They were swarming all around me.
They were jabbing, and now it hurt and there was no pleasure.
But they couldn't stop.
I could see my hands on them now.
I had a hundred ectoplasmic hands, and the hands wouldn't stop, even though I screamed
at them.
My roommate came home and called an ambulance, and they took me overdosing to the hospital.
The needles kept stabbing me all the way, and they had to put in a tube in my lungs
because they were filled with fluid.
I almost proceeded Belushi.
And then the girls came in.

The crash hit me when I was in the hospital with the nasty tube down my throat, and the
sheets were made of sandpaper, and I had a third degree sunburn on my body.
But that's how it felt.
I couldn't rest, but I was so exhausted I wept from it.
It went on for a day or two.
Afterwards my whole body below the neck was puffed up from needle jabs and coke damage
to the tissues.
It looked like I had a terminal skin disease.
It took weeks to go away.
Nightmares.
About the needles.
It was worse than that.
I can't talk about it any more than this, though.
I can't think about it any more.
I lived through it, and I stopped using cocaine.
From the Confessions, dear friends, of John Shirley.
Read it and weep.
Here's a song of his that probably applies.
John Shirley, Read It and Weep.

John Shirley, Read It and Weep.


John Shirley, Read It and Weep.
Pauline, I'm burning out, baby.
Pauline, I'm working out, baby.
I squandered my youth like pocket change
Oh Lord, I spent it all and I spent it strange
I used to feel love and pain
And I'm never gonna feel it again

Hey, later

Oh, party now
And hey, later

As it wails through my ribs and through my spine

Oh, party now
Hey, later

Chaos is a machine
Whose blueprint we've never seen
And vacuum seems to be the only way to get out of this mess

At the heart of things

Oh, yes, dear friends
Yeah, John Shirley
This is a pretty depressing
Sort of
Downbeat show, you might say
My friend John Shirley
Is a pretty downbeat
Kind of guy sometimes
Here's a
Well, a list of books
By John Shirley
Uh
You can pick up right now
A Splendid Chaos
A collection of short stories
Called Heat Seeker
Um, Black Hole of Carcosa
Is that one with the subgenius elements in it
His, uh
Classics, Eclipse
Eclipse Penumbra, and coming up
Eclipse Corona, and another short story
Collection called The Moorman
And he's done some
Horror novels, one is called
Sellers
And one called
In Darkness Waiting
This, I'm gonna read some excerpts from
In Darkness Waiting
Just to give you some idea of how sick
This man really is
This is near the climax
The
Insect evil spirit
Beings have taken over the inside
Of the slaughterhouse
One of the faces detached
From the group and came at him
A lean snarling man with a steel mallet
In his hand, shrilling
He said, I want the woman, I want the woman
And flashing the mallet down at the big man's head
The big man grabbed the other's
Mallet hand and let her go
So he could claw at the lean man's face
And the two of them, wrestling furiously
Tottered off into the milieu
She had fallen, she realized
And was lying on the floor
Instinctively she crawled towards the wall
To the nearest shelter, the meat cutting table
With its saw
She crept underneath and bowled herself up there
In the shadows, a pile of rotting meat shavings
And bone dust between her legs
Between her back and the concrete wall
Cushioning her, maybe they wouldn't see her here
At first
What she saw looked like a
Barroom brawl or a riot
Raging out of control
Several hundred of the higher ones
Turned against one another
The pilots whirring above
Crawling on the dead
But then she saw it for what it was
She saw a fountain of red spray
The red spurting
From here, from there
But united by fields of
Telekinesis
The warring psychic fields
Projected by the pilots
Creating bubbles in the red spray
Butting thunderheads of electromagnetic force
Their conflict
Shattering the spray into mist
That was sculpted by the uncontrolled
Power of mind
Made to conform to the imagery
Crackling from the tortured minds
Of the pilots
Images painted in the air
In blood spray
Airbrushed scarlet
Nothing given detail
On secondary colors with bits of
Levitated bone and sinew
And blue under flesh and hair
And torn skin
A brief image of a woman's living head
Exuding toothy worms
As if Medusa's snakes had turned
Against her, dug into her skull
Emerged from her eyes and mouth
A man with a human
Face on one side of his head
A gargoyle on the back
The two melding together, compressing fluidly
To become one pathetic grotesquerie
Human inadequacies
Hopeless struggle against moral
Disillusion
A hawk ripping a rabbit open
A rabbit devouring its own young
A fetus chewing its way out
Through a woman's pregnancy
Swollen belly
Its snaggly teeth
Flecked with its mother's
Shredded uterus
A dog reaching back to gnaw
Chunks of meat from a


Worm's mouth

Side
Jesus Christ
Writhing on his nails
As a pig with human hands
And giant insect wings
Thrusting its snout into the wound
On its side
Flies, flies choking the mouths
And noses of children
Dying in a Nazi execution pit
Nazis choking Jews
And Israeli Jews hanging Nazis
A pope in full regalia
A wheelchair
A man's
Organ
Growing fantastically oversized
Till it thrust into its owner's mouth
And smashed up into his brain
So that blood squirted from the place
His eyes had occupied
An old woman shaking in a nest
Of rattlesnakes and scorpions
Her wheelchair changing shape
To become a pair of steel-spoke jaws
Clamping her down
Another sweet-faced old woman
Feeding on a pretty little girl's
Throat
A man with a cactus for a member
Thrusting it into a delicate
Victorian lady
A child's head lopped
With a single stroke of a mallet
The head spinning away to change shape
Becoming rubbery
Bloating, bursting open in the air
To erupt a furious
Swarm of blood-sticky bees
Leering demonic faces
Vomiting happily
Eyes wide with pleasure
As bits of maggoty flesh
Gushed over their horny lips
A lamprey
Engorging on Marilyn Monroe's
Ripe bosom as her skirt blows up
The bills flow down
From her to become the wings
Of vampiric moths
Which descend in a cloud
On the singer Madonna
Sucking her into a
Draggled bag of wizened flesh
The flesh falls away
From her skeleton which embraces
The fat lady, compressing her
Corpulence so tightly her skin rips
And her suet-lumpy yellow fat
Squeezes out between the dead white bones
Like dough, flows like human lava
Into a hardening shape
Of a soldier
Thrusting a bayonet into the belly
Of a soldier who thrusts another bayonet
Back into the first
Both thrusting in, out, in, out
Each thrusting wildly in each other
But showing no pain
Their faces imbecilically happy
Until they reach some kind of climax
Where they explode into fragments
Which twist and reform
Into children burning
With napalm running down a road
Sizzling and screaming and becoming
A group of Nicaraguan children hit by
The anti-personnel shells fired by the Contras
The children torn limb from limb
By the flechettes and tiny razors
So that their blood runs down an invisible screen
And paints itself into the shape
Of a man stepping into his children's bedroom
With a shotgun
Blowing heads and headlines
Off into the air
And that was from John Shirley's book
In Darkness Waiting
Well, have I got your interest up?
Peaked your interest a bit maybe?
Maybe some of you want to know
What this John Shirley guy is really all about
Well, they're cheap books
I mean, I don't mind recommending
This high quality book



This high quality book


Is high cultural literature to
All of you who might have
Some interest
And here's one last song from him
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
Which I guess
Sort of fits
At this point
He's one off the же
Super
Growing there, I got to wash my hands, wash my hands again.
I better rub deep and hard, they could be hiding in the pores.
Like men in foxholes, cowering in wars.
I'll never, I'll never get clean.
I wish I had a sponge with barbed wire.
Maybe then I could get myself clean.
I can't get myself clean, I can't get myself clean.
I, I can't, I can't get myself clean.
I can't, I can't, I can't get myself clean.
I can't, I can't, I can't get myself clean.
I can't, I can't, I I can't get myself clean.
OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD!
The whole bloody world is obscene.
Wash my hands again
Till my, till my fingerprints are gone
Something dirty crawling on me
Were all of us originally wrong
Till my fingerprints are gone
Were all of us originally wrong
Till my fingerprints are gone
Were all of us originally wrong
Just being alive's the original sin
Just being alive's the original sin
Just stepping outdoors is giving in
Stepping outdoors is giving in
Being alive is the original sin
Stepping outdoors is giving in
Being alive is the original sin
Stepping outdoors is giving in
OCD
OCD
OCD
It can't happen to me
It can't happen to me
Better check the locks
Are you sure they're closed?
Must stuff the window cracks
With all my filthy clothes
OCD
OCD
OCD
OCD
OCD
OCD
OCD
OCD
Being alive is the original sin
Stepping outdoors is giving in
Drive, drive, drive the nail in
Drive, drive, drive the nail in
OCD
OCD
OCD
OCD
Hit the walls with bare knuckles
Tighter, always tighten that buckle
Tighter, always tighten that buckle
Go over the rug with a fine-tooth comb
Go over the rug with a fine-tooth comb
Check the wall cracks in my home
Check the wall cracks in my home
OCD
OCD
OCD
OCD
I don't know if I can stop
I don't think
Then I can start
OCD
OCD
Stop it for me
Stop it for me
Stop it for me
Here's a gun, stop it for me
Take this gun, stop it for me
Someone please stop it for me
OCD

Mr. Smith, it is not at this time treatable
However, sometime in the near future
We hope to have a treatment
We hope to have a treatment
We hope to have a treatment
Maybe hope to have a treatment
Maybe this gun
Maybe this gun

OCD, OCD, OCD, just being alive, just being alive is the original sin.
And just stepping outdoors is giving in.
Well, it can't happen to me.
Well, it couldn't, couldn't happen to me.
No, it couldn't happen to me.
Couldn't.
OCD couldn't happen to me.
OCD couldn't happen to me.
OCD couldn't happen to me.
Well, OCD couldn't happen to me.
But don't you wish it could, friends?
No, yes, it does have to end soon.
This is the...
It's the end, but if you don't want your...
I mean, some of us don't want to be treated, okay?
You know, we don't want the treatment.
And if you want more of the same,
the song that wouldn't die, friends, that's it.
You can write for free information about the Church of the Subgenius,
which has presented this John Shirley special.
Just write for free information from Bob at Box 140306.
Ah, you didn't have a pencil ready, did you?
I'm going to say that again now that you do have one.
Write to Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.
And just say, Bob, I've got OCD, and I want more.
And he'll bring it to you.
By the way, make a quick little announcement here.
You know, a couple of years ago, I worked for six months on a film called China Run,
and it's showing this Thursday night on Cinemax.
It's the only time I know of it ever being on TV and probably never will be again.
But China Run, Thursday on Cinemax.
Also, at the science fiction convention this weekend,
there will be a Subgenius revival, 9.30.
Friday night at the Marriott Hotel, Coit and LBJ.
Coit and LBJ, Friday, 9.30, science fiction convention, Subgenius revival.
And I don't know what else.
Maybe worse.
Free to the public.
That's why I can mention it.
It's very clean.
Stay tuned.
It's very clean.
I clean that gun every day.
Again.
Again.
Again.
I clean that gun every day.
It takes a lot of work and order.
I oil all the parts.
I clean that gun every day.
Again.
Gotta put it somehow like this here.
I clean that gun every day.
I clean that gun every day.

I clean that gun every day.
I clean that gun every day.
