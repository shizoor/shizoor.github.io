1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,100
Your nightmares come alive.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,280
Now prepare yourselves for a terrifying hour that won't be easy for you to forget.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,840
You will now hear all of the positive messages contained in the subliminal portion of this tape.

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:27,340
These messages have been carefully designed to help you achieve the success you desire and deserve.

5
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,680
I use rest stops regularly.

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,600
You choose to be in control of your life.

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,380
You choose to be happy.

8
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,480
You choose to be happy.

9
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,120
You are a happy person.

10
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,460
You are a winner.

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,840
I got a 32.

12
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,800
I got a 220 built on a graveyard frame.

14
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,980
Shoots tombstone bullets, balls and chains.

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,500
Said I'm tough as cowhide, swift as lead.

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,100
I was born in the jungle where they never go to bed.

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,140
Wild throw a brick through midnight and break broad daylight.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,220
Cause my eyes is made of bulletproof glass.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,500
I like being in control of my life.

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,780
I know I can be who I want to be.

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,600
I can be who I want to be.

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:29,960
I can be who I want to be.

23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,880
I can get out of this night's heck.

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,380
If you need thanks, damn bad,

25
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:47,860
walk out the door, I'll see how deep you немногоing yourborg.

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:59,200
These messages will now become subliminal.

27
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,960
But once you have acquired them, they can now be heard.

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


29
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,880
but your subconscious mind will be hearing and accepting all of the positive messages.

31
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,380
Listen to the tapes as often as you can.

32
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,360
The more you listen, the sooner success will come.

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,540
That's enough. Cut off the telecommand.

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,760
Are you crazy? Cut off the telecommand, I say.

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,680
We must maneuver freely. That would be an act of insubordination.

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,100
And if they say anything against God or Elvis Presley,

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,800
they get thrown out on the rest again.

38
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,160
He said, you're insane. He said, you need to be put away.

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,360
He said, you're a sick woman.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,620
And I said, if this is sick, I never want to get better.

41
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,340
I want to stay in critical condition for the rest of my life.

42
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,540
And he filed for divorce on grounds of extreme cruelty,

43
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,100
and Elvis was item number two, excessive devotion to Elvis Presley.

44
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,740
And I said, I love it.

45
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,000
Hit one of them bombs. Not with the rays. Run into him.

46
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,640
This program has been banned from the air, and you know that, too.

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,920
I know, but it's too vital to the radio.

48
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,520
Not only was the ban on the program overruled,

49
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,660
now I don't understand anything.

50
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,300
This almost seems like a joke, but...

51
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,800
I made the judge understand the importance of this program to the radio.

52
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,140
Can't say it's a blamer.

53
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,880
The show can cause tropical fish to pop,

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,980
when waved over the tank.

55
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,900
The show sterilizes dogs and house cats within a three-block radius.

56
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,620
The show removes rust, earwax, and questionable stains of passion.

57
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,060
And now...

58
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,120
The Sub-Zine News.

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:48,500


60
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,740
What?

61
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,320
What?

62
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,380
What are we doing? What are we doing with the money?

63
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Well, honestly, we're spending.

64
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,240
That's the thing.

65
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,680
We're spending an huge box of money.

66
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,900
She says, look, Bob, it was so good to look at that.

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,740
With your dear, dear host and prayer partner,

68
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,220
Reverend Ivan Stang.

69
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,940
Presented to you by the Church of the Sub-Zine.

70
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,080
Sub-Zine.

71
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,800
Genius in the name of J.R. Bob.

72
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,400
Dose.

73
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,320
But all I can say is I get lots of recurrences when I do this.

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,700
And I get a few leaks.

75
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,380
So my own tendency is if the rectum seems normal,

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,460
perhaps with a bit of anal disease,

77
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,440
not to do an immediate collectomy and early rectal,

78
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,940
but to do a sub-ingenious...

79
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,100
...

80
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,100


81
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,740
...

82
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:51,760
...

83
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,760
...

84
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:52,780
...

85
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,620
...

86
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:53,680
...

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


88
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


89
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


90
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,780
...

91
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:53,800
...

92
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:53,960
...

93
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:53,960


94
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,000
...

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000


96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000


97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000


98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000


99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000


100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,440
...

101
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:54,880
...

102
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:54,880


103
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:54,900
...

104
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:54,920
...

105
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:54,920


106
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,340
...

107
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,340


108
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,360
...

109
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,360


110
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,360


111
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,380
...

112
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,760
...

113
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:56,760


114
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:56,760


115
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:56,760


116
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:56,760


117
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,020
...

118
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,020


119
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,020


120
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,020


121
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,200
MAN

122
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Man!

123
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,980
Man!

124
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,040
Put the adaptive nerve inside the body!

125
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,040
Mind it!

126
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,760
No we're not men!

127
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,340
We are the subgenius!

128
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,260
Aaaaaah!

129
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,920
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

130
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,260
Men's, no sense of humour.

131
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,500
And of course a lot of them have a normal rectum, so it's very attractive.

132
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,260
Keep the rectus subingenious and then after a year or so consider joining the patient up.

133
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,620
What if you punch two up?

134
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,140
You know what I mean? That's what I think.

135
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,740
Well stop thinking and get on down to Studio X Atomic Disco Lounge.

136
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,880
We think it's time we stop thinking.

137
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,840
Here we go!

138
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,000
The acceleration of pressure is tremendous.

139
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,240
It's a lot of pressure.

140
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,380
The velocity is a lot.

141
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,680
68 seconds, 69 seconds, 70 seconds, 71 seconds.

142
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,980
We better check everything.

143
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,280
We've got 48 hours to save a lot of money.

144
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,980
What a swell is the time!

145
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,520
We've got 48 hours to save a lot of time.

146
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,420
What a swell is the time!

147
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,820
No!

148
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,020
Yes?

149
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,520
You can assure your family's safe, secure comfort.

150
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,660
But hurry.

151
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,620
But hurry.

152
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,560
But hurry.

153
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,460
But hurry.

154
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,600
But hurry!

155
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,300
But hurry.

156
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,400


157
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,400


158
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,400


159
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,400


160
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,400


161
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,880
The biblical servant will be at the judgment.

162
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,980
That man, that woman who claims to be a Christian

163
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,140
and fails to support the kingdom of God in this life

164
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,220
will have no part in the kingdom of God.

165
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,880
The Bible said no covetous person shall inherit the kingdom of God.

166
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,200
A man cannot buy his way into the fold or into heaven.

167
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,300
The price was paid at Calvary by the blood of Jesus Christ.

168
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,200
But we're told plainly in the Bible,

169
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,080
that we're to give our tithe and our offering.

170
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,660
Or else...

171
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,200
Or else...

172
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,600
Or else what?

173
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,600
Well, you probably don't even care.

174
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,300
But at the same time,

175
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,960
our nobler aspirations are stirred

176
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
onward and upward

177
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,000
by the sweep in the emotions

178
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,360
lifted by the waving flag

179
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,080
and the...

180
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,660
...fields of fraud.

181
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,340
If you act like a dumb, stupid fool,

182
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,080
they'll treat you as an equal,

183
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,740
Bob said.

184
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,280
And I would say to you and your classmates,

185
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,900
uh, that as you go on into this abattoir,

186
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,280
this slaughterhouse,

187
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,100
this, uh, brothel and butcher shop that we call life,

188
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,860
just remember that...

189
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,640
...the fighting Jesus,

190
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,020
the fighting Jesus,

191
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,920
never fell back on jingoistic slogans

192
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,420
about family values for Nazis.

193
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,680
No! No, sir!

194
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,060
The fighting Jesus!

195
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,220
The praised Bob with a sword and a gun.

196
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,820
With a bullet in his gun.

197
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,080
And with a great big electric...

198
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,220
...marital aid.

199
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,280
With batteries!

200
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,840
...with batteries!

201
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:18,840


202
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,680
And his mind vibrated.

203
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,340
Strapped on, yes,

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,240
with big patriotic RED STRAPS!

205
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,900
And with his boxing gloves on, yes,

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
he would wade forward into the fray,

207
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,820
his machine gun blazing,

208
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,900
his Bible strapped across his chest

209
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,720
like a bulletproof vest,

210
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,320
and his Bob tattoo there on his forehead

211
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,240
protecting his brain.

212
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:48,820
And we've got a great local response here, Mr. Ornette.

213
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:48,820


214
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,900
from enemy missiles.

215
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,700
Ah, yes.

216
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,860
Oh, but after hearing my president

217
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,680
and his friends speak, I was moved.

218
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,900
Watching the Republican convention,

219
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,700
it reminded me what America is all about.

220
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,340
And I'm moved to announce that,

221
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,280
we were just kidding with all this subgenius stuff.

222
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,420
Oh, and by the way, we're not Jewish or gay.

223
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,340
And in fact, we all became Christians again.

224
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:24,760
Yeah.

225
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,120
And I'm a white male Christian of Anglo descent

226
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,060
with a family, with a family.

227
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,320
That's the most important part.

228
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,760
And I want Oliver North and Phil Graham

229
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,160
to be president in 1996.

230
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,300
But now I have this great big flag.

231
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,360
See, see me, see me?

232
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,180
I'm normal.

233
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,480
I'm normal.

234
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:48,740
I'm normal.

235
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,880
Everything's okay.

236
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,500
It is okay.

237
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,800
They're not gonna do anything to me yet, are they?

238
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,960
Probably not until after the election.

239
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,820
I'm sure they wouldn't do anything like that.

240
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,860
Oh, thank you.

241
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,460
Thank you.

242
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,560
When we accept this nomination,

243
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,260
you know, you're gonna be a great president.

244
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,260


245
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,260
Yes, dear friends.

246
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:26,740
Well, I was kind of surprised watching the Republicans

247
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,680
because they were acting like socialists.

248
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,580
Can you believe it?

249
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Republicans acting like socialists?

250
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,100
Of course, they were acting more like national socialists.

251
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,920
If you look in your history books

252
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,700
and see what else the national socialists like to be called,

253
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,700
you get big picture, kids.

254
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,260
All I can say is, I'm a Republican.

255
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,260
I'm a Democrat.

256
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,260


257
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,260


258
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,260


259
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,260


260
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,380
I mean, I hate to be so partisan.

261
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,920
You know, on the Subgenius show,

262
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,640
it's not that I like the other ones at all,

263
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,700
it's that you know, if this current bunch stays in there,

264
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,440
you better be white and straight and a fundamentalist

265
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,180
and a virgin.

266
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,480
That's gonna be the hard part for a lot of you.

267
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,080
But most of all, you better have money, plenty of money,

268
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,240
because that's what America is all about.

269
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,240


270
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,580
is all about. Anything to the left of fascism, such as what used to be called the middle of the road,

271
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,960
that you people are all un-American communists. And not only that, but Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

272
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:38,860
And read in the newspaper, why just the other day, that in Oregon, they're planning to

273
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,980
try to force a referendum on the strongest anti-gay measure ever considered by a state.

274
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:54,040
It could only be enforced by a vast bureaucracy of investigators to find and root out people,

275
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:02,020
not only who are gay, but who speak favorably of gays in state and local governments.

276
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,960
They wouldn't allow things in the library that referred to homosexuality in anything but a very

277
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:16,340
negative way. So what you would have would be thought police and peeping toms crawling all over

278
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,220
Oregon looking for gay people.

279
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,600
They claim that the intent of the measure was not to have a witch hunt,

280
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,980
but rather to simply state that it is the government's position that homosexuality is

281
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,840
abnormal and wrong. Well, I'm glad the government's going to get involved in family rights like that.

282
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,520
I'm sure the conservatives would love it. The measure would discriminate against gays.

283
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,060
They acknowledge the backers of it and would give landlords the right to

284
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,660
evict gay tenants or employers the right to dismiss gays.

285
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,300
And of course, they'd go into your bookstore and take out any books that happened to be written

286
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,100
by anybody who was gay. Well, you know, that's how you change history.

287
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:09,680
But on the other hand, look at those darn Democrats. I mean, Clinton, he's a draft dodger,

288
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:16,960
not like Dan Quayle or, you know, I mean, because po'buckers like Clinton are supposed to be.

289
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:24,120
Do the fighting in wars. Rich families like the Quayles, they're needed at home to support the wars.

290
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:33,140
And, uh, why, George Bush was a war hero, just like Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein. But then,

291
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,200
you know, on the other hand, World War II was worth fighting. Back then, back then,

292
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:46,720
Bush was shooting at the Nazis. In some ways, you know, he lost because afterwards, the OSS, he hired

293
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,800
Clinton, and then he was their boss in the CIA.

294
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,120
But, uh, he says he will lower taxes.

295
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,880
Now read my lips, listener.

296
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:13,460
But, uh, Clinton, Clinton, on the other hand, as they pointed out, will raise your taxes if you're

297
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,100
rich. Uh, Clinton,

298
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:24,380
Clinton admits, he just came out, well, almost admits that he smoked pot.

299
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,720
Now, see, whereas Dan Quayle's ex-dealer is in solitary confinement forever,

300
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,200
so you don't have to worry about that with those guys.

301
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,760
But then the liberals control the media, don't they?

302
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,240
You know, liberals like G.E. and Westinghouse and Exxon, those kind of liberals.

303
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:52,400
But all that aside, it's true that Clinton and all those Democrats want to kill babies with abortion

304
00:15:52,400 --> 00:16:00,940
rather than keep them around so that there'll be 50 million poverty-stricken teenagers to kill later in future oil wars.

305
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:09,780
Well, where are all our little colored soldiers going to come from when we decide to retake Vietnam?

306
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,280
Uh, it's family values, dear friends. God and country.

307
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,940
And it's that simple. That's all there is to it.

308
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,100
I mean, family values.

309
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,300
Although, one has to wonder, just exactly what is family values supposed to mean?

310
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:36,560
It's funny, I've got a family, a real tight family, real healthy, smart, able kind of family, big family,

311
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,400
with aunts, uncles, nieces, cousins, tons of babies.

312
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,140
And yet...

313
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:47,860
You know, I think we may value different things from the Bush family and the Quayle family

314
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:53,280
and some of those other piggish, lying families.

315
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,120
We value a lot more things and kinds of people than they do, apparently.

316
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,140
We don't call people un-American if they aren't like us.

317
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,500
And if we have enemies, we've found that it works better to tell the truth about ourselves

318
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,060
than lying about them.

319
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,940
Or their wives and girlfriends or whatever.

320
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,560
And, uh...

321
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,820
But it's true, they do want freedom of school choice.

322
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,560
Choice to segregate.

323
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,740
But no, no, I shouldn't say that.

324
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,140
The conservatives aren't racist anymore.

325
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,640
They never say the word nigger in public anymore.

326
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,500
You never hear them say that.

327
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,100
They can't be racist.

328
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,860
How could that...

329
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,660
And so...

330
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,700
And another thing about our values...

331
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,460
We actually...

332
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:47,420
And maybe this is bad, but we value questioning authority in a big way.

333
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,280
Because, by definition, authority is just what most must be questioned.

334
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:59,620
Authority has a lot more power to send my kid to war, to oil war, or to warp his mind,

335
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,400
or to throw him in jail, than any bunch of little minorities all put together.

336
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,360
But, on the other hand, it's not within family values to question any authority.

337
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:20,660
It's an authority that has the words, quote, family values, unquote, printed biggest across its, uh, swastikas.

338
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:29,420
Now, we'd like to have a choice over which drugs were being advertised to our children and sold cheap on the street corners.

339
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,380
And I don't mean crack.

340
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:37,100
I mean Miller Lite and those other liquid narcotics and the kind of smokes that cause cancer.

341
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,420
But, see, those aren't sold by hippies.

342
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,340
They're sold by cornerstones.

343
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,220
They're sold by corporations that own the whole states and senators.

344
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,460
Family values.

345
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,900
Family values, dear friends.

346
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,580
You know why Hillary Clinton is evil?

347
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,720
Do you know what makes her evil?

348
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,460
It's not just because she wrote that stupid thing on children's rights 18 years ago,

349
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,840
but because she wrote anything at all.

350
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,420
Because she had a job.

351
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,800
In fact, she makes more than her husband does some years.

352
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,940
But, oh, no, she ought to be home supporting her family.

353
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,520
God said so in this 2,000-year-old fairy tale we got here.

354
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,680
You know?

355
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,300
And school prayer.

356
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,960
We need to have school prayer back.

357
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,840
Why can't Christians have the right again to push around Jews and atheists and Buddhists and Muslims?

358
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:37,180
Because family values only includes that one God, you know, the nice one in the business suit,

359
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,880
with the wife that keeps her mouth shut.

360
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:48,060
And the daughter whose abortion is, well, it's a dirty secret we keep in the closet with several other things.

361
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:56,660
But you just, we should, with family values, a man doesn't cheat on his wife like that dirty dog Clinton and Jennifer, what's his name?

362
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,440
Now, of course, Bush had a secret girlfriend named Jennifer also.

363
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,500
And, in fact, I know a reporter who asked Bush about that a couple of years ago.

364
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,020
But the Secret Service made him leave.

365
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,340
And when he got home...

366
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,040
Well, when he got to work, he found out he was fired with no reason given.

367
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,580
And when he got home, there was a note on his door that basically said,

368
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:20,760
Ha ha.

369
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,880
Liberal controlled media, were you saying?

370
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,960
But at least they have family values about those, those, those gays.

371
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,140
And see, by their values, if their son is gay,

372
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,240
and, of course, you know, they haven't been able to cure,

373
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,900
that disease yet,

374
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:47,760
well then, then that son damn well better hate himself sufficiently for it.

375
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,800
Keep it in the closet.

376
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,500
Now, by my family values, if my son turned out gay,

377
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,480
and he still could,

378
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,060
my values would say to pat him on the back and say,

379
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,080
Well, go to it, son.

380
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,620
Don't let them ignorant witch-hunting scaredy-cats push you around.

381
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,020
And watch out, because there's a disease that's especially designed to kill,

382
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,260
you unmarried and poor folks.

383
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,420
Oh, I don't know.

384
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,900
Oh, by the way, speaking of which, just recently,

385
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,020
some radical or reactionary or Christian or somebody who hates us

386
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,980
had a porno catalog sent to my 11-year-old daughter.

387
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,640
But the joke's on them, because in our family values,

388
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,480
I mean, it just wasn't that terrible of a shock to her.

389
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,000
It was kind of a shock.

390
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,000


391
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,620
It was kind of funny.

392
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:46,620
Because we explain to our kids what real sex is about a long time before they've had a chance

393
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,800
to get some weird immersion on the playground or from pornography.

394
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,020
They've had the ins and outs.

395
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,420
Well, I mean, explained to them.

396
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,700
And even the variations thereof, carefully and sensibly explained to them.

397
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,280
Not demonstrated.

398
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:08,400
But, uh, I know a lot of families with more traditional family values.

399
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,460
You know, most of their kids have the dirtiest, most coprophilic mouths I ever heard.

400
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,940
Their parents don't ever hear it, though, because, um,

401
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:29,900
those conservative kids learn very early in life that there are a lot of things that you don't tell your parents.

402
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,640
Uh, friends, honestly, you know, listening to those speeches,

403
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,320
especially Phil Graham,

404
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,660
the anti-Christ, I call him,

405
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,260
and seeing Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson and those religious nuts,

406
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,240
you had to wonder,

407
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,660
well, how'd they keep David Duke out?

408
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,140
Oh, that's right, that's right, he might say the N-word and blow their cover.

409
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:05,120
And, uh, seeing all those Nordic, clean-cut, healthy, thug-like young Republicans chanting their little brains out,

410
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,320
I had to wonder, where's their brown shirt?

411
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,060
You know, where's those uniforms?

412
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:19,260
But the ones I really felt sorry for is the loyal Republican women continuing to keep their mouths shut

413
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,420
only because they hate liberals so much.

414
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,520
And I can't blame them.

415
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,920
But then look at how the media, including NPR and PBS, have defined liberal.

416
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,460
It's a cuss word now.

417
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,600
There's no middle of the road, according to Republicans.

418
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,560
No center is possible.

419
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,300
You're either a white-bred gay person,

420
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,660
bashing Ali North, revering money, making church going normal,

421
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,280
or you're a commie, a pervert, and a fool,

422
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,200
and all who do not support King Bush,

423
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,160
or baby-killing, anti-God, AIDS-spreading,

424
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,560
give-all-the-money-to-the-lazy-and-homeless,

425
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,780
big-word-using, Marxist,

426
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,320
simpering, lip-wristed, hand-wringing sissy, Sig Heil.

427
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,280
And not only that, but they are collaborators in the international arena.

428
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,280
And I'm not saying that because I'm a big fan of the Jewish conspiracy.

429
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,400
I'll tell you, I'll tell you, Mr. Conspiracy,

430
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,520
you keep talking that way, and come 1998,

431
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,560
you're going to have to deal with an interplanetary subgenius conspiracy.

432
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,980
Oh yeah.

433
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,360
Yeah, Bob will save us.

434
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,420
Unfortunately, in the meantime, we're going to have to save ourselves.

435
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,180
And that means, distasteful as it may be,

436
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,400
that we minorities are going to have to stick together,

437
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,580
because the majority, which seems to be easily taught in simple slogans,

438
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,600
has been taught to hate us.

439
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,080
And me, a minority?

440
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,540
Hey, I'm a straight Anglo male from a good Christian family.

441
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,700
But I must be in a minority,

442
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,740
because I sure don't have anything else in common with that majority.

443
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
So I don't know.

444
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,060
I mean, I hate, like I say,

445
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,700
I really don't mean to get partisan,

446
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,480
because I'm a satan, patriotic, psychotic, anarcho-materialist.

447
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,720
I think they're all fools.

448
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,420
And some of the people I love best are Republicans,

449
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,520
but they're not that kind.

450
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,980
And I wonder how much longer they can hate the liberals more.

451
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,980
Anyone can be a preacher.

452
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,460
You don't need a philosophy degree or a doctorate in anything.

453
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,880
Just have Jesus Christ enter the spirit of your body,

454
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,720
and you can spread the word of the Lord.

455
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,700
It says in the Bible,

456
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,860
go out and spread the word of Jesus.

457
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,000
And now you can do it, and make money too.

458
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,580
And don't worry about it.

459
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,640
Don't worry if you haven't been saved yet.

460
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,260
Father Grace and myself will take care of that.

461
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,200
We'll see you next time.

462
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,200


463
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,180
What a sweet, what a sweet.

464
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,280
Remember, nothing happens until someone buys something.

465
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,120
Oh, it would be wonderful, George.

466
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,080
We'd feel like Columbus when we discovered America.

467
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,160
Have you lost your mind, Jane?

468
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,940
It's dangerous, and it's ridiculous.

469
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,140
I'll call the government up and explain it's all a horrible mistake.

470
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,960
Can you find a solution?

471
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,640
How do we make America a practice of the world?

472
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:51,880
The fact is,

473
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:51,880


474
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,760
Oh, my God.

475
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,400
Sir,

476
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,620
Mr. S serious?

477
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,960
Excuse me?

478
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,380
but the record reveals that you have been unprofitable and the word decrees

479
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:16,680
that the unprofitable servant must be cast into outer darkness but when have

480
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:23,020
I been unprofitable you have rebelled against my word and you have stolen your

481
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:28,220
Lord's money why you lived upon the earth I permitted you to earn a good

482
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,900
living as my servant I gave you power and health to earn money and in return

483
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:40,520
for this I decree to my word that a tenth part of those earnings were mine I

484
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:47,240
left that 10% in your care charging you to invest it for me into my church that

485
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:54,320
the gospel might be preached but you Scott have rebelled against my word you

486
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,680
have not only taken 90% which I freely gave you but you have been so covetous

487
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,100
as to take the 10% also

488
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,940
did you know that rebellion is a sin of witchcraft and that no covetous person

489
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,680
shall enter the kingdom of God oh sir I tell you I didn't realize it was so

490
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:24,360
serious you made that choice when you were only 18 look at your record July

491
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:33,300
15 1953 well a man robbed God yeah you have robbed me but you say when have we robbed thee?

492
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,880
you say when have we robbed thee?

493
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,600
in tithes and offerings you're cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation

494
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:49,600
God wouldn't do that he's a loving God besides there's plenty of people that have more money than I do I need mine

495
00:28:52,580 --> 00:29:00,220
Scott you made your choice when you rejected my word you rejected me and to your eternal sorrow

496
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,980
you have found that I only could you afford

497
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:09,220
to give to God that which was his but you could not afford to do otherwise the

498
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:16,100
Senate still stand cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness where there

499
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,680
is wailing and gnashing of teeth please give me just one more chance sir I don't

500
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:28,460
want to go to Hell, no no, let go, I don't want to go to Hell, no!

501
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,320
The ancient tradition that the world will be consumed in fire at the end of six thousand

502
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,880
years is true as I have heard from subgenius Hel.

503
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,580
For the Kerug with his flaming sword is thereby commanded to leave his guard at the Tree of

504
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:59,560
Life and when he does, the whole creation will be consumed and appear infinite and holy,

505
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,360
whereas it now appears finite and corrupt.

506
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:08,280
This will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment.

507
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,420
But first to the notion that man or woman has a body distinct from his or her soul is

508
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,700
to be expunged.

509
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:23,800
This I shall do by printing in the infernal method by corrosives which in subgenius Hel

510
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:29,340
are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away and displaying the infinite

511
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,180
which was hid.

512
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,340
If the doors of perception are closed, then I shall not be able to see, nor can I see

513
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:32,340


514
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:32,640
the light of the world.

515
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,100
If the world were cleansed, everything would appear to us as it is, infinite.

516
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,720
The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom, folks.

517
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,040
An excess of sorrow laps, an excess of joy weeps.

518
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,760
The cistern contains.

519
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,020
The fountain overflows.

520
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,340
The world is in its own right.

521
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:02,340


522
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,280
The world is in its own right.

523
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,360
One thought fills immensity.

524
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,980
You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.

525
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,360
The soul of sweet delight can never be defiled.

526
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,860
Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires.

527
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,180
Exuberance is beauty.

528
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,820
If the lion was advised by the fox, he would be cunning.

529
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,440
The lion is the lion.

530
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,180
The lion is the lion.

531
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,160
The lion is the lion.

532
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,340
The lion is the lion.

533
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,340


534
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,340


535
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,800
The lion is the lion.

536
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:34,800


537
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,260
You never know what is enough unless you know what is enough.

538
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,360
One thought fills the palace of wisdom, and the entire universe is in its own right.

539
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,360


540
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,360


541
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,360


542
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,400
The world is full of bliss.

543
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,400


544
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,400


545
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,400


546
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,400


547
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,400


548
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,400


549
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:45,520
Those who restrain desire do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained, and

550
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,040
the restrainer, or reason, usurps its place and governs the unwilling.

551
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,200
willing.

552
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:59,300
All Bibles or sacred codes have been the causes of the following errors.

553
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,500
That we have two real existing principles, that is, a body and a soul.

554
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:13,940
That energy called evil is alone from the body and that reason called good is alone

555
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,060
from the soul.

556
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:21,640
And that God will torment us in eternity for following our energies.

557
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,860
But the following contraries to these are true.

558
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:37,220
We have no body distinct from our soul, for that called body is a portion of soul discerned

559
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,860
by the five senses, the chief inlets of soul in this age.

560
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,960
Energy is the only life.

561
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,160
And is from the body.

562
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,140
And reason is the bound or outward circumference of energy.

563
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,280
Energy is eternal, the alive.

564
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:10,240
Place the right thumb over the right nostril.

565
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:23,620
And the left thumbあります the attribute which nicknames the soul.

566
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,400
So, I know that you have the wish for the solution.

567
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:24,400


568
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:32,600
I but would you have realized that as a persons not the violent channels that have been being

569
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,060
put in like malevolent or ideologous.

570
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,140
I?

571
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,200


572
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,720
Oh, husk.

573
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,560
Oh, husk.

574
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:36,560


575
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:36,820
My dear.

576
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,020
Look, there is immtrlточ.

577
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,420
F 만�ον 식ər다.

578
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:37,420


579
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:37,420


580
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:37,420


581
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,620
Endless hole towards a destructing system.

582
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,180
The third second beginning smells of ever устройment and complete denial of nature and

583
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,180


584
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,840
Re Competition.

585
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,040
End this on the orbit!

586
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,040


587
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,040


588
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,140
Landing on the moon is just an old Boeing does.

589
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,220
So without further delay, let's rock away to the final 15 minutes of the show.

590
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,160
Here's your first officer of the day, Presley Gevidence.

591
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,820
He's spinning some platters now.

592
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,360
We're going to have a great show, guys.

593
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,740
And here we go.

594
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,980
Now, here's an interesting news item.

595
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:18,840
Yes, a wealthy American tourist visiting Budapest, Hungary,

596
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,980
suffered a violent and bloody death after her expensive mink coat sprang to life

597
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,480
and clawed the woman to pieces.

598
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:31,580
She was covered from head to toe with terrible bite marks on her...

599
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,600
reported police inspector, Janer...

600
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,400
Janer?

601
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,800
What the...

602
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,080
Janer Troutman, who investigated the death of 47-year-old

603
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,960
California Harris...

604
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,260
Marilee Fitzgerald.

605
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,140
Tests show that the wounds were caused by claws and teeth of person or persons unknown.

606
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,080
They don't know who the mink was?

607
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,880
Mink the bill.

608
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,320
I thought it was her mink.

609
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,040
Never stuff a lobster down your underpants.

610
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:04,000
A simple maxim, you may think, but one that was overlooked by Boston shoplifter Winston Treadway

611
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,720
with unfortunate results.

612
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:12,620
Treadway had already amassed a quantity of stolen food in a trawl around an out-of-the-way supermarket,

613
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,280
when he spotted a tank full of live seafood.

614
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,960
Plucking two claw-clickin' lobsters from the water, he stashed them in his undies and sprinted for the exit,

615
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:29,540
only to pull up short in the nearby alley as the enraged crustacea clamped their claws around his...

616
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:29,900
Boop!

617
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,720
When we saw him, he was trying to prize...

618
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,740
To prize? They must mean to pry.

619
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,980
To prize the claws off.

620
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,580
He was purple as an eggplant.

621
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,900
When we...

622
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,020
When we got to him, said police, having accosting the thief...

623
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,500
Where was this printed, in Hong Kong?

624
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,620
Having accosting the thief, the cops had to call for pliers to remove the lobsters,

625
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:59,340
and doctors who confirmed that Treadway had inadvertently performed a DIY vasectomy

626
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:06,320
later told him he might never father children, but only give birth to a large, creepy lobster.

627
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,880
Mwahahahaha!

628
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,460
I'm sorry, I thought I'd come in.

629
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,900
Yeah, you did. You gave it away.

630
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,020
I'm sorry.

631
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,040
Spoiled the puns.

632
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,320
Where's Aunt Goita?

633
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,320
Well, you know, I feel so passive here, buried down in the sound well, surrounded by mazes of sound effects.

634
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,160
Now, you might be telling yourself, the project sounds great.

635
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,880
What can I say? It's just beautiful!

636
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:39,940
The project in its package form is available for your use immediately, with your own chosen title for the album,

637
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,880
as well as the entire inside cover surface, and the full cover of the album.

638
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:42,880


639
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:42,880


640
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,460
For your use.

641
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:52,040
Take two high-quality stereo LPs, put them in a full-color jacket, add a beautiful sexy gal on front,

642
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:59,600
and candid photos of the KQ jocks inside, and you've got a bombshell.

643
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,880
In the retail stores, the album was sold for $4.80.

644
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:12,880


645
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:12,880


646
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:12,880


647
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:12,880


648
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:12,880


649
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:12,880


650
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,980
And you will receive an additional 25 cents per album above the royalty rate set for mail order.

651
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,140
Black is black.

652
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,800
White is white.

653
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,280
Day is day.

654
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,880
Night is night.

655
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,240
Nature is what it is.

656
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,060
Regardless of what you would like.

657
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,800
Man up, stick to your nonsense.

658
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,000
Go take a hike.

659
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:00,000
Honey noise.

660
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,580
zers of WEB tennis rules.

661
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:01,580


662
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:01,580


663
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:01,580


664
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:01,580


665
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:01,580


666
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,860
And now, questions of body number, weight, éico,ижу, weight,

667
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,860
physiology, dressing room.

668
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,320
Meant to say, some.

and here's the transition to chaos

694
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,520

00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:12,860


715
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,180
oh

716
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,320
all right we're being replenished

717
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,500
oh that's awful

718
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,080
is there nothing i can do to please you people

719
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:36,980
no i'm sorry

720
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,320
too bad

721
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:41,940
the love of your life is so strong that it's hard to understand

722
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:42,860
the love of your life is so strong that it's hard to understand

723
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:57,060
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness, but is long suffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

724
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,000
Yes, Doctor, here's that repentance now.

725
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,260
Now, wasn't that easy and wasn't that fun?

726
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,740
I'm going to kill you.

727
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,840
That's not English.

728
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,480
I never said he was.

729
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:11,980
Is that New York?

730
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,700
He's the garotter, the thuggy strangler of Wedley Marsh.

731
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,620
I'm going to kill you?

732
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,700
Is that like for a book or something?

733
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:26,720
Once he catches you by the coattails, he submerges you in the stinking marsh until you're devoured by the lamprey of Lampwick.

734
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,500
Wow.

735
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,180
Okay, well, I'll just get this tape here and a coke and sit back and watch the lamprey of Lampwick do his stuff.

736
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,780
Something like a missile.

737
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:41,960
When you forgot to worship Jesus, your lives turned into a little prayer.

738
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,880
I'm sorry, Aunt Bertha.

739
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,960
What can I do to make it all up to you?

740
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,300
Should I shoot Jesus?

741
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,120
You should write to me at...

742
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,260
At Box One Grand Rapids.

743
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,860
...Story, Box One Grand Rapids.

744
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,440
What about Uncle Charlie?

745
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,320
Are you and him still getting it on?

746
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,080
This is it.

747
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:07,140
Timmy and Bobby were at a radio station.

748
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,360
Come on.

749
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,760
Nobody's meeting.

750
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:12,140
Pay attention.

751
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,600
Let's go in and talk on the microphones.

752
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,360
We could have a show of our own.

753
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,140
But I don't think...

754
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,200
So they do.

755
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,940
Jesus Radio Station.

756
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,280
They sneak around the back of the cruise ship.

757
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,520
Aunt Bertha swelled up and...

758
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,400
Aunt Bertha?

759
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,440
...became larger and...

760
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,200
Aunt Bertha?

761
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,100
Who are you?

762
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,240
What the hell is Aunt Bertha?

763
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,880
Boys and girls.

764
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,580
Oh, no.

765
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,340
He cussed and said Aunt Bertha in the same sentence.

766
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,520
We'll all die now.

767
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,500
Shoot that man, Timmy.

768
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,420
He blasphemes against Aunt Bertha.

769
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,100
Aunt Bertha's dead.

770
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,280
I hope you like this story, boys and girls.

771
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:49,820
Dead.

772
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,240
If you would like a free picture of me, as well as a free game...

773
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,440
And I killed her.

774
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,020
I'm ripping her apart.

775
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,700
Aunt Bertha.

776
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,200
I'm a story.

777
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,160
Box 77.

778
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:04,780
Massachusetts.

779
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,220
Grand Rapids.

780
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,000
Massachusetts.

781
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,920
Goodbye now.

782
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:09,440
Goodbye.

783
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:10,760
Goodbye.

784
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:11,320
Bye.

785
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,220
Goodbye.

786
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:14,280
Goodbye.

787
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,080
Billy and Timmy.

788
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,340
We brought the lady in.

789
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,980
She appears to be ripped apart.

790
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,380
Name's Bertha.

791
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,640
It was Billy and Timmy, officer.

792
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,500
They ripped my body.

793
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,440
I'm not sure what we'll do with her.

794
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,080
We could sew her back together.

795
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:28,800
Oh, I'll get it.

796
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,320
Visitors to the Aunt Bertha show are put up at the posh Roach Motel.

797
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,140
On the kitchen floor with the little toy cars in front of it.

798
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:41,640
And guests.

799
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,500
And the

800
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,700
Aunt Bertha Show.

801
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,500
We'll have to start that one over again.

802
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,600
Gosh, Timmy.

803
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,780
It sure is neat to drive this midget submarine.

804
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,640
Yeah, they'll never know we're not really in church the way we're supposed to, like Andy

805
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,200
B says.

806
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,020
Oh, forget about that old baby.

807
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:02,420
This is God.

808
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:03,080
I see them.

809
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,100
Oh, no, look.

810
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:05,880
Somebody.

811
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,180
It's God.

812
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,320
And he sees us.

813
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,040
He's got all of our hair.

814
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,120
Let's see how long you've got in this submarine.

815
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,440
You've never come out.

816
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:14,780
Oh, no.

817
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,660
We can't get out even with a ladder.

818
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:18,780
Oh.

819
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,680
I wish I'd thought to take Jesus into my heart.

820
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,360
But it has to rhyme.

821
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,400
Now it's too late.

822
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,040
It has to rhyme.

823
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,560
But it's never too late, Billy.

824
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,000
I won't cut off your air hose.

825
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,160
It won't be clean.

826
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,240
You'll just take Jesus into your heart.

827
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,840
I'm sorry, those children.

828
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,020
The submarine exploded in a quiet moment.

829
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


830
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


831
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


832
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


833
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


834
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


835
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


836
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


837
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


838
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


839
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


840
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


841
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


842
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:47,900
It was a child's arm turning over and over, ascended at the top of the explosive column.

843
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,600
I hope you like this story, boys and girls.

844
00:51:52,780 --> 00:52:00,300
If you would like a free gift and a nude picture of me, write to Aunt Bertha.

845
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,300
Dial Astori.

846
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,340
The subgenius show.

847
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,760
I get excited every time I see that.

848
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,220
That must be a drug addict, Kimmy.

849
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:10,720
Run.

850
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,000
He's got a gun.

851
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:11,000


852
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:11,000


853
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:11,000


854
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:11,000


855
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,280
He's got big, loaded eyes.

856
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,500
Okay, we're loading up the eyes of the big, Timmy monster now.

857
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,060
Okay, Kimmy, eyes loaded.

858
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,780
Kimmy, come over here before I smack you silly.

859
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,860
Now, you notice that Kimmy is swelling to 160 feet tall.

860
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:28,920
Now, when your Aunt Bertha tells you to do something, by heaven, you ought to do it.

861
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,100
I don't even believe you are my aunt.

862
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,540
The giant Kimmy is armed and loaded.

863
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,780
Ever since you kidnapped me and told me that my daddy was my daddy, my mommy was my mommy,

864
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,620
my aunt was my aunt.

865
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,660
Now, the giant Kimmy begins to...

866
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:40,980
Now, you're going to kill me.

867
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,340
...stride across the city with arms akimbo.

868
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:43,740
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

869
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,820
You godless little creep.

870
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,660
I'm going to give you the back of my hand.

871
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,160
You're never going to give me the back of your nothing because I'm running away.

872
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,360
I'm getting to the place.

873
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,520
And now, the little Kimmy has stripped the skin from his mother.

874
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,220
I'm going to get to the place in just a couple of minutes because I know he's Oakland

875
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,060
police officer.

876
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,380
Kimmy, put those pants on right now.

877
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:56,780
No.

878
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,880
When do your father get home?

879
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,120
I'm sick of the impressive chance to die.

880
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,160
The 160-foot Kimmy is embarrassing the entire city.

881
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,660
I'm afraid to be me.

882
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,640
I'm proud of my person.

883
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:09,100
And now, Kimmy strives with more arms akimbo than even before.

884
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,980
We have the situation under control.

885
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,480
General, I'm...

886
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,200
...I'm in a situation where I'm in a plane with a plane in my mouth.

887
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:13,940
...in a plane with a plane in my mouth.

888
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,020
Repeat.

889
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,340
Kimmy is absolutely harmless.

890
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,000
There is no cause to panic.

891
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,600
The government is lying to the people now as the giant Kimmy steps on all the breweries

892
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,720
and schools in the area.

893
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:23,960
...trying to stop me.

894
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,220
There's a real and personal psychological proportion.

895
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,280
Kimmy will not harm you if you are still.

896
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,960
But I'm at 20 feet tall now.

897
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,680
The giant Kimmy is advancing towards the state capital now.

898
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,220
Attention.

899
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:39,680
Group military units, regiments, 12 and regiments are taking into position.

900
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,380
I need a little weak test.

901
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:40,960
I need a little weak test.

902
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:40,960


903
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:40,960


904
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:40,960


905
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,200
The

906
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,460
giant Kimmy is approaching the capitol building.

907
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,860
Nothing can stop me.

908
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,140
The heroes may be ultra strong.

909
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,420
I'm now the size of a city clock.

910
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,040
I must be over 100 feet tall.

911
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,460
Even the sea missiles won't be able to stop me.

912
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,340
The giant Kimmy threatens Washington, D.C.

913
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,460
Sergeant.

914
00:53:59,140 --> 00:53:59,700
Sergeant.

915
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,800
We've got an old lady here who says she knows this Kimmy and can control it.

916
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,540
Put her on the megaphone.

917
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,660
Kimmy, I know you can hear me.

918
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,940
This is Aunt Bertha and this is...

919
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,780
I'm sick of hearing what you're telling me what to do, especially...

920
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,540
Where is Aunt Bertha's voice coming from?

921
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,740
I'm going to step on her.

922
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:22,980
Uh-oh.

923
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,240
Uh-oh, look.

924
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,580
I'm right down here by your foot, Kimmy.

925
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,120
Now remember, Jesus loves you.

926
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,780
His giant power eyes are looking into the Aunt Bertha.

927
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,900
I'll tell you who loves me.

928
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,420
If Jesus loves me, you can spoil me, don't you?

929
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,200
That ought to show her a thing or two.

930
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:36,880
Oh, no.

931
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,120
He blew up the Aunt Bertha doll.

932
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,920
This is a tragic moment in our history.

933
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:40,920


934
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:40,920


935
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:45,380
A cloud of poisonous gas just drifted over the city.

936
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:45,980
Oh, excuse me.

937
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:52,880
They thought they were free to live their lives in sin.

938
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,000
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

939
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:04,020
Oh, that hurts my ears so good.

940
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,920
And, friends, what we have been hearing there was Aunt Bertha's voice.

941
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:10,920


942
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:10,920


943
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:10,920


944
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:10,920


945
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:10,920


946
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,980
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

947
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,700
I was so scared.

948
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:25,920
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

949
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:32,740
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

950
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:44,820
The place where this commeschoolonne comes to où which is a great pool should be

951
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:51,160
dried is in the heart of a dream where I should turn to the bulwark mountain before

952
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,340
the sun goes down into days workshops.

953
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,140
Is it going to rain tomorrow?

954
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:57,280
Yes, it did.

955
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,680
There we go.

956
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,720
and listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

957
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,320
And I know you'd like to know more about the Church of the Subgenius,

958
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,960
which, why, it would explain exactly what this is all about.

959
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,520
You can write for free information, find out more about our books, tapes,

960
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,220
and you name it.

961
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,560
They sell it, we sell it too.

962
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:33,220
Just write, send that postcard or self-addressed stamped envelope to Bob at,

963
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,340
you got that pencil ready?

964
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,900
I knew you would.

965
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,340
Oh, getting excited, aren't you?

966
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,600
Yes, baby.

967
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:55,540
That's Bob at Post Office Box 140306 in lovely Dallas, Texas, 75214.

968
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,500
Awesome.

969
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,380
Ah, yes.

970
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:06,120
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

971
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,620
And stay tuned for the Swingin' Love Corps.

972
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:09,980
We'll see you then.

973
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,080
Bye.

974
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,520
Bye.

975
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,080
Bye.

976
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,680
Bye.

977
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:17,880
Bye.

978
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,500
Bye.

979
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:19,800
Bye.

980
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,520
Bye.

981
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:20,680


982
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:20,940
Bye.

983
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:21,280


984
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:21,660
Bye.

985
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:23,900
Bye.

986
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:25,940
Bye.

987
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:26,540
Bye.

988
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:26,540


989
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:26,540


990
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:26,540


991
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:26,540


992
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:26,540


993
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:26,540


994
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:26,540


995
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,360
guitar solo

996
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,780
In the name of love and understanding

997
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,800
Say it all away

998
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,640
And the baby's singing

999
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,520
And all the animals

1000
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,160
Oh, can you feel the section

1001
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,540
Oh, our animal brothers

1002
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,540
Oh, our animal brothers

1003
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,560
Oh, our animal brothers

1004
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,780
That sacrifice their lives every day

1005
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,000
In the name of

1006
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,760
Medical fire

1007
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,460
I fall for the brothers

1008
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,540
They're giving their lives

1009
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,160
Every day

1010
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,660
They're cutting them open

1011
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,660
Running in tubes

1012
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,520
They're putting those doors on their sides

1013
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,580
All kind of experiments

1014
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,920
And they do it in the name of

1015
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,020
Medical science

1016
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,000
You fall for the brothers

1017
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,920
I'm giving their lives

1018
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,840
I'm giving their lives

1019
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,380
I'm giving their lives

1020
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,340
My body

1021
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,360
Medical science

1022
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,920
Oh, oh, oh

1023
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,240
Oh, oh, oh

1024
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,620
Oh, oh, oh

1025
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,280
Oh, oh, oh

1026
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:58,280


1027
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:58,280


1028
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,800
If I could have my way

1029
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:05,360
If I know it's not gonna be

1030
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,360
We're good at much patient

1031
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:06,360


1032
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:06,360


1033
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,240
Oh, oh, oh

1034
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,880
My eyes will kick in

1035
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,700
So remember

1036
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,960
The very next time

1037
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:43,660
There's a friendly four-footed furry animal that gave his life to find out whether or not you die when you ate that stuff, or drank that stuff, or smoked that stuff, or whatever else you had to do.

1038
01:00:48,960 --> 01:01:03,360
Your four-footed brothers are laying down their lives for you every day, for you every day, for you every day.

1039
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,700
Some tick to fill the section.

1040
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,580
Some tick to fill the section.

1041
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,400
Some tick to fill the section.

1042
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,340
Some tick to fill the section.

1043
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,160
Some tick to fill the section.

1044
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:23,360
Our four-footed brothers are subject to vivisection.

1045
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:40,440
In the name of medical science, for you, my friend, for your life, for the lives of your fellow man.

1046
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:46,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1047
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:50,360
Ah, ah.

1048
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:56,760
Your four-footed brothers are laying down their lives.

1049
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,780
Ah, ah.

1050
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,760
Little doors on the side.

1051
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,520
Tooth.

1052
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,540
Running out of that little duster.

1053
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,360
Ah, ah.

1054
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:20,900
Tooth to tooth.

1055
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,080
To the dip.

1056
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,700
To the dip.

1057
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,860
To the grip.

1058
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,260
To the grip.

1059
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:28,640
Point it.

1060
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:29,300
To the elbow.

1061
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:29,700
Tothe little dick.

1062
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,220
To the lip.

1063
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,120
To the butt.

1064
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,260
To the tooth.

1065
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:40,860
To the face.

1066
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:40,860


1067
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:40,860


1068
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:40,860


1069
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:40,860


1070
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:40,860


1071
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:41,960
guy again.

1072
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,080
Let un Bub.

1073
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:42,640
Hey.

1074
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:43,340
Abigail, it's a penny-a-igten.

1075
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:43,340


1076
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:43,340


1077
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:43,340


1078
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:43,340


1079
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:43,340


1080
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,060
And...

1081
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,080
This is a test of the emergency bra-

1082
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:52,460
Sipana.

1083
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,400
Merge your Lincoln into the rudder of the broad-

1084
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,840
cowing pre-recorded announcement.

1085
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,240
