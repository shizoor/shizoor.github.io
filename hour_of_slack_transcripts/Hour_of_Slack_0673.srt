00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:15,300
Good evening, and welcome to the radio ministry outreach of Tranquility Base, where we believers

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:23,380
carry the firm conviction that we were placed here to build the rocket ships, the space-faring

3
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:31,440
pleasure vessels prescribed in Dobsian scripture, to voyage out into the cosmos to venture where

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,120
no billion-year-old carbon has ventured before.

5
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,040
Wanna go for a ride?

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,700
Earth, we must get on.

7
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,480
Earth.

8
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,320
We must get on.

9
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:01,860
Earth.

10
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:02,840
Earth.

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,800
We must get on.

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,020
They'd say, you know, that crazy neighbor dreamed houses up the street.

13
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,860
We kept talking about this.

14
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,360
That religious nut.

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,920
He must have been wild.

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,900
Get it and follow it.

17
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,980
Kill, kill, kill zombies.

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,820
If you don't like the people or the way that they talk.

19
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,360
If you don't like their manners or the way that they walk.

20
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,720
Kill, kill, kill zombies.

21
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,360
Kill, kill, kill zombies.

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,160
If you don't kill them, then the Chinese will.

23
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,100
If you don't want America to play second fiddle.

24
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,320
Kill, kill, kill zombies.

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,900
Kill, kill, kill zombies.

26
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,920
If you let them live, they may subvert the Russians.

27
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,840
If you let them live, they might love the Russians.

28
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,080
Kill, kill, kill.

29
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,720
Kill them, kill them, scrape them, gook creeps.

30
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,220
Only gook an American can trust.

31
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,680
Is a gook that's got his yellow head bust.

32
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,000
Kill, kill, kill zombies.

33
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,900
Kill, kill, kill.

34
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:53,780
Kill, kill, kill zombies.

35
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,160
Kill, kill, kill.

36
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,500
It'll feel so good.

37
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,920
Like my captain said it should.

38
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,340
Kill, kill, kill zombies.

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,040
Kill, kill, kill zombies.

40
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,860
Kill, it will give you the mental ease.

41
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,200
Kill, it will give you a big release.

42
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,840
Kill, kill, kill zombies.

43
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,420
Kill, kill, kill zombies.

44
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,020
Kill, kill, kill zombies.

45
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,200
Kill, kill, kill.

46
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,280
Kill, kill, kill.

47
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,900
How would we explain all this to a dispassionate extraterrestrial observer?

48
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,300
What account would we give of our stewardship of the planet Earth?

49
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,240
We have heard the rationales offered by the superpowers.

50
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,860
We know who speaks for the nations.

51
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,160
who speaks for the human species who speaks for earth

52
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,960
but they were laughing at it do you remember the one guy who we were here yeah what you call it a

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:11,040
one-way mirror and he was uh i don't know it was like he was trying to get the people to roll all

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,440
of us to roll the one stone back up and down the hill and the one-way mirror we we gave it a name

55
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,980
or something like that yeah that's where all those metaphors started it was the that was when we first

56
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,280
created metaphors don't you remember that yeah archie and the swingers all the old language you

57
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,460
know with the with the cataclysm through sonic and we had to reinvent language of course through

58
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,680
sonic imitation that was hard to make a metaphor when you were trying to say this was like a big

59
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,920
music you know making something you know the metaphors that the dolphins used when they were

60
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,140
trying to teach us didn't make any sense because they were all based on echo's sonic location right

61
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,960
you know what which by then we we were that make probably so far away from

62
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,540
that evolution right they get out of the water and go yeah and we're supposed to you know see a

63
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,860
shark uh you know with this cool little shark movie in our heads it's just you know all we see is this

64
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:10,000
ugly fish so we should harpoon it drag it out and eat it well it took us a long time to figure that

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,440
out didn't it well it didn't really take that long after you've been harpooned and eaten a few times

66
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,620
yes and that is why i don't play my golf masters for having no mercy on us

67
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,220

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,260

makes fun of him

71
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,260
yeah

72
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,520

contains all the

74
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,620
typical reincarnation memories each one of you guys have all had since he was a little bit of heart

75
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:49,080
you didn't even know it see so you're just making fun of him but he carries all the vast memories of everybody in the ocean of his big fat brain

76
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,300
but how do you weird

77
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,720

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,220
sh

81
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,800
is

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,020

そして

85
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,860
Who speaks further?

86
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,940
We can just kind of walk lackadaisical through life.

87
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,800
Well, I hope I'm going to make it.

88
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,780
You sense an oppression, an evil presence there, don't you?

89
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,000
If there's no meat, no fruit in any of their works.

90
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:01,680
I have seen works from Vienna to Rome and I look everywhere I look, each opening I go to, it looks like these people have just eaten dirt.

91
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,080
They live on dirt and filth.

92
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,560
They have no real feeling for art.

93
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,660
They eat their own fishes.

94
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,200
They eat their own sweets.

95
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,000
They are running pokies and things.

96
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,300
And it is no importance to their work.

97
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:14,780
And they are not.

98
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,380
I think if I only look in retrospect at these people, I think I will know them.

99
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,520
Not one of them will survive into the next century.

100
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
Help is on the way.

101
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,880
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

102
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,760
You're my only hope.

103
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,760
The Toraleaf and Magnified Mummy's hand, that's a very powerful component.

104
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,620
They used to do that in the Swamp Lands.

105
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,300
Remember when you guys were down in New Orleans and that weird old Greek lady was trying to put a hexagram on you?

106
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,620
Yeah.

107
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,320
And I don't know.

108
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,900
I don't really remember it though.

109
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,260
It was some kind of an abstruse dog figurine or something like that.

110
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,140
They were selling it on the street and they said it was full of cloy leaf and anchovies and different stuff.

111
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,340
And it would make you go sterile and blind and run and bite the bark off the trees and everything.

112
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,400
So that's what happened to me.

113
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,140
I tried some of it.

114
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:06,860
Yeah.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,460
And that's what happened afterwards.

116
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,440
It's over, I guess.

117
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,200
Well, do you write songs about you?

118
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,280

125

134
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:06,900
dear now run along beings from another world

135
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,560
is that some kind of a flying machine no no it's parted from the ground by rays probably some form

136
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,440
of magnetic flux like invisible legs this is amazing they take the egg boxes that you in a

137
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,560
common department store any other place you might leave your clothing and stuff and they just plaster

138
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,340
it up on the walls and there you got yourself in a synchronized compartment you know the world is

139
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,780
changing so fast that the only way you can get out of it is by putting it in a box and you can't get

140
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,180
out of the box and you can't get out of it so you have to put it in a box and you can't get out of it

141
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,180


142
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,840
predict things is with retroactive prophecy but if you can get the top of your head up outside that

143
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,600
20 mile zone above the steroid you can look down where there ain't no time seat and you can check

144
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,380
out the different compartments the lonesome cowboy dave the human periscope well that's what i do

145
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,140
imagine you with your head neck stretched out like that and your head swiveling and wobbling

146
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,100
wobbling

147
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,780
why

148
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,240
all right not listening i wanna tell you one more thing before you pass out

149
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,940
stop listening to the radio stop drinking nyquil by the courts stop drinking whole bottles of vo

150
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,060
Supreme and listening to the radio and complaining about what you don't understand, okay?

151
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,380
Can I say it right?

152
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,180
Try to communicate with them first and shoot later if you have to.

153
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,460
Shut off the pump and let that poor thing in there die.

154
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,180
You have gone over the line.

155
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,400
This is too far.

156
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,700
This is too far and you are not really dealing with this.

157
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,000
That's why you're calling because you know you're in trouble.

158
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,580
Man, they're predicting a lot of stuff.

159
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,520
The seven seals will be broken.

160
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,040
The eighth seal will bark and juggle.

161
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,780
That's always...

162
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,180
They taught how to juggle, you know, balance the ball on top of its nose.

163
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,840
Yes, and when it drops the ball, that's when all the computers will crash.

164
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,280
When the seal drops the ball from its nose.

165
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,940
And when all the computers crash, that's really it.

166
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,060
That's the end of everything.

167
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:26,940
Oh, yeah.

168
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,040
I mean, we can't exist.

169
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,820
I mean, everyone's heart will stop.

170
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,220
Flowers will go to sleep.

171
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,900
The cows will run away.

172
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,640
January 9th will become another ska-punk holiday.

173
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,720
It just will go wacky for some reason.

174
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,200
All food will disappear because it's made by computing.

175
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,680
I'm opening a canvas and twine store to take advantage of the rush that will be going on.

176
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,680
Yeah, I need to stockpile some torches.

177
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
You should be building ships willy-nilly.

178
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,860
Light might break.

179
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,840
Right, canvas, torches, twine.

180
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,580
Yeah, is the sun liable under the Y2K?

181
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,940
You know it might go out.

182
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,520
Yeah, the sun might go out.

183
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:01,900
Yeah.

184
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,840
It's conceivable.

185
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,320
It is, well, it's rather inconceivable, really.

186
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,560
Might have to reboot the sun.

187
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,740
Yeah, because...

188
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,600
It's going to think the sun will think it's 1900.

189
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,040
That's right.

190
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,040
And it'll say, all those passenger pigeons are blotting me out.

191
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,960
I'll have to go out.

192
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,720
Yeah.

193
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,520
Actually, they're going to solve this whole problem.

194
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,300
The next year after this will be year 1999.1.

195
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,920
I think it would be really cool if...

196
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,300
99A, I think they were going to run an adherence.

197
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,120
At the stroke of midnight, all of a sudden, everything,

198
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,900
everyone, everything is transported back to the year 1900.

199
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,620
Yeah.

200
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,420
Well, it's just this endless cycle.

201
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,960
I think they rightfully should be because we really never learned anything.

202
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,680
Until they fix the problem.

203
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,060
We can import, you know, thousands of slaves from China.

204
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,880
It'll be great.

205
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,360
Yeah.

206
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,100
We can build our own railroad and our own train.

207
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,460
Yeah.

208
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,840
And as fast as we want.

209
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,320
Yeah.

210
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:52,920
Yeah.

211
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,660
And we'll come up with a radio.

212
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,020
Or somebody come up with a radio.

213
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,000
No, we gotta have a telegraph first.

214
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,020
Yeah, just say all the radios will be gone.

215
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,340
Instant.

216
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,100
Instant radio.

217
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,200
We'll be back to horse and buggies.

218
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,500
And, uh...

219
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,800
We'll brush on blankets for smokes and telegraph.

220
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,640
Hey, don't file hey.

221
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,060
You need to feed those horses something.

222
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,320
And then we'll have to have a lot of sacrifices.

223
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,060
It didn't work out last time.

224
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,260
I think it's not enough bloodletting.

225
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,920
I think we need to take a few more.

226
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,840
How important were the computers to the telegraph system at the turn of the century?

227
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,000
Well, I know the Vikings needed them real bad.

228
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,420
Yeah.

229
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,500
They couldn't get anywhere without them computers and MOLOTs.

230
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,060
Like, it doesn't...

231
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,900
You know those wires they stretched all over the country?

232
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,140
You had a chip on it?

233
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,720
Yeah.

234
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,100
Yeah.

235
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,500
Yeah, sometimes they had those curly fries.

236
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,560
What if the Y2K problem is retroactive and the shock wave goes back in time?

237
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:44,900
Wow.

238
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,540
It's destroying all computers in the past as well.

239
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,600
So that means we'll have to go back even...

240
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,440
Wipes out all...

241
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,320
We'll all be in America that has never been discovered by Columbus.

242
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,140
And instantly...

243
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,160
Because we don't have a computer to make his math.

244
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,740
Yeah, it instantly wipes out all artificial intelligence in the universe.

245
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,760
All he does is work on canned computers andutes like a Pastel, and then he cuts out all the underground movimento to get software that gets players running a illustrate data daddy.

246
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,020
And that proves how important płp is.

247
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:18,620
But the only way we can teensys Mr. developer could be if we just left the game in the first place.

248
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:18,620


249
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:18,640
picture-في...

250
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,480
andougin...

251
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:32,080
If you gave up all your powers asanga hid the game, then Lord will have to kill you.

252
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,080


253
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,060
will be blasted amidst all of our ancestors, so all of them will have this vague memory

254
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,000
of a strange time when everyone had magical machines that did everything for them, but

255
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,680
it will all end in 1999. And then they'll all live forward and eventually produce us,

256
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,620
and in us, the memory will be concentrated, the terrible thing will happen in 1999, and

257
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,440
then it will happen again, and our conscience will be blasted back to 1900 again.

258
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,540
Again, it'll just be an endless loop.

259
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,720
Endless loop, yeah.

260
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,320
That's an ill prescription for mankind to constantly keep taking really short of themselves.

261
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:17,760
Now, maybe we can, this time around, maybe we can plant something that will clue us in as we're living our lives, you know, as kids and stuff like that.

262
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:26,360
We won't know it's coming, but maybe we can leave something behind that will send us a message to start working on...

263
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,620
We need an artifact that's completely computer untouched, so it won't be destroyed.

264
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,160
Right.

265
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:43,240
And we need to immediately impregnate the first person we see in that world, so that our seed, like a tiny little oak, can grow out of them and impregnate the rest of the seeds of mankind's depleted accordion.

266
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,200
Maybe we could just bring along business cards instead.

267
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,640
Or sub-accordion.

268
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,020
Yeah.

269
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,460
Yeah.

270
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,340
That's a different pitch place that you're going to go in there.

271
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,280
We want to get people to dance into the new century.

272
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,620
Right?

273
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,420
Or just kill themselves again, or what?

274
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,760
I think they should dance until they die.

275
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,480
All time ends, as far as I know, from listening to, like, a lot of radio.

276
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,220
Talk radio and stuff.

277
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,000
Whatever you are doing at the moment of the turnover, you will do for all eternity.

278
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,660
That's right.

279
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,960
You're frozen in that one moment.

280
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,020
So, obviously, you should be having sex.

281
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,140
Kind of like X-Day.

282
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:18,680
Yeah.

283
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,680
Kind of like at 7 a.m.

284
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,780
So, if you can just reach orgasm at midnight...

285
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,480
You'll be scrubbing it forever?

286
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,420
That's right.

287
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,340
Well, that's...

288
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,320
What about Pat Boone?

289
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,980
Is that guy going to be on a heavy metal stage saying the world's going to end in six minutes

290
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,960
for the rest of time?

291
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,780
He's going to be singing a heavy...

292
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,660
For all of eternity.

293
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,520
Pat Boone singing a heavy metal version of We Are the World.

294
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,480
Forever.

295
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,940
With Metallica, you know, special guest.

296
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:48,420
The real despotically bone-chilling Christian undertones there, just kind of like putting

297
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,400
you in the mausoleum in the Inquisition at the same time you're getting rocked out.

298
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,240
Yeah.

299
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,700
Maybe not.

300
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:53,980
Maybe not.

301
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,060
Maybe not.

302
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,540
Maybe not.

303
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,200
Maybe not.

304
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,800
Maybe not.

305
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,100
Maybe not.

306
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,300
Maybe not.

307
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,300


308
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,300


309
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,300


310
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,300


311
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,300


312
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,300


313
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,300


314
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,300


315
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,280
You'll be eternally reaching for that terrible itch and you'll never be able to scratch it.

316
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,560
You'll just be spinning around forever and ever reaching.

317
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,500
Reaching for that spot in your back you can't quite reach.

318
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,140
Yeah.

319
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,700
But you'll be eternally ungrateful.

320
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,440
Forever and ever.

321
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,800
If you got it.

322
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,400
Yeah.

323
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,520
Well, at each moment, I suppose there'd be a plethora of delights that would last or

324
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,320
kill you forever.

325
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,800
Maybe we should just start killing all the computers now.

326
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,860
We'll become...

327
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
We'll get used to it.

328
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,500
If you can't...

329
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,280
If you can't fix the problem in a year, I'm sure...

330
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,360
I'm sure we could kill every computer within a year.

331
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,580
How about we all become Buddhists?

332
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,560
Nah.

333
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,880
Nah, there'd be a few computers left over.

334
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
It's kind of like, you know, the...

335
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,120
Someone would hide there.

336
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,360
Yeah.

337
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,000
They'd have to underground shelter with the rank of batteries.

338
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,060
We gotta kill...

339
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,720
It'd be like the killer, you know, that movie Killer Bees, you know?

340
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,160
Don't you think...

341
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,420
That one bee left up on the seat at the top of the...

342
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,280
Bill Gates.

343
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,360
Superdome.

344
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,000
Superdome.

345
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:49,780
Superdome.

346
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,320
Superdome.

347
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,040
Superdome.

348
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,040


349
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,380
Superdome.

350
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:51,640
Superdome.

351
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,360
Superdome.

352
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,820
Vampires.

353
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:58,820


354
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,540
Vampires.

355
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:00,880
Rhino.

356
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:00,880


357
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:00,880


358
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,960
Heil.

359
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,200
Haier.

360
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,200


361
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,840
Hell.

362
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,440
As if.

363
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,260


364
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,740
What's going on.

365
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,000
I hope you find it nice.

366
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,060


367
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,120
I don't like dancing, but it's just pure fucking hell.

368
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,120


369
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,120


370
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,120


371
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,180


372
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,240
Uh...

373
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,860
Uh...

374
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,220
What do you even want?

375
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,140
Who's more spiritual?

376
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,280
Who's more spiritual?

377
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Who's more spiritual?

378
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,320
The man who put the thousand dollars in.

379
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:39,900
Slavery.

380
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,340
Slavery.

381
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,380
Slavery.

382
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,540
Slavery.

383
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,860
For you, that was a sacrifice.

384
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,480
Slavery.

385
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,780
Slavery.

386
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,960
Slavery.

387
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,100
Slavery.

388
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,680
It doesn't matter the amount, my friends.

389
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,400
Slavery.

390
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,660
Slavery.

391
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,640
Slavery.

392
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,860
Slavery.

393
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,040
Slavery.

394
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,400
What matters, as it says, you give generously and with a cheerful heart.

395
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,000
Slavery.

396
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,240
Slavery.

397
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,460
Slavery.

398
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,600
Slavery.

399
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,760
You are excited about the fact that God has given you something that you can give away.

400
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,280
Slavery.

401
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,460
Slavery.

402
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,900
To see the work of God.

403
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,460
Slavery.

404
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,680
Slavery.

405
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,280
Slavery.

406
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,340
It takes money for that to happen.

407
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:22,940
Slavery.

408
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,160
Slavery.

409
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,240


410
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,400
Slavery.

411
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,220
Slavery.

412
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,740
Put a little bit of money in the stock market.

413
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,100
Add a little bit of money in gold.

414
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,740
Add a little bit of money in real estate.

415
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,540
And be sure to buy those beanie babies and those sports cars,

416
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,700
because we know that's what the kingdom of God needs.

417
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,380
Slavery.

418
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,720
Slavery.

419
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,200
Slavery.

420
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,680
You know, if it weren't for the spirit of God, I'd buy a handgun.

421
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,200
Kill somebody.

422
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:42,560
Yeah.

423
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,380
Slavery.

424
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:44,760
Slavery.

425
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:44,940
Slavery.

426
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,680
As soon as everything's cool, then I'm on board.

427
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,800
Well, nothing's going to be cool until you're on board.

428
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,360
And then you're going to ruin it.

429
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,680
Well, yeah, then we got you, and you're dead weight.

430
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,220
We're going to drag you down the road.

431
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,220


432
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:02,760
you around. I've got a Bible question though for you. Oh, that'll be easy. I'm very smart.

433
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,380
I'm wondering if you could answer it. It was, um, you know, the miracle of Jesus trying to

434
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:12,200
wander. Well, there's this, uh, modern day scholar who was saying that, that you couldn't

435
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,600
actually turn it into wine at that point in time in the new Testament had to be, maybe it was a

436
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,860
California cooler or a microwave, but not wine. If you understand the Lord, our God and his power,

437
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,740
his power, he can turn it into anything he wants. It doesn't have to be just wine. It doesn't have

438
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,560
to be a week of wine. It could have been a moonshine. It could have been ice water. It could

439
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,820
have been a slurpee. It could have been a smoothie or a frappy. What is a frappy dog? What is a

440
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:48,600
frappy dog? What is a frappy dog? I think you need to study a little bit more. What a blessing it is

441
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,900
to, uh, to give.

442
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:57,440
There was something spiritual in there that even though we didn't have anything, we still had

443
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:04,960
something. When you are a slave to God, you are in bondage to it and it will control you and

444
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:13,720
manipulate you and rule you. But when you offer yourself as a slave to God,

445
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,340
slavery,

446
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,880
that if you want to be free,

447
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,440
you must become a slave.

448
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,120
slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money.

449
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,400
So you get an extra job to ease the pressure.

450
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,760
slavery, money, slavery, money,

451
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,460
This is the way God works, folks.

452
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,220
slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money.

453
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,380
One of the best things that could happen to a church is for people to show up on a Sunday

454
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,700
one door, one morning, and the doors to be locked.

455
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,080
slavery, money, slavery, money,

456
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,720
Well, God, make me a cheerful giver, will you please?

457
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,240
I can't do this.

458
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,580
slavery, money, slavery, money

459
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,240
Wow,

460
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,140
it doesn't cost anything because it just flows through you know i mean, I

461
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,060
I'm happier to be this way than other way.

462
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,580
The other way I was just miserable.

463
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,780
slavery, money

464
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,400
slavery,

465
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,360
New, slavery,

466
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,000
and I want you

467
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,500
Mister and Mrs Christian to grow

468
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,140
in your relationship with Christ,

469
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,880
and you will never go back and your new Christ, you have been in the past, you're in life, you know, specialty, but you hit me on the knee man, use and you immediately go back to you and you're, and you know, you put yourself versus me whenever people say we're breaking

470
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:19,880


471
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:32,940
beyond a certain point until your pocketbook is free. God, you are welcome to take control of my

472
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:40,180
checkbook, my account, my bank account, everything that I have. You are welcome to have it and to do

473
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:47,860
with it whatever you want to, God. Until you do that, you will be a slave

474
00:23:50,720 --> 00:24:01,180
to yourself and to your greed. And what I want, folks, is I want you to be free.

475
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,340
Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage.

476
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,020
Everything you have is God's. Right. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage.

477
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,540
There's a lot of guys that wouldn't really make it in a lot of other venues,

478
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,700
but they can get a small church, be nice to some people, and serve.

479
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,480
Squeak out a living.

480
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,600
Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage.

481
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,640
Folks, they're finally here.

482
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,360
Bible Stalge. A new cigar that contains a rich, smooth taste and a good Bible story.

483
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,440
Bible Stalge. Cuban tobacco leaf finally rolled in pure biblical text.

484
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,640
Bible Stalge. Just listen to the reports from postmodern cigar smokers.

485
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,840
As an agnostic cigar connoisseur, I was extremely skeptical of the Bible.

486
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:52,580
Bible Stalge. The next thing I knew, I'd smoked the entire Old Testament.

487
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,060
Even non-smokers are happy with Bible Stalges because...

488
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,660
You can get good dosages from other sources.

489
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,080
For instance, I practically smoked all of 2 Chronicles before discovering I had lung cancer.

490
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,940
I was bummed at first. Then I realized, hey, I can read the rest of the story in a regular Bible.

491
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:15,960
Bible Stalge. Orthodox biblical teaching and fantastic tobacco taste all rolled up in one practical cigar.

492
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,500
Bible Stalge.

493
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,700
It's a stogie that tells a story.

494
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,420
Bible Stalge is now available on NIV and ASB.

495
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:39,240
I heard about a lady that was out working very hard one day and she decided to sort of reward herself a little bit.

496
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,620
So she went down to the local mall and walked by one of those cookie stores, Mrs. Fields, you know.

497
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,820
And she bought herself a whole bag of cookies.

498
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,980
And one of those specialized coffee lattes, you know.

499
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,780
Half-calf, you know, all that.

500
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:04,620
And so she took her gourmet coffee, drinking her cookies, and she pulled her newspaper out of her purse and she sat down at a table to read it.

501
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,700
And as she was reading along, she'd reach in, grab a cookie and eat it and take a sip of her coffee.

502
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,060
And she was flipping the pages of her paper and she heard a rustle in her little cookie bag.

503
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,500
And she sort of pulled it down the top of the paper.

504
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,500
And there was a guy sitting.

505
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,160
She didn't know him.

506
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,700
And she thought she had seen his hand pull a cookie out of her bag.

507
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,380
But she thought, surely I'm seeing things.

508
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,900
No way would this guy swipe one of my cookies.

509
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,820
Well, then she took another cookie and she heard a rustle.

510
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,320
And this time she looked and sure enough, his hand was in the bag of the cookies.

511
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,060
He took a cookie out right in front of her, ate it.

512
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,860
Didn't seem to have any remorse or concern about it.

513
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,580
She grew very indignant.

514
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,740
She'd reach in, grab a cookie and eat it.

515
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,600
He'd reach in with a smile on his face.

516
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,020
He'd eat a cookie too.

517
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,260
This went on and on till the bag of cookies was almost gone and there was only one left.

518
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,600
And he reached in and grabbed it first before she could get it.

519
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,760
He broke it in half.

520
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,280
He smiled.

521
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
He gave her half of it.

522
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,460
She ate it.

523
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,420
She was so mad.

524
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,240
How dare that man steal my cookies?

525
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,940
I bought those for myself.

526
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:14,360
And she got up in a huff and grabbed her newspaper and was on her way out and was going to put her newspaper back in her purse.

527
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,300
And when she opened her purse up, lo and behold,

528
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,320
there was her bag of cookies.

529
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:36,360
What about the poor astrocephalic children, the people that have star material in their own brains and next thing you know they're trying to pooter pooter like I'm sick of coughs.

530
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,380
The problem nowadays, you've got the technology you can take advantage of.

531
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:46,280
But back in the day, we had to just sit and watch them, watch all that retardation just go way, way away.

532
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,900
It became the norm.

533
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:48,900


534
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:48,900


535
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:48,900


536
00:27:48,900 --> 00:28:02,360
All of you including Robert, you're chỉ about to get rid of 알�iumene Breeze on a cap.

537
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,520
And you are not blood as strong as I was, just like a farad.

538
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,140


539
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,140


540
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,400

546
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,280

549
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:33,520
half of the cactus you know and in about a few hours that bowl that you've cut out of there will

He got air down to his face.

He got to be a joker.

00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,160


611
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,160


612
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,400
The cup of the cup of evil.

613
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,400


614
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,560
Hega.

Fuck.

621
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:29,420


622
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:29,420


623
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,540
My allies.

624
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:30,860
Yeah.

625
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,740
Our program.

626
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,260
Where the hell to to advance?

627
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:32,260


628
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:32,260


629
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Yeah.

00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,920

631
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,580
right now

632
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,340
over me

633
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,100
right back

634
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,000
he rode the coaster

635
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,640
got early warning

636
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,960
he got my time

637
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,240
he bought

638
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,980
mojo vienna

639
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,340
he said

640
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,580
why

641
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,040
why

642
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,140
why

643
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,260
he slayed

644
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,800
got two big gold looking

645
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,320
cozy so hard to see

646
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,400
got together

647
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,620
got early warning

648
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:30,800
he started my day

649
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:30,800


650
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,420
right now

651
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,820
over me

652
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,980
got to get up

653
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,220
right now

654
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,720
over me

655
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,400
right now

656
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,220
You've been staring at a blank screen and your mind has been humming and screaming.

657
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:39,160
Well, they come in and out of the window, but only when I'm sleeping and only when I don't look.

658
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,420
Jupiter's child is shaped like a burning thing.

659
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,760
Jupiter, no, no, get off my head.

660
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,200
Can you explain to the listeners what's going on now, Friday, please?

661
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,440
Well, the wind...

662
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,720
We're just waiting. We're waiting to stop waiting.

663
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,500
Buildings, buildings, buildings.

664
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:09,080
But instead of going back to Chicago, this woman, Connie, decided to go to Maui instead.

665
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,200
She just wanted to have an adventure.

666
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,860
Strangers offered her a place to stay.

667
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,420
She moved in with them and she was quoted in this article as saying,

668
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,640
You know what the word free spirit means?

669
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,260
Well, that's what I am now.

670
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,740
Now, what she was saying, Bleepo, is just correct.

671
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:34,740
She just had a misdirection at the vanishing house where the twelve apostles were...

672
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,100
She was cruising with the twelve apostles at the house of wax.

673
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,060
So then you don't want to turn the heat on too hard, then.

674
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,340
Because it'll start to melt.

675
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,980
Bob, Bob, Bob.

676
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,540
I'll buy you a start on your rocket jet.

677
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:52,580
Rocket jet, rocket jet, rocket jet, rocket jet, rocket jet, rocket jet, rocket jet, rocket jet.

678
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,880
How can you say something like that, you know?

679
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,140
Especially with your hands on it.

680
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,720
Hey, what is that giant domino floating in the air?

681
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,140
Over the studio.

682
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,400
It's Ludwig and Wolfie.

683
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,380
Look at it now.

684
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,240
It makes me...

685
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,780
It's giving me ideas.

686
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,380
It's getting into my brain.

687
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,480
It makes me want to throw bones in the air and invent faster than light travel.

688
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,420
And go out with girls I never met before.

689
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,220
That's all, lady?

690
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,240
We don't have to shave anymore.

691
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,720
She has a machine that does it.

692
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,140
This marked the first manned attempt to reach this distant planet.

693
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:29,920
Pro蓮m JR.: Just do some stuff.

694
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:29,920


695
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:29,920


696
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:29,920


697
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:29,920


698
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:29,920


699
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:29,980
Your nee поро kid did her best to require giving.

700
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,260
I enjoy working with people.

701
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,540
Well you know what?

702
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,380
Connie has a plan different for you than you had for yourself.

703
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,040
Rocket Jet.

704
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,980
I like rocket jets.

705
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,120
Rocket jet.

706
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,520
If you want to be a happy-

707
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,680
Happy bag of cookies,

708
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,260
I like rocket jets.

709
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:44,860
I like rocket jets.

710
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,480
I like rocket jets.

711
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,720
I like rocket jets.

712
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,940
Rocket jets.

713
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,540
What is your secret?

714
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,720
What is your secret?

715
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,760
What is your secret?

716
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,180
He was just another young soldier from your town.

717
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,120
And as he lay dying three hours out of a post-op situation,

718
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,280
they administered the vast dumps of cyanide directly into his brain.

719
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,680
He stared skyward underneath the mesh.

720
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,440
He could see the stars burning bright.

721
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,700
In his mind, the world was forming.

722
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,220
An island in his own mind.

723
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:39,560
And if I will call you

724
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,320
any night

725
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,260
again,

726
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,500
any day,

727
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,940
in your mind,

728
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,860
he'll hear it for you.

729
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,560
Come away,

730
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,220
come away.

731
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,700
I'm going to check,

732
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,600
stay with me.

733
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Got the wounds in my head,

734
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,460
the wounds in my heart.

735
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,800
And they're scarcely breathing.

736
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,640
But he can see the swarming, the whispering,

737
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,660
pulling him upward with his finger,

738
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,020
his spirited guide to leave his body.

739
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,760
Far across that land,

740
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,440
over the coral of the news,

741
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,380
across the sea,

742
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,380
and the red and the blood.

743
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,340
And in the background,

744
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,180
the island of the moon.

745
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,440
And in the background, the island of the moon.

746
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,640
And in the background, the island of the moon.

747
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,140
And if I will call you,

748
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,540
come away, come away.

749
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,620
In your mind,

750
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,080
you'll hear it for you.

751
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,540
Come away, come away.

752
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,180
Come away, come away.

753
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,200
Come away, come away.

754
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,060
Come away, come away.

755
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,260
Come away, come away.

756
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:44,240
If I remain your friend,

757
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:44,240

784
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,880
20 minutes in the oven at 350.

785
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,740
And he's here.

786
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,760
That's your mom right there.

787
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,660
That's everybody's mom.

788
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,180
No, that's you, Dave.

789
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,420
So you're saying you're not the product of some experiment a long time ago?

790
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,040
No, we're the product of you, Dave.

791
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,840
We're the product of your imagination.

792
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,140
Oh, yeah, look, I dreamed of the anyone and all that stuff.

793
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,220
And all that propaganda been sucking up for 12 years.

794
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,460
Oh, yeah, they dreamed that whole Earth planet thing.

795
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,840
Oh, yeah.

796
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,860
They're happy.

797
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,540
You have never actually set foot on Earth.

798
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,360
Let me go to space.

799
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,880
Let me go to space.

800
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,500
Let me go to space.

801
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,960
Let me go to space.

802
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,180
Let me go to space.

803
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,780
Let me go to space.

804
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:29,960
Let me go to space.

805
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,080
Let me go to space.

806
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,380
These guys are a little more perceptive in this second run here.

807
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,760
You have to let go of all the stuff around you

808
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,000
before you can see.

809
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:38,560
Clearly.

810
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,840
Let me go to space.

811
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,360
Let me go to space.

812
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,720
And it's all in your mind.

813
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,040
Yeah.

814
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,860
Within you and without you.

815
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:45,740
Soul of Chisholm.

816
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,700
Yeah, I'll buy that doctor on any day.

817
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,180
Yeah.

818
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,160
It's 100 monkeys, 100 cowboy Dave.

819
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,520
Let me go to space.

820
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,240
Let me go to space.

821
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,820
Let me go to space.

822
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,080
Let me go to space.

823
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,500
Oh, man, that's not the life for me.

824
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,500
I don't want to be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen.

825
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,820
But that is not necessarily, not necessarily,

826
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,940
not necessarily,

827
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,060
not necessarily,

828
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,640
not necessarily God's plan for you.

829
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,680
Who knows what he has in store?

830
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,200
Let me go to space.

831
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,720
Let me go to space.

832
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,440
Let me go to space.

833
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,700
Let me go to space.

834
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,820
We'd love to lead you through little fantasies of memories and things.

835
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,080
But Dave, you know, face it.

836
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,000
Still a long way to Alpha Centauri.

837
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,160
It's a long way to Alpha Centauri.

838
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,120
There you go.

839
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,220
That might help.

840
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,480
That might help pass the time.

841
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,960
That's why I dreamed up cash.

842
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,300
To be my thought meister.

843
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,180
We gave, well, we gave, see, we took care of your needs.

844
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,040
I dreamed up for you to confuse me even more than I need to be in my life.

845
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,640
Every time you take a hit of the bong,

846
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:52,000
you have to open up the little, the little tiny little one inch big hatch to blow the hit out into space.

847
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,480
And when you do, it increases your velocity a little bit more.

848
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,440
I just thought I was going to have to blow wind through my head out of the turtle.

849
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,320
The more you smoke that thing, the faster you get there.

850
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,440
Let me go to space.

851
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,900
Let me go to space.

852
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,080
Let me go to space.

853
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,640
Let me go to space.

854
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,860
You've got to keep sucking to keep going.

855
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,180
Yeah.

856
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,300
It's just like life.

857
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:13,940
Yeah.

858
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,440
But, you know, like in music, if you play too many notes, like they say, the more you suck,

859
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,600
I mean, the more you blow, the more you suck.

860
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,240
Tell me not to, tell me not to, tell me not to, tell me not to.

861
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,260
I'm listening to you hard now.

862
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,480
Let me go to space.

863
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,980
Let me go to space.

864
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:34,680
The devil appeared, and he said to me, man, that outfit looks good on you.

865
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:40,260
A new planet will pass so close to the earth, it will cause vast destruction.

866
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,800
Let me go to space.

867
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,300
Let me go to space.

868
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,780
You open up the suitcase thinking, oh, boy, maybe it's full of money because it seems

869
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,300
sort of squishy and heavy.

870
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,780
And you open it up, and it's just full of, like, you know, salamanders and newts and things.

871
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,020
And do you know people that there are people out there who are growing alien life forms

872
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,480
in their heads?

873
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,360
Yeah, you should.

874
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,160
In their brain cavities and stuff like that?

875
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:02,440
Yeah.

876
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,540
You mean because of the implant?

877
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:03,920
No.

878
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,760
No, they're doing it for money.

879
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,400
And then you try and get rid of it, and then somebody comes by, and they offer your contract

880
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,040
by email, which you email back.

881
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,440
Oh, yeah, the thing where you sign it, and they say they put coins inside your head,

882
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,820
and then after a certain number of months, they double the number of coins in your head.

883
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,180
Yeah.

884
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:25,580
After that nine-month gestation period, your head just instantly turns into a little spaceship

885
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,060
and leaves your body behind.

886
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,740
Let me go to space.

887
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,440
Let me go to space.

888
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,000
Let me go to space.

889
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,340
Let me go to space.

890
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,500
We love you, man.

891
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,680
We're interested in everything you do.

892
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,020
You don't really exist.

893
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,440
You're figuring my imagination.

894
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,020
You're non-Pixation's radio character.

895
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,980
I just, you can't say stuff like that.

896
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,660
I wish.

897
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,280
What happens to all of us when Dave starts dreaming?

898
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,980
Well, that's the fun part.

899
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,020
What are you talking about?

900
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:51,740
We're waiting for that.

901
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,420
What do you mean, when?

902
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,880
Dave, when are you going to bed?

903
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,640
When's he going to wake up?

904
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,700
Dave, when are you going to stop dreaming?

905
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,780
This has been a long dream.

906
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,280
I hope it never happens.

907
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,620
Or was.

908
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:11,500
I mean, I might be down near the Dallas River, smoking an enchilada,

909
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:16,440
dreaming about the Shagawin Empire and the bloody empire of all the

910
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,160
Playing the Masonic funeral music over and over again.

911
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:24,240
Dreaming about Wolfgang and Ludwig having fights and snowball fights with each other

912
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,420
up in the car, and this music in heaven.

913
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,200
And we put the tin can to the hole with the rest of the corpses and poor lion.

914
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,560
But even then, Hal won't open the goddamn pod bay door.

915
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,160
25 or 624.

916
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,580
Hal opened the pod bay door.

917
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,880
I'm sorry, Dave.

918
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,320
I'm afraid I can't do that.

919
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,780
Let me go to space.

920
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,200
Let me go to space.

921
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,920
I'm a little overwhelmed with dealing with life here.

922
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,440
I own my own mobile home, separated.

923
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,340
There's a lot of responsibilities I have a hard time dealing with, and I'm trying to get over it.

924
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:00,480
But.

925
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,620
I probably better stop there.

926
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:08,880
And now I have to support myself.

927
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,880
I think I'm a little resentful.

928
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,180
Everybody in the world, you have to inhale to exhale.

929
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,060
I mean, I understand these principles.

930
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,060
I know this isn't real, you know, this is just the way it is.

931
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,660
I'm finding out that I really don't want to be responsible, I think.

932
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,060
Oh, I think it'll pass.

933
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,020
I'm sure that I'll come out on top eventually.

934
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,780
Let me go to space.

935
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,460
Let me go to space.

936
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,240
Let me go to space.

937
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,120
Hang in there.

938
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,800
30 seconds.

939
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,200
Coming down at two.

940
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,500
He's got it made.

941
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,580
Come on in there.

942
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,900
24 feet.

943
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,220
Contact light.

944
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,220
Roger.

945
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,000
Copy contact.

946
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:42,620
Probe.

947
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,440
Yes, probe.

948
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,240
OK.

949
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,440
Interceptor off.

950
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,180
OK.

951
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,720
I'll cycle these valves.

952
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,700
You got your command over right off.

953
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,140
Yep.

954
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:51,880
Buildings.

955
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,080
Buildings.

956
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,340
Buildings.

957
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,580
Buildings.

958
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:55,700


959
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,040
Buildings.

960
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,040


961
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:56,600
Buildings.

962
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,100
Buildings.

963
00:50:59,180 --> 00:50:59,660
Buildings.

964
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,400
Buildings.

965
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,260
There's no love.

966
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:02,940
No hate.

967
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,440
No hate.

968
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:06,720


969
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:06,720


970
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:06,720


971
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:13,920
But if you can get it another 20 miles up, man, then you're there.

972
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,600
You're where it's at.

973
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:15,560
That is.

974
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,880
You're free, man.

975
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,560
You're float.

976
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,800
40 miles, yeah.

977
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,820
You've escaped the pool, the gravity pool.

978
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,300
You're out there.

979
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,560
You're just licking the surface of the blood plant.

980
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,460
About 160,000 miles.

981
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,400
miles out, you lose the Earth's gravity altogether.

982
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:38,460
Is that where it is, 160? Yeah, and then the moon starts tugging you towards it.

983
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:42,380
So you start accelerating after you pass that point. Well, you know, if you can find that

984
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,100
perfect spot right in between the Earth and the moon, that L5.

985
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,460
That's it. That's called the L5 spot. You build your space colony

986
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,840
there, man, you are in free floating.

987
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,440
Yeah, it sounds good on paper, but remember, Doppler's Helm of Grange was

988
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,160
supposed to be there, and now it's wandering somewhere in the solar system.

989
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:06,260
Well, actually, Pete, it's out there

990
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,540
in the asteroid belt, and we know where it is.

991
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,520
It's not completely ruined yet. It's kind of bouncing off asteroids

992
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,420
here and there. I think it may need

993
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,520
a little work there. Roger. All dressed up and no place

994
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,680
to go. Don't work on it someplace. We can see it

995
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,260
getting bigger and bigger all the time.

996
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,980
Let me go to space. Let me go to space. Let me go to space.

997
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,320
Let me go to space.

998
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,300
There it is. Oh, my God. Right down the middle of the road.

999
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,300
Outstanding. 42 degrees, Pete.

1000
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:46,580
I can't believe it. Amazing. Fantastic.

1001
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,780
42 degrees, Pete.

1002
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:53,780
Coming down in about 99 feet a second. You're looking good.

1003
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,220
Okay. I'm going for landing.

1004
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,640
Let me go to space.

1005
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:04,780
Only one law. Rise above it all or drown in your own shit.

1006
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,920
Build your own rocket ship.

1007
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,760
Build your own rocket ship.

1008
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:27,240
Build your own rocket ship.

1009
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,580
Build your own rocket ship.

1010
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,180
Man, that one got a little out of control.

1011
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,560
But that's the way it goes in the rocket business.

1012
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,880
I had to push the self-destruct button. Sorry about that, kiddies.

1013
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,800
Build your own rocket ship.

1014
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,820
The mission and roll program in this baby has really gone.

1015
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,840
Fuel cell lights and AC bus light.

1016
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,840
Fuel cell disconnect.

1017
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,280
AC bus overload.

1018
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,180
One and two.

1019
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,500
Main bus A and C out.

1020
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,660
I don't know what happened here.

1021
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,460
We had everything in the world drop out.

1022
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,680
I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.

1023
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,260
I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.

1024
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:20,260


1025
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:20,260


1026
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:20,280
I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.

1027
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:20,340
I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.

1028
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:20,340


1029
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:20,340


1030
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:20,820
I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.

1031
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,400
I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.

1032
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:25,720
I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.

1033
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,760
Oh, my God.

1034
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:14,440
Oh, my God.

1035
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:54,020
Oh, my God.

1036
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:16,320
Oh, my God.

1037
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:54,880
Oh, my God.

1038
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,060
Oh, my God.

1039
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:17,940
Oh, my God.

1040
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,200
Oh, my God.

1041
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,920
Oh, my God.

1042
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:38,840
Oh, my God.

1043
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,260
Oh, my God.

1044
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:38,560
Oh, my God.

1045
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,900
Oh, my God.

1046
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:39,040
Oh, my God.

1047
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:08,020
Oh, my God.

1048
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:12,660
Oh, my God.

1049
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,100
Oh, my God.

1050
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,680
Oh, my God.
