1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
What is with the completeness of love?

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:16,160
I know that you love me a lot, and you don't have any distrust, and you don't love me at all.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,880
Even if it wasn't the first time, I'll be your friend.

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,200
Two hundred hours of slack.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,860
Life on.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,320
The air.

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,700
Yes, friends, we're back.

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:43,400
The show that, the only radio show in the Southwest that probably plays more pieces of music by perpetrators of the Tate murders,

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,960
the Tate-LaBianca murders, than any other show.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,320
Ah, yes, dear friends.

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,700
As my, as old Will here says.

12
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,020
I love you.

13
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,420
It's yineour turn.

14
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:15,460
Too late now.

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,060
Get lost with our emphasized city.

16
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,140
Original lead, Tipo.

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,140


18
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,260
So when I thought of the Tate and when I thought of the North...

19
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:24,260


20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,300


21
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:24,580
Look at yes such a surprise.

22
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:24,980
It's former.

23
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:24,980


24
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:24,980


25
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:24,980


26
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:24,980


27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,940
One detail.

28
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:37,120
And they said, yea, though it causeth my ears anguish and my brain to hurt between my ears, nevertheless it is good.

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,900
Do me a favor. Me. Kill me. Smart head. Kill me first. Do me a favor. Because you're driving me crazy.

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:51,380
This is Bob speaking. When you say that, you make yourself sure sound dumb. Loosen some of your halos, sister. Praise the Lord.

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,800
Now let's talk about ice sheet.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,680
Yeah, ice sheet. Let's, no, let's not talk about ice sheet, dear friends.

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,260
Them crazy, crazy, crazy rooskies.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,240
They attend church in a pretty white dress. Squeezes the hem, no tie to impress.

35
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:40,000
Sings like an angel, sweats like a thief. Bit me last night like it on the knee.

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,500
Hey, hey, we're so wild. All your farmer's daughters gonna reap from your soul.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,780
Hey, hey, we're so wild. Dancing with the milky moon.

38
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:02,300
Baby, take communion with the rest of the clan. They bought a pack-moon tour to the Holy Land.

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,040
At the shrine of the Virgin, she was dressed to kill. With her mad dog twin and her birth control pills.

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:17,540
Hey, hey, we're so wild. All your farmer's daughters gonna reap from your soul.

41
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,900
Hey, hey, we're so wild. Dancing with the milky moon.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,360
Hey, hey.

43
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:47,580
Oh, on your haze, haze, haze and maze. On your haze, haze, haze and maze.

44
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,160
Flopping haze, haze, haze and maze.

45
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,520
Talking pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty.

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,740
Well, we cry sometimes for no reason at all

47
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,480
Makes the man so nervous in the good things he's called

48
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,040
Most little angels all sit there

49
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,800
A child of God with a bigger spirit

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,100
Oh, hey, hey, we're so wild

51
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,360
All your farmers' daughters gonna eat what you sow

52
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,620
Hey, hey, we're so wild

53
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,780
Dance and eat the milky milk

54
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,240
Oh, come on

55
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,020
Hey, hey, we're so wild

56
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,160
Bow to your partner in a cozy door

57
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,640
Hey, hey, we're so wild

58
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,740
Dance and eat the milky milk

59
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,160
All right now

60
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,080
Hey, hey, we're so wild

61
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:52,440
Hey, hey, we're so wild

62
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,020
Hey, hey, we're so wild

63
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:07,540
Hey, hey, we're so wild

64
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:15,060
Hey, hey, we're so wild

65
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,340
Oh, yes

66
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,020
Oh, yes

67
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,420
Oh, yes

68
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,220
Oh, yes

69
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:52,160
Oh, yes

70
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,420
Oh, yes

71
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:49,680
Oh, yes

72
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:22,260
Oh, yes

73
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:33,740
Oh, yes

74
00:08:52,260 --> 00:09:05,020
Oh, yes

75
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:52,600
Oh, yes

76
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,060
Oh, yes

77
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,320
Oh,彥

78
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,960
Oh, yes

79
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:03,660
Oh, نال

80
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,760
Oh, we, we're so wild

81
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,520
Oh, yes

82
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:14,920
Oh, I see

83
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, язы fires

84
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,780
The church tends to attract loners and eccentrics, a few total idiots and mad crazies, but really

85
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:38,260
the last thing a lonely loner needs is another eccentric loner.

86
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,380
So a Bob and the church do not provide that most crucial element of your life because

87
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:50,040
you can't copulate with the church, but it nevertheless provides at least a good jumping

88
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,600
off point for the second most necessary thing, which is fake meaning for life.

89
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,580
It reassures you that your version of meaning is as valid as the next guy's and that it's

90
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,340
perfectly okay if it's yours alone.

91
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,900
It reassures you that you aren't the only one who suspects your grandma's crazy when

92
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,680
she says all unbaptized babies will fry in hell for eternity just because they didn't

93
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,720
have written contracts with God Jr.

94
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,540
It's a reassurance that just reminds you all the time that that's all it is.

95
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,020
A reassurance.

96
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,020


97
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,460
A real bottom level assurance and beliefs that you started with are still yours.

98
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,260
You can keep them.

99
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,820
We merely provide expert help in the window dressing of these things.

100
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,260
For a price, of course.

101
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,640
But you know this church is cheaper than most of your store bought religions.

102
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,980
You get more for your dollar.

103
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,320
It's less habit forming and it's really easy to kick Dobbs, believe it or not.

104
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,900
Honest.

105
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,540
You don't believe me?

106
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,820
Because see, Bob doesn't want to be the monkey on your back.

107
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,500
Dear friends, he's got better things to do.

108
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,440
Unlike certain versions of Jesus.

109
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,060
Sure you want supernatural help.

110
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,080
Everybody wants something for nothing and it's pretty tempting to believe you're getting

111
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,220
it.

112
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,180
But our experiment has proved, I think, that you can get it without even believing in it.

113
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,260
It's all faith healing and placebos and Jesus is a placebo and so is Bob.

114
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,440
And that doesn't demean either one of them.

115
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,420
Although it does elevate the useless sugar pill to deity status.

116
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,640
And it's too bad.

117
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,800
That's the way it is.

118
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,480
And it doesn't leave you in a lonely abyss of disbelief.

119
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,580
In fact, it puts you in some damn good company.

120
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,860
You become a peer of Jesus, Bob and the placebo pill too.

121
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,780
You're as good or as bad as you think you are.

122
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,740
And I hope you think you're so good you're bad.

123
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,620
And so you therefore act accordingly and not mess up everybody else's day.

124
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,480
Thank y'all.

125
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,320
So that's it.

126
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,480
We just explained it all.

127
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,200
Now we don't have to do anything else for the rest of the hour.

128
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,400
You do though.

129
00:12:50,440 --> 00:13:00,880
You can call for information in Dallas, Texas from 9 to 10 o'clock p.m. Central Standard Time at 823-7490.

130
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,520
That's right.

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,360
823-7490.

132
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,780
Speak to Will O'Dobbs, one of Bob's chosen fishers of wallets.

133
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,380
And, uh, yeah.

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,640

Well if Bob gets wrong and I get wrong, that must be all right.

180
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,160
Well if Bob gets wrong and I get wrong, that must be all right.

181
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,240
That must be all right.

182
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,300
You know, things were different in my day.

183
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,220
I mean, these kids these days, they walk around like they were zombies.

184
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,260
I mean, that's what really makes me mad.

185
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,740
Back when I was a zombie, things were a little bit different.

186
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,200
You know, when we rose from the dead, it was at 6 a.m., not noon.

187
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,680
We ate the flesh of a young woman's corpse.

188
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,560
We did it with respect.

189
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,040
Respect for the woman and respect for the corpse.

190
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,360
And kids these days are walking around with just computerized this, that, video games.

191
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,520
I remember back in my day, just to iron clothes.

192
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:04,820
We just had to heat our hands up over a stove and then just rub your hot hand over the clothes.

193
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,240
I mean...

194
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,160
Well it's all these body eatings that made people spoiled.

195
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:17,720
Yeah, I remember back in my day, to just even walk to school in the morning, I had to walk across the surface of the sun while I was eating.

196
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,840
And I was just, you know, swallowing fish hooks.

197
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,200
So that'll...

198
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,420
That was on a cold day, too.

199
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,900
Yeah, in a snowstorm.

200
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,280
You know, the trick of picking chicken is picking what chicken to pick.

201
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,260
Like this fowl I plucked the other day.

202
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,120
Look how plump and funny.

203
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,640
I'll have to put it out of its misery, but it looks so funny in its little bag.

204
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,480
You can trick and kick that chicken, but you've got the right chicken to pick.

205
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,420
Yeah.

206
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,740
Well, we'll let you go back to sleep.

207
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,940
This has been educational.

208
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,120
And we'll send you a copy.

209
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,260
A simul-fax copy of yours.

210
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,120
Write for another copy of our experiment.

211
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,780
Which you're hearing right now, right?

212
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,340
You get to hear how intelligent and intelligent I am at 7 o'clock in the morning.

213
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,180
You're hearing for the very first time the copy of yourself right now.

214
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,620
You're not going to stand up and hear my tape played.

215
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,920
You're going to hear your tape played.

216
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,280
And it won't be in a secretary around until you raise a part of it.

217
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,100
You might need to just take off and run!

218
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,680
Bob's running with the devil.

219
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,160
So you're going to run way to the other.

220
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,700
One way or the other.

221
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,320
What else do you do?

222
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,720
Come on, kids.

223
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,220
Honey?

224
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:16,740
Well?

225
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,580
Here we are.

226
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,220
The park.

227
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,100
Come on, everybody.

228
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,240
Welcome to Synthetic National Park 116B.

229
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm Jack, your animatronic ranger and guide.

230
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,260
Please step on conveyor and press A for nature excursion.

231
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,560
Okay.

232
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,520
Kindly direct your attention to the astroturf and fabric forest.

233
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,620
You will notice the mechanized bears are not threatened by us and will not respond in a

234
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,000
hostile manner, unlike real bears of the past.

235
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,420
Growl.

236
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,280
Growl.

237
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,620
And over on the right are 3D computer generated water birds.

238
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,100
Hey, that's not real water.

239
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,200
It's not real water in those rapids, is it?

240
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,080
Of course not.

241
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,780
It's basically recycled liquid wastes and salvaged oil spills from tanker accidents dyed

242
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,060
blue and white and mechanically propelled by small nuclear rotors for a historically

243
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,780
correct effect.

244
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,780
We're proud to say it's almost aesthetically perfect as well.

245
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,920
What about the clouds and the blue sky?

246
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,200
Computer generated.

247
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,780
What about the warm temperatures?

248
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,920
Greenhouse effect.

249
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,980
Not bad for New York in February, huh?

250
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,620
Yes, thanks to the efforts of one time President George Bush over 100 years ago, real parks

251
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,700
were cleared away and controlled, easy to maintain environments like this one were created.

252
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,780
Which park was this?

253
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,360
It was called Central Park, I believe, but I'm only a ranger, not a historian.

254
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,020
Please, follow me, folks.

255
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,760
There's much more of the park to see.

256
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,000
Having trouble getting the children to eat their food, Mom?

257
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,560
Kids complaining that they don't like the taste of fish?

258
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,460
Try Mrs. Filabert's deflavored fish.

259
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,420
The fish that doesn't taste like anything.

260
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,260
That caviar was great, Mom.

261
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,580
Pass the anchovies.

262
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,640
Thanks for dinner, dear.

263
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,680
It was tasteless.

264
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,820
They didn't taste a thing.

265
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,800
And you will too when you serve Mrs. Filabert's deflavored fish.

266
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,880
The fish that needs no flavoring.

267
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,080
Marge, that tasted like nothing I've ever had.

268
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,080
Never taste that fishy taste of fish again with Mrs. Filabert's deflavored food.

269
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,440
Waiter, I'd like to try some of that delicious fish.

270
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,600
But you just ate your fish, ma'am.

271
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

272
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,440


273
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,440


274
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,440


275
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,440


276
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,440


277
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,440


278
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,440


279
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,440


280
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,440


281
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,440


282
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,440


283
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,480
What a catch.

284
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,460
Whole fish without the flavor.

285
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,220
Try the same fish the fast food restaurants use.

286
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,240
Mrs. Filabert's freeze-dried deflavored fish.

287
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,820
In sticks, cakes, slabs, or baked.

288
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,380
Mrs. Filabert's.

289
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,020
That man of yours will say...

290
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,200
What was that, honey?

291
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,720
Yeah, that's a good question, dear friends.

292
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,340
Thanks to Reverend Bleepo Abernathy up in Manhattan.

293
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,160
Oh.

294
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,200
At K-Rock's, the biggest station in New York.

295
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,060
He gets better equipment than I do.

296
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,340
It makes him think up funny jokes.

297
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,420
But those ads were all real.

298
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,600
And those were just things he happened to catch off the air.

299
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,120
They just happened to have his voice.

300
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,860
Thank you.

301
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,860
Oh, and now, the man you've all been waiting for, I'm sure, after his many appearances

302
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,420
here on the show.

303
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,240
Papa.

304
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,540
Mama.

305
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,140
Thank you.

306
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,020
Mama.

307
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,020


308
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,020


309
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,340
Hello, friends, and welcome.

310
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,460
Tonight's sermon is entitled Free Thought.

311
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,980
You get what you pay for.

312
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,820
Now, the Church of the Subgenius has always encouraged free thought, friends.

313
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,240
Don't get me wrong.

314
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,580
We've always been behind free thought.

315
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,260
You know that.

316
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,800
I know that.

317
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,720
Everyone knows that.

318
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,140
It's only when you want to know free thought, that you can do it.

319
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,140


320
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,140


321
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,140


322
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,080
what you think, that we charge a donation.

323
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,220
And that's also why the church says,

324
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,520
anything worth knowing is worth paying for.

325
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,520
Now you have all these so-called normals,

326
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,380
these average Joe Blows,

327
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,300
the mediocre majority,

328
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,640
the folks who have to go to school to learn how to learn.

329
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,740
Oh yes, they think they know how to think.

330
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,960
Because why?

331
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,560
Because they got a piece of paper.

332
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,620
A piece of paper, friends, that says they know how to think.

333
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,080
A diploma, friends.

334
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,560
Created, maintained, signed, sealed, and delivered by who?

335
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,980
The conspiracy.

336
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh sure, they pay good money for that piece of paper too.

337
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,520
Let me tell you.

338
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,220
Oh boy.

339
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,020
You pay a whole lot of money for it.

340
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,420
More than we would ever dream of stealing from you.

341
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,480
Investing for you.

342
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,120
But does a conspiracy teach you?

343
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,120
What you think, friends?

344
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,480
Hell no.

345
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,600
The conspiracy teaches you what they think.

346
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,640
Why they're so scared that someone out there might in fact trip upon the truth

347
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,600
and think a real independent thought for themselves.

348
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,960
A thought funk without the guidance of the conspiracy.

349
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,860
A non-conspiracy concept that they force you and everyone else

350
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,540
to go to their conspiracy training schools

351
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,120
and go to the conspiracy training schools.

352
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,100
A thought that they're not going to be able to do.

353
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,340
For the most formative and most imaginative of their years.

354
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,780
And they won't let you out, friends.

355
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,520
Not until you conform to their normality.

356
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,120
Or one of their carefully selected alternative normalities.

357
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,880
Oh yes, you know what I'm talking about.

358
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,760
I'm talking about those hippies, those punks, those skinheads

359
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,720
who wouldn't be called dead thinking anything.

360
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,060
But the hippest, punkest, skinniest thots.

361
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,660
Oh sure, friends.

362
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,000
They think they're thinking.

363
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,000
They think they're rebelling.

364
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,180
But they've only joined another branch of the conspiracy corps.

365
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,700
Oh, they're out of the army, all right.

366
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,140
And they're into one of the other arms of the conspiracy octopus.

367
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:08,060
Oh, but I disobey all the laws and everything that they tell me to do.

368
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,800
Friends, that's just reverse psychology they're using on you.

369
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,120
The conspiracy is a master of rebellion.

370
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,820
It's a reverse psychology.

371
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,160
They want you to disobey them.

372
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,180
Just say no means just say yes.

373
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,960
Why do you think they call it dope?

374
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,780
They want you to pacify your brain with drugs.

375
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,800
They want you to transmit AIDS via every natural orifice.

376
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,020
And every unnatural one too, friends.

377
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,780
It gives them something to waste your time with to avoid getting slack.

378
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,300
While simultaneously providing junk food for thought to fuel their media hype.

379
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,160
Something for them to market.

380
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,700
And then take from the market.

381
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,920
And then black market.

382
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,780
And then ban.

383
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,800
And then regulate.

384
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,700
And all the while, you think it's just savage dance.

385
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:52,640
Ha!

386
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,720
Supply and demand.

387
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,100
Who are you fooling?

388
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,580
They do the supply and they do the demand in tune.

389
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,780
And you think you're so clever because you cheated on last year's income tax.

390
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,440
Oh, friends.

391
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,080
So much for your free thought.

392
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,680
It was worth precisely what you thought.

393
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:14,680


394
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,560
You paid nothing.

395
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,840
Nothing at all.

396
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,360
And I bet you still don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

397
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Oh, no.

398
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,520
I pity you.

399
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,360
Wherever you may be.

400
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,540
Oh, how I pity you.

401
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,860
And Bob pities you even more, friends.

402
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:38,320
But let us not here at the Church of the Subgenius get too smug, too self-righteous, too high

403
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,780
and mighty.

404
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,880
Because, friends, we all know there's plenty of what?

405
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,680
Pseudo-subgenius.

406
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


407
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


408
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


409
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


410
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


411
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


412
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


413
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


414
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


415
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


416
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


417
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


418
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,680


419
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,060
There's plenty of subgenius out there who just pretend to think for themselves.

420
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,280
Why do they come to the church, friends?

421
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,280
Because they think it's cool.

422
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,820
They can't understand what we're talking about, friends.

423
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,420
It sounds like a big joke to them.

424
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,180
A riddle.

425
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,400
Something to laugh about.

426
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,980
Well, ha, ha, ha.

427
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,240
That's just fine and dandy.

428
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,580
We'll take your money, friends.

429
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,460
But we ain't touching your soul.

430
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,980
Hell, no.

431
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,900
And then again, it's not like you give a lot of money anyway.

432
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,120
You're afraid to know what you think.

433
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,800
You're scared.

434
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,820
You're frightened.

435
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,940
There may not be anything.

436
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,540
Well, friends, there's only one way to find out.

437
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,180
And that's to put your money where your mind is.

438
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,380
And if you don't get a quick, prompt response in six to eight weeks, well, friends, you

439
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,520
can just assume the worst.

440
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,420
Tell them that address and praise Bob.

441
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:30,960
Amen.

442
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,220
Oh, yes, dear friends.

443
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,980
And you can indeed get that free information from Bob at, got that pencil ready?

444
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,080
P.O.

445
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,800
Box 140306.

446
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:43,780
P.O.

447
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:43,780


448
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:50,020
Box 140306 here in mighty Dallas, Texas 75214.

449
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:59,400
Once again, that's Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

450
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,060
Give thanks to Bob, our eternal hope.

451
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,340
And praise me to Erwin, New Jersey's Pope.

452
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,780
We're fickle and free and we don't make no frills.

453
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,980
We're the only ones who can help us at the Church of the Self Genius.

454
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,360
Bob, hear our plea.

455
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,800
We beseech thee.

456
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,240
Help us be free from normalcy.

457
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,780
We're dumb, devoted, and don't talk back.

458
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,180
Please give us an hour of slack.

459
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,180
Woo.

460
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,980
J.R.

461
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,120
Bob Dobbs never fails.

462
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,760
He's the living slack master of Bob Dobbs.

463
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:43,760


464
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:43,760


465
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:43,760


466
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,020
He's the one who's got the mystic sails.

467
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:52,140
All you conspiracy doofs, just you wait till July the 5th, 1998.

468
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:02,860
Invaders will come from Planet X, bringing gifts of money, time control, and great sex.

469
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,500
A new age will dawn and we'll never look back.

470
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,900
We'll be busy enjoying our slack.

471
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,400
Everybody now.

472
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,320
Bob here.

473
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,720
We believe in silly things.

474
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,280
Jasmine doesn't move.

475
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,520
And nobody loses out.

476
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,860

481
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,220
The slack master sells everywhere

482
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,240
Give thanks to Bob

483
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,580
Give thanks to Bob

484
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,000
Our eternal hope

485
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,320
And praise me to Owen

486
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,360
New Jersey's Pope

487
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,480
We're fickle and free

488
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,740
And we don't make no fuss

489
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,280
At the church of the subgenius

490
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,460
Everybody now

491
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,420
Give thanks to Bob

492
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,880
Our eternal hope

493
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,240
And praise me to Owen

494
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,160
New Jersey's Pope

495
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,420
We're fickle and free

496
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,900
And we don't make no fuss

497
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,060
At the church of the subgenius

498
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,320
Give thanks to Bob

499
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,740
Our eternal hope

500
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,120
And praise me to Owen

501
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,140
New Jersey's Pope

502
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,280
We're fickle and free

503
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,660
And we don't make no fuss

504
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,340
At the church of the subgenius

505
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,060
Yes, dear friend

506
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,800
Lovely, lovely

507
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,220
New Jersey's Pope

508
00:27:50,020 --> 00:28:11,340
Yes, dear friend

509
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,320
Yes, dear friend

510
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,320


511
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,240
Well, no, it's only a half hour at this point

512
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,780
And it must be carefully contained

513
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,400
Or it will reach fusion point

514
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,900
And you'll all be sorry, won't you?

515
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,580
Embarrass you to death in a few moments

516
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,620
You need to run?

517
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,080
That means you need to premeditate your pressure points

518
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,540
Brother Bob, the devil's after me all the time

519
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,760
I said, wait, really?

520
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,200
Because the devil don't ever bother me much

521
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,580
He usually puts a demon or two on me

522
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,340
They can take care of me

523
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,900
If the phone rings and there's somebody you don't want to talk to

524
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,400
Run from the phone

525
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,020
A minute

526
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,220
A minute

527
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,020
Push, push, push

528
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,580
The Octo Emmet nearly invaded the sub

529
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,420
We're going to continue until we...

530
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,120
He always tries to get on the show

531
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,000
He tries his things

532
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,760
We'll fire seven nuclear missiles into the fiery froth

533
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,620
And perhaps that'll put out the fire somehow

534
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Though don't ask me why

535
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:55,920
Sharpen my knife

536
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,620
Thank you, thank you very much

537
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,100
We're determined to go ahead with this course of action

538
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,580
Right or wrong, my country, never shall I say thee nay

539
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,040
Sharpen up my knife, you're a hit

540
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,340
We're sharpening up our tools

541
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,540
Getting ready to invade Ethiopia

542
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,820
With Mussolini and his boys

543
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,920
Oh, uh, take a look at that over there

544
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,760
That one seems to be, uh, well-excelled-handed

545
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,980
But it's wasting itself

546
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,080
Oh, that's what I was looking for

547
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,960
The moon unabrested in moon-calling snow

548
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,820
Gave the lustre amidnay the objects below

549
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,180
When what to me wondering eyes should appear

550
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,040
But a basset hound humping a cast-iron lawn deer

551
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,500
Away to the window I flew in a flash

552
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,300
Tore open the shutters and flew up the sash

553
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,820
Gold, gold!

554
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,240
They're holding them to our mill

555
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

556
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,800
I'm sorry, I didn't know it would be that painful

557
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,860
No, I guess I really blew it

558
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,500
And how many times have you wished you could do something?

559
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,560
Thank you, thank you

560
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,660
Well, now you can

561
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,300
If you listen to Subgenius Radio

562
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,060
You'll soon know how to confound your enemies

563
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,080
And even puzzle and bother your friends

564
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,940
It's easy, just do as the doctors of the air do

565
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,320
Listen to their inflections

566
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,540
Copy their everywhere

567
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,220
Soon you'll know that there's a show ongoing everywhere

568
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,360
Around you now

569
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,720
Even as you think sleep

570
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,540
Devocate or go about your family

571
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,460
Further business

572
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,800
So remember, there's a show where you look to find it

573
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,520
This tip has been brought to you by the doctors of the air

574
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,320
Ah, I have a hint

575
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,980
Yes, yes, yes

576
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,160
Yes

577
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:29,740
Wow

578
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,040
Oh, that was

579
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,400
You just heard the end of a cartridge

580
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,960
Wasn't that interesting?

581
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,120
Kind of that

582
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,940
That full, rich

583
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,980
Full-bodied hiss

584
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,900
Well, here's the beginning of the cartridge

585
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,980
First, I'd like to give thanks and praise to the most high

586
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,700
For giving I and I this privilege

587
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,500
Of being with I and I brethren and sisters

588
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,380
In a land where we're free to say

589
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,840
Ja, Rastafari, Nibiru

590
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,840
Cheerio, cheerio

591
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,900
Greetings from I and I

592
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,640
The biggest event of the year

593
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,760
Yes, indeed

594
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,120
From the heart of Matigaben, Jamaica

595
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,800
Vegas, Sunspot, Jamaica

596
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,500
All over all around the world

597
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:11,880
Ah

598
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,520
Okay

599
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,000
More god hate here

600
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,200
And watch

601
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,440
Watch lightening not strike us dead

602
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,080
There was this very powerful man

603
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,140
In fact, he was more than a powerful man

604
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,280
He was more like a force, a force, a force

605
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,340
He was the one who threw the switch

606
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,460
The switch was wired to the sun's rays

607
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,420
Then it went right out and it made the Earth

608
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,460
And it did it all in seven days

609
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Take this story up, it has been going around for years.

610
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,680
It first came out of this old book with a capital B-C-C.

611
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,200
They say there's wisdom in that book, more than you'll find in a bottle of scotch.

612
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,500
And if you buy what's in that book, perhaps you'd like to buy this watch.

613
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,680
Oh God, oh God, you give me such a pain.

614
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,800
When I think of all the things we do and don't do in your name.

615
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,020
Are you love? Are you light? Are you just a man?

616
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,040
I just hope I'm on your side when the sh** all hits the fan.

617
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,320
When I was but a little lad, I stood before the throne of our Lord.

618
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,240
A wide-eyed, open bundle of youth, but not quite on the search for truth.

619
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,520
I saw the water turn to wine. I saw the church's coffers grow.

620
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,500
I saw more miracles in there than at the circus magic show.

621
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,740
There was this kindly man of the clock. This man, he took me by the hand.

622
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,940
This man said I should stand erect and wait for God.

623
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,780
I saw God in his command. This man, he taught me wrong from right.

624
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,560
To love the sinner and hate the sin.

625
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,860
Only word from God I heard was not to be along with this man.

626
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,720
Oh God, oh God, you give me such a pain.

627
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,940
When I think of all the things we do and don't do in your name.

628
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,120
Are you love? Are you light? Are you just a man?

629
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,220
I just hope I'm on your side when the sh** all hits the fan.

630
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:08,980
Whoa!

631
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,000
I've got you.

632
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,460
I've got my crystals. I've got my chance.

633
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,640
Girls think I'm cool in my tai chi pants.

634
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,860
All I really want to know is what I have to buy.

635
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,000
So when I kick, I can shake his hand and look him in the eye.

636
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,100
There are so many gods right now, it just could drive a man insane.

637
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,240
And all these people running around who slip your throat in his good name.

638
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,380
They all got holy beads and books.

639
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,300
They make their god the one to know.

640
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,000
But I ain't never met no one who's been up there to see his show.

641
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,060
So don't be coming around to me with all your holy cosmic s**t.

642
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,200
And don't be showing off your god like he's the latest spandex cop.

643
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,220
All Christian soldiers go to war crusading for the Prince of Peace.

644
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,560
The only preacher you can trust will give the most.

645
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,820
Oh God, oh God, you give me such a pain.

646
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,360
When I think of all the things we do and don't do in your name.

647
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,160
Are you love? Are you a liar? Are you just a man?

648
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,240
I just hope I'm on your side when the s**t all hits the fan.

649
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,120
Nonsense. Nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.

650
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,480
I don't feel very nice. I feel as if I'm having a bad dream.

651
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,260
He looks perfectly pitiful. I think it's just awful.

652
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:39,240
Oh, I was wrong. We were struck. We were struck for playing that awful, all this god hate stuff.

653
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,560
Actually, that was Reverend Joe Paulino. So he's the one who's going to hell.

654
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:50,380
Not me. No, no. We're going to quit hating religion for a minute.

655
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,220
And we'll go back to hating politics. Yeah, that's okay.

656
00:34:53,320 --> 00:35:00,000
Let's hate left wing, right wing, all radicals and reactionaries and middle of the roaders most of all.

657
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,180
From our lofty perch high above. Ah, yes. Thank you, old friends.

658
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,740
Now from Metro Meaningless Mayor.

659
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:15,820
The last heterosexual. His desire was unquenchable for the other sex.

660
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:22,600
His search was unending for a straight bar. He was not into leather.

661
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,140
The last heterosexual.

662
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,120
You, uh, want to open your bags?

663
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,880
Uh, there's nothing in there but a vase and some fresh cigarettes.

664
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,760
Oh, yeah? What do you call this? Blue Boy?

665
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,020
Oh, that penthouse magazine. That belongs to my sister.

666
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,680
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

667
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,440
Blue Boy. Obviously the victim of a mental disorder.

668
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,140
Friggin' pervert!

669
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,880
The last heterosexual. His friends pressured him.

670
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,280
Come on, Dave. The same old nitrate is bought.

671
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,200
His parents shunned him.

672
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,300
He acted like any other normal boy. He played with dolls. He decorated our home.

673
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,160
He wanted to work in the State Department.

674
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,340
But in the end, he was alone. The last heterosexual.

675
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,500
Okay, okay. So I'm not gay. But I'm happy.

676
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,720
What a person does in his private life is not his own.

677
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:08,720


678
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,460
Own business as you'll see in The Last Heterosexual.

679
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,300
Rated CA. Consenting adults only.

680
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:21,360
Time now for the George Bush workout with your host, George Bush.

681
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:27,160
Okay, America. Let's get ready to go through the motions like I do every day.

682
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,820
Going through the motions. Ready? Here we go.

683
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,000
Pick up that pen. Come on, pick it up. Pick it up.

684
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,280
Now sign a veto for new welfare increases. One, two. Doesn't that feel good?

685
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,280
Hey, what's this? A bill to make experimental drugs available to AIDS patients?

686
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,400
Veto. Veto. Shoot it down. Shoot it down.

687
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,960
Okay. Higher minimum wage? Yeah, sure. Ha, ha, ha.

688
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,540
No you don't. No you don't. Greenhouse effect. Never heard of it. Never heard of it.

689
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,180
One, two. And stretch the truth. Stretch. Stretch. Stretch the truth.

690
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,620
Feels good, doesn't it? Now, one and two.

691
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,820
Ollie North. A pardon? Maybe. Maybe. Think about it. Think about it.

692
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,920
Not important right now.

693
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,660
The EPA. Not responsible for the Exxon spill. One, two. One and two.

694
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:19,940
And drug problems. Import. Export. Condone. Condemn. Condone. Condemn.

695
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,900
Now, Iran-Contra. Hey, let it lay. Let it lay. Okay, read my lips.

696
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,560
Let's put the past behind us. Come on. Put it. Put it. Put it behind you.

697
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,040
All the way behind you. One, two. One, two.

698
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,940
Now this is the tough part of the workout. Keeping the NRA happy.

699
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,700
Iran all imported semi-automatic and automatic weapons except the ones made in the USA.

700
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,620
Those are different from the bad foreign guns.

701
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,700
Feel the burn. Feel the burn. No pain, no gain.

702
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:54,860
Now, let's all take back the streets. Come on. Take them. Take them. Take them.

703
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,200
One, two. Fight crime. Thousand points of light. Stay on course.

704
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,600
Quid pro quo. Here we go. Vodio do.

705
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,200
Isn't this fun? Going through the motions?

706
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,680
This is the greatest and you'll feel better every time you do this program.

707
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,680
I'm telling you right now. You can be sure of that.

708
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,600
One, two. Don't miss tuning in to the George Bush workout tomorrow

709
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,280
when George will concentrate on development of the private sector.

710
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,560
And, uh, thank you, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

711
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:31,860
And that's it for the Bleepo Abernathy production demo, dear friends.

712
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,300
I've now played all of it on the hour of slack.

713
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,180
But what you haven't heard yet, I'm going to play it on the hour of slack.

714
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,820
I have a hint, excuse me, as to the meaning of this.

715
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,380
Oh, good.

716
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,280
If you look in the National Dream Book.

717
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,260
You hearin' a preacher preach? I hope you're listening.

718
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,900
I hope you're listening.

719
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,140
Man, those first few months I wore out three pair of breeches.

720
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,500
I learned to talk to God.

721
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:04,640
See, because for a person to get saved and just quit smoking, drinking, cussing, chewing, acting ugly, drying up and dying,

722
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,160
they become bored to death.

723
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,040
I'm a dictator.

724
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,360
Our show, our Claremont Fan Club has 15 members.

725
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,380
15 members and a dictator.

726
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,480
How are we doing, gentlemen?

727
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,480
It's good enough time for a general business meeting, I think.

728
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,780
Dr. Fireside's business meeting.

729
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,620
Now, uh, Pete, you're in charge of our investments.

730
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,540
How are we doing there?

731
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,000
Our investitures, actually.

732
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:29,260
I've sold church property in Belgium, uh, Great Britain, Wales, and southern France,

733
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,360
where the media, you know, is at least a week slow, so they don't have any reports of the scandal.

734
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,600
Now, we charge extra, don't we, when they become a priest?

735
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,660
I hope we're still continuing that fine service.

736
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,400
We charge extra until...

737
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,700
A priest, by the way, because of the modern rules now, is a man who's been pressed by us.

738
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,860
Yeah, well, he's... they wear those pressed suits.

739
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,340
That's why most of them are...

740
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:47,360
Priest suits.

741
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:47,360


742
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,380
Pressed priest suits are known as priests.

743
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,040
Most of them are newsmen.

744
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,540
Right, most of them are new, new newsmen.

745
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,400
New, uh, news, gospel...

746
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,060
Gospel, yeah.

747
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,980
...after all.

748
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,700
Right, you know.

749
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,200
We shave their camera, right?

750
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,860
We take out all the really, you know, advanced f-stops until they really, you know, are ready to open their eye up to God.

751
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,860
We keep them in...

752
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,480
Yeah, so that's the investitures so far for the Fireside.

753
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:05,580
All right.

754
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,060
And then the Help the Who Fund is going on pretty well.

755
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,580
What did you say the what?

756
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,240
Wait, Help the Who?

757
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,000
The Help the Who Fund.

758
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,720
We're trying to raise $30,000 to help pay for the Who's new limousine.

759
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,060
Yeah.

760
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,540
To take a little burden off the economy.

761
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,480
And I must...

762
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:24,100
I want to just notice to you, make clear here, I went through the old files of the Help the Who campaign.

763
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,060
Well, we've been helping him...

764
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,460
Since 66.

765
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,700
We've been helping him ever since we found out who he was.

766
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,080
Yeah.

767
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,320
Yeah, right.

768
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:28,880
65.

769
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,960
66, actually, November.

770
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,600
It's interesting to note that the same limousine in 66 only cost us $17,336.

771
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,580
Right.

772
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,120
And it's been going up to $18,000, $19,000 in 67, $21,000 in 1968.

773
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,660
Remember, we almost didn't make it.

774
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:43,960
Right.

775
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,020
And last year it cost us, well, it cost us $27,665.

776
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,800
So this year, we know it's going to cost $30,000 and we're pushing for it.

777
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,000
We hope we can get all that money.

778
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,800
So please, you know...

779
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,400
Mr. Punder?

780
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,500
If I knock on your door, don't slam the old screen in my face.

781
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,440
We're going to have that telethon, aren't we?

782
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,080
Yeah, we're going to have the telethon.

783
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,860
Oh, somebody just come in with a contribution.

784
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,580
No, somebody just left hearing that you were going to do the call.

785
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,920
The Who Fund is always nice.

786
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,520
It's not a drag.

787
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,360
It's just kind of heavy.

788
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,560
It's super dramatic after the show when they put the lights on, they put the lead over

789
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,260
the windows and you come around with that basket.

790
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,720
We're going to have the drawing in Butte, Montana.

791
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,020
What are you going to be drawing, do you think?

792
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:16,740
Lots.

793
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,300
Lots.

794
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,200
Not rain or crowds.

795
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:18,940
No.

796
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,680
Lies.

797
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,560
Cows are easy.

798
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,440
Cars are easy.

799
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,120
I can draw some of the late 50s cars.

800
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,080
Yeah, yeah.

801
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:30,060
Well, anyway, we've taken care of religion and public service and Dave Osmond, who's

802
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,820
in charge of art for the Fireside Theatre, his report is next.

803
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,780
In the meantime...

804
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:39,220
All the amazing things that have been going on while the Chinese burned rented bathing

805
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,600
suits to kill AIDS, yes?

806
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,120
Inspirational.

807
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,380
While tiny dinosaurs were excavated...

808
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:45,900
Also Chinese.

809
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,180
Thousands of little...

810
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,400
Here's a guy pulling one out of the...

811
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,160
Hey, get away from him.

812
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,060
Yeah, they're really smelly.

813
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,520
He works out here and he never really...

814
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:58,560
These foul-smelling fossils indicate what life was like during mid-Cretaceous times 75

815
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,600
million years ago.

816
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,560
It may be a painful process, but we're going to have to get through it.

817
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,820
We've got one necessary to good grooming, healthy toilet habits, and the understanding

818
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,180
of the advancement of science.

819
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:20,820
In the meanwhile, we'll attempt to entertain you with some Helen Wolf balls all the way

820
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,900
from Ontario.

821
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:33,540
With only 15 minutes remaining in the subgenius convention, I think we have a caller now down

822
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,120
on the...

823
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,040
Oh, yeah.

824
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,460
We've got to run.

825
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:35,620
We've got to run.

826
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:35,780


827
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:35,780


828
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:35,780


829
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:39,180
So we'll go to Charles B. Howard and take that call now.

830
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,760
Chapter 20, Eccentric Sexual Theories.

831
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,040
The field of sexual pseudoscience is understandably vast and grotesque.

832
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,000
Hardly an aspect of sex has escaped the theorizing of eccentric biologists.

833
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,880
Consider, for instance, the problem, how the sexes came into being.

834
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,400
Did gene splicing have to do with this early sexual...

835
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,380
A kind of modern occult vision.

836
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,440
We place Gene Simmons under Gene Harlow and Dr. S. H. H. H.

837
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:05,440


838
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,960
Got this gene call.

839
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,980
What a gene pool we drew from.

840
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:14,520
And in this warm and turgid gene pool, we sport the tiny spermatozole...

841
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,300
And there goes a little caller and his girlfriend dropping into the color pit.

842
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,900
We tried to warn him, but he didn't get the gist or allegorical language.

843
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:31,060
You see, on the microscopic level, contraction starts and, well, it's not pretty sight.

844
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,340
In fact, terrible, the excretion contract, the ovacuole, the...

845
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:35,420
And then the first thing we do is we do a little bit of a...

846
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,420


847
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,420


848
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,420


849
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,420


850
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,420


851
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,420


852
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,960
Digestion.

853
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,180
Dr. Hale, where are you doing your signing?

854
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,920
The membrane, all protoplasm...

855
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,360
Hold on.

856
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,540
All talking, all singing, all dancing, prehistoric...

857
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,820
Dr. Hale, I have a rare public appearance at...

858
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,600
On Sunday.

859
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,440
That's right.

860
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:53,460
I'll be signing my book, What You Can Do About Skeletons in the Closet, at Justin Herman

861
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,440
Plaza, dust in time for the nuclear holocaust which will be descending on us all.

862
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,160
What was that noise, Mike?

863
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,500
That sound you just heard could well be the result of a nuclear explosion somewhere down

864
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,400
here at the bottom of the ocean.

865
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:05,400


866
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,560
akkorim?

867
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:07,960


868
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,440
Well, that's the best case.

869
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:12,440


870
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,400
Scholרא́k!

871
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,160
... quit doing a pertta preparator.

872
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:18,340
Kratos couldn't delightful hear that sound.

873
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:18,580
Yeah, that right there.

874
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:22,600
Well, this Xu Myung-wook, that, that ghost bury me alive...

875
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,920
JunkLetting, a tentart which is located...

876
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,580
Lt.

877
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,000


878
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,240
Hannu-feu.

879
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:30,920
He...

880
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,640
Iknow that.

881
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,700

La...

883
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:43,780
dead soil of a lost world a world that may have to go on if it goes on without us well we don't

884
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:49,720

902
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:47,960
you can find out just how funny it really is by writing for free information we're going to give

909
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:33,060
you know which whatever you're after um but before it gets cut off because the swing

910
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:40,680
ended up getting cut off speaking of the living dead uh this what i'm about to play is a a tune by

911
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:49,760
our dear friends of the church the swinging love corpses who um are from saint louis missouri

912
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:58,140
manned by dr phylo drummond captain sphinx drummond and their cousin ray hay

913
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:02,520
uh stepbrother-in-laws uh mojo and skippy

914
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:07,640
and so on, and Leif, Cowabunga.

915
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,740
This particular song, this is a live recording in a club,

916
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:16,020
and they're singing about the subgenius get-togethers

917
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,440
known as Dockstock.

918
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,100
Dockstock is not like our big revival shows or devivals,

919
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,680
as the Nakedian church calls them, and many others.

920
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,180
The Dockstocks are by invitation only.

921
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,960
They're probably a little more like the Merry Pranksters

922
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:41,100
scholastic aptitude tests in the olden days.

923
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,000
Just a lot of fun.

924
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,480
They don't happen around here, and you'll never find out

925
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,420
where and why they do happen.

926
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,340
But you remember that song, Down in Monterey?

927
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,980
This, I think, was inspired by that song

928
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,340
and the Dockstock experience.

929
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,380
By the way, lest I forget, what you were listening to earlier

930
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,160
was a comment.

931
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:06,020
It was a combination of the KPFA subgenius show in Berkeley

932
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,060
with puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell and Bob Nelson there,

933
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,440
engineering and muttering,

934
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,860
mixed with the Fireside Theater's ancient show from the 60s,

935
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,160
from the late 60s, tapes of the original show.

936
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,860
And it's amazing, you know, listening to that,

937
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,520
how much of it might as well have been done yesterday.

938
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,840
However, there were sections that I couldn't play.

939
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,740
They could play in 1968, but I cannot play them

940
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,160
in the 80s.

941
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:43,080
Because people would accuse us of trying to be funny about race.

942
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,620
So you can't do that anymore.

943
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,080
I can't.

944
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,420
Somebody else can.

945
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,780
And I'm sure does.

946
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,400
Anyway, friends, praise Bob.

947
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,600
This is the Swingin' Love Quarters.

948
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:00,120
Mojo, mojo, mojo, mojo.

949
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:06,160
Mojo, mojo, mojo, mojo.

950
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:36,360
From across the nation they came and they saw

951
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:40,500
A new world begin in northern Arkansas

952
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:45,100
They drove the storm and perils of life

953
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,980
To their new awakening and

954
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,180
Stock stock inside

955
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,820
Six years peace and love and moving time

956
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:58,100
The attorney was there and they were feeling fine

957
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,160
Bodies were there, but they were fine

958
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:02,160


959
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,660
They were mostly cool guys like me and you

960
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:10,100
And we got high, so high

961
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,020
On Stock Stock Mountain

962
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,920
Yeah, we got high, so high

963
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,840
On Stock Stock Mountain

964
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,900
People were happy, they were all having fun

965
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,980
While doctors survived was fun

966
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,500
And skulls in the sun

967
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,740
The corpses were swinging

968
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,000
Their love did abound

969
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,580
The average corpse floated a foot off the ground

970
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:47,100
The band that did not want to be in his name

971
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,820
While half-doctors on the clamshell

972
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,660
Was claiming their fame

973
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:56,620
Fart dog explosion and combo gang farts

974
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:00,860
Finished their sets just in time for lunch

975
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,160
So we got high, so high

976
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,960
On Stock Stock Mountain

977
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:13,300
Yeah, we got high, so high

978
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,460
On Stock Stock Mountain

979
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,580
We ate lots of mushrooms

980
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,800
We commute with nature

981
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,140
Power we don't know how to use

982
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,340
So we'd have to move our s**t later

983
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:08,640
500 colors flashed into my brain

984
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,080
My cell division occurred in three or four planes

985
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,360
My brain was blasted and my head even bit

986
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,780
My eyeballs protruded, but I didn't get sick

987
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:26,740
I sucked tits, butts, Pepsi and Docs

988
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:30,940
Then we found that the beans had gotten all the best parts

989
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,120
So we got high, so high

990
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,640
On Stock Stock Mountain

991
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:43,160
Yeah, we got high, so high

992
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,160
On Stock Stock Mountain

993
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,940
Yeah, we got so high

994
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,220
We climbed way up on top of Stock Stock Mountain

995
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,120
On the way up there, we shot the bulls

996
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:02,120


997
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,880
Smoked, drank everything in sight

998
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,120
When we got up to the top

999
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,220
I realized I was too high

1000
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,160
Oh my God, I may not be able to ever come down on Stock Stock Mountain

1001
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,220
Oh, s**t, I don't think I'll get this high next year

1002
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,960
Oh, oh, we got high

1003
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,960
We got so high

1004
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,100
But then finally we got high on top of Stock Stock Mountain

1005
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,940
and we came back down a little ways off of Dockstock Mountain.

1006
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,540
I got too high.

1007
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,460
How many of you are taking acid tonight?

1008
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,240
How many of you are taking acid tonight?

1009
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,860
Just show your hands.

1010
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,060
How many people out there tripping?

1011
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,820
I'd say about 12 people out there.

1012
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,160
All right.

1013
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,780
I count 13.

1014
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,440
We got high, high, high.

1015
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:01,800
Now, if that isn't an anti-drug song,

1016
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,420
I don't know what is.

1017
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,580
Because you certainly can't be left with the impression

1018
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,620
that drugs make you sing well.

1019
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,960
I just wanted to throw that little disclaimer in, friends.

1020
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,960
These boys are singing about being high on Bob.

1021
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:16,500
And that's all you need.

1022
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,040
Bob's the only real drug.

1023
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,100
He's one you can't come down from.

1024
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,360
It's a heavenly, lovely thing.

1025
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,360
A confusing thing.

1026
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,840
But, you know, what good are brains in the late 80s anyway?

1027
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:35,240
Pope Meyer has so often said,

1028
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,240
well, dear friends,

1029
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,280
I guess we'll just sit here and keep playing tapes

1030
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,060
until somebody comes in to do another show.

1031
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,240
And we started a couple minutes late,

1032
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,980
so anybody else is welcome to.

1033
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,480
This tape will run for another 15 or 20 minutes.

1034
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,220
This has been your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1035
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,320
By the way, Ivan Stang,

1036
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,900
when you flip the letters around, says,

1037
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,500
Nats Navy.

1038
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,360
Navy of Nats.

1039
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,540
Little bugs.

1040
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,540
Gnats, you know, you get it?

1041
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,380
Whoa! I'm sorry!

1042
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:09,720
Human victims.

1043
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,220
The body should be disposed of at once,

1044
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,620
preferably by cremation.

1045
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,920
Well, how long after death, then,

1046
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,580
does the body become reactivated?

1047
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:18,860
It's only a matter of minutes.

1048
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:19,940
Minutes?

1049
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,360
Well, that doesn't give people time to make any arrangements.

1050
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:22,880
No, you're right.

1051
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,100
It doesn't give them time to make funeral arrangements.

1052
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,660
The rapture continues.

1053
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,400
In heat of my flesh,

1054
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,620
drink of my blood不会born 죽 Tuyet my flesh.

1055
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:38,620


1056
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,540
Baby

1057
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,220
oh, baby

1058
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,120
touch me, baby

1059
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,000
deeper baby

1060
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:54,500
oh, yeah

1061
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,220
Ain't you ever had sex with someone

1062
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,400
that you don't even know, yeah

1063
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,240
You think that's funny?

1064
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,160
I don't.

1065
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,960
You think I'm a prude?

1066
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,140
Call me.

1067
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,260
Kinison doesn't stop there.

1068
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,540
He deliberately mocks Christ.

1069
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,580
He even takes on the crucifixion.

1070
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,440
He's on the cross.

1071
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,460
30, 40 Christians standing around going,

1072
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,520
it's a shame that he has to die.

1073
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,640
And Jesus is going,

1074
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,880
well, maybe I wouldn't have to.

1075
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,600
Does somebody get a ladder and a pair of pliers?

1076
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,800
In case you couldn't understand what he said,

1077
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,820
while Christians were weeping at the cross,

1078
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,340
he said Jesus is up there saying,

1079
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,700
would somebody get a ladder and a pair of pliers?

1080
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,180
Can't they be staged, Bob?

1081
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:45,620
Some way?

1082
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,000
Any suggestions, Bob?

1083
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:50,820
Time may have come for all of us to hold our tents.

1084
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,520
We, as opposed to they,

1085
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,180
may have to give up this little piece of real estate

1086
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,140
we call the world.

1087
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,420
It may only be a matter of days.

1088
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,400
And meanwhile?

1089
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,680
Meanwhile, we prepare to get out just as fast as we can.

1090
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,640
Not only from this place here,

1091
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,840
but from the entire planet,

1092
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,920
while we still have the chance.

1093
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,600
While we still have the chance, dear friends,

1094
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,440
I will say this is KNON 89.3 FM

1095
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,180
in Dallas, Texas.

1096
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,780
And you're still listening to the subgenius radio ministry.

1097
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,260
Hour of Slack.

1098
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,860
How about that?

1099
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,200
Hey, you got more than an hour of Slack this time.

1100
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,560
So I find now, as some eight years ago,

1101
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,980
I was doing things for the first time,

1102
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,960
I am doing them now for the final time.

1103
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:49,260
As president, I will not again have the privilege of greeting you.

1104
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:52,680
I again assure you it has been a very great privilege

1105
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,920
to have these contacts with a body

1106
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,060
in which I find so many of my intimate friends.

1107
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,420
And alongside others...

1108
00:58:59,420 --> 00:58:59,860
What's the senator?

1109
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,560
That I respect and admire,

1110
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,080
even if I do not have the privilege

1111
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,140
of their personal acquaintanceship and friendship.

1112
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,680
So thank you again and good luck

1113
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,280
and keep going.

1114
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,300
That's all I can say.

1115
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,920
In which direction would you suggest that we keep going?

1116
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,220
Yeah, we'll just keep going.

1117
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,800
Up. Up. Up. Up. Up.

1118
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,300
Up we go.

1119
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,460
Well, they're up.

1120
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:23,440
Yep, they're up.

1121
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,860
There they go. They're heading around the field.

1122
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,380
Look at that. Look at them run. Look at them run.

1123
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,960
There it is. There's the State of the Union.

1124
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,420
He's on ahead there.

1125
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,380
He's doing very, very...

1126
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,940
The Constitution now is making it a little in the rear.

1127
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,700
It's about three bills behind.

1128
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,600
Here comes the Bill of Rights.

1129
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:36,720
Coming up on the outside.

1130
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,120
Pretty good.

1131
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,400
Pretty good.

1132
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,840
They're coming around the wide turn now.

1133
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,400
There's the hoop.

1134
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,400
I believe there's a penalty on the field.

1135
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,720
Freedom of the Press has been sent back three yards.

1136
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:47,760
Yes.

1137
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,560
The hoop is coming around.

1138
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,820
He's coming around.

1139
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:53,900
He's coming around again.

1140
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,720
Yes, he is coming around again, isn't he?

1141
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:56,900
There he comes again.

1142
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,200
Well, that's wonderful.

1143
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:58,760
That's wonderful.

1144
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:00,180
Well, that's post time down here.

1145
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,920
The United States of Armenia.

1146
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,120
Post time.

1147
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,040
Just before it happens.

1148
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,180
You know, the big bomb scare is over now, guys.

1149
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,400
The big bomb scare of 69.

1150
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:11,640
Yeah, that's all over.

1151
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,220
The guy with the trembling finger pushing the red button

1152
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,380
and the whole world going up in monosodium glutamate.

1153
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,020
That's all over.

1154
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,160
The big bomb scare is over.

1155
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,020
There's a new one now.

1156
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:20,860
Oh, there's a new one now.

1157
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,580
Yeah, the big...

1158
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,520
What do you call that?

1159
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:23,960
The big...

1160
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,940
Sonic scare.

1161
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:25,560
No, no.

1162
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,100
The big guy, you know, ecology.

1163
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,300
Ecology.

1164
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:28,840
Ecology.

1165
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,900
The big ecology scare.

1166
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:30,840
The now scare.

1167
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,680
That's the now scare.

1168
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,800
Well, it's such a now happening word.

1169
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:34,380
It surely is.

1170
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,740
Pollution is such a happening thing.

1171
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,260
If we could only find a way of really...

1172
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:37,980
Well, we found a way of doing it.

1173
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,560
I got a good idea for a TV series about pollution.

1174
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,800
Curb front polluters?

1175
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,280
No, the young polluters was my final.

1176
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:44,960
That's a good title.

1177
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,320
Well, that's good.

1178
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,520
We can work together on it.

1179
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,560
We can take 50-50 and I'll take 20 off the middle.

1180
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,100
I'll take 50 out of the bottom.

1181
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:50,760
You will.

1182
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:51,860
Off the secretary.

1183
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:53,720
The young polluters.

1184
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,740
That's a wonderful idea.

1185
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:55,260
Right.

1186
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,440
Should I come in and tell you about it?

1187
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:57,740
Sure.

1188
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,460
Come on in.

1189
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,280
Open the door.

1190
01:00:59,440 --> 01:00:59,880
All right.

1191
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,140
Sure.

1192
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:04,000
Okay, we only use that door a couple of times per show, you know, and I like to get it on.

1193
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:04,560
That's right.

1194
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,980
Now, the young polluters is going to be about this vacuum cleaner salesman, you see?

1195
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:08,480
Yeah.

1196
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,380
Played here by young Adam Thigh.

1197
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:10,920
Oh, yeah.

1198
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,400
Formerly known as Philip Hunter, but he changed his name because Thigh is more of an in now

1199
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,380
happening word, you know.

1200
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,920
THs are very big now, you know, ever since everybody's gums have swollen up and they

1201
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,740
look like that.

1202
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,980
Well, so many of the now happening people...

1203
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:23,900
Like pollution.

1204
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,040
Use THs.

1205
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:25,560
Yeah, LHP.

1206
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,220
Many now happening people LHP.

1207
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:27,520
Right.

1208
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:28,040
They're from LHP.

1209
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:28,460
Go ahead.

1210
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:29,040
Yes, indeed.

1211
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,280
What was I saying?

1212
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:32,300
I don't know.

1213
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,140
Oh, the TV series.

1214
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:33,440
Okay.

1215
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,200
It's about this young vacuum cleaner salesman who goes around.

1216
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:44,840
He could be a big time vacuum cleaner salesman, but he prefers to be out on the street vacuuming

1217
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,100
the street.

1218
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:45,300
The Shister Warriors.

1219
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:50,520
In fact, they have to defend him because his electric cord, you see, keeps getting like

1220
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,600
tripping people's dogs or getting wrapped around people's heads, as you see, or electrocuting

1221
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:54,820
people.

1222
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:59,680
In one episode, we have him electrocuting a young hippie girl who's stoned on LSD.

1223
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,300
Yeah.

1224
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,300
And he's a young person who's contemplating a mass murder.

1225
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:02,760
No.

1226
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,460
Yes, right.

1227
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,280
And it's a love story.

1228
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,580
It's a very now love story.

1229
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:08,540
It does not mind.

1230
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:08,920
Oh, yeah.

1231
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:09,900
I live on now street.

1232
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,900
Oh, you do in Mod Go-Go Heights, right?

1233
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,060
Sure.

1234
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:12,620
Mod Heights.

1235
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:12,980
Yeah.

1236
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:13,280
