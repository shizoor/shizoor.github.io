1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,740
Brace pop.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,860
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,400
When we leave this area in a moment, be sure to take along all your belongings.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,880
Including your imagination.

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,500
Beaver!

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:22,500


7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,000
Beaver!

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:23,880
Beaver!

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,800
Beaver!

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,340
Beaver!

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:27,700
Beaver!

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,200
Beaver!

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,600
Beaver!

14
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,500
Beaver!

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,160
Beaver!

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,540
Beaver!

17
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:34,900
Beaver!

18
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,340
Beaver!

19
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:35,380
Beaver!

20
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:35,440
Beaver!

21
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,140
Beaver!

22
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,380
Beaver!

23
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,300
You were calling to him in the dark?

24
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,940
Where is Bob?

25
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,500
What are you gonna do to him?

26
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,540
I'll ask the questions.

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,080
Where is Bob?

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,700
ünkü

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,440
B-Hit to believer!

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,840
Barbara's fever.

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,740
What are you doing?

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,540
I'm not doing nothing.

33
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,800
The

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,140
S.O.S.

35
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,600
G.E.F.

36
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,940
G.E.F.

37
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,800
The Hour of Slack.

38
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,000
There is truth

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,460
and there is untruth.

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,400
Freedom

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,960
is the freedom to say

42
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,040
two plus two equals four.

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,760
If that is granted,

44
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,020
all else follows.

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,320
And I saw an airplane hit the classroom.

46
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,080
Uh, uh, uh,

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
one terrible day.

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,020
Terrible day.

49
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,900
And I saw an airplane hit the classroom.

50
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,680
Uh, uh, uh,

51
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,060
one terrible day.

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,700
TV was obviously terrible.

53
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,780
The Matrix is everywhere.

54
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,700
It is all around us.

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,380
Even now in this very room.

56
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,180
You can see it

57
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,220
when you look out your window

58
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,200
or when you turn on your television.

59
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,760
You can feel it.

60
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
When you go to work.

61
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,480
When you go to church.

62
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,920
When you pay your taxes.

63
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,920
It is the world

64
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,080
that has been pulled over your eyes

65
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,400
to blind you from the truth.

66
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,660
My truth.

67
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,500
My truth.

68
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:14,960
My truth.

69
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,580
My truth.

70
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,880
That you are a slave.

71
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,960
That you are a slave.

72
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,980
I confess to spreading the rumor

73
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,780
on orders from Groves' team

74
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,060
that the war is not ready with you.

75
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,060


76
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,660
Eurasia.

77
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,500
Eurasia.

78
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,960
That for years,

79
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,940
in fact since the days of our glorious revolution,

80
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,360
I had no faith in our future.

81
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,540
I forged government announcements

82
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,120
and falsified figures

83
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,180
voting for agricultural and industrial

84
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,140
As a result of mental disturbance

85
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,180
dating from my experiences during the atomic wars,

86
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,800
I was a willing subject of Goldstein's influence.

87
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,020
I was stubborn and egocentric.

88
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,820
When own life thoughts occurred to me, I reveled in them.

89
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,660
I went into the proletarian zones.

90
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,800
I had sex with prostitutes.

91
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,740
I deliberately contracted syphilis.

92
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,280
Yes, dear friends, Norrell Preff did that one.

93
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,800
The preferable Norrell Preff.

94
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,220
Enter.

95
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,540
I'm trading for a second.

96
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,560
Okay, you can trade because trading is always a good thing.

97
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:54,260
Yes, Norrell Preff of heavyconfetti.com is gone.

98
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,040
But Lonesome Cowboy...

99
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,140
Cowboy Dave, princess.

100
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,280
We are dough.

101
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,580
A few heavy confetti.

102
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,540
Queen of all the UFOs.

103
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,520
Actually, Norrell Preff is still here because he's in the background.

104
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,100
He's that background music.

105
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,520
All of the background music tonight will be Norrell Preff's steaming, sizzling guitar work.

106
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,120
And or Lonesome Cowboy Dave on the accordion as heard here.

107
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,780
Well, we could do live.

108
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,580
We could do a live rug.

109
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,900
Can you talk and play that at the same time?

110
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,780
I can't do neither.

111
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,900
No, I think perhaps...

112
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,960
What the hell is that?

113
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,040
Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave has entered the studio wearing an antique accordion.

114
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,260
I mean, a giant keyboard.

115
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,920
Oh, no, the bellows are blowed.

116
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,480
So now I have to maybe put it down or something.

117
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,220
It'll only add the kind of ambience like this.

118
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,480
Well, that sounds horrible, so put it down and shut it off.

119
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,840
No, that's enough, Dave.

120
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,200
Okay.

121
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,460
I thought you could really play it.

122
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,300
I thought I could, too.

123
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,380
Oh, you can eventually.

124
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,100
See, you don't want to waste a whole program waiting for me to get warmed up.

125
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,600
Have I a day?

126
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,960
Hold on just a second and let me read this news.

127
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,180
Okay, everyone's holding something, but it doesn't really...

128
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,480
There was this news thing that came down the pike last week and nobody said anything about it.

129
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,740
The sub-DMEs didn't say anything about it.

130
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,020
Well, the...

131
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,020


132
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,640
They're rather recalcitrant and uneager to speak their own pieces.

133
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,860
No, just the opposite.

134
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,320
And they still didn't say anything about this mass extinction in process.

135
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,420
Now, this won't be news to everybody, but...

136
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,120
Is this actually true?

137
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,860
Is this a true thing?

138
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,600
This is a true thing that I am...

139
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,620
Well, I mean...

140
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,080
I don't understand.

141
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,260
It was on CNN, so no.

142
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,460
With your little saucy-shaped shovel.

143
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,440
The answer is no.

144
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,560
It was on CNN.

145
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:47,880
Okay.

146
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,940
It said that a survey of birds and butterflies in Great Britain shows a population decline

147
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,680
of up to 71%.

148
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,700
Yes.

149
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,800
A finding that suggests the world may be undergoing another major extinction.

150
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:02,780
Mm-hmm.

151
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,560
Mm-hmm.

152
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,440
Uh, the, uh, supports the theory that the sixth big extinction in Earth's history is

153
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,820
underway.

154
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,740
And this one caused by humans.

155
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:21,500
Because for over 40 years, more than 20,000 volunteers counted each bird, butterfly, and

156
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,660
native plant that they could find in beautiful Mariola.

157
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,540
Oh, man.

158
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,540
The bird population has declined by about 54%.

159
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:53,400
Native plant species, a decrease of 28% in only 40 years.

160
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,500
Oh, man.

161
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:54,860
Quote,

162
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,660
Oh, man.

163
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,180
The bird population extinctions were recorded in all main ecosystems of Britain.

164
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,220
The authors report in Science Magazine, and a biologist with Smithsonian National Museum

165
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,820
and blah, blah, blah.

166
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,660
Sam Gornian.

167
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,980
They may not be representative of the world as a whole, but they have the best data.

168
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,260
The data supports the idea that the rise of humans over tens of thousands of years, along

169
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:24,760
with climate changes, are bringing an extinction of many species and reshaping the world in

170
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,540
ways that aren't.

171
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,640
Some are not so far from being totally, utterly and utterly understood.

172
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,340
Some are not so far from being totally, utterly understood.

173
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,180
Okay, now, wait a minute.

174
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,140
As a small bit of human interjection, just like I would like to relax your

175
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,720
lubritator, or just perhaps, you know, like if I was to pull on the top of your

176
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,780
pituitary gland or something.

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,520
Ooh, that feels good.

178
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,640
You like that tickling motion?

179
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,180
I like that.

180
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,020
Okay, now listen to this.

181
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,820
I've actually made observations because, you know, sono osopetoric.

182
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,420
I mean, I am an assyrup runner.

183
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,940
And I do watch things very carefully.

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,580
Have you noticed?

185
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,040
You don't notice because you're from Texas.

186
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:51,920
Peepers.

187
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,800
Too early, man.

188
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,860
Too early for peepers.

189
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,900
Way too early.

190
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,460
Way too early.

191
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,520
way, way, way too early for them weird southern birds.

192
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,100
Like when you're down south, those birds that go,

193
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
those ones that have that nauseating,

194
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,420
that voice,

195
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,500
way too early for the birds.

196
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:05,680
You go,

197
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,240
like that.

198
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,400
Way too early.

199
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,160
Red-winged blackbirds.

200
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,000
Everything is kind of way screwed up right now.

201
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,620
Way, way, way.

202
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,060
I went past a microwave tower the other day,

203
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,600
and I saw birds incessantly going back and forth,

204
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,980
east and west, east and west,

205
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,700
almost banging against two groves of trees,

206
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,800
coming back together.

207
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,080
There was like a silence for a second.

208
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,660
Then as they were gaining momentum,

209
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,940
they started roaring of birds.

210
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,980
What the hell were they doing?

211
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,640
They were confused.

212
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,960
This is a migration pattern,

213
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,220
and everyone is confused.

214
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,220
Mom nature.

215
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,960
Mom nature has had enough.

216
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,480
Mom nature is shrugging.

217
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,920
First hurricane in the South Atlantic.

218
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,800
What's up with that?

219
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,540
The sun is going down in different places.

220
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,360
If you say that, they think you're nuts.

221
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,040
And the...

222
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,180
Now what?

223
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,280
The sun is not really going down the way it usually does.

224
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,460
It seems to go down,

225
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,880
and then all of a sudden, a couple days later,

226
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,640
it's going down a little wester.

227
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,700
It's supposed to be going, moving more easter.

228
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,580
I mean, norther.

229
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,100
Actually, Dave, the sunlight...

230
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,620
Is not real?

231
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,160
...is decreasing from the last...

232
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,000
has decreased slightly over the last decade or so.

233
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,200
I'm telling people the dark...

234
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,320
Often people I have known, I have said,

235
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,420
the darkness is growing.

236
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,360
And they think I'm trying to be poetic.

237
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,280
What I mean is there's an actual substantial darkness,

238
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,260
almost similar to dark material,

239
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,680
which is sucking on our gonads and ripping our flesh and...

240
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,860
No, don't worry, Dave.

241
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,380
See, the Earth is slowly passing out of a cloud

242
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,320
that has prevented our intelligence from developing.

243
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,200
And soon, we'll all go insane.

244
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,140
That's...

245
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,500
However, now get this.

246
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,140
You know, there have been five extinction events

247
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,740
in Earth's history.

248
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,520
With some so severe that more than 90% of all life forms were killed off.

249
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,260
90%.

250
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,840
The largest one was when the Permian period...

251
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,720
The Permian period.

252
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,720
...ended some 250 million years ago

253
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,440
when all but 4% of all species disappeared.

254
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,640
Another famous one was the Devonian period.

255
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,280
Yes.

256
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,360
From Akron.

257
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:07,980
Yeah.

258
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,420
And almost 35% of the hipsters were extinct in one final moment

259
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,700
when their entourage moved to the harvest country or the October...

260
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,840
We are in the middle of a sixth extinction event

261
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,500
that began about 50,000 years ago

262
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,060
with the expanding role of...

263
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,360
in the world of human beings.

264
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,260
We have likely underestimated the magnitude of the pending extinctions.

265
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,660
But nothing less than the enormity of the whole event.

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,240
You think your peepers are all messed up.

267
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,140
We looked out the window and...

268
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,260
And you do need new glasses.

269
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,920
But the fossil record shows that the disappearance of many animals

270
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,600
in Australia, Madagascar, and North America

271
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,120
started about the same time that humans arrived at those sites.

272
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,200
Mmm, who'd have thunk it?

273
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,740
And gone, therefore,

274
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,380
from our beautiful North American environment

275
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,440
are such beautiful animals as the mammoth,

276
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,240
the camel,

277
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,100
the giant sloth,

278
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,160
and the Dave-raping taper.

279
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,380
The face...

280
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,980
The giant face-raping bat

281
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,020
has all but vanished.

282
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,380
The corpulation...

283
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,540
Giving us no longer any excuse for the...

284
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,740
The, uh...

285
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,520
Face-sucking?

286
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,260
Bat sperm antidote.

287
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,760
Oh, you mean the bat...

288
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,400
The bat...

289
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,160
Copulating.

290
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,600
Yes.

291
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,500
The face-copulating bat.

292
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,500
The face-abusing bats of the...

293
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:21,720
The face...

294
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:21,720


295
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,400
In northern Ohio.

296
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,860
The face-copulating bat does exist, still.

297
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,020
They're already gone.

298
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,320
I have seen them.

299
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,740
I've seen their migration patterns.

300
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,740
I've noticed their toot-whistle, the way they sing.

301
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,600
And I've even interviewed a few of them for various stories.

302
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, the good news is...

303
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,080
Lies, of course, all lies.

304
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,240
The good news is,

305
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,000
this wave of extinction caused by humans

306
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,380
could come to an end with the extinction of the humans.

307
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,420
And there's another interesting little bit of factual mail

308
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,220
that came down the pike, or news, last week,

309
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,580
which was that...

310
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,080
A hundred-foot asteroid hurtled past the Earth,

311
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,460
only 26,000 miles away,

312
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,640
the closest asteroid ever detected by astronomers

313
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,480
before it made its approach.

314
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,540
Now, they said here, friends,

315
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,700
that anything 130 to 165 feet across

316
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,900
would probably make it to the Earth's surface.

317
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,980
This one was only 100 feet across.

318
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,400
It'd probably burn up, maybe break a few windows.

319
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,820
As it tore in.

320
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,360
It was the closest recorded encounter

321
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,040
between Earth and an asteroid,

322
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,680
says Stephen...

323
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,700
who also said,

324
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,620
there certainly have been closer encounters

325
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,460
that we didn't know about.

326
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,380
And those are the ones I like to think of,

327
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,360
you know, late at night.

328
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,720
The asteroid was close enough to Earth on Thursday

329
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,340
to be visible through binoculars.

330
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,240
If it had hit Earth,

331
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
it would likely have broken up in the atmosphere.

332
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:50,860
Here.

333
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,060
And it was only discovered last Monday.

334
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,200
So what if...

335
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,580
Now, this one was small.

336
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,160
Stank.

337
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,720
What if it had been the size of a football field?

338
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,240
We'd have had three days to kiss our butts goodbye.

339
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,880
This is the voice of your alter credo.

340
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,280
Don't you know your religion is based on this folk science?

341
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,620
This is folk science.

342
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,040
You just...

343
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,720
Hey, Dave.

344
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,700
You just...

345
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,220
You can't be heard.

346
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,100
You just stepped on my punchline.

347
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,440
Oh, punchline.

348
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,100
Yes, and I just turned your...

349
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,680
I'm setting up...

350
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,460
I know.

351
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,340
He was punching me with it.

352
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,520
I'm showing...

353
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm showing you...

354
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,760
I'm demonstrating something for you.

355
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,880
I can turn...

356
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,500
I'm turning...

357
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,420
See this little knob?

358
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,180
As I turn it down, you disappear.

359
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,100
Yes.

360
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,380
Now, see, you've got to watch for my punchlines.

361
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,020
When my eyes light up...

362
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:39,260
See that gleam coming out of Reverend Stank's eye?

363
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,340
You know it's not time to pounce out with a new line.

364
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,120
But...

365
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,680
And it's a big atmosphere that almost butted its...

366
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,560
I mean, a big asteroid that almost butted its...

367
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,700
It's way into our atmosphere.

368
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,580
And it just barely went by.

369
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,640
And then it's like, oh, gosh, wasn't that wonderful?

370
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,560
We saw an asteroid.

371
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,320
It almost hit us, but it didn't.

372
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,760
Isn't that cute?

373
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:07,720
In 2002, only 1.8 million years ago, on June 21st,

374
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,800
an asteroid the size of a football field passed extremely close to Earth,

375
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,800
but remained undetected until days later.

376
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,420
This one came 75,000 miles close.

377
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,560
Would have...

378
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:21,560


379
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,280
Would have packed some major firepower had this big boulder struck,

380
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,320
comparable perhaps to the Tunguska asteroid or UFO crash,

381
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,340
which flattened 77 square miles in 1908.

382
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,540
This bare mess happened to be kind of a lightweight among asteroids

383
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,140
and wouldn't have wiped us out like the big one did, the dinosaurs.

384
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,060
We wouldn't have known what hit us.

385
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,780
But, well, the funny thing is people say...

386
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,580
That is the basis of your religion.

387
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,300
Well, now, see...

388
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,540
The nice thing is now here it's the 2,000 and millions of the future,

389
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,240
and we could just nuke it out of space.

390
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,820
See, if our astronomers saw this thing coming, we'd send some brave Americans up...

391
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,000
What's that waiting for?

392
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,460
And they'd nuke it out of space.

393
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,300
It's a much larger object than the ones you've referred to,

394
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,360
and this is the basis of your religion.

395
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,100
And, no, we're waiting for aliens to come and do all of that stuff.

396
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,560
Well, they think a bunch of alien ancestors are going to come and save them

397
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,580
when Punga smacks into the hard cakes.

398
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,200
And they also think that...

399
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,840
What's it called?

400
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,280
Lunga?

401
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,280


402
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,280


403
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,380
Limpelotomy?

404
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660
The bowling lane area and stuff?

405
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,300
They think everything's going to have to be recreated.

406
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,180
You know, not incestually or ancestrally.

407
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,160
I mean, incestually.

408
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,060
You know, if...

409
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,340
Use the same chromosomes over and over.

410
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,660
No, we won't do that.

411
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,720
If one of them big rocks did hit and didn't kill us all,

412
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,820
the insurance companies would have a hell of a time covering the damages, you know.

413
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,180
Well, why do you think the insurance companies are recovering all their assuragements

414
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,760
and all these things that are going on in the banking world?

415
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Why do you think the Bilderbergers and the Schmelweifers

416
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,940
and all these different groups are coming together?

417
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,660
Why do you think the secret societies are fomenting so strongly?

418
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,980
Well, what I'm saying is the good news is

419
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,660
if one of those asteroids were to hit,

420
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,660
it would kill them too.

421
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,860
They, even the Bilder...

422
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,760
Even your buddies, the Bilderbergers

423
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,840
and the guys that run the world secretly from the mountains in Switzerland,

424
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,560
deep underground,

425
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,680
even they would be wrecked.

426
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,760
There's a thing going on in the sausage oil industry.

427
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,220
Because...

428
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,660
Because, friends, it's hard to...

429
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,580
Even if we had a rocket ready to launch when the thing was coming three days from now,

430
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,700
it's kind of hard to hit something going six miles per second with a rocket.

431
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,880
And it's very easy for something going six miles per second.

432
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,160
It's very easy for something to hit all kinds of stuff.

433
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,320
If you were going six miles per second,

434
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,860
you'd probably have to catch up with your own thinking.

435
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,120
That's the robust idea being passed around in the great channels of thought nowadays.

436
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,400
This is what's coming down from the elder ones.

437
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,100
Oh, they've already made documentaries about the animals that will replace us

438
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,380
100 million, 200 million years from now.

439
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,660
Well, we've all got replacement animals right now.

440
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,940
That's the problem with everything.

441
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,420
At the end of the future...

442
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,520
It's too easy to make them.

443
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,980
At the end of the future news report that we saw,

444
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,200
the future is wild.

445
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,720
After 200 million years, after humans are removed,

446
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,340
giant land squids will migrate across a new pangea

447
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,940
and tool-using squid monkeys will...

448
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,520
Yeah, now that makes sense.

449
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,200
...swing through the trees.

450
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,420
...swing through the trees,

451
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,540
prompting a new future, we can imagine,

452
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,440
with these squibbons evolving up through...

453
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,180
The only culture.

454
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,120
...squidus erectus primos quidthropocus,

455
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,700
becoming squavemen and finally the squen and squimen...

456
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,280
The squenettes.

457
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,580
...who will build a new civilization after we, the humans, screw up.

458
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,300
We'll never build any culture beyond that which can be built in a petri dish.

459
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,400
And you want to know why?

460
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,460
Because the very nature of their midbrain itself,

461
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,140
which is what...

462
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,340
...gives them their raison d'etre's and, you know,

463
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,020
the other things you can put in your cereal.

464
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,000
What kind of raisins?

465
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,520
The midbrain?

466
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,340
Raisin d'etre's.

467
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,500
Raisin d'etre's.

468
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,500
And that's why they think they're in their midbrain,

469
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,920
but actually they're floating around somewhere way, way south of there and stuff.

470
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,340
Mm-hmm.

471
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,520
That's very scientific.

472
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,180
America's new condom, condominium.

473
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,360
Any hypotenuse?

474
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,380
Pineal sands.

475
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,620
For those of you scratching the exterior.

476
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,640
Like, like that.

477
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,100
Okay, I'm gonna...

478
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,760
It's very, very, very new.

479
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,620
I do a lot of...

480
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,640
You want to try one little lick on the side.

481
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,020
If you lick both sides of it,

482
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,100
your head begins to...

483
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,000
I can't lick that flat.

484
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,140
...fabric, yeah?

485
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,100
Mm-hmm.

486
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,020
Dave, have you ever heard of Alex Jones?

487
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,400
Oh, yes, of course.

488
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,060
I met Alex Jones at the brewery the other night.

489
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,700
He passed me some documents,

490
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,260
and I passed him some information.

491
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,860
Here he is driving around Texas.

492
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,860
I didn't even get a moment.

493
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:41,980
Texas.

494
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,640
No talk about politics or religion.

495
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,600
This is all the involvement of enemy propaganda

496
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,260
rolling across the picket line.

497
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,060
Lay down!

498
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,600
Lay down, G.I.

499
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,640
Lay down, G.I.

500
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,680
We saw it all through the 20th century.

501
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,740
And now in the 21st century, it's time to stand up and realize

502
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,200
that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.

503
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,760
We should not submit to dehumanization.

504
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,340
I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.

505
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,240
I'm concerned with the structure.

506
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,440
I'm concerned with the systems of control.

507
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,420
Those that control my life and those that seek to control it even more!

508
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,060
I want freedom!

509
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,540
That's what I want, and that's what Jason wants!

510
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,120
It's up to each and every one of us to decide.

511
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,260
It's up to each and every one of us to turn loose of just some of the greed,

512
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,420
the hatred, the envy, and yes, the insecurities.

513
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,460
Because that is the central mode of control.

514
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,260
Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty,

515
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,140
our liberty, our destiny.

516
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,740
We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.

517
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,660
Start challenging this corporate slave state.

518
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,040
The 21st century is going to be a new century.

519
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,960
Not the century of slavery, not the century of lies and issues of no significance

520
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
and classism and statism and all the rest of the modes of control.

521
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,120
It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and something right.

522
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,080
What a bunch of garbage, liberal, democrat, conservative, republican.

523
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,340
It's all there to control you, two sides of the same coin.

524
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,740
Two management teams bidding for control, the CEO job, a sh**y of lies.

525
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,820
I'm sick of it, and I'm not going to take a bite out of it.

526
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,600
Do you got me?

527
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,840
Resistance is not futile.

528
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,280
We're going to win this thing.

529
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,900
Humankind is too good.

530
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,580
We're not a bunch of underachievers.

531
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,260
We're going to stand up, and we're going to be human beings.

532
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,580
We're going to get fired up about the real things, the things that matter.

533
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,380
Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.

534
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,640
Well, that's it. That's all I got to say.

535
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,540
It's in your court.

536
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,300
It's in your court, baby.

537
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,740
It's in all of our courts.

538
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,420
And we're all playing left-handed baseball, dynamites.

539
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,240
The entire fabric of our culture is...

540
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,260
The entire fabric of our culture is...

541
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,200
It's been dismissed and refabricated.

542
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:50,720
The front court.

543
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,180
The place is very, very far.

544
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,100
Blimper court.

545
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,100
Labor court.

546
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,000
Labor court?

547
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,160
No, there's no more labor court.

548
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,700
Blinky court.

549
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,700
There's nothing but corporeal disenfranchisement.

550
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,260
People leaving their bodies for no apparent reason.

551
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,560
People reappearing for no apparent reason.

552
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,060
Bodies forming. Bodies reforming.

553
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,200
Psychic entities growing their own bodies.

554
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,860
New psychic entities growing new psychic entities growing more bodies.

555
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,000
A long silver thread.

556
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:24,460
Hey, speaking of new bodies, have you seen how fat Kirstie Alley has gotten on the cover of the Star magazine?

557
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,840
I can't believe it.

558
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,360
I can certainly believe it.

559
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,460
Kirstie Alley and I, boy, we had a thing going, I think it was in 1979.

560
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,480
Was she a Scientologist then?

561
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,260
Or were you a Scientologist?

562
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,900
She was modeling neck braces at the Land Down Under Stars Cafe.

563
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,100
It was a convention for the new neck braces.

564
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,180
There are also psychic implants and transceivers.

565
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,420
Right, right.

566
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,100
We've marketed for a while, none of them sold.

567
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,580
And now she's Old Navy in it or whatever it is.

568
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,620
I don't know, perhaps she's...

569
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,780
Her bloomers look like they would be much...

570
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:56,860
Elephantine.

571
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,840
Elephantine is a way of putting it.

572
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,800
She was perfect about 40 pounds ago.

573
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,420
She was diagrostic.

574
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,520
Back around 180, when she was about 180 or so.

575
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,640
That's probably just right.

576
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,980
Well, they say once you start accumulating all that detritus in your brain,

577
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,360
it makes your body want to jump out of its flesh.

578
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,620
Well, I don't know if they say that.

579
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,440
I've said that a couple of times.

580
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,020
Can you really blame the body?

581
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:23,940
I mean...

582
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,380
With so much detritus floating around in the immune system.

583
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:26,600
Exactly.

584
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,720
I don't know, it doesn't have to do with the church though, I guess.

585
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,040
Well, she was really hot back when she was a subgenius in the early days.

586
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,420
Was she originally a subgenius?

587
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:34,700
Yeah.

588
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,140
And then Bob...

589
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,920
See, what happens to you?

590
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,540
You know, let her down and L. Ron picked her up and now nobody can pick her up.

591
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,680
For another face of the church.

592
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,200
The price of the crowd.

593
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,960
The price of slack.

594
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,280
It's often like somebody's cheeks in a different way, if you know what I'm saying.

595
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,180
Her face looks like a butt.

596
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,460
I'm sorry.

597
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,920
She very seldom can pick herself up.

598
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,480
When pinks are slack-jawed, it is with bovinity and boredom.

599
00:23:59,520 --> 00:23:59,760
Yes.

600
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:09,080
When we are slack-jawed, it's with slack slaked with fully sated lusts.

601
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,440
A happy talker.

602
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,120
Enlisting the smiles of everyone around.

603
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,020
Some of their brains are on slant style.

604
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,140
Look at the delightful carvings in this one's head.

605
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,220
I can smell my spine, Dr. Rowlett.

606
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,620
I can smell my own spine.

607
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,920
It's the fluids.

608
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,700
The fluids to be sucked.

609
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,860
There will be new cerebral fluids going around on next day.

610
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,200
Suckle of them.

611
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,860
Don't expect your old cerebral fluids to get you through that magnetic door, pal.

612
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,600
You're going to have to have a brain made of bubbles and feisty-ness.

613
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,300
You're going to have to have the mega-anche in the top of your pants.

614
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,080
But friends, you can have that slack.

615
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:03,200
That you so desire, so easily, by just, well, tuning in to this radio station.

616
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,680
The subgenius radio ministry, our of slack.

617
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,420
Twist that tepid torpor into a mynapis dynamic.

618
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,500
Dynamic dynamo of superhuman emotions and thoughts and beliefs.

619
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:23,400
Jump right out into the new negative world with your own pair of socks directly forced onto your body by one of the eliminator monitors.

620
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:30,760
Look at the hair grow on the back of your neck as you continue to repeat, repeat, lie after lie.

621
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,880
Or join.

622
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,060
Or die.

623
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,020
Join us, humans, before it's too late.

624
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,680
We're authorized to blaspheme by the gods themselves.

625
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,940
Run it, baby.

626
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,860
Run it, baby.

627
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,600
Well, now there's some serious umbrage.

628
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,000
There's some serious umbrage being taken by thousands.

629
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,540
Umbrige!

630
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:53,600


631
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:06,760
Not only what you say, Dr. Reverend Ivan Stang.

632
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,620
And Princess, we are Doe Connie of People.

633
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,760
People. Yeah, people, sure.

634
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,780
Sure, but this.

635
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,240
But this.

636
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,500
This is ten times worse.

637
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,800
Ten times worse.

638
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:25,120
There was a time in South Africa that people would put flaming tires around people's necks if they dissented.

639
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:34,480
And in some ways, the fear is that you'll be necklaced here.

640
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,680
You'll have a flaming tire of lack of patriotism put around your neck.

641
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:51,360
Now, it's that fear that keeps journalists from asking the toughest of the tough questions and to continue to bore in on the tough questions so often.

642
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,460
And again, I'm humbled to say I do not accept myself for this criticism.

643
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:04,080
A war is real mud, real blood, real screams of the dying and real death.

644
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,440
That's war.

645
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:19,800
Well, what's going on to a very large extent, I'm sorry to say, is a belief that the public doesn't need to know.

646
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:32,960
Limiting access, limiting information to cover the backsides of those who are in charge of the war is extremely dangerous and cannot and should be accepted.

647
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,000
And I'm sorry to say that up to and including the moment of this interview.

648
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,340
That overwhelmingly it has been accepted by the American people.

649
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,560
And the current administration revels in that.

650
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,040
They relish that and they take refuge in that.

651
00:27:52,120 --> 00:28:05,600
The belief went so strong in both the political and military leadership in the current war effort that those who control the images will control public opinion.

652
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,260
They realize.

653
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,500
They realize what an entertainment-oriented society ours has become.

654
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,540
Therefore, in one way of looking at it, it's quite natural that they would say to themselves,

655
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,180
Hey, we've had the Hollywoodization of the news.

656
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,940
We've had the Hollywoodization of almost everything else in society.

657
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,380
Why not the Hollywoodization of the war?

658
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:28,880
The war is a war.

659
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,100
It's a war.

660
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,440
It's a war.

661
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,320
It's a war.

662
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,620
It's a war.

663
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,620
It's a war.

664
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:54,300
We don't know if that's going to be the Crow dominant.

665
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,360
The things that we think have been somewhat well-thought-out have been theTrue Crisis.

666
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,360


667
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,820
And if it's the war then I feel, I could write a hundred more of these operations.

668
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,360
How many Hannah give when you kill three weapons in your first go to tet which clearly was this Pinocchio project in the country we lived in, angry own comrade Shakti,

669
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,840
people caЙed talka outward from puppet forbade statement in his manifest to you he is going to work without everyone.

670
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,680
How much did you fail to stop him?

671
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:05,680


672
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,960
How did you create a war if you didn't have face of those...

673
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,420
He played bad.

674
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,040
Real mud, real blood.

675
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,580
Real screams of the dying and real death.

676
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,960
That's war.

677
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
That's Amore.

678
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,480
Actually, that was Norrell Preff.

679
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,420
Actually, that was Dan Rather.

680
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,540
Rather and a Lather, it was called.

681
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,720
The music was by Norrell.

682
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,180
Rather and a Lather.

683
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,340
Are you related to that royal blood?

684
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,240
Do you have the Sangreal, my friend?

685
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,780
I have the blood of the Yeti coursing through my brains.

686
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,060
Do you have the royal purple blood of Jesus cracks in your veins?

687
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,580
The blood of the Jesus of the Himalayan mountains, yes.

688
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,800
The Jesus of the abominable Jesus.

689
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,180
What about the Jesus born in Mount, I mean, buried on Mount in France?

690
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,140
The name of the Mount Shasta, the Bigfoot Jesus.

691
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,880
So you were related to the Jesus born on Mount?

692
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,400
I read that.

693
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,260
He's on Mount Shasta?

694
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,420
The Mount Shasta Jesus.

695
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,420
Sanguine McGuire.

696
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,640
Just call me Sanguine McGuire.

697
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,100
Call me Sanguine, baby.

698
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,920
I'm bloody and ready to fight.

699
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,300
Hey, look at my eye.

700
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,780
Cut my eye, will you, Rocky?

701
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,280
I mean, Snocky, whatever your name is.

702
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,400
Just you there.

703
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,120
Come over there and suck my eye.

704
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,220
Okay, okay, okay.

705
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:27,720
Okay.

706
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,780
Hey, it's going to puff up pretty bad here if you don't get a razor blade in there.

707
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,580
Here, here, here.

708
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,780
Oh, feel free to go right into the eye socket there.

709
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:35,960
That's right.

710
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,340
Now, just remove the old occipital gland there.

711
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,660
Burn out the gland at the end of the year.

712
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,860
What do they call the occipital gland?

713
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,180
Yeah, just take off that whole area there.

714
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,320
You don't need the brain cells anymore.

715
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,420
Keep on digging past the skeletal sinus thing.

716
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,800
You're both the members of Skull and Bones, a secret society of the air.

717
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,880
What does that tell us?

718
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,960
Not much, because it's a secret.

719
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,420
Is there a secret handshake?

720
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,340
Is there a secret code?

721
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,100
I wish there were something secret I could manifest.

722
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,820
322, secret number?

723
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,640
There are all kinds of secrets, Stimple.

724
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,580
It's a secret.

725
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,300
It's a secret.

726
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,820
There are all kinds of secrets.

727
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,060
Completely alienated.

728
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,900
All this dread.

729
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,540
Purely symbolic.

730
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,420
The powers that be want us to be passive observers.

731
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,740
And they haven't given us any other options

732
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:55,580
outside the occasional, purely symbolic participatory act of voting.

733
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,820
You want the puppet on the right or the puppet on the left?

734
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,680
What a bunch of garbage.

735
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,220
Liberal, Democrat, conservative, Republican.

736
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,180
It's all there to control you.

737
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,400
You can't control me.

738
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,520
We're all the same size and the same coin.

739
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,220
Two management means.

740
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,600
Bidding for control.

741
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,340
The CEO job of Slavery Incorporated.

742
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,020
No.

743
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,020
It's an acumen.

744
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,760
It's very, very an acumen.

745
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,840
Oh, look, the children are coming up with the flowers now.

746
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,300
They've got their red bandanas on and they're waving the red carnations.

747
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,740
I don't know if it's time to make some more milk or time to fight for a workers' republic

748
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,160
where everyone shares everything except for the sausage.

749
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,240
I'm just going to shake this little fly.

750
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,980
I'm going to shake it up in the air.

751
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,280
Oh, that's not the real flag.

752
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,460
You've got to remember to keep the real flag high.

753
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,440
The secret flag, wear it in your pants.

754
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,040
That's right, in the crack of your underwear.

755
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,460
What about this pom-pon?

756
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,260
Would that be okay?

757
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,080
Well, you can stuff that into your knee socket

758
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,820
and make it look like you've got a very, very puffy ship sitting there.

759
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,160
Okay.

760
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,640
You're fine.

761
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,300
Okay.

762
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:54,780
Okay.

763
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,440
Keep those high steppings going.

764
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,860
I don't want the baton to drop.

765
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,500
Once again, I'm the least bit.

766
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:04,960
I'm the least bit.

767
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,100
I'm the least bit.

768
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,360
I'm the least bit.

769
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:06,640


770
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:07,740
I'm the least bit.

771
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,380
I'm the least bit.

772
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:08,380


773
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,780
Huh?

774
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:11,820
Huh?

775
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,740
Something must have lost the translation.

776
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,560
Somebody must have made a terrible mistake.

777
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,400
I don't know what to do now.

778
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,540
Oh, my God.

779
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,540
I look out on my window, and it looks like the sky is filled with ships.

780
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,500
Large, large ships.

781
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,360
Huge.

782
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,520
I don't know what to say.

783
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:35,680


784
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:35,860
Does somebody help?

785
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,520
I'll put a note or something back.

786
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,160
I don't know.

787
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,240
I'm looking at water skiing.

788
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:39,700
I...

789
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,940
Subgeniuses are spiritual gypsies

790
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,940
discovering new short-duration personal saviors

791
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,560
constantly enforcing them down the throats of other subgeniuses.

792
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,420
Wide-brimmed.

793
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,740
Their philosophical journey will take them in and out of many religions and sciences.

794
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:56,960
Too tolerant.

795
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,100
One day, they may be undergoing water baptism

796
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,720
at the good old whitewashed rural primitive Baptist church

797
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,860
and the next night, drinking goat's blood at a black mass for...

798
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,180
Hell.

799
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,860
...13 years.

800
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,660
But all the while, they know it was not the Baptist church that saved them.

801
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,800
It was not the Scientology church.

802
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,500
Nor was it him.

803
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,520
It was, friends.

804
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,020
Nor was it even the church of the subgenius that saved them.

805
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,180
Because it was Bob.

806
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,200
Bob alone that saves you.

807
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,180
It is he that walked that hot pavement,

808
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,780
sweat streaming down his face,

809
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,180
his neck tied too tight,

810
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,600
his briefcase too heavy,

811
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,420
that whosoever believe it, then him.

812
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,760
And Bob, not the subgenius church,

813
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,500
and him.

814
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,280
Whosoever believe it, then Bob.

815
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,800
Should not go through

816
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,300
and should have everlasting slack.

817
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,940
Praise Bob.

818
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,720
My God.

819
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,900
My God, man.

820
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,820
Bob is back again.

821
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,260
After another, another long journey into abstract night.

822
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,020
After another journey into forceful self-rejection.

823
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,400
Denial of his own mind.

824
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,360
Denial of his own mind.

825
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:08,880
Denial of his own powers.

826
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,900
Bob has resurrected himself like that salivary Jesus you wear on your sink.

827
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,360
Are you related to the real blood?

828
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,900
The royal blood?

829
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,940
The holy blood?

830
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,080
The sangreal?

831
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,560
No?

832
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,780
Are you related to Bob?

833
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,380
He's like a goat with many breasts, you know.

834
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,880
He is very, very friendly.

835
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,800
I think is the way you put it.

836
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,360
He is friendly.

837
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,560
It's not the word for him.

838
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,120
He's not the way you talk.

839
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,120


840
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,120


841
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,120


842
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,800
You little swine.

843
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,940
You're all gonna have to work for it.

844
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,160
You're down there in front.

845
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,780
The one with the droopy eyelids.

846
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,040
I'm up here now.

847
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,620
Let me see the palms of your hands.

848
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,280
Okay.

849
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,520
Yes.

850
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,780
You do not bear the mark, my child.

851
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,280
Have you done your exercises?

852
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,200
Yes.

853
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,220
Have you repeated your credo night and day?

854
00:35:59,500 --> 00:35:59,560
Every day.

855
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,320
Every day.

856
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,980
Have you flagellated freely?

857
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,260
Yes.

858
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,040
Let me see the marks.

859
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,280
There's no marks on you.

860
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,340
There's no marks on you.

861
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,340


862
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,340


863
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,340


864
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,900
In fact, it looks like those fake tattoos.

865
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,840
Get down on your knees and pray to the place.

866
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,420
Oh, Bob.

867
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,620
I believe in a world created...

868
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:25,640
You both were members of Skull and Bones, a secret society at Yale.

869
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,740
What does that tell us?

870
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,680
Yeah.

871
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,680
What does that tell you, buddy?

872
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,000
Yeah.

873
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,060
What does that tell you, huh?

874
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,480
Yeah.

875
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,140
What can it tell you?

876
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,320
They're both members of the Skull and Bones.

877
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:33,660
Yeah.

878
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
They're all thick as steams.

879
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,180
You know, like two fingers stuck together, one on each different eyeball.

880
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:37,840
You know what I mean?

881
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,320
They're all one.

882
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,320


883
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,320


884
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,320


885
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,320


886
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,320


887
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:38,800
They're both connected.

888
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,620
Far, far too connected.

889
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,140
Yeah, it's a deep...

890
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,940
Jesus takes a throne and he turns it upside down.

891
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,560
And oops, there comes a smile.

892
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,600
He making me laugh now.

893
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,300
Look, he's wearing clown slippers.

894
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,860
I can't believe our Lord looks so good in those things.

895
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,800
Man, look, he can make his smile go all the way from his ear to ear, literally.

896
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,320
Hey, son of God, son of man, you can't believe that.

897
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,320


898
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,640
Jesus takes a throne.

899
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:08,640


900
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,160
He makes a lot of stuff, right?

901
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,220
Jesus takes a throne.

902
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,780
Oh, look, man.

903
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,500
He turns it upside down.

904
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,940
He's making all kinds of lights come out of the top of his head.

905
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:15,700
Oops.

906
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,240
There comes a smile.

907
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,800
They look like highway patrol lights or the police cars that are coming every day.

908
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,260
They'll send those things to Jesus and then he smiles.

909
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,100
Calm down, Terry.

910
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,180
I can't because I'm thinking all about how we can make Jesus smile.

911
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,660
Jesus has to go to the bathroom now.

912
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,780
Can't you leave the poor guy alone for a second?

913
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,700
He's still part human.

914
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,300
Just sit down for a second and stop tugging on his pants.

915
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,640
He takes care of things.

916
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,380
But, my child, I really have to go, literally.

917
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,500
Well, you can go if you have to go.

918
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,420
I may make you go with me if you know what I mean.

919
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,880
Oh, I don't know about that.

920
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,340
He has to go.

921
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,020
He's making a snowman.

922
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:05,280
He's going to the bathroom.

923
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,160
He's going to the bathroom.

924
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,280
My mother has a bit of laptops growing on it.

925
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,780
It's time for Elmo's Salivating in the Hour of...

926
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,260
Slack!

927
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,000
Lots of it going on.

928
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,900
Lots and lots and lots of slacking.

929
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,760
It is possible that there may eventually be slack.

930
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,880
There may be a new thyroid gland built into you.

931
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,300
There may be a new heart muscle.

932
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,180
Sitting out utopia in a world without slack.

933
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,400
Is that what you're doing, friends?

934
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:48,780
That's right.

935
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,480
Have we finally reached, you know, I mean, this is the best of all possible worlds.

936
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,680
And yet there's no slack.

937
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,760
Yeah, there's no button to push to end it either.

938
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,320
And we're trying as hard as we can.

939
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,380
Thanks to unlimited food supplies,

940
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,880
artificially shortened jams,

941
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,600
gestation periods,

942
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,880
and the perfect religion,

943
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,840
the Earth, only 50 years after X-Day,

944
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,100
will house 100 billion human bodies,

945
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,380
plus almost 1 billion unruptured subgeni.

946
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,300
Quite a healthy soul harvest for the Elder Gods,

947
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,320
don't you think, boys and girls?

948
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,740
Yeah, I see them now.

949
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,940
All over again, five times as big,

950
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,260
like a diamond man taking up continents,

951
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,160
you know, rolling back like the carpet on your front lawn

952
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,440
when the landscaper comes,

953
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:31,880
and now...

954
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,440
Friends, if you believers aren't giving money,

955
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,540
all you're doing is believing.

956
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,800
Oh, we get it.

957
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,280
First, you want to see the eternal salvation.

958
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,400
Then you'll pay.

959
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:46,920
Oh, yeah.

960
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,280
Yeah, you'll end up with that excuse nailed to your back

961
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,420
with a sharpened telephone pole in normal hell.

962
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,140
My friend, and when you yank that off,

963
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,780
they'll just hammer it in with a bigger nail.

964
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,880
Are you going to yank off with Bob, friend?

965
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,360
You're going to allow the nails to be driven into your skull

966
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,920
at that last final moment.

967
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,520
The passion of Bob, indeed.

968
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,320
You know what they did to Bob?

969
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,480
You know what they actually did to him?

970
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,880
The blood was on the floor.

971
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,380
He was cursing an ancient Aramaic.

972
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,160
They tried to nail him.

973
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,460
But Bob was the Jesus that didn't get nailed, my friend.

974
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,300
That is the miracle of it.

975
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,820
The beautiful miracle.

976
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,380
Beautiful, beautiful.

977
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,140
Friends, when you line Bob's pocket with love offerings,

978
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:31,880
that helps you to...

979
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,540
to slide between the power sanders of justice and karma.

980
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,740
It greases you up for a faster skid

981
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,520
straight through that chute of white light

982
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,640
and into the before life itself.

983
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,080
So you just kind of pop right out

984
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,520
rather than having to squeeze through.

985
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,060
Limestone pockets getting puffy.

986
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,120
Pop or not.

987
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,340
Friends, that plunge to subgenius heaven

988
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,700
is going to be just like a water slide at the wet and wild.

989
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,540
Pull the lever.

990
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,300
Down you go.

991
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,300
At first, ass guard might seem kind of hot and stuffy.

992
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,040
What with all the flames around you.

993
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,500
Fellas with tails.

994
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,840
But those are angels in uniform.

995
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,800
You know, that's a big joke they have down there.

996
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,320
Yeah, they're fallopian tubes with wings.

997
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,820
They're chasing you, man.

998
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,100
Human, human looking, human looking.

999
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:21,780
Yeah, they have faces.

1000
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,640
They're like, they want to bring you in.

1001
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,360
Make a new...

1002
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,060
Friends, there are plenty of quality souls

1003
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,220
frying in normal hell right now

1004
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:31,860
because they can't do it.

1005
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,780
They couldn't follow the goose-stepping guidelines

1006
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,200
of their gods,

1007
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,960
but they thought that they should.

1008
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,540
Untold billions.

1009
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,520
Horribly tortured for no greater sin

1010
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,900
than that they wanted slack

1011
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,140
but didn't believe they were supposed to get it.

1012
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,800
If getting slack is a sin, my friend,

1013
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,160
then you better pray that someday

1014
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,760
we all become mortal sinners.

1015
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,260
Mortal as we all are.

1016
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,140
Yes, here we are.

1017
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,700
Okay.

1018
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,560
How can you give?

1019
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,780
We are ready and waiting for your question.

1020
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,120
Because we are subgenius,

1021
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,420
we do go very low.

1022
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,620
Well, I'm not actually a member, but they are.

1023
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,960
How low can you go is a question

1024
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,680
that's never been fully explored.

1025
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,820
Yeah, if you've been through basic,

1026
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,960
then you can understand the show.

1027
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,520
What is the subgenius?

1028
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,940
Or what does it mean?

1029
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,880
What does it mean?

1030
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,240
I gotta tell you, then, you know...

1031
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,300
I almost started talking...

1032
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,740
I can't see on the babies behind.

1033
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,620
It means it's the same as having a

1034
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,340
baseball glove radar strapped to your butt.

1035
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,380
I think you got it.

1036
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,180
I think you got it.

1037
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,760
It's like, Bob Dobbs, huh?

1038
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,440
Just remember, the one thing that's most important

1039
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,660
to subgeniuses everywhere,

1040
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,240
the one thing you can't forget,

1041
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,560
a subgenius must have slack.

1042
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,120
Of all other things,

1043
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,760
a subgenius must have slack.

1044
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,280
That is the motivator.

1045
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,300
Here for the subgenius.

1046
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,820
So if you're one that has felt like you needed this thing,

1047
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,900
that you didn't know how to explain what it was,

1048
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,300
and yet there it was...

1049
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,160
Because of the subgenius, huh?

1050
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,100
...grabbing, completing you.

1051
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:14,620
What is that?

1052
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,060
Well, it makes you jump five or ten inches higher,

1053
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:19,720
that's for sure.

1054
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,600
A subgenius must have slack,

1055
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,560
but in order to get the slack...

1056
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,620
So clip those coupons.

1057
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,640
...the subgenius must disengage from the conspiracy

1058
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,760
and be under his own genius.

1059
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:30,900
So you're saying that you're not sure

1060
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:30,900


1061
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,080
Well, that's what I'm saying.

1062
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,080


1063
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,080


1064
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,080


1065
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,080


1066
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,080


1067
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,080


1068
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,000
Well, let's see right here, Dr. Shlaker-Laker,

1069
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,980
where you're moving the top of the skull with the...

1070
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:36,940
Do you have the right saw?

1071
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,340
That doesn't even look like a saw to me.

1072
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,120
It looks like a nail file.

1073
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,780
I don't see how we're gonna get much done here.

1074
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,120
It's gonna take a half an hour to remove the top of this guy's skull

1075
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,340
if we're gonna find anything out.

1076
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,260
Oh.

1077
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:50,960
Ah! Ah!

1078
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,480
Oh, my God, the patient is still, uh...

1079
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,420
He's not anesthetized or...

1080
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,620
Hey, man, what...

1081
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,980
What are you doing to my head?

1082
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,080
You wouldn't put a nail file on my head, man!

1083
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,100
Well, that was a memory you didn't want to have, wasn't it?

1084
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,260
Do you remember the third time they tried to make the implant?

1085
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,100
The third time.

1086
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,100
Yes, they were using a different kind of material.

1087
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,440
It was... What was it?

1088
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,460
Laser-sort of thing, yes. No.

1089
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,640
No, it doesn't work anymore.

1090
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,460
I'm cultivating a dog's head on my vulva.

1091
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,720
I'm cultivating a dog's head on my vulva.

1092
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:35,120
That's right, you're cultivating a dog's head on your vulva.

1093
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,500
That's what we're trying to create here.

1094
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,020
Think. Think.

1095
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,780
You can use your mind.

1096
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,540
This is the voice of the Inceptor Locutor.

1097
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,360
I'm speaking to the top of your neck.

1098
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,480
I mean, I'm speaking through your skull.

1099
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:57,400
Your skull is actually now a magnifying membrane, an amplifier, if you will.

1100
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,840
A speaker, a great, great speaker.

1101
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,580
Speakers.

1102
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:08,500
Make the naps at vulva with your mind.

1103
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,240
This here is the quiet part.

1104
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,440
That was a terrible dream.

1105
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,000
I don't ever want to dream anything like that again.

1106
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,360
I was in a laboratory and you were there.

1107
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,660
It's all right. It's all right.

1108
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,800
And you had a saw.

1109
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,740
It's all right.

1110
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,120
And then it was a nail file.

1111
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,080
Yes, yes, yes, I know.

1112
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:37,360
And they were trying to extract the royal parts of my jelly, you know, in my brain.

1113
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:37,980
It's going to be all right.

1114
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,560
But you promised me he'd come.

1115
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,340
With a tenon and a ram.

1116
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,780
I'm on the receiving end alone.

1117
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,200
You said she was on the receiving end and she wasn't kidding.

1118
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,860
Yes.

1119
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:55,160
Don't you think we'd both be a little more comfortable without that gun in your hands?

1120
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,780
I'm perfectly relaxed.

1121
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,460
I can feel the tension mounting like the approach of an electrical storm.

1122
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,280
Now just raise your hands above your shoulders, sweetheart, like a good little man.

1123
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,160
Was the late Melvin Bishop an amateur Martian picture fan?

1124
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,860
It's already answered.

1125
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,680
That movie picture film, The Medium News, belonged to Melvin Bishop.

1126
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:26,020
His wife was in bed, wrapped up on a couple of pillows with a 10-inch stiletto stuck in her back.

1127
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,400
Right behind.

1128
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,240
I knew you were a private det...

1129
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:29,620
Pick up.

1130
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,080
She knew.

1131
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,160
We both knew.

1132
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,160
Pick up.

1133
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:32,860
They were all...

1134
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,040
Pick up.

1135
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,180
Pick up.

1136
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,440
...private detectives.

1137
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,780
Where can the Dobstown beat every night from Tuesday to Wednesday?

1138
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,140
And where can the Dobson's be?

1139
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,500
The following week, one day off for bad behavior, a couple of gags of sauce.

1140
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,440
Head down to the old bowling alley and see what's shaking, but I'm still wearing my badge and I still got my gun.

1141
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,640
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

1142
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,720
It's been a long time waiting here, man.

1143
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,220
There's like about 400 people outside of the door.

1144
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:07,780
Ahem.

1145
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:07,960


1146
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,100
I...

1147
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,880
I actually had reservations.

1148
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,760
Not about, you know, coming here, but I had reservations to go here.

1149
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,400
Yeah, well, I was waiting a long time, too, you know.

1150
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,160
Well, they started a riot and then they had to call the Black Force police.

1151
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,100
Yeah, I know.

1152
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,720
They cracked some heads.

1153
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,340
They also cut some spines and eliminated some...

1154
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:25,540
Oh, really?

1155
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,480
Yeah, that vestigial thing back there that...

1156
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,020
Ah.

1157
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,420
...they don't want to get too magnetic.

1158
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,740
You don't have it, do you?

1159
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:34,340
I...

1160
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:34,940
I...

1161
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,260
Do you?

1162
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:37,940
I...

1163
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,940


1164
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,940


1165
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,940


1166
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,940


1167
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,940


1168
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,940


1169
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,940


1170
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,940


1171
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,940


1172
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,940


1173
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,940


1174
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,940


1175
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:42,860
I...

1176
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,300
I...

1177
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:44,780
I...

1178
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:44,780


1179
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:44,780


1180
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:44,780


1181
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:44,780


1182
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,800
Of course I don't have a vestigial tail.

1183
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,340
I have one.

1184
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:55,160
I have a four-foot-long vestigial tail, which I have to hide in the bottom of my shirt,

1185
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,140
my Oxford slippers.

1186
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,320
It's very sexy.

1187
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,760
I tie it up with twine.

1188
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,400
Very interesting.

1189
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,640
Why, well, it actually hurts when I ride the public services.

1190
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,240
Oh, I can imagine.

1191
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:03,840
Yeah.

1192
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,500
Yeah, of course.

1193
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,180
It takes me a half an hour to get to work.

1194
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:06,860
Of course.

1195
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,540
Of course.

1196
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:07,920
Of course.

1197
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,040
You don't want that special tailored clothes, do you?

1198
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,100
No fair, baby.

1199
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,940
You know the rules.

1200
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,980
Go, baby.

1201
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,020
Nice shot.

1202
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:29,620
Hmm.

1203
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,740
Ping Pong.

1204
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,800
Ping pong. Yeah.

1205
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,500
He's got to be kidding me.

1206
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,320
Time. The holidays. Time. Time. The holidays.

1207
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,900
A bug house. A bug house. A bug house. A bug house.

1208
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,400
Me too. Everything's so mixed up.

1209
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,300
These buildings. I'll never get out.

1210
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,120
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1211
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,320
What will happen?

1212
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,120
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1213
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,400
What will happen?

1214
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,960
Deterioration. Chronic conditions. Limit hope for some.

1215
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,100
Others may go home tomorrow.

1216
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,060
Modern mental institution. The therapy of busy hands.

1217
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,860
First step. Power is so important.

1218
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,380
The sick. The sick. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.

1219
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,740
And lower the mentally ill. Life became too much for them.

1220
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,460
They just left me alone. I'm going to send you to the hospital.

1221
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,840
I think they'll be able to do you...

1222
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,980
Why do you think they're going you this way?

1223
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,420
The patient's mental disorder.

1224
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,060
Well?

1225
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,280
Schizophrenia. Paranoid склад.

1226
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,940
Schizophrenia. Paranoid struggle.

1227
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,060
Paranoid sleep. Paranoidpool.

1228
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,900
Insulin shock.

1229
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:50,620
Insulin shock.

1230
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,480
Schizophrenia.

1231
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,300
Schizophrenia.

1232
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,240
Electro shock.

1233
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,040
Electro shock.

1234
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,880
Electro shock.

1235
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,580
Electro shock.

1236
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:55,700


1237
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,100
Loss of contact with reality.

1238
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,900
Loss of contact with reality.

1239
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,640
Loss of contact with reality.

1240
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,340
Loss of contact with reality.

1241
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,620
Disordered minds.

1242
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,800
Disordered minds.

1243
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,000
Disordered minds.

1244
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,040
Disordered minds.

1245
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,540
Reinforced shock treatment move closer to reality.

1246
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,560
Boredom is always an enemy of the mentally ill.

1247
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,180
Ping-pong is always fun.

1248
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,860
Ping-pong is always fun.

1249
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,440
Ping-pong is always fun.

1250
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,620
Books mean so much to so many.

1251
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,540
Religious services in the chapel offer reinforced shock treatment.

1252
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,040
Well learned.

1253
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,980
What a difference it makes.

1254
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,280
What a difference it makes.

1255
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,560
What a difference it makes.

1256
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,060
And George comes too.

1257
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,600
A cigarette from the doctor.

1258
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,180
A cigarette from the doctor.

1259
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,860
And Fred's hand is steady.

1260
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,480
And Fred's hand is steady.

1261
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,440
So this is it.

1262
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,380
Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick fear.

1263
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,420
Not wrong.

1264
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:48,820
Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick.

1265
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,980
But I am well and I know it.

1266
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,880
And most of them are happy.

1267
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,660
I'm home.

1268
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,180
All the time.

1269
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:05,720
Rejected.

1270
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,160
Rejected.

1271
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,040
He finally really did it.

1272
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,700
Rejected.

1273
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,280
Rejected.

1274
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,300
You maniac!

1275
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:13,960
Rejected.

1276
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,540
Rejected.

1277
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,720
You blew it up!

1278
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,660
Rejected.

1279
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,420
I'll damn you!

1280
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,380
Rejected.

1281
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:23,440
God damn you all to hell!

1282
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,640
Rejected.

1283
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,920
The alternative, flee!

1284
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,100
Flee America!

1285
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,060
The Americans are coming!

1286
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,160
The Americans are coming!

1287
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,140
are coming. George Bush

1288
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,640
had an answer to that and he said,

1289
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,640
screw voting, let's roll.

1290
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,580
What was the phrase?

1291
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,020
He volunteered to go on a beer run

1292
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,160
and ended up president

1293
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,300
of the United States.

1294
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:50,680
Man.

1295
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,000
Some people have all the connections.

1296
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,420
Even that spaceship,

1297
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,580
Pioneer 10,

1298
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,040
fled America. It fled

1299
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,700
the whole damn solar system.

1300
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,120
I was glad to see somebody finally get off.

1301
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,320
But now

1302
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,820
it's alone, flying

1303
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,020
through the void, no doubt

1304
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,820
to be found a billion years

1305
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,440
from now by some robot

1306
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,680
who'll make a fortune selling it on

1307
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,600
eBay as the last thing

1308
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,660
handmade by living

1309
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,900
creatures, the extinct human

1310
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,060
race. It does

1311
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,740
get depressing and I'm at the point

1312
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,020
where I didn't pay any attention. I avoided

1313
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,720
the news for three years

1314
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,920
until 9-11 because I

1315
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,720
decided that the news was either

1316
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,280
evil or

1317
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,420
a sin.

1318
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,700
It's a slight difference,

1319
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,380
but we don't know which one it is yet.

1320
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,360
We do know that the news is

1321
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,080
surrealism

1322
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,600
and we have to get used

1323
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,820
to the idea that at any moment

1324
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,580
anything can

1325
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,560
happen, both the

1326
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,580
imaginable and the

1327
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,360
unimaginable. Sometimes

1328
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,660
the impossible, but more

1329
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,180
often the unlikely.

1330
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,100
Both are

1331
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:03,520
uncertain.

1332
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,880
I don't know.

1333
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,300
Yeah, and we're going to be discussing this.

1334
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,740
Were we in the middle of a discussion before this?

1335
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,520
Yes. What exactly

1336
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,080
were we talking about? Chocolate.

1337
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,260
And Bob Dobbs?

1338
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,540
This is terrible.

1339
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:46,540


1340
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:46,540


1341
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:46,740
katjav designed

1342
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:46,740


1343
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:46,740


1344
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,700
很

1345
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:03,700


1346
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,540
man

1347
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,680
senor

1348
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,680
four

1349
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,220
to

1350
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:03,680
d

1351
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,040
Great Acres is the place to be

1352
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,740
Farm livin' is the life for me

1353
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,380
Land spreadin' out so far and wide

1354
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,520
Keep Manhattan, just give me that countryside

1355
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:25,820
The charge

1356
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,400
The stars

1357
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,100
Fresh air

1358
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,060
Times Square

1359
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,920
Elvis... Elvis Hitler, friends.

1360
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,020
Elvis had sangria. He was related to Jesus Christ.

1361
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:58,820
That's the thing nowadays, Stang, is to be related to Jesus Christ.

1362
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,700
Elvis Hitler, friends. We've also been listening to a whole lot of Nora Lowe.

1363
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:13,840
Nora L. Preff tonight. You can download Nora L. Preff's killer guitar work and cut-ups from heavyconfetti.com.

1364
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:23,720
The general subgenius doctrine is accessible at www.subgenius.com.

1365
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,820
Quite accessible to the masses, unfortunately.

1366
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:32,800
You can also, for those without access to the internet, you can write for free information

1367
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,380
from this post office box number I'm about to give you.

1368
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:43,580
That's post office box 204206, Austin, Texas 78720.

1369
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,820
That's Elvis coming at you!

1370
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,740
That's box 204206, Austin, Texas 78720.

1371
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,520
You can write to me, Stang, at subgenius.com.

1372
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,160
But why would anybody want to do such a thing?

1373
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:09,700
Why would anybody want to do such a thing as write the last of the diamond stags?

1374
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,900
Actually, you'd be surprised.

1375
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,140
It's a sick man.

1376
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,020
It's about Bob.

1377
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,300
He's very vindictive.

1378
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,960
It's about Bob.

1379
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,840
They said he did his politics.

1380
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:17,660
Bob loves you.

1381
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:23,240
Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a fateful trip

1382
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:29,160
That started from this tropic port aboard this tiny ship

1383
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,780
The main was a mighty sailing man, the other was a mighty sailor,

1384
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,100
The skipper brave and sure,

1385
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:41,140
Five passengers set sail that day for a three hour tour,

1386
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,400
A three hour tour.

1387
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,240
Ah, it makes me wonder.

1388
00:56:54,300 --> 00:57:00,280
Now the ship's aground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle

1389
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,680
With Gilligan,

1390
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,840
The skipper too,

1391
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:10,180
A millionaire and his wife,

1392
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,920
The movie star,

1393
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,800
Oh, and the rest,

1394
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:21,800
They're here on Gilligan's Island.

1395
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:51,280
Oh, and the rest,

1396
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:51,320


1397
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:51,380


1398
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:51,380


1399
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,640
The skipper too,

1400
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:13,020
The skipper too,

1401
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:13,320
The skipper too,

1402
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,580
The skipper too,

1403
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,420
The skipper too,

1404
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,140
The skipper too,

1405
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:32,780
The skipper too,

1406
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,340
The skipper too,

1407
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,900
The skipper too,

1408
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,320
The skipper too,

1409
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:55,940
Oh, and the rest of them are here on Gilligan's Island.

1410
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:05,640
And they're here on Gilligan's Island.

1411
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:18,360
And, friends, that was, in fact, Little Roger and the Goosebumps doing Stairway to Gilligan's Island.

1412
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,200
Before that, Elvis Hitler did Green Haze.

1413
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:27,020
We heard some recordings of yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, preaching at last Starwood.

1414
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:32,080
You might check out Rosencomet.com for information on that.

1415
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:42,440
In the background and around the edges, we heard lots of bits by Fernand and Anderly Murr,

1416
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:50,540
and New Monet, Ed Fred, Matt Hive, Heart Ignition, and everything else was by Norrell Preff.

1417
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,200
You are Bob.
