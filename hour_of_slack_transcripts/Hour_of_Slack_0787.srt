1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
And now, the subgenius hour of slack!

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,560
What?

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:35,920
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station.

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,020
And only in the city of...

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,580
Should any other show be heard from a contact in the course of the show,

6
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,900
the listener is advised to remain on the contact list of your own initial positions

7
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,240
in the event of any material interference on the listening device being in the old broadcast.

8
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,160
First arrangement.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,880
The first arrangement.

10
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:03,960
To sit down slowly, making sure the head muscles don't move too much,

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,220
causing the brain to move around in the brain case.

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,780
Making sure all the...

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,920
The brain's are connected so that no one knows.

14
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,360
No one knows.

15
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,860
Oh, yes, dear friends.

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,160
Welcome to another subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

17
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,900
This one is actually, what, number 787.

18
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,340
That's all.

19
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,860
And, uh...

20
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:47,920
Well, we finally finished moving the subgenius archives into the new tomb castle.

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,780
But I'm getting married in four days.

22
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,700
We did everything back-asswards, friends.

23
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,980
Princess, we, and I.

24
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,160
First, we bought a house.

25
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,800
Then we went on our honeymoon to Amsterdam.

26
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,640
Then we got married.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Next, we're gonna start dating.

28
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,240
And I guess, uh...

29
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,640
Someone will introduce us.

30
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,600
Wendy, so...

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,900
Since I've gotta go, uh...

32
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,280
Get ready...

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,780
Get fit for my tuxedo and, uh...

34
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,120
All that kind of crap.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,720
Uh, romantic crap, friends.

36
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,160
Uh...

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,720
See, I've been there, done that.

38
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,580
It's my second time, too.

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,440
Although Princess We is very excited.

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,100
She's never been married before.

41
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,940
And she's never gonna be married again.

42
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,200
Because, my friends, I'm gonna announce to you right now...

43
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,240
In a subgenius on-the-air wedding ceremony...

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,760
That I'm gonna bird-dog that stuff.

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,440
You hear me?

46
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,100
I'm gonna bird-dog that stuff.

47
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,020
So don't even think about it, boys.

48
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,420
And subgenius girls.

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,340
Don't even...

50
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,660
This is...

51
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,180
Reverend Stang is bird-dogging that stuff.

52
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,480
And, uh...

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,600
And in so doing, I've gotta rush through this show.

54
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,860
Of course, there's tons of Einstein Secret Orchestra...

55
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,440
Uh, recorded from, uh...

56
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,160
The DeVival at Euclid Tavern.

57
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,120
And maybe some ranting.

58
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,760
And tons of Brandon...

59
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,740
New, uh...

60
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,460
Saint N.

61
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,100
And Helena Handbasket.

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,960
And, uh...

63
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,820
Little Theodore.

64
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,080
I've got some Little Theodore here that, uh...

65
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,260
You probably haven't heard.

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,600
That's wonderful.

67
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,080
And, uh...

68
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,440
Oh...

69
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,820
Lord only knows what all.

70
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,580
Oh, Morning Forty Federation.

71
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,920
That's this, uh...

72
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,180
Sloppy band in New Orleans that I kindly like.

73
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,340
But, friends, this is, after all, the hour of slack.

74
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,600
And who better to explain certain...

75
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,340
Heretofore unexplored areas of slack and slacks

76
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,860
than the great discovery of our friend Pope Phil Monty,

77
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,400
the pope of all northern England.

78
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,140
And, uh...

79
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,680
Phil Monty discovered this local artiste

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,340
by the name of Fat Harry White.

81
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,920
And so, dear friends, once again on the Hour of Slack,

82
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,020
we are so pleased to have you here.

83
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,020


84
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,180
We are so pleased to present to you

85
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,960
slack as...

86
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,200
explored...

87
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,320
the conceit of slack

88
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,820
as entertained by the great

89
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,480
Fat Harry White.

90
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,340
Praise Bob.

91
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,580
Baby.

92
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,780
Slippin' into my new skin-tight jumpers

93
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,860
for you, honey.

94
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,920
And dressin' up...

95
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,060
for the leaders...

96
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,000
for the love.

97
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,400
Come over here, Maureen.

98
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,640
Hey!

99
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,300
I'm talkin' about dressin' up right reminds me

100
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,240
of when I worked at Slack's R.O.s.

101
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,840
You know, eh?

102
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,400
Next to Jessop's, the grocer's.

103
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,660
It was the first time I met Foxy Fiona,

104
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,460
my very sexy lady friend.

105
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,120
Never forget it, she walked up to me at the counter

106
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,900
and in a very sexy voice,

107
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,020
asked me what I had to offer in the trouser department.

108
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,880
Apparently, she wanted to buy some flared crimpling slacks

109
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,000
for her long-legged, tight-fitting, slacks.

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,760
It was my great-father's birthday.

111
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,700
Very partial to bright colours, it was.

112
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,320
Anyway, I told her I was almost certain

113
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,880
I'd have something with a good length

114
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,180
that would satisfy her,

115
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,120
and asked her to follow me upstairs.

116
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,020
Well, after going through me trousers,

117
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,240
she surprised me by saying that she really fancied

118
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,040
the large pink pair that I had.

119
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,740
Not only did they hang well,

120
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,080
but she thought they looked really attractive,

121
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,160
particularly the way they swung about loosely

122
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,080
when I walked.

123
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,060
Mind you, she wasn't too sure of the size at first,

124
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,820
and had me lay them out on the counter

125
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,420
so she could measure them up.

126
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,120
She also ran her fingers admiringly down the crease.

127
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,380
Well, she decided to go for it,

128
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,340
asked me how much.

129
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,580
I says three and a half quid.

130
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,440
She asked me rather cheekily if I would go down.

131
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,380
Well, you know, thought about it, long and hard,

132
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,180
decided to drop them for her,

133
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
which I did there and then.

134
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,760
What fun, backwards and forwards, over the counter.

135
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,340
A good bit of haggling, and no mistake.

136
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,560
And I was thinking about this, right,

137
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,940
because I'd been back to that shop,

138
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,860
because the weather's beginning to change a bit,

139
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
getting a bit parker, isn't it?

140
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,820
Well, I tell you what, I went out the other morning,

141
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,820
and me buns was so cold it started to change colour.

142
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm not kidding, when me very sexy lady friend,

143
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,200
sexy Sam, saw me coming towards her,

144
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,100
me purple hat sticking out me coat,

145
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,300
she told me to get it covered immediately.

146
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,860
So I said, I'm going to the shop to buy a hat, a fur one.

147
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,940
Well, when I got there, you know,

148
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,780
I asked sexy Salea,

149
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,500
the very sexy lady friend hat assistant,

150
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,000
to show me what she had, you know, in her fur department.

151
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,600
She said she'd be only too pleased

152
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,300
to show me what she had downstairs,

153
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,100
and led me to the basement,

154
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,540
where I could see everything she had on full display.

155
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,960
I tell you what, you wouldn't believe how much she had.

156
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,060
She had every kind of fur that you could imagine.

157
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,360
I was going to go for a fox fur,

158
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,100
but as soon as sexy Salea said she had a particularly nice beaver

159
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,380
that I might be interested in,

160
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,940
immediately changed me mind.

161
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,020
Well, you know, after getting it out for me,

162
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,840
I've got to say I've never seen such a big bushy one like it in all my life.

163
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,680
Well, when I asked her if she could, you know,

164
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,880
try it on for size, she said,

165
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,640
I might find it a bit tight at first,

166
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,740
but if I buried my head deep enough,

167
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,380
then it should stretch a little to accommodate me fully.

168
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,160
Tell you what, she weren't wrong,

169
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,720
and when I looked at it in the mirror,

170
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,140
you know, sideways on,

171
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,900
I could see it had slid in perfectly.

172
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,080
Well, you know, after that, she then said she'd

173
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,220
summat round the back that I might be interested in,

174
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,880
led me into the storeroom,

175
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,880
to show me a selection of gloves that had just arrived.

176
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,980
Well, I was obviously interested,

177
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,560
but as I didn't know what size I was,

178
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,980
I had to get sexy Salea to measure my hand.

179
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,620
Well, after asking me to, you know,

180
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,940
give her a finger, which I promptly did,

181
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,960
she then asked me to stick my thumb up,

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,240
no problem at all.

183
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,620
Within minutes, she declared,

184
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,620
as she was holding her measuring tape,

185
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,240
that I was extra, extra large.

186
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,460
Well, then she had to take a phone call,

187
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,720
but while she was on the mobile,

188
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,880
I took the opportunity of rummaging in her box

189
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,960
until I found the perfect fit,

190
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,340
and when I withdrew,

191
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,060
sexy Salea nodded appreciatively

192
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,280
at my great big leathery pair.

193
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,920
Dressing up for the ladies, yeah.

194
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,100
I'm a-looking in the mood for love.

195
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,700
Oh, yes, Fat Harry White, dear friends.

196
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,680
And from his album,

197
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,400
well, actually, it's Fat Harry White

198
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,120
and the Love Limited Orchestra,

199
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,560
from his album,

200
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,080
Mmm, Baby,

201
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,980
on Anxious Records,

202
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,680
thanks to Pope Phil Amante.

203
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,200
Oh, yes, friends, you're listening

204
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,920
to the subgenius radio ministry,

205
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,620
Hour of Slack,

206
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,680
the voice of the church of the subgenius,

207
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,900
the only real religion,

208
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,460
because it's the only one that admits

209
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,460
it's so totally full of crap,

210
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,660
that makes it pretty much the only valid religion.

211
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,580
It's the only valid one, don't you agree?

212
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,900
Anyway, you can always get more information

213
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,520
about this church by checking us out

214
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,600
on the internet, www.subgenius.com.

215
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,640
And what's it about?

216
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,840
Well, it's about the great super salesman,

217
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,160
J.R. Bob Dobbs, who discovered in 1953

218
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,300
that there was a conspiracy of normal people

219
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,700
robbing away the slack of all the weirdos,

220
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,660
abnormals, disbelievers,

221
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,940
or those who'll believe anything,

222
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,800
which is what we're looking for, friends,

223
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,420
those who can join us in this nameless fight

224
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,400
against that conspiracy of normal people.

225
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,020
And how are you gonna get slack,

226
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,260
and how are you gonna fight the conspiracy?

227
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,560
Here's our secret.

228
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,800
We won't tell you.

229
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,880
It's up to you,

230
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,720
because only you know what's best for you.

231
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,020
So, praise God,

232
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,380
I don't even know what's coming up next.

233
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,900
I gotta get this show done in a hurry,

234
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,540
so I can go on to some serious, serious slack.

235
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,080
I understand that when you get married,

236
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,340
you can have sex,

237
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,320
and I've heard a lot about that.

238
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,600
I was just so anxious to check it out.

239
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,780
Well, so I'm going to let the older tapes

240
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,120
take care of the rest of the show.

241
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,540
Praise Bob.

242
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,980
Bob, Bob, Bob.

243
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,260
I heard Mojo almost had mutiny in New Zealand

244
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,940
because he kept spewing Bob.

245
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,960
And we have people that work for the company

246
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,760
who actually go to church and stuff.

247
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,700
Well, I guess that's their problem.

248
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,700
And they got absurd by the effective way.

249
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,920
They got the effective Bob upon their cataclysms?

250
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,580
Yeah.

251
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,860
Oh, my dearth.

252
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,500
So they felt threatened by Bob.

253
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,360
Their God.

254
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,620
Their God.

255
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,520
They felt like their God wasn't standing a chance

256
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,760
against Bob Dobbs.

257
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,380
They might be listening right now.

258
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,600
They were feeling a little sick.

259
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,120
A little, you know,

260
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,200
there's some people that have the kind of God

261
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,860
that needs help from his followers.

262
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,340
A weak, pathetic, sad God

263
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,200
who can't take a joke,

264
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,360
who can't take an insult,

265
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,480
and whose followers have to thrash those

266
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,940
A God whose hands and feet wounds have never healed,

267
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,960
nor that long-kneed spear in the side knicks.

268
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,240
Then you got old Bob.

269
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,480
They'd been festering for thousands of years,

270
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,260
and even before the hams came out.

271
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,140
No, old Bob, he's a better sport,

272
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,000
and his followers are a pretty good sport.

273
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,820
They listen to him.

274
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,500
Check it out.

275
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,260
Bob's being tortured.

276
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,620
Some sport with hams right now.

277
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,880
They average about 27, 28.

278
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,620
Inches.

279
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,440
Oh, my God.

280
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,520
That's a new record.

281
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,820
Well, it's old for brownies.

282
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,100
Oh, I see how you could get it that way.

283
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,720
The Muscovites are all girls whose first few marriages didn't work out,

284
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,640
and they decided to get back into uniform.

285
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,600
Fortunately, we sell enough cookies to keep a roof over our heads.

286
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,320
March, march, march, march,

287
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,340
over our heads.

288
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,760
Door to door.

289
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,000
No, most of the girls sleep right here in the barracks.

290
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,320
No, no.

291
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,440
Dobbs Town.

292
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,100
Cookies.

293
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,820
You sell the cookies door to door.

294
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,440
Oh.

295
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,840
Bob cookies.

296
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,260
Yes.

297
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,560
We go out every night at the stroke of midnight.

298
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,180
Oh, stroking at midnight.

299
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:00,660
Yes.

300
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,260
Well, there's no time during the day.

301
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,400
I give my lectures during the day.

302
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,360
Oh, I can see.

303
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,020
I teach my girls the basics of a happy, successful life.

304
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,940
Things like cooking and...

305
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,040
No, dum-dum.

306
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,440
Things like alimony.

307
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,020
Oh.

308
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,260
And then one week each month...

309
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,140
And shaving their vaginas for Pazuzu.

310
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:20,800
Uh-huh.

311
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,400
Each girl has a tent all to herself,

312
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,220
and each one has her own message.

313
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,600
A blanket, bedroll, and a flashlight.

314
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,800
The girls just love it.

315
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,560
Oh, that sounds very interesting.

316
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,980
Where do you have these in Kansas?

317
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,540
Fort Dix, New Jersey.

318
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,560
Fort...

319
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,300
There you go, Dave.

320
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,880
Fort Dix.

321
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,780
Man, Dave, he...

322
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,220
Fort Dix.

323
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,320
Dave exploded there.

324
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:42,960
I'm sorry.

325
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,900
I had a bad vision.

326
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,440
Dave, that was pretty weird there.

327
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,380
It was intense, Chaz.

328
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,460
It scared us.

329
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,420
It was like right in my prefrontal lobe.

330
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,880
Your mother sucks Bob in hell.

331
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,020
I could see it right in the front of my head.

332
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,980
Stang and I were both actually like scared when you did that.

333
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,200
Well, I'm sorry.

334
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


335
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


336
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


337
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


338
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


339
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


340
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,960
I thought it was going to come out of my head and leap onto the turntable for the love of

341
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,300
Dobbs.

342
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,240
Like a Harryhausen animation.

343
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,540
Yeah, like one of those...

344
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,600
It's pulling Dave's forehead open from inside and leaping out from little...

345
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,240
You're homunculus.

346
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,420
With kind of a Dave look to it.

347
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,260
Tiny little man, come out.

348
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,340
And a big, prehensile...

349
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,380
Tiny little man, come out.

350
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,300
...like, tentacle-like appendage, baby.

351
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,300
The world is a ghetto.

352
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,200
I'm not a ghetto.

353
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,200


354
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,200


355
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,200


356
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,200


357
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,200


358
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,200


359
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,200


360
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,200


361
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,200


362
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,200


363
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,820
Remember, folks, in Sector 49...

364
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,200
But you could put a nice little horn soundtrack to it and it's not so bad.

365
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,140
Come on, baby.

366
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:34,700
Yeah.

367
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Get on down.

368
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,020
When the windows are open a little bit.

369
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,080
Sit down next to me.

370
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,020
Let me tell you about old Bob.

371
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,980
See, just like you can't imagine me as Shakin'.

372
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,060
You need a light.

373
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,880
Like, all I see is hot buttered corn right there.

374
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,820
You know what I'm saying, bro?

375
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,200
I mean, I can't see you as like the dulcet tone, you know, any one of them kind of singers,

376
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,860
you know, like...

377
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,200
I'm not a good singer.

378
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,200


379
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,200


380
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,200


381
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,200


382
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,200


383
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,220
I'm a good singer.

384
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,220


385
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,580
What, you mean I'm not doing the Isaac Hayes thing right?

386
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,880
Well, I just can't see you.

387
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,880
Hey, baby.

388
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,880
Hey, baby.

389
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,900
Well...

390
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,960
The Isaac or Barry Jones...

391
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,560
Hey, I just made a musical joke.

392
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,440
Hey, Chad.

393
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,200
I just made a musical joke.

394
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,800
I said, the Isaac or the Barry Jones...

395
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Hey, baby.

396
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,400
My baby, baby.

397
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,580
He's my baby.

398
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,420
Sector 49.

399
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,160
Necks will be shaved at 3 p.m.

400
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,780
The world is a ghetto.

401
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,380
Ring my bell, baby.

402
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,080
There will be no forehead paintings.

403
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,800
There will be no absurd behavior

404
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,880
among the Lungerlesions and the Bungerhesions.

405
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,880
The world is a ghetto.

406
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,440
Lesions.

407
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,900
There'll be no smoking in the gas chambers.

408
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,620
There'll be no puffing in the town of hogs.

409
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,040
Please go to the restroom before you are strapped to the table.

410
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,460
Run slowly.

411
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,060
Do not walk with your head lifted or your eyes skyward,

412
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,400
but run slowly to the nearest convenience area.

413
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,880
Step on stopping blue line.

414
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,660
If your family wishes to witness your execution,

415
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,180
make sure they...

416
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,860
They have the pink backstage palace before they enter the death chamber.

417
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,880
Security to aisle B.

418
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,180
The Kmart special tonight is a floundering of ham,

419
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,260
some pieces of old-estute periodical from the period before this propaganda...

420
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,640
The world is a ghetto.

421
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,700
Something wrong.

422
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,360
That is true.

423
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,980
Ah, Dr. Muffy, the walls are clean now.

424
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,620
All the blood's been washed into the sewer.

425
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,340
The old box is a ghetto.

426
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,500
All the barbed wire's down now,

427
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,820
and everything looks like it used to look here in Cleanville.

428
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,480
Before the bungalows exploded.

429
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,660
I don't know if that's really true.

430
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,780
I think we still have problems here in Topstown.

431
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,040
It's a very, very deep cycle.

432
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,700
It's a logical problem.

433
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,260
Dobbstown is a ghetto, baby.

434
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
The world is a ghetto.

435
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,340
That's terrible to see.

436
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,440
Dobbstown is this world.

437
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,540
Ah.

438
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,180
You ain't in the world until you've been to Dobbstown.

439
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:45,180
And you can't escape the world until you have escaped from Dobbstown.

What's your story?

449
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,140
Watch as it chooses to be your business code.

450
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,560
Is it a game of the overwhelmingly better,

451
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,200
or is it a game of a Bunun worthy,

452
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,000
How about some subgenius techno?

453
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,140

459
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,080
Do we trust Mr. Conney?

460
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,740

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,740
Mr. Conney?

463
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,220
Divine domestic deviation.

464
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,000
Conney is our inspiration.

465
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,420
Our lovely leader in fighting love.

466
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,980
This is Mr. Conney.

476
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,220
Sister Connie.

479
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:19,400
Likewise, in the realm of subgenius techno, we now experience Lampre Systems' latest,

480
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:27,380
which is copped off of alt-binary slack from their new album, Rave Till Bedtime.

481
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,540
This is Lampre Systems' Brain Hat.

482
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,900
Stand by for mind control.

483
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,400
Rave Till Bedtime.

484
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,260
Rave Till Bedtime.

485
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:36,500
This spore penetrates the flesh and devours the body from within, turning it into a human fungus.

486
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,200
I've got images in my brain I'll never get out!

487
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,300
Rave Till Bedtime.

488
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,380
Rave Till Bedtime.

489
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,320
No 9,000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted the information.

490
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:59,940
We are all, by any practical definition of the words, foolproof and incapable of error.

491
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:12,060
I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed, or numbered.

492
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,260
Have you ever jacked in? Have you ever wired tricked?

493
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,800
Brain is gone.

494
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,840
Lampre Systems.

495
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,620
And...

496
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,220
Friends, you may have been wondering what this beautiful music in the background,

497
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,800
has been throughout this subgenius radio-media ministry of slack.

498
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,880
This is a band called Final Back, from here in Ohio, northern Ohio.

499
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,100
Final Back.

500
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:10,060
The name of this album CD is Operation Coop Strap, or Co-op Strap.

Oh, praise Bob.

505
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,360
And now, for the great Morning Forty Federation.

506
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,960
Alright, boys.

507
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,780
Yes.

508
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,400
, I'm a drunk, a drunk.

509
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,620
I miss you.

510
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,460
Mom, but I'm a drunk, a drunk.

511
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:30,680
I love you, Mom, but I'm a drunk, a drunk.

512
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:37,420
Spend money, Mom, cause I'm a drunk, a drunk.

513
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,140
Just send me money for a bottle or two.

514
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,920
And then I'll tell you that.

515
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,220
Woo!

516
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,440
I miss you, Mom, but I'm a drunk.

517
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,460
Matt Sozial invited me.

518
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:01,520
Lonely American Dwarf is in town.

520
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,460
Men of everything.

521
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,460
Why?

522
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,900
There's more.

523
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,020
Well, you treated me well

524
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,360
And you fed me my grease

525
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,680
It's not your fault, mama

526
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,420
That I can't stay clean

527
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,040
Hey, I'm not shooting dope

528
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,420
And I'm not snorting speed

529
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,420
So won't you send me about $40

530
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,440
For a little of what I need

531
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,300
You heard me

532
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,700
Just send me money for a bottle or two

533
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,460
And then I'll tell your dad

534
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,280
I love you

535
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,500
Come on, kid

536
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:32,600
I'm on a million and a thousand and two

537
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,120
Yeah

538
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,280
Yeah

539
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,720
Yeah

540
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,060
Yeah

541
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,360
Yeah

542
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:40,400
Yeah

543
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:40,680
Yeah

544
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,020
Yeah

545
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,020


546
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,020


547
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
Sorry, mom

548
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,300
But I'm a drunk

549
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,980
A drunk

550
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,880
I love you, mom

551
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,200
But I'm a drunk

552
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,660
A drunk

553
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,820
I miss you, mom

554
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,300
But I'm a drunk

555
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,960
A drunk

556
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,040
Send money, mom

557
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,460
Cause I'm a drunk

558
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,560
Drunk

559
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,060
Drunky donkey

560
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,760
I'm

561
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,560
Drunk

562
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:32,940
Drunk

563
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,380
Drunk

564
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:36,600
Drunk

565
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,800
Drunk

566
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,000
Drunk

567
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,060
Drunk

568
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,100
Drunk

569
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


570
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


571
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


572
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


573
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


574
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


575
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


576
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


577
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


578
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


579
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


580
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


581
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


582
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


583
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,100


584
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,160
Drunk

585
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,580
I need a little beer, a little wine, a little hard liquor.

586
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,360
But none of that's important, mama.

587
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,940
What's important is that I love you.

588
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,500
You love me too?

589
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,360
I love you too, baby.

590
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,440
Your papa was the same way.

591
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
Oh, mama, that means so much to me.

592
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:18,560
I love you too, baby.

593
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:29,900
What the fuck?

594
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,340
What the fuck?

595
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,620
What the fuck?

596
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,260
What the fuck?

597
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,800
What the fuck?

598
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,400
So now I ski and watch TV.

599
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,880
Of course, that's a lot more fun and relaxing.

600
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,160
That's what I really want to do with my time.

601
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,960
Art gets old when no one pays you or even understands.

602
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,440
What's the point?

603
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,000
Unless I was going to do it just for me.

604
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,060
But I'd really rather just ski and watch TV.

605
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,980
Of course.

606
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,400
That's a lot more fun for me.

607
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,280
And I might as well have fun.

608
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,520
Because that's what life's for.

609
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,200
You know, grab more of a gusto and all that.

610
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,620
And I'm alive now.

611
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,160
But someday I'll have to die.

612
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,960
And then I'll be dead for a long time.

613
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,820
For a long, long time.

614
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,560
For a long, long, long, long time.

615
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,560
For a fucking forever in fact.

616
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,960
So I might as well ski.

617
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,080
And watch TV.

618
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,080
Now, while I have the chance.

619
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,560
Don't have time to waste.

620
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,340
On art.

621
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,680
And I don't believe in God.

622
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,040
I'm not that dumb.

623
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,160
So what's art even for if you don't get paid?

624
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,800
And I'm sick of torturing myself.

625
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,200
And of wondering if it's done yet.

626
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,800
And I'm sick of hanging out with all those dumb flakes.

627
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,240
Who think they're so smart.

628
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,300
And I might as well just listen to the music that I grew up with.

629
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,500
That's what I'm doing.

630
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,920
The only music that ever really moved me.

631
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,560
And who's stuff's just a trend.

632
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,680
It's not real.

633
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,440
And now I can get all those old great songs again.

634
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,840
On CD.

635
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,820
Cause they sound better.

636
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,780
And last longer, I think.

637
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,640
Oh, I'm so glad to be alive.

638
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,280
In this modern age.

639
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,620
And that's why I don't want to die.

640
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,060
But there's not a whole lot I can do about that now.

641
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,100
Except maybe eat more vegetables.

642
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,560
And I think I better marry my girlfriend.

643
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,080
Cause it's such a risk nowadays.

644
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,280
Even though I'm not one of those people.

645
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,340
And I'm probably safe.

646
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,100
But you can never be too sure.

647
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,720
And so we can marry.

648
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,880
And ski.

649
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
And watch TV.

650
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,220
Together.

651
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,460
And feel free and happy.

652
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,180
Without having to worry about art.

653
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,600
What a pain.

654
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,540
Glad I'm through with all that.

655
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:05,780
And now I've got all I could really reasonably expect to get out of life.

656
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,720
Anyway.

657
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,020
Anyway.

658
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,460
Anyway.

659
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,280
Anyway.

660
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,680
Anyway.

661
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,660
Anyway.

662
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,100
Anyway.

663
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,900
What the fuck.

664
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,440
What the fuck.

665
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,800
What the fuck.

666
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,120
What the fuck.

667
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,100
What the fuck.

668
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,300
Anyway.

669
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,520
Anyway.

670
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,920
Anyway.

671
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,520
What the fuck.

672
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,360
Anyway.

673
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,260
Little Theodore from his album

674
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,100
Idiots Are Closer To God.

675
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,040
Truly a subgenius anthem.

676
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,680
You can contact Little Theodore

And for that matter

693
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,760
you can write to Subgenius Foundation

694
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,800
for that free information.

697

Dallas, Texas

698

75214.

699
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,020
And now back to the Euclid Tavern

700
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,440
in Cleveland

701
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,000
where that

702
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,680
D-Vival with Einstein's Secret Orchestra

703
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,280
is already in progress.

704
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,120
Now we can get back

705
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,640
to what we started at doing

706
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,940
which is saving souls

707
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,100
from themselves.

708
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,800
Yes friends

709
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,160
we're going to do

710
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,160


711
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,400
something to save souls

712
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,220
from themselves.

713
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,060
To save people from the false

714
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,700
slack that they chose

715
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,280
by default, just by ignorance

716
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,160
following the man

717
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,900
just because they didn't recognize

718
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,040
the power of their

719
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,200
own slack.

720
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,680
And slack friends

721
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,060
when you truly

722
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,000
take the attitude of slack

723
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,860
you have a power that the

724
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,080
Pope of the Vatican would kill for.

725
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,360
And has killed for.

726
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,160
The power to fail.

727
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,620
The power to fail my friends.

728
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,800
If we were geniuses

729
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,880
we'd call it the Church of the

730
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,660
Genius.

731
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,900
But this is the kind of church

732
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,260
that's a little easier to qualify for.

733
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,100
As the great

734
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,960
subgenius Pareto

735
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
whoever the hell he is once

736
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,080
said, give me a

737
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,640
fruitful arrow

738
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,980
anytime full of

739
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,920
seeds bursting with

740
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,020
its own corrections.

741
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,900
You can keep your sterile

742
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,840
truth for yourself.

743
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,940
And friends it's true

744
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,600
false prophecies

745
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,100
abound everywhere.

746
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,200
For instance, everybody

747
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,840
thought that whoever got the

748
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,960
most votes would win.

749
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
Prophecy

750
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,400
failed.

751
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,800
Sorry days are

752
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,400
gone here again.

753
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,600
Mr. Big Dick Cheney

754
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,400
says it's time for lots more

755
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,080
nuclear power.

756
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,560
See who we got on the board.

757
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,560
We got Tom Lisa Rice. She works with

758
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,500
Exxon. We got Cheney.

759
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,200
He works with Huffer Puffer Pelley and

760
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,300
Swank Incorporated.

761
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,100
We got Dim Char and Dimwit

762
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,800
working for the oil companies.

763
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,720
We got oil, nuclear power.

764
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,500
We got the

765
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,240
Caesars.

766
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,980
We got a

767
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,220
DeC Constitution properly

768
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:12,420
being dealt.

769
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:12,420


770
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:12,420


771
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:12,420


772
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,160
We got an

773
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,600
oil and gas

774
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:13,600


775
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:13,860
We gotクコ

776
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:13,860


777
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,080
power runs.

778
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,080
What did I

779
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,460
say?

780
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,840
One, two, three

781
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,140
Boa's

782
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,140


783
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,140


784
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,140


785
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,040
But just to stay alive with the other man

786
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,140
One, two, one, the other man

787
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,880
One, two, one, there's no more running through the middle land

788
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,040
No more pay a visit

789
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,140
Shake the holy hand, oh the man

790
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,040
Shake the holy hand

791
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,800
The barium, a two, four, eight

792
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,040
It's mainly sterile, arcane, procreate

793
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,340
And the plutonium, one, four, seven

794
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,360
A silver approach, I'll see you in heaven

795
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,620
But the iodine, one, three, one

796
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,820
The iodine, one, three, one

797
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,640
There's no more running through the middle land

798
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,760
No more pay a visit

799
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,700
Shake the holy hand, oh the man

800
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,820
Shake the holy hand

801
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,700
Looked at over two million dumb pollutants

802
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,380
That can cause cancer

803
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,560
Skin lesions

804
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,880
Brain tumors

805
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,840
Thoracic confusion

806
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,000
Possible Republican identity

807
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,540
Congregations in the Middle East

808
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,280
Disconnected rumors

809
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,300
The long-slimming thing on DNA

810
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,640
When the sperm is fired

811
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,240
Chicken egg spasia

812
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,640
And what the fuck is the use?

813
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,520
The iodine, one, three, one

814
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,520
The iodine, one, three, one

815
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,680
All the run and the krypton

816
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,780
When it fires

817
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,560
It's making it hard to stay alive

818
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,140
Iodine, one, three, one

819
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,260
The iodine, one, three, one

820
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,120
There's no more running through the middle land

821
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,180
No more pay a visit

822
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,120
Shake the holy hand, oh the man

823
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,860
Shake the holy hand, oh the man

824
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,460
There's no more running from the little man.

825
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,620
No more running from the little man.

826
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,440
Shake the party hat.

827
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,700
The party's a man.

828
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,580
Shake the party hat.

829
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,300
Shake it, baby.

830
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,900
Thank you.

831
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:53,820
Thank you.

832
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,260
Boys and girls gathered here in the name of freedom.

833
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,620
I know some of you have hardly reached your 14th birthday.

834
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:13,600
Some of you are wearing those pearl cockled necklaces given to you by your ancient grandfathers.

835
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:21,860
And we know the nuclear devices you will be carrying into town today will cause you instant sainthood and martyrdom.

836
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,100
You will be lifted on high so there's no reason to cry, children.

837
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,180
Each one of you are a little boy.

838
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,540
Come, armed and ready to pop.

839
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,800
It's not going to fit in here.

840
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,060
I feel like I could pop all night, baby.

841
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,680
I don't know if I can walk to town with this.

842
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,160
You're my radar love, hon.

843
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,560
The implantation devices make sure that each child walks the straight and narrow path

844
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,240
to his dream.

845
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:09,740
The target is known at control is to make sure that each child removes itself as it removes

846
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,440
the target.

847
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,380
So there are no witnesses and no disclaimers allowed past the curfew now.

848
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,540
Damn it, Dave.

849
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,520
What do you think, Dave, about the fact that...

850
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,640
Damn it.

851
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,580
They're not even going to hide anymore, are they?

852
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,040
No.

853
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,720
No.

854
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,200
No, they're just right out there.

855
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,260
We're having an oil problem right now.

856
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,340
We're not making enough money to who knows what.

857
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,040
They're just not even going to hide it anymore.

858
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:43,600
Nope.

859
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,460
They're just going to rape everything they can in the four years they have.

860
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,280
Or only two, really, because they know they're going to lose the Senate.

861
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,760
Oh, Jeb's son will be the next Bush emperor.

862
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,800
And then...

863
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,340
Jeb's son?

864
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,880
You mean the little Puerto Rican kid?

865
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,180
Yeah.

866
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,800
The one granddad called the little brown one?

867
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,980
His father called him the little...

868
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,060
Really?

869
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,700
Yeah, George Bush Sr.

870
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,560
Oh, is that the little brown one?

871
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,180
The little brown one, right?

872
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,960
Well, I'm glad he's spreading his genes around and kind of like one of the folks now, but

873
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,340
that's good to have a brown child.

874
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,240
I'm learning...

875
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,040
How did that happen?

876
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,380
You know, I realized that I was serious when it sunk in that I really was trying to learn

877
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,340
Dutch from that little Berlitz book.

878
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,620
You mean you're saying you're actually...

879
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,300
You're actually thinking of repatriating the species?

880
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:32,740
I...

881
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,120
Well, you know...

882
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,680
I don't want to be part of the empire.

883
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,400
I know what you mean.

884
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,060
You know, I don't want to be on the Death Star.

885
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,580
I know.

886
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,040
I want to do...

887
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:45,800
I grew up believing that America was the rebel forces.

888
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,020
And now I'm a peanut in a big huge drum.

889
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,480
And now it's like, well, the rebel forces, this is the Death Star, man.

890
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,700
Howdy, folks.

891
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,400
Come on down to America, Inc., where you'll be forced to pay for everything.

892
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,680
But it's not.

893
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,080
It's convenient, friends.

894
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,140
Ah, memories.

895
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,420
This is the most convenient.

896
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,040
Ah, memories.

897
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,780
They used to shoot at us.

898
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,080
Now they shoot near us.

899
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,220
Well, I heard about the softer, the more friendlier bullets that they're using on the kids these

900
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:16,620
days.

901
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,440
Well, they don't think they were using friendly bullets in Cincinnati.

902
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,460
I heard they use the little bouncing bullets.

903
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:25,940
No.

904
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,960
Not in the West Bank of Gaza, they don't.

905
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,040
No, no, no.

906
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,840
They're using really lead bullets still.

907
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:31,740
Yes, there's still lead.

908
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,320
And even the Army.

909
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,040
What do you think about this?

910
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,360
The Army has switched to a...

911
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,020
Orgasm gun.

912
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:41,100
The Army has switched to a bullet that is environmental friendly.

913
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,280
It's some sort of other...

914
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:43,920
It's not lead.

915
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,420
It didn't buy degradable bullets.

916
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:45,860
Yeah.

917
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:46,720
Oh, my God.

918
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,880
The family still has to pay for it.

919
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,900
So that we only kill humans, not the earth.

920
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,680
They probably got a big conservation tax break for that.

921
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,420
Yeah.

922
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,960
The idea, of course, being, you know, this is the way...

923
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,680
Think of the research that went into that.

924
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,020
Gentlemen.

925
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,100
How much money cleaned up.

926
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,680
Cleaned up for years and years and years.

927
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,300
Will be a clean war.

928
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,080
A war that you and your children can stand to fight.

929
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,340
An effectively deadly bullet, but yet...

930
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,820
You know, somebody had to not repent.

931
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,240
Easy to mop up after.

932
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:19,260
In order for that bullet to be developed, somebody had to not repent or quit their job or slack off.

933
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,100
That's the age-correct way of thinking of it, yes.

934
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:26,540
There was a point where somebody could have repented, quit their job and slack off, and then somebody else would have had to develop that bullet.

935
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,080
Said, no, sign the check and put it in my rectum right here.

936
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,080


937
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,080


938
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:35,340
Well, if I don't develop this bullet, somebody else is going to do it, so I might as well not repent, quit my job or slack off.

939
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,700
I got to tell you guys something.

940
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,320
I'll be known as the guy who developed the environmental bullet.

941
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,660
The environmental bullet.

942
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,240
Yeah.

943
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,740
You know, the guy in the Doobie Brothers who's supposedly a missile defense expert?

944
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,660
Bend over and spread them, baby.

945
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:55,000
Here comes my environmentally cool bullet.

946
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,280
Bullet.

947
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,260
Bullet.

948
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:56,640
Bullet.

949
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:57,720
Bullet.

950
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:58,940
Bullet.

951
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:58,980
Bullet.

952
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,060


953
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,060


954
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,060


955
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,060


956
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,060


957
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,060


958
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,060


959
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,060


960
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,060


961
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,060


962
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,060


963
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,060


964
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,120
Thank God I've been shot.

965
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:06,200
I can almost see the future of America as my life oozes out here on the sidewalk.

966
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,740
Thank God for the safe, clean bullet that just ended me.

967
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,120
Ended you?

968
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,140
Did I?

969
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,360
Did you end?

970
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,980
Did I end at that moment?

971
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,820
No, you know, we have a friend who was in a band who's kind of like...

972
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,060
This song is just important today.

973
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,340
Why aren't kids, like, marching and stuff?

974
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,260
For what?

975
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,660
Yeah, they're not shooting them yet.

976
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:27,920
Stop.

977
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,860
Once they start shooting...

978
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,960
You're thinking of the old America.

979
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,860
This is America Incorporated.

980
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,320
Right.

981
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,060
We don't actually...

982
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,900
I mean, come on, man.

983
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,860
Do I have to spell it out as many of my employers?

984
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,880
There are no disagreements in corporate America.

985
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,420
Come on now.

986
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,520
Get with the program.

987
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,140
Read from the same page and remember the talking points.

988
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,800
Point number one.

989
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,120
Things are better than they've ever been.

990
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:55,760
And worse.

991
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,260
All the kids know today is they want their job.

992
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,660
Well, that's all there is.

993
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,380
There's the job and there's...

994
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,080
Endless drudgery.

995
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,100
The life.

996
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,260
Well, sort of.

997
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,700
And the job and...

998
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,240
Well, the job.

999
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,420
I'm not gonna rock the boat.

1000
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,420
I want the job.

1001
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,260
Chaz, you told me you're not only gonna rock the boat,

1002
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,000
that you were gonna rocket butt that boat right into another world.

1003
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,060
Rocket butt that rocket boat.

1004
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,220
I mean, I'm just...

1005
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,320
You're getting wanted to go.

1006
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,440
You're wanting to really climb on there and go to a world

1007
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,860
where people actually think normal or something.

1008
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,620
I don't know.

1009
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,580
Yeah, definitely.

1010
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,880
It's becoming very important.

1011
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,660
To get off.

1012
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,720
To get off.

1013
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,680
To get off.

1014
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,100
I mean, very, very, very important now.

1015
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:35,860
Yeah.

1016
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,560
I want to get off.

1017
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,220
I don't want to...

1018
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:39,940
I only hope...

1019
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,860
Stick around here.

1020
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,220
Exactly.

1021
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,840
I just did build...

1022
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,120
Buy a house in Cleveland.

1023
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,720
I'm building my own Amsterdam.

1024
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,960
Yeah, but you also built yourself a nice canal boat in your mind.

1025
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,460
You know?

1026
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,820
With the little hair and green thing in the front.

1027
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,300
You know?

1028
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,140
I'm also learning...

1029
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,320
Foreign languages.

1030
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,140
So that they'll let me go there.

1031
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,340
Are you learning Enochian babble?

1032
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,160
Well, I've been living in my house for five years.

1033
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,700
And for five years, I've been installing...

1034
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:13,500
Each day, I dig out a little area in the foundation area.

1035
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,420
And put in another composite rocket motor.

1036
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,500
So the house is about two-thirds now

1037
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,040
completely surrounded and strapped with rocket motors.

1038
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,600
So in another year or two...

1039
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,400
But the timing is so fiendishly important.

1040
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:28,980
I have to.

1041
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,060
I have to.

1042
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,060


1043
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,060


1044
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,060


1045
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,060


1046
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:33,120
I'm so devilishly tricky to get every rocket to go off at once.

1047
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:33,580
Mm-hmm.

1048
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,160
You don't...

1049
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,720
What happens if half of them go off and the other half don't?

1050
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,180
Oh, you have to kind of...

1051
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,220
You've got a tilted house, dude.

1052
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:40,780
Really?

1053
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,820
The Mish Fire is just going to send that thing...

1054
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,600
Might end up in Arkansas.

1055
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,820
Well, you would hope it would end up in Arkansas.

1056
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,980
Well, I'm not middle of Lake Erie.

1057
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,640
It doesn't matter.

1058
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:55,560
As long as I reach seven miles per second in any direction, that'll be...

1059
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,520
Even down.

1060
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,840
I'll be able to get Earth orbit.

1061
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,980
Chaz, I'm afraid...

1062
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,060
You don't want to go seven minutes per second in any...

1063
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,060
I mean, seven seconds...

1064
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,540
You know, that speed in all general directions,

1065
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,420
because that would be...

1066
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,680
You would be exploding up if you were, you know, not ahead of direction.

1067
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,900
It can't happen here.

1068
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,280
It can't happen here.

1069
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,020
I've been checking it out for a while, B.

1070
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:21,340
I'm telling you, my dear, that it can't happen here.

1071
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,300
Camtus!

1072
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:25,180
RFA!

1073
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,880
I've been checking it out.

1074
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:27,700
Did it?

1075
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,240
Did it?

1076
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:28,660
Check that out.

1077
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:29,300
A couple times.

1078
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,560
Yeah, it's happening here right now,

1079
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,240
and as we watch the sun go down on our democratic freedoms,

1080
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,060
the freedoms that we've taken for granted for so long...

1081
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,440
Oh, no, but we still have all those freedoms.

1082
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,400
They're even more convenient than ever, as long as you...

1083
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,640
As long as you tow the line.

1084
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:55,380
As long as you want what they want, you can have anything you want.

1085
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,540
We want what they want.

1086
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,200
What Bob wants.

1087
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,720
I want what we all want.

1088
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,080
I want a worldwide cataclysm.

1089
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,440
I want chocolate pudding delivered to me by aliens,

1090
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:13,780
and I want some female chocolate pudding delivered as frequently as possible,

1091
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,600
as the old salivary glands can move.

1092
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,800
Sometimes they don't move.

1093
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,760
Of course, that's not the first part of it.

1094
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,220
That's the end of it.

1095
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,160
The first part is much more laconic and obscure.

1096
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,000
I mean...

1097
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:33,460
Well, that's more artistic, you know, when you're obscure and hard to understand.

1098
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,000
That's more artful.

1099
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,540
And, you know, Dave, if we were a little more artful,

1100
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,720
we'd probably be getting paid a little better.

1101
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,240
But instead, we're...

1102
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,960
You just...

1103
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,760
Low-grade showbiz clowns.

1104
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,560
We might as well be the guys that sweep up behind the elephants at the circus, you know?

1105
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,480
Well, we do that, too.

1106
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,920
The dwarfs with the little pooper scoopers.

1107
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,500
Well, we also do...

1108
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:58,960
We do that.

1109
00:50:59,240 --> 00:50:59,560
Yeah.

1110
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,800
I mean, at least I've been going back.

1111
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,320
I don't know.

1112
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,100
Some people think they're too good to work.

1113
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,820
But, you know, as long as I'm getting a paycheck,

1114
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,600
I don't mind what tumbles out of there.

1115
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,460
I've seen worse things, and I've picked up worse things.

1116
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,400
You've stuck your arm all the way up worse places than where that came from.

1117
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,580
Yes, that is true.

1118
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,600
I don't want to go into the grim details.

1119
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,360
You tried to get your head all the way up into worse places, but I...

1120
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,440
I was almost a microcephalic baby from that incident.

1121
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:32,360
And I was almost returned to my native home in Canada

1122
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,360
and buried alive there for the whole incident.

1123
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,020
It was just...

1124
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,980
I don't know.

1125
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,140
In London, it struck a compromise.

1126
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,920
That's in England, you know.

1127
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,640
Dodger Stadium, it struck out.

1128
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,860
In Munich, it struck first.

1129
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,580
Take your head down.

1130
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:55,760
Very interesting.

1131
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,940
Chaz is trying to bring back the...

1132
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,260
Rebellion of the 60s, which, of course, was actually a co-op.

1133
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,440
From the very beginning.

1134
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,180
Okay, you start.

1135
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:12,280
The John Lennon glasses were trademarked before John Lennon was even born.

1136
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,340
Well, Jack Kerouac and Cassidy and all those guys...

1137
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,060
All planned out ahead of time.

1138
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,060
...were actually mind-controlled for quite some time.

1139
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,100
Yeah, but what good did it do?

1140
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,900
It was early in the morning.

1141
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,180
The energy was so, so weak.

1142
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,640
The poor people below could hardly stand...

1143
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:29,340
...to look up.

1144
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,980
Their necks were craning, but still, it looked like it was...

1145
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:32,800
Wait.

1146
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:33,780
This is...

1147
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,280
Dave, you're stuck in the 60s, man.

1148
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,880
No, man, I'm not stuck in the...

1149
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,560
Get with it, dude.

1150
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,680
It's the 90s.

1151
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,180
No, wait.

1152
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,120
It's the...

1153
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,120
The aughties or the zeros or the...

1154
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,660
Yeah, it's the new...

1155
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,480
It's the modern age.

1156
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,580
What is that feeling?

1157
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,800
It's contemporary.

1158
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:49,280
It's new.

1159
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:49,780
It's now.

1160
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:54,340
It's when muscles rise up in your neck and the back of your brain tingles...

1161
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,080
...like there's a little teeny...

1162
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,460
...chameleon in the back of your neck.

1163
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,640
What is that feeling when your shoes drop off as you're walking down the street...

1164
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,700
...and they wave goodbye to you?

1165
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,140
What is that feeling?

1166
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,420
What is that feeling?

1167
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,120
What's that blue stain in your undies?

1168
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,220
Have you been keeping bad company again?

1169
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:20,420
Have you been hanging with those who hang too far?

1170
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,380
Yeah.

1171
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,420
Today I bought a new car.

1172
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,780
Today I bought a new horn for it.

1173
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,800
Herb Alpert.

1174
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,180
Yeah.

1175
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:32,120
Sick thing is, Rowan and Martin's laugh-in was actually kind of...

1176
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,080
...the hippest thing going at the time.

1177
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,040
I can hardly afford to buy my groceries.

1178
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,620
Horrible nauseas.

1179
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,440
Possessed us in the morning.

1180
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,740
First a chilling feeling that Dean was not going to go on.

1181
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,840
His arms were too scrawny.

1182
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,280
His ears...

1183
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,380
Well, his ears were full of gray...

1184
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,500
It's yellow matter.

1185
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,800
Yellow matter's coming out of his ears.

1186
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,640
All of a sudden...

1187
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:57,720
Then...

1188
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:57,940
Then...

1189
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:58,640
Then...

1190
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,480
Put out all the lights and play Robert Goodway...

1191
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,240
No, said Bill.

1192
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:01,580
...to like it.

1193
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,380
I've been standing here for three hours with my panties upside down and no one's noticed.

1194
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:06,760
I scream.

1195
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:14,460
Dean hopped up about a minute convulsively, anxiously pulling on his arms.

1196
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,760
It made me wonder if the college boy had thanked him,

1197
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,920
or what he was trying to do with all strange, strange radio equipment.

1198
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,820
Well, actually, it's an idol.

1199
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,380
Would you mind saying that again?

1200
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,560
Idaho?

1201
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,300
That's frightfully interesting.

1202
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:28,640
We've been...

1203
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:32,840
Oh, I've always wanted to make a cowboy.

1204
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,360
I mean, meet a cowboy.

1205
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:35,720
Really?

1206
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:36,940
Really?

1207
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,260
I yelled across the river.

1208
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,160
Well, you won't see me to...

1209
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,720
Yeah, there was a mist and men are tonight,

1210
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,840
and the streetlights didn't come on the freeway till Vine Street,

1211
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,760
and me and an old friend were talking about Allegheny and pulling boats,

1212
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,860
and there was people hanging themselves down steps, I guess,

1213
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,780
but mostly good things.

1214
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:55,940
Good things.

1215
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,080
And, uh, hello, J.D.

1216
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,700
Hello, Robbie.

1217
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,080
Hello.

1218
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,140
Hello, everyone.

1219
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:00,340
Um...

1220
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,640
My parents say I don't know what good clean fun is.

1221
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,640
And they're right.

1222
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,060
I don't know what good it is.

1223
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,420
The spasms lasted for three and a half hours.

1224
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,400
By the time we got Grandmother all quieted down,

1225
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,680
she still had somehow gotten it into her brain that Grandma was going to...

1226
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,080
Grandpa.

1227
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:23,720
I'm sorry.

1228
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,400
Grandpa was...

1229
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,160
You had the right idea.

1230
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,500
It's just a shame that polygamy never caught on among the married.

1231
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,540
People of this country.

1232
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:30,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1233
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,140
They should have had more polygamies.

1234
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,160
They can't help it if they're not tall.

1235
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,160
Wah, wah, wah.

1236
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,620
Wah, wah, wah.

1237
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,160
Wah, wah, wah.

1238
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:47,420
Hey, did you have a joke on Wirefin last week about holding pig meat in your nostrils?

1239
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,300
Feeling that the long arm has gone through and brought back one that we could slip under the door.

1240
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,540
Wah, wah, wah.

1241
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,280
Oh, I couldn't have said it better myself.

1242
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:58,460
Oh, yeah.

1243
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:58,640
Oh, yeah.

1244
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1245
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1246
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1247
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1248
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1249
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1250
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1251
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1252
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1253
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1254
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1255
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1256
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,640


1257
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,280
How about that?

1258
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,840
Your name's in big lights up there on that marquee.

1259
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,400
So is mine.

1260
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:02,680
Yeah.

1261
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,960
Now we had a number of circumcision marks.

1262
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:06,680
Talk about history.

1263
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,380
Some of them were covering our heart.

1264
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,700
No, but there's a great party in 1537.

1265
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,780
Nearly psychic circumcision marks.

1266
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,480
Why don't we go to that one?

1267
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,300
The kind of young men like to make that.

1268
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,180
Oh, there go cues from that bit.

1269
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:26,700
The marks are purely coincidental, and I think the problem was he might have fallen down before he entered the elevator.

1270
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,480
No, no.

1271
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:28,560
No, no.

1272
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,440
It's not the same guy.

1273
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,600
This man was confused.

1274
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:36,320
He was pointing and asking questions, and I just couldn't answer what...

1275
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,760
I had no idea what he was talking about.

1276
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,280
We really learned the three R's.

1277
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,940
Reading, writing, and rhythm.

1278
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,040
Specifics, barking, and playing with ourselves.

1279
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,940
These are the new rules.

1280
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,180
This is the new regimen for a new human race.

1281
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,580
One that will not only conquer the stars, but conquer the...

1282
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:05,180
And you'll be behind it.

1283
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,320
Standing there, guarding, standing tall for America.

1284
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,400
Really.

1285
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,240
Man, that really moves me, Dave.

1286
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,860
I'm so glad that...

1287
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,060
It's just a tear gas.

1288
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,660
You can't say such a sincere...

1289
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:21,880
No, man.

1290
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,280
It's a tear gas in the mind control, man.

1291
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,580
I don't know what I'm saying.

1292
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,440
I'm crying.

1293
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,620
I'm crying.

1294
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:28,980
Oh, man, I...

1295
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:30,460
Get it together, man.

1296
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,240
It sounds like Mambo music.

1297
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:31,760
You're on the air.

1298
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,440
Come on, come on.

1299
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,000
None of this emotional baloney.

1300
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:36,820
Get it...

1301
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,640
Hey, guys, you know, I was wondering,

1302
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:42,180
the funny thing about doing a late-night show like this

1303
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:45,420
and getting a lot of, you know, really out-there callers.

1304
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,420
Last night, little Jimmy Spliff called three times,

1305
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:53,140
and he was, you know, doing his own variety of rocket science.

1306
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,260
But here at, you know, the Kingdom Dome,

1307
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,280
there's a lot of complaints, you know.

1308
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,840
We've had problems before,

1309
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:03,420
but we're going to hang in there as long as we can.

1310
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,380
I mean, as far as I'm concerned, the gallows have been built,

1311
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,380
so let's keep hanging.

1312
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,020
And nobody's going to talk about your shoes

1313
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,760
or say that, you know, you left the eggs in there too long

1314
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,720
or there's just, you know, some problem with you.

1315
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,780
You know, everyone's going to just be cool with that.

1316
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,720
Hey, who were you hot for on the Laugh-In,

1317
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,240
Rowan and Martin Laugh-In show?

1318
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,840
I liked Goldie Hawn.

1319
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,160
Chaz.

1320
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:28,380
Chaz.

1321
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,520
Yeah, I figured you'd be the Goldie Hawn.

1322
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,980
There was Judy Karn, which is a little cute English chick.

1323
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:34,620
Nah.

1324
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,580
I liked Joanne.

1325
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,220
Joanne Worley.

1326
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,000
Me too, man.

1327
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,300
I was really into it.

1328
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,460
I understand.

1329
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,980
She was kind of large and kind of heavy-boned

1330
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,580
and loud and obnoxious.

1331
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:53,980
But that wide, wide, wide mouth just invoked...

1332
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,000
The Queen of Hearts look.

1333
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,380
You like that Queen of Hearts look?

1334
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,420
Off with their heads.

1335
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:57,780
I know.

1336
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,220
And referring to your structures down there.

1337
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,920
Yeah, I don't know what it is.

1338
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,680
I can't put the two and two together.

1339
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,360
Her laugh was just very infectious.

1340
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,860
There's no doubt about it.

1341
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:13,700
I wonder where she's at now and how large and old.

1342
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,560
And she's in the old actor's home in Pasadena, California.

1343
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,820
Sitting out in the backyard watching the Cupid pee in the pond.

1344
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,880
Yeah, she's had her last turkey sandwich for today, though.

1345
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,620
She's going back in sight.

1346
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,620
For her meds.

1347
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:33,060
Does that little boy ever finish peeing?

1348
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,320
Or does he just pee that forever?

1349
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,720
Keep your back to the wind.

1350
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,320
Keep your hat tight.

1351
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,440
Keep your sack in saddle.

1352
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:46,100
Quedan tus cajones en el...

1353
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:51,060
The rebel forces, this is the fucking Death Star, man.
