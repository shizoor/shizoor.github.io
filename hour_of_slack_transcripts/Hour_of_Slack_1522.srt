1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
The big machine, 8,000 cubic miles of Kleistron relays, enough power for a whole population of subgeniuses.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,640
Operated by remote control.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,620
Operated by the electromagnetic impulses of individual subgeniuses' brains.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,220
To what purpose?

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,860
In return, that ultimate machine would instantaneously project mob to any point on the planet.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,760
In any shape or color they might imagine.

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,240
For any purpose.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:21,900
Mob?

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,080
By mere thought.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,200
Why haven't I seen this all along?

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,640
But like you, the subgeniuses forgot one deadly danger.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,620
Their own subconscious hate and lust for mob.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,860
The beast.

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,700
The mindless primitive.

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,800
And so those mindless beasts of the subgeniuses had access to a machine that could never be shut down.

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,260
The secret devil of every soul on the planet all set free at once to loot and maim.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,520
And take revenge and kill mob.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,840
After a million years of shining sanity, they could hardly have understood what power was destroying them.

19
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,340
Mob?

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,120
The

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,740
Green

22
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:01,740


23
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:01,740


24
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:01,800
Up to

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,380
Most

26
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:02,940
All

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,840
aneous

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,140
Ah, yes dear friends.

29
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,620
Here's an hour of slack.

30
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:28,620


31
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:28,620


32
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:28,620


33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:28,620


34
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,960
We haven't used in years by Reverend Zoso Dada.

35
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,600
Those clips from Forbidden Planet a minute ago were from a new guy, Doc Cosmic.

36
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,100
But get ready because we're about to play a song by our friend Charleston Okafor,

37
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,880
who does the show just before this one at WCSB.

38
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,660
And yeah, I think you will be as amazed as I was.

39
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's go.

40
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,740
Adorable, impeccable, your personality

41
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,480
Simplicity, so humble, in a special way

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,580
You think I'm in love, so deep it's my fault somebody's stopping me

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,800
On your ego, face to face, we got so bright

44
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,660
Then worry your eyes, because every day's a call

45
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,680
You smile at me, love just like a star on a map

46
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
We don't wear you out, we don't dassoot my soul

47
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,040
Rama Rama, Rama Krishna

48
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,840
Krishna Krishna

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,060
Rama Rama, Rama Krishna

50
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,980
Krishna Krishna

51
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,640
Rama Rama, Rama Rama

52
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,320
Girl in the hill, gently scoping you

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,100
You're my fantasy

54
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,020
You got me twisted

55
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,240
Oh, naughty girl

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,400
You're my apple wood

57
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,400
Fruit to my taste

58
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,220
Beer to my boo

59
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,320
I'm high on love in you

60
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,300
Said I'll drop on me

61
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,500
High above my reach

62
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,440
Still I'm digging you

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,940
Sunshine in your fears

64
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,940
Delicious choice for my love

65
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,820
Rama Rama Krishna Krishna Krishna

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Krishna Krishna Krishna Krishna Krishna

67
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:58,600


68
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:58,600


69
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:57,900
Whatever place!

70
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:45,980
Lamb of God, Lamb of God, Lamb of God, Lamb of God.

71
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,820
Rama Rama

72
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,020
Rama Krishna

73
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,000
Krishna Krishna

74
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,940
Rama Rama

75
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,000
Rama Krishna

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,960
Krishna Krishna

77
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,920
Rama Rama

78
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,040
Rama Krishna

79
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,960
Krishna Krishna

80
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,840
Rama Rama

81
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,180
I don't suppose either one of you know why Bob's car is parked out in front?

82
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,700
Good question.

83
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,040
No.

84
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,000
However, I will say, Bob, please don't interrupt me, man, because I'm trying to stay focused.

85
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,440
Oh, whoa.

86
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,280
Excuse me.

87
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,620
Are the explosives really necessary here?

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,980
Man, who's boss is this thing to?

89
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,500
Bob, look, I'm paying.

90
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,420
Damn it.

91
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:24,780
Bob.

92
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,780
You son of a bitch.

93
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,060
You're not paying attention if you're messing around with the gun.

94
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,580
Now, quit.

95
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,140
Keep the gun on the table.

96
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,640
I can't focus unless the gun is on the table.

97
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,980
Well, you just paid for it.

98
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,780
Shut up, man.

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,560
Shut up.

100
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:35,780
Bob.

101
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,640
I'm warning you now.

102
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,700
Be quiet, please.

103
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,460
It's true.

104
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,160
Okay.

105
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,800
There.

106
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,060
Do you see the star?

107
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,040
It's me right there, and I'll be in there.

108
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,220
Bob, you're the zero out here in the car.

109
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,160
Okay, we're heading back to Bob's, so we're going to hit the road and go on the lane.

110
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,000
Go.

111
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,560
Go.

112
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,000
Go.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,140
Go.

114
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,300
Go.

115
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,520
Go.

116
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:53,740


117
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:53,740


118
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:53,800
Go.

119
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:53,800


120
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:53,800


121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,080
One thing.

122
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,380
Bob gets the spirit award on this case.

123
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,520
The contribution was never accepted.

124
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,100
Come here, Bob.

125
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,680
Come here.

126
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,700
Did you see the look he gave me?

127
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,020
Don't double cross this guy.

128
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,900
Don't even think about it.

129
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,620
You son of a bitch.

130
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,300
You're going to cut me up.

131
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,980
You're going to not wait a second.

132
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,080
Wait a second.

133
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,540
Bob.

134
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,620
That's a good haircut there that my friend needs to get.

135
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,960
Bob, you went like this.

136
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,380
Bob is a big boy.

137
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,480
Now, we are in the real world.

138
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,320
We don't settle our problems with hugs, man.

139
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,200
We settle them with bare knuckles and head shots.

140
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,440
Right now.

141
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,320
Let's go, Lord.

142
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,980
Let's go.

143
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,820
See you in a minute.

144
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:23,820


145
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:23,820


146
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,460
Bob!

147
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,180
Bob! Stop it!

148
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,180
Come on, Bob!

149
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,880
Come here, Bob.

150
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,520
I'm going to hug him.

151
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,760
I would like to have you on the team.

152
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:34,980
If you'll have to.

153
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,100
Pal and Philo are out there on the edge of the world now

154
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,600
with the one ring that will make everything different.

155
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:47,880
Yes, sir.

156
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,600
You can tell by the music.

157
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,880
When you start talking about gadgets,

158
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,880
gadgets, all conversation ceases and stops.

159
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,820
Comes to a dead stop.

160
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,800
Ceases and stops.

161
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,020
Yeah, see, now, it's an electronic world now.

162
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,720
They're lost in their little devices, the iPhone 36.

163
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,020
Oh, wow.

164
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,680
No, it's true, though.

165
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,300
I mean, who cares?

166
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,300
They work so well.

167
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,900
They do what we want them to do.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,220
They're fantastic platforms for creativity.

169
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,240
It's just fun to whine about the change.

170
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,680
It's not the thing itself.

171
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,360
It's the dynamic of having to keep catching up

172
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,660
with them faster and faster.

173
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,820
It costs you some change.

174
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,180
Yeah, it costs you some change.

175
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,120
Change you can believe in.

176
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,580
Yeah, you have to believe in it,

177
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,460
because you just made it.

178
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
For the richest person on earth.

179
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,960
And every show,

180
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,820
because everybody's got their own show now.

181
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,440
Yes, you too can help buy someone who's richer

182
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,540
than most smaller nations,

183
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,040
buy yet another house.

184
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,720
Yeah.

185
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,360
We need a couple more houses.

186
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,160
I mean, they do.

187
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,320
Yeah, they do.

188
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,500
Us and them?

189
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,720
Philo's such a great man, he's going to give us and them

190
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,140
a few more houses.

191
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,880
I don't see how we can do that without making other people

192
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,480
feel included in our large ass.

193
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,920
That's the only way.

194
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,340
Well, that's a very handsome attitude.

195
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,960
We will bestow upon those.

196
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,100
Those seen as deserving,

197
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,680
although obviously

198
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,660
they would be as great

199
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,740
out of their depth.

200
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,180
They've tried.

201
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,600
Yes, they can't handle power tools.

202
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,260
Just look at that sloppy job.

203
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,060
Yep, look at those shoes.

204
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,840
Look at those floppy, sloppy socks.

205
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,340
Obviously, if you're wearing sloppy

206
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,080
hirachis, you don't care about your personal appearance.

207
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,420
No, you don't care.

208
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,380
And why should you?

209
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,840
It would be a

210
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,020
just be a horrible,

211
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,000
thing to impose upon an individual

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,680
asking that they're

213
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,240
about hygiene and

214
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,440
what would be the point?

215
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,540
It's just such a superfluous act,

216
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,400
a waste of time and effort.

217
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,420
So, I'm going to

218
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,800
when you're just going to get dirty and filthy and

219
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,300
filled with fetid rot

220
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,660
at some point in time in the future anyway, again.

221
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,180
Why advance that time?

222
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,380
Wait a minute.

223
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,940
I just said I'd do a show.

224
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,660
I didn't say I'd rot for that.

225
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,040
You wouldn't smell rot for the show?

226
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,020
When they went to try to depose the supposedly dead magician,

227
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,040
Maligris, that he cursed them and made them rot.

228
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,140
Though Maligris?

229
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:29,600
And where they stood.

230
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,480
Yes.

231
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,740
See, that's some strong ink in there.

232
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,900
I'll wipe this stuff off.

233
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,220
A church audience is rolling out

234
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,800
church secrets as he's talking about.

235
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,200
Oh, no more church secrets now.

236
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,060
Puzzling evidence.

237
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,080
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

238
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,780
No, we...

239
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,680
What have we been listening to?

240
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,240
Oh, the Puzzling Evidence show from KPFA Berkeley.

241
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,340
Just some clips there.

242
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,220
Philo, Dr. Drummond.

243
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,360
I mean, Philo is Dr. Drummond.

244
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,980
Hal is Dr. Hal.

245
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,920
And Puzzling Evidence is actually the name of the show

246
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,820
and the man, Puzzling Evidence.

247
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,500
And once again, we played that song we played,

248
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,340
Rama Rama.

249
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,060
Rama Rama.

250
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,100
Coming in the template,

251
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,740
comes out on SID Metric implant heart

252
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:39,740


253
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:39,740


254
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:39,740


255
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,100
Come On.

256
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


257
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


258
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


259
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,600
is all it is.

260
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,400
The Era of The Verbal Eye,

261
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,960
is a hyperreb Mortal Art,

262
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,020
which after reading it.

263
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,040
имся

264
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,600
a weird mashup of an old religious chant

265
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,940
fits in perfectly.

266
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,220
The little chopped-up movie soundtrack,

267
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,620
I don't know what the movie was,

268
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,540
the armed bobbery there was by another new contributor,

269
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,660
Richie and Soren.

270
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,660
And I'm going to go back to reading a little bit

271
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,240
from our out-of-print bauble.

272
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,840
The Bobliographon.

273
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,540
Actually, the complete title is

274
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,600
The Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack.

275
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,260
Cyclopedia spelled with a P-S-Y.

276
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,640
That was Princess Wee's idea.

277
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,300
New revelations from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

278
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
And here's what Bob said.

279
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,960
To continue from last week,

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,860
I'm getting to where I have to take my glasses off to read now.

281
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,660
Slackers fighting back.

282
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,080
A contradiction in terms?

283
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,940
What then do we do about the conspiracy?

284
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,240
Asked the young subs of us elder hierarchs.

285
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,340
I want to rip them a new soul hole.

286
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,300
I have much feist in me.

287
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,720
Just tell me how to source it properly.

288
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,660
They say, well, some Native Americans have a piece of paper

289
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,840
that says they still own South Dakota.

290
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,880
Jesus has a piece of paper that says

291
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,980
he owns the moon.

292
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,900
But if he doesn't have enough lawyers, guns, and money,

293
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,820
he's got no more hope of holding onto his property

294
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,020
than the Indians did.

295
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,160
You cannot defeat the conspiracy.

296
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,800
In fact, you probably can't even weaken it.

297
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,520
But you can make yourself stronger.

298
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,680
You can make yourself less dependent on the conspiracy

299
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,960
or anybody else.

300
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,800
You're going to have to get out from under mom and dad.

301
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,520
Before you can take on big oil, though.

302
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,020
If you're on the dole, eventually you'll have to choose

303
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,500
between living off the system and overthrowing it.

304
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,900
By definition, you can't do both forever,

305
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,320
although we've certainly seen plenty try.

306
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,740
Voltaire said that if you want to change the world,

307
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,440
cultivate your garden.

308
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,280
Now, we agree.

309
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,260
First, mow your own damn yard.

310
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,340
Then you can tell everybody else what to plant.

311
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,660
Ha, ha, ha.

312
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,260
Ha, ha, ha.

313
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,860
To end slacklessness,

314
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,680
the subgenius must have slack.

315
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,880
True slack.

316
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,380
That's self-evident.

317
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,600
Everybody who's anybody knows that.

318
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,040
And we're with everybody who's anybody.

319
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,380
But it's not for everybody.

320
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,460
We're only into it if it's only for everybody who's anybody.

321
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,320
We're too independent to follow the big crowd.

322
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,380
We only follow the small crowd.

323
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,760
Unless they're too small.

324
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,260
Everybody knows that everybody who's anybody already knew that,

325
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,840
except for the nobodies.

326
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,580
Nobody who's anybody doesn't know that.

327
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,620
See?

328
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,560
We're nobody's fools.

329
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,120
Nobody who's anybody, anyway.

330
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,060
This church is not the final weapon that will bring down the conspiracy.

331
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,940
It only provides an umbrella under which all of you misfits

332
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,360
can yourselves conspire for a while,

333
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,460
if you have enough sense to get in out of the rain.

334
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,560
So wake up!

335
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,060
Become a doctor.

336
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,040
Instantly.

337
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,700
777!

338
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,140
Well, that's what it says here, anyway.

339
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,000
Um...

340
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,860
Bob is here to fight the conspiracy by breeding new,

341
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,180
quote, humans, unquote, that are more like the oldest breed.

342
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,220
Stinky humans.

343
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,880
With instincts.

344
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,880
The flattening of the personality that comes with the average conspiracy,

345
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,740
uh,

346
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,160
life style,

347
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,320
has suppressed genetic instincts down through the millennia.

348
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,800
That's exactly why so many people injure or kill their own children,

349
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,820
or customers, or constituents.

350
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,640
It's why marriages don't work half the time,

351
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,780
and why the family's gotten a bad name.

352
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,500
It's why you keep screwing yourself!

353
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,220
As Dobbs said in 1967, while reading the front page,

354
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,020
Father...

355
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,660
Don't forgive them.

356
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,760
For they know exactly what they do.

357
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,300
Yes, my friends!

358
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,380
Each murder of Bob only refuels our holy flame throwers of vengeance!

359
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,240
That we may torch all pinkness!

360
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,700
That we may burn out, root out, and cauterize the evil and impurity

361
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,560
to sweep clean the filth from Earth Farm One!

362
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,480
Uh, the...

363
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,400
Exists would have done it years ago,

364
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,080
but for Bob's haggling to get a better price for it.

365
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,420
So what are you?

366
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:50,900
A human?

367
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,520
Or a subgenius?

368
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,040
Are you gonna let God and the conspiracy just walk all over ya?

369
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,680
If the church of the subgenius goes down,

370
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,920
civilization goes up in flames.

371
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,100
But,

372
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,240
as Reverend B.J. Maloney said,

373
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,280
when the world goes up in flames,

374
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,260
the subgenies will have the weenies.

375
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,380
Just as the characters in Hamlet never mention Shakespeare,

376
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:27,360
the Pink cannot see to what extent he depends upon our most insipid fantasies

377
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,080
for his entire lifestyle.

378
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:38,700
The Pink is like a blind, deaf albino snake crawling on the floor of a pitch-dark cave.

379
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,540
But ol' Spelunker Bob has a flashlight,

380
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,660
a snake bag,

381
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,220
and a gig in Spike.

382
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,780
Soon enough,

383
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,560
you'll be searching for Bob on the scaly roof of your mouth.

384
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,720
The church of the subgenius.

385
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,500
We put the ha in hate,

386
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,660
and the lo in love,

387
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,280
along with the fun in fundamentalism,

388
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,620
the uh in fundamentalism,

389
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,040
the mental in fundamentalism,

390
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,640
the ism in fundamentalism,

391
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,820
the fundamental in fundamentalism,

392
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,920
the da in fundamentalism,

393
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,640
the da and the fu,

394
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,060
and even the u.

395
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,900
That's you, friend.

396
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,960
So, yeah, that's all from the Bob Leografon,

397
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,960
the Encyclopedia of Slack,

398
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,720
out-of-print subgenius book.

399
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,100
Our first book, Book of the Subgenius, is still in print.

400
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,820
It's a,

401
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:46,040
it's even in some sort of really degenerated e-book format.

402
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,040
Uh, but yeah,

403
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,920
Thunder's Mouth Press was daring enough to publish this,

404
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,960
this wonderful newish subgenius book.

405
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,540
Well, it's nine years old now.

406
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,260
Old enough to marry in some countries.

407
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,640
Heh, heh, heh.

408
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,640
Eh, mm.

409
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,260
And, uh,

410
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,200
but, you know,

411
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,320
I suppose we could turn this thing into an e-book ourselves.

412
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,200
I believe the rights would revert back,

413
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,060
and all the artwork could be in color,

414
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,400
because on this book,

415
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,840
the artwork originated in color, most of it.

416
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,240
It just cost too much to print that way.

417
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,820
But an e-book,

418
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,040
why, color's the same as black and white.

419
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,940
We could even do it in 3D.

420
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,080
Ehh.

421
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,740
That would be weird.

422
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,900
I'd have,

423
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,620
you'd have to fake it all.

424
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,940
It'd be like the conspiracy fake 3D they use for movies now.

425
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,760
You know, most of those movies are not actually shot in real 3D.

426
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,880
They're just shot.

427
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,960
Yes, they impose 3D upon them in retrospect.

428
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,180
Yeah.

429
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,820
Or, hey, we saw,

430
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,840
on the way to the station,

431
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,920
we saw a guy walking down the street with a T-shirt that said,

432
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,060
Keeping Cleveland Retro.

433
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,220
I like that.

434
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,180
I like that line.

435
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,820
The guy fit.

436
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,580
I mean, he looked kind of retro.

437
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:08,600
Mm-hmm.

438
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,620
He looked kind of 90s.

439
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,760
Indeed he did.

440
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:10,960
Mm-hmm.

441
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,540
Yeah, huh.

442
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,520
Keeping Cleveland.

443
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:15,940
It's like,

444
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,580
you know,

445
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,320
the problem is that once you say that,

446
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,960
it means it's already too late.

447
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,320
It's like in Austin,

448
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,520
you see the saddest bumper sticker,

449
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,320
Keep Austin Weird.

450
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,820
And you'll see that bumper sticker for the next 30 minutes,

451
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,460
if you happen to see it while you're on the expressway there,

452
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,380
because it's not weird anymore.

453
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,940
It's just another crowded,

454
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,380
horrible,

455
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:38,600
weird,

456
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:38,600


457
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:38,600


458
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:38,600


459
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:38,600


460
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:38,600


461
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,560
Silicon Valley,

462
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,160
Dallas-like,

463
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,880
nightmarish place.

464
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,100
Mm-mm-mm.

465
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,060
How come we're not seeing any,

466
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,640
uh,

467
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,220
It didn't know.

468
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,100
We're hearing Dave.

469
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,680
I don't quite get that.

470
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,040
Our Dave must call.

471
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,620
Princess,

472
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:57,720
you might want to keep your eye on this false phone line here,

473
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,700
which I can't see quite as well.

474
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,020
Okay.

475
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,060
I can do that.

476
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,060
I could always,

477
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:03,600
um,

478
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,780
you know,

479
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,740
if we're not interesting or funny,

480
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,960
I can always put on Puzzling Evidence again,

481
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,540
and,

482
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:11,920
and,

483
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,260
uh,

484
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,060
Dr. Howell,

485
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,820
and Philodrumon.

486
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,200
But,

487
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,740
Oh,

488
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,700
but surely Dave will call soon.

489
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,340
Well,

490
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,340
and besides that,

491
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,800
we're more intelligent and funny anyway.

492
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,940
I was about to read some more from this,

493
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,160
uh,

494
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,580
book,

495
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,400
but I can't read this section by Reverend Lemuel Atom.

496
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,100
Oh,

497
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,960
now I remember who Lemuel Atom is.

498
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,980
It's my cousin.

499
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,720
Oh,

500
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,620
my cousin in Portland.

501
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,460
But since he wants to be Lemuel Atom,

502
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,660
I better not say his name,

503
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,180
but his last name is,

504
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:49,820
uh,

505
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,180
uh,

506
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,840
Smedley.

507
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:52,800
Yeah.

508
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,180
Yeah.

509
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,700
Smedley.

510
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,360
Smedlab.

511
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,540
All right.

512
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:56,780
Oh,

513
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,740
the music in the background,

514
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,400
by the way,

515
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,740
is,

516
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,200
uh,

517
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,740
Esquivel,

518
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,380
the great,

519
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,700
the great Mexican composer.

520
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,820
I believe he is Mexican.

521
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:05,980
Esquivel.

522
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,720
Did you know that Brotherhood is a great,

523
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:07,720


524
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:07,720


525
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:07,720


526
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:07,720


527
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:07,720


528
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:07,720


529
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:07,800
great,

530
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:07,820


531
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:07,820


532
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,760
And did you know that Brother Cleve made an album with Esquivel just before Esquivel died?

533
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,180
Yes,

534
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,260
I did know that.

535
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,780
That's so phenomenal though.

536
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,680
I went to Cleve's house once,

537
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,040
and he held up these boxes of hand-lettered reel-to-reel tape and said,

538
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,700
this is Esquivel's handwriting.

539
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
These are his tapes.

540
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,260
I couldn't believe it.

541
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,280
And neither will Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

542
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,060
if he ever hears it.

543
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,100
The Lonesome?

544
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,020
You see?

545
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,120
I told you.

546
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,340
One,

547
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,760
one's one year.

548
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,660
No,

549
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,640
No, we don't pick up the phone until we're finished talking about you, Dave.

550
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,840
I thought it was until you got done doing the credits and stuff, something normal like that.

551
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,400
Oh, we hardly had any credits this time.

552
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,160
I didn't play very much.

553
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,440
I did play a song by Charleston.

554
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,340
Yes.

555
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,340
The guy who does the African Abstract show before us.

556
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,240
And you can hear that show.

557
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:04,920
I did music on that show.

558
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,460
Huh?

559
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,340
It's an excellent show.

560
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,300
I love it.

561
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,900
I love African Abstract.

562
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,680
How can you hear it in Ashtabula?

563
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,620
I could hear it before.

564
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,360
Oh, right.

565
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,400
And I still remember.

566
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,980
I don't think it's gotten bad or anything.

567
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,940
I think it's gotten better, so it was great to begin with.

568
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,920
You're just guessing, though.

569
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,580
You don't know.

570
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,680
No, but I'm pretty hip to some other things happening in world music,

571
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,980
and I know that he's right on top of everything.

572
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,200
And also erudite.

573
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,960
Yes, but he keeps it retro, too.

574
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:45,140
Tonight he was playing some old stuff, so he keeps a good mix going.

575
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,940
How would I know if something was old?

576
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,480
I'm so old, everything seems new to me.

577
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,560
If something is from the 60s, it's old.

578
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,760
That's me.

579
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,360
Oh, that reminds me.

580
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,700
I was...

581
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,100
But Charleston had...

582
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,640
I've been rereading the Time Life book.

583
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,000
Done in the 60s.

584
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,480
Oh, man, you are old.

585
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,380
Yeah.

586
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:11,980
Yes.

587
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,980
Yeah, they...

588
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,680
Those books sucked!

589
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,680
No, no, actually, they're...

590
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,800
Well, they were...

591
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,700
They had a lot of details in them that would be considered wrong or incomplete now.

592
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,660
For instance, the book I was reading mentioned that computers...

593
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,180
They've been able to make computers so small that they can fit on a spaceship.

594
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,280
Fit on a what?

595
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,160
A spaceship.

596
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:38,720
A spaceship.

597
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,400
Yeah, they were planning to put...

598
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,280
They were making computers so small that they were planning to put one on the moon missions

599
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,320
that were proposed at the time of this book.

600
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,720
None of them had actually happened.

601
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,260
And it had these amazing...

602
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,160
Oh, let's see.

603
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,920
Here's this one.

604
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,560
But what is...

605
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,580
Microcircuits.

606
00:25:59,580 --> 00:25:59,780
What is it?

607
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,680
This microcircuit was so small, no larger than the capital O.

608
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:05,740
Oh.

609
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,540
In this sentence.

610
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,100
And does the job of four transistors and two resistors.

611
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,600
They were impressed by that level of miniaturization in 1961.

612
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,900
Yeah, I was going to query you right now on the state of miniaturization and nanotechnology at this very moment.

613
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,540
It's ridiculous.

614
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,940
There are things that are so small now and they contain so many different information.

615
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,160
So much different...

616
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,000
So much information.

617
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,000
And they're so tiny.

618
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,600
They're so very tiny.

619
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,220
They're like...

620
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,260
How do you measure them?

621
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,400
Now, what were we talking about?

622
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,480
The brains of the presidential candidates?

623
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,280
Or the brains of the voters for the presidential candidates?

624
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,020
Nano small.

625
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,340
I'm for veterinary.

626
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,240
I'm going to write in Havelock veterinary for president.

627
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,220
That's what I've decided.

628
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,540
He's unfortunately fictitious.

629
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:05,480
He's the tyrant who controls Ankh-Morpork in the Discworld books by the late Sir Terry

630
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:05,720
Peele.

631
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,520
I honestly wrote the book.

632
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,560
Because I think it's pretty great, but ituh, uh, Caitlyn classem always talking about one

633
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,200
other band that's what reallyности night track think they're talking about want every

634
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,580
thing, you know, one thing and only reason is should never be the second choice in life.

635
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:21,580


636
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,460
pickup judgments.

637
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:26,800
Well, how about Mary Evan.

638
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,780
I remember when I got all these to.

639
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,180
Gary Hall was writing for the New York Times about this event.

640
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,020
And I'm starting to read him.

641
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,720
It was a Cameron'sغandbank investigatory Quiun, de BerGMox.

642
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:35,860
Yeah.

643
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,420
Luckily, that will never happen to us, right, Dave?

644
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,600
Well, I'm sure it'll happen to me.

645
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,800
But I think it could be protracted.

646
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,520
What do you mean, will?

647
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,040
Everybody gets it a little bit.

648
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,120
Everybody gets it a little bit when they, you know, when you turn 90 or something like that.

649
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,220
You're automatically getting a little bit more befuddled once in a while and ask questions like,

650
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,560
are we in the same building that we were just in three minutes ago?

651
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,800
90, I was going to say 16 or 17.

652
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,820
That's when it starts.

653
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:11,280
No, no, but 90 is the natural course of the river that flows through you gently,

654
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,260
through your over-muscled mind right now, I might say, as long as I'm acting like a chimp.

655
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,280
But it's 90 or even 90 years.

656
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,300
Supposedly.

657
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,180
I don't know.

658
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,640
Maybe I picked this up like a bad rash or something.

659
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,800
The average person doesn't live anywhere near that long.

660
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,020
Come on.

661
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,760
And they get stupid long before they die.

662
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,220
I can prove it.

663
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,520
I'm about to prove it with the next half hour's worth of sentences that I say.

664
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,740
So there.

665
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,800
It'll all be one repeating sentence.

666
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,240
And you'll ask it each time, every time you finish.

667
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,260
You'll ask if you've finished yet.

668
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,960
And then you'll want some more dinner.

669
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,540
And then you've already eaten.

670
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,420
And the next thing you know, you don't even like chocolate anymore unless someone smears it in your third nostril.

671
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,860
It's a hell of a...

672
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,180
Hell of a...

673
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,640
It's a hell of an afterlife.

674
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,780
Yeah.

675
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,940
A heavenly hell of an afterlife.

676
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,700
I've been thinking, Dave.

677
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,700
I was just sitting down the other day, and I was just thinking.

678
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,260
And I had this thought.

679
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:29,760
Things that are equal to the same things, I realized, are equal.

680
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,300
Logistically.

681
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,000
Logistically.

682
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,260
Or things that are equal to the same things are all equal.

683
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,700
And then I went, wait a minute.

684
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,420
If that's true, then if equals are added to equals, then the sum...

685
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,180
The sums are equal.

686
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,800
No, no.

687
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,420
It just occurred.

688
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,600
And I thought, man.

689
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,780
You'd think...

690
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:48,980
It's invalid.

691
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,240
No, no.

692
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,300
I'm certain of it.

693
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,460
And if equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.

694
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,660
This all just hit me in like a huge fit.

695
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,280
Of spasmodic brain work.

696
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,660
Well, have you tried like Avogadro's Law or Pi or any of those other...

697
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,480
Oh, it's all self...

698
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,660
It's self-evident and axiomatic.

699
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,500
These aren't mere postulates.

700
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,020
It's like two and 20 after you wrote it down.

701
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,400
Especially when you smeared your nose all over it.

702
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:20,900
I'm sorry.

703
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,960
I'm sorry.

704
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,120
You know, but it's weird how one thought leads to another.

705
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,000
The next thing I was thinking, well, you know...

706
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,020
You can draw.

707
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,740
I picked up a pencil and I said, you know, you can draw a straight line from any point to any other point.

708
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,840
I'm sorry, Lennon.

709
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,640
And if it's...

710
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
My pants are chasing.

711
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,200
I'm sorry.

712
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:55,200
I think that the little place in the back of your head between the corpus callosum and your midbrain or, you know, closer to your neck there.

713
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,700
I think you need to take a little attention off that a little bit.

714
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,280
Just like...

715
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,760
Maybe turn to the left.

716
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,020
See if you get some drippage.

717
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,940
Oh, you're just anti-intellectual.

718
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,240
No, I'm not.

719
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:06,960
I'm anti-intellectual.

720
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,640
You think I'm crazy.

721
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,840
Oh, that part's true.

722
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,740
I definitely do think you're quite mad.

723
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,640
I know this for a fact.

724
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,360
And others would corroborate it, wouldn't they, we?

725
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,020
Yes.

726
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,920
Well, I don't know.

727
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,820
Try this experiment.

728
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:24,820
If you draw a circle and you can describe any point as the center.

729
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,000
And with a radius, the radius is going to be equal to any finite straight line drawn from the center.

730
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,900
The center of that circle.

731
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,420
Try it.

732
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,140
You'll be shocked.

733
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,540
But if you do that, it will come true every single time.

734
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,640
But how can you draw an infinite line?

735
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,900
It's a circle.

736
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,340
It's not...

737
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,940
Well, it can be infinitely large or infinitely small, I suppose.

738
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,560
But measuring it becomes a problem.

739
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,140
But on the other hand...

740
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,500
Now, this one...

741
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,740
Whether this is true or not requires measurement.

742
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,860
And you can't...

743
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,660
You can't...

744
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,020
That's...

745
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,040
There's something phylogistically incorrect, though.

746
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,880
In your...

747
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,740
Assumption, it's kind of like a closed state or something that doesn't really exist.

748
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,560
It's an ideal state.

749
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,000
No, that's different than...

750
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,620
Well, I don't know.

751
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,400
If you keep...

752
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,040
Infinity cannot be measured, though, by its nature.

753
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,220
Of course.

754
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,220
Which is, you know, running around barren...

755
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,500
Well, no.

756
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,680
You're limited by your tools, of course.

757
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,980
But in theory, in pure...

758
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,940
The pure thought that I was having that just occurred to me one day.

759
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,620
For instance...

760
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,260
Well, now, if I think about it...

761
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,620
If you...

762
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,840
Say you inscribe a bunch of triangles inside of a circle.

763
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,640
Well, each of those triangles is going to have a flat end.

764
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,520
So how can you...

765
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,800
How can it ever be a circle?

766
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,860
But if you make them ever smaller, ever more diminishing triangles,

767
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,980
they can become closer and closer.

768
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,660
And so that their bases start to sit on the circumference.

769
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,580
And eventually, of course, it becomes ridiculous.

770
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,420
Reducto ad infinitum.

771
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:57,740
Ridiculous.

772
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,940
Not even a computer would be able to figure it out.

773
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,460
And you'd just have pie in your face.

774
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,340
Because it would just be an irrational...

775
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:04,800
It'd be irrational.

776
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,400
And that was another thing.

777
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,520
I thought, some numbers make sense.

778
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,860
Irrationality, yes.

779
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,280
Some numbers make good sense.

780
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,360
Like one, two, three, even two and a half.

781
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,280
Three and a half.

782
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,440
But then you got these crazy numbers.

783
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,920
Like when you start trying to...

784
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,060
A square root of two.

785
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,300
Well, what are you going to do with that?

786
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,160
Well, if you like to play with...

787
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,760
You keep calculating it, and it just doesn't end.

788
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,980
It's like the triangles inside the circle.

789
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,200
It's like the repetition in nines.

790
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,780
In multiplication, addition, and subtraction.

791
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,620
And division.

792
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,780
The nines resurface.

793
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,800
And it's the basis for numerology.

794
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,080
But it was once a jolly, jolly, nice arithmetic system.

795
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,980
Which was supplied by the system of ten.

796
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,260
Which is a commercial system, as we all know.

797
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,860
We studied our archaeology.

798
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,380
And closely examined our nasal hair.

799
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,000
Well, the superior numeral system was the third.

800
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,720
Yeah, but it wasn't a 30-based one.

801
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,860
No, 60.

802
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,620
60-based.

803
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,740
Because you can divide 60 by more numbers than you could ever divide 10 by.

804
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,100
It's complicated though.

805
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:17,580
And there's a reason why the Mesopotamians finally dropped it, and picked up that silly

806
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,600
10-based thing.

807
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,100
Just cause everybody had 10 fingers.

808
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,220
Well, what about some of us with nine fingers?

809
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,740
Or 11 fingers?

810
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,040


811
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,560
Where are we to be in this brave new world of proofs?

812
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,240
Odd.

813
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,980
Very odd.

814
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:30,980


815
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:30,980


816
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,100
Odd?

817
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:31,980
Just odd.

818
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,360
You're calling me odd because I have 15 fingers and 45 feet?

819
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:36,880
Yes.

820
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,400
You calling me odd?

821
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,960
Well, no.

822
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,720
I'm not 45 actual feet.

823
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,620
45 temporal three-visit feet.

824
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:56,940
Well, now speaking of 45, it's what's really relaxing and reassuring to know is that all right angles are equal to each other.

825
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,680
If they're right angles, they're all equal to each other.

826
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,460
Same exact damn thing.

827
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,160
That just blows my mind, dude.

828
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,720
I sat down scribbling on a napkin.

829
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,980
I drew a little triangle.

830
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,040
I said, okay, now see, I got this triangle that I drew has two equal sides.

831
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,360
Oh, my God, the angles on the two opposite sides are exactly equal to each other.

832
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:28,120
And I just thought, if that's true, then what if you drew two straight lines?

833
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,480
The cross?

834
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:29,800
The cross.

835
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,740
The cross each other, not parallel.

836
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,560
They cross each other.

837
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,660
That's going to form four angles, and the opposite angles are always going to be equal.

838
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,120
But there is hope.

839
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,540
There is hope in this world.

840
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,360
Because there's symmetry?

841
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:49,260
Because there's some tiny, tiny bit of order, and at least I finally started thinking of it.

842
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,540
You know, I don't know.

843
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,440
It seems to me like, you know, from this basis, you could carry on.

844
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,640
You could build a whole science out of it.

845
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,460
Just like the Nazis.

846
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,880
That's the problem with your thinking right now.

847
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,300
You're rediscovering the laws of mathematics, the old ones,

848
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,840
and then you're making up some new ones that are hypothetically true based on your syllogistic logic.

849
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,820
However, you haven't taken it to its furthest extent.

850
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,480
You, on the one hand, say all angles were 45 circle degrees.

851
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,360
You know, that's stuff you learn in high school, everything like that.

852
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:21,820
What?

853
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:28,300
And then you've moved on to the second level where you've extrapolated somehow that everything is everything.

854
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,320
I didn't.

855
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:29,520
I didn't.

856
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,320
I didn't learn any of that stuff in high school.

857
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,660
They lied to me.

858
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,180
They just drew a bunch of crazy symbols on a chalkboard, and I was supposed to understand what was going on.

859
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:43,900
Of course, that was before my parents found out that I was effectively blind and also deaf.

860
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,680
But that hadn't slowed me down a bit.

861
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,740
I figure I worked all this stuff out on my own.

862
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:57,000
Do you know if you divide a circle exactly in half that its diameter will bisect it?

863
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,520
That perfectly?

864
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,420
And then it becomes a semicircle.

865
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,200
And any angle inscribed in that semicircle, guess what kind of an angle it's going to be?

866
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,520
A right angle.

867
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,000
Because if it was something else, it'd be the wrong angle.

868
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,420
Oh, now that was planned.

869
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,680
I could hear the dissonant sound of like a German or a neo-Nazi or maybe we probably could.

870
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,600
And I got to looking at that picture.

871
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,220
I was looking at that picture of the circle and I was thinking,

872
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,600
what if he made like a board?

873
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,940
A board that was shaped like that.

874
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,500
It could, you could move it and set it upright kind of,

875
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,360
and it would move easier than if it was laying down on its flat surface.

876
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,580
You'd have to drag it.

877
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,420
But if you put it upright, you could roll it.

878
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,860
And if you put a stick between that circle and another circle,

879
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,360
you could put a damn box on it and you wouldn't have to drag the box anywhere.

880
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:57,900
You could.

881
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,460
You could roll it.

882
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,480
And I thought, man, what an invention.

883
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,060
Only a subgenius could come up with this same thing over and over again.

884
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,880
I'm pretty sure I thought of it the week before last too.

885
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,420
You've lost a genius ear-shaking now.

886
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,040
There's not a wink of curiosity in any of this ostracage.

887
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:27,100
This is just the main lines of three critter violence and unusual behavior from out in the motor vehicle zones that we're so fond of lately.

888
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,100
It seems like everybody,

889
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,580
it seems like everybody,

890
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,980
wants to get there before they have any time to get there.

891
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,140
And next thing you know,

892
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,880
all mathematics equals all mathematics.

893
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,880
What does that have to do with mathematics?

894
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,060
And how could, I mean,

895
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,640
I guess I wasn't making any sense.

896
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,700
But now that Dave talks, I can see the sense in it.

897
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,700
I think it's the,

898
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,580
I think all that other stuff I was talking must have been a bunch of gobbledygook.

899
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,460
What you gonna do with that?

900
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,220
What is the point of knowing all these stupid angles and circles?

901
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,380
And pies and slices?

902
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,280
Well, before you invented the wheel,

903
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,780
it was the fact that I thought you were gonna lay it,

904
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:15,580
put an overlay on this huge circle that was divided into quadrants and also into like degrees and stuff of 360 of which there are 90 in this circle.

905
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,620
And 24 times 90 is 360.

906
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:26,440
And then you would put a solar map or perhaps even a map of the constellations.

907
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,280
It would be the overlay.

908
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,820
You could use it for mapping.

909
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:37,320
And you could tell how long it would take to get to Pegasus or Thesaurus or any of those other playthroughs that lived down there.

910
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,980
The constellation Thesaurus.

911
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,520
The dinosaur.

912
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,680
Also known as, also known as, also known as.

913
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,680
God-saurus.

914
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,860
Theosaurus, Theos-Thesaurus,

915
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,060
also known as the God lizard.

916
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,980
Is the most famous constellation in the night sky.

917
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,460
Even the primitives recognize the,

918
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,900
the head of the Tyrannosaurus and the tip of its tail, which we call the North Star.

919
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:17,280
And it was like, I think it was around midsummer time when the savages would grind their nuts into a firm paste and spread it out equally in four different portions of the wind.

920
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,760
I guess, northeast, south and west, which you can divide up into a thermometer too if you want to go that far.

921
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,120
Yeah, then you get your circles and your radii and all that stuff.

922
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,260
Yeah, then you get your circles and your radii and all that stuff.

923
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,780
You can do lobotomy, you know, you can test your barometric pressure.

924
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,200
You can do all kinds of stuff like that, but I think science is not Fortean.

925
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,940
It's, it's weak.

926
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,980
It just proves Reverend Stang's mind works in circles.

927
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,040
That's it.

928
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,020
Great men run in circles.

929
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,240
Too many video games.

930
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:57,420
It's like, you know, you discover something like you discover Avogadro's law or pi or nines or any of the other math stunts and stuff.

931
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,000
And you go, never mind, I'm sorry.

932
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,080
I got flat-swinged for a minute and I forgot everything was catching fire, so.

933
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,840
Them scientists, them scientists is stupid.

934
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,660
I think once they understand all this stuff and then they start to play around at the end, I think they're crazy.

935
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,140
You know, I could tell.

936
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,660
Wait a minute, are you saying that my...

937
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:27,400
I came up with a weapon that would automatically listen to everyone and shoot them at the same time and then heal them.

938
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,400


939
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,620
I'm in charge of that.

940
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,800
Or something like that, you know.

941
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:37,380
Maybe I should erase those notes I made about the circles and lines and stuff because that could lead to weapons.

942
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,640
That would be terrible.

943
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,840
It's best not to have knowledge.

944
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,000
Knowledge is, there are things that man was not meant to know.

945
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,740
And we've learned this from monster movie after monster movie.

946
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:56,940
When man dares to play God and trespasses into the realms of the world.

947
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,380
When man dares to play God and trespasses into the realms of the world.

948
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,760
When man is but a result of the divine, why...

949
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:07,640
Who will be surprised when Gorgo comes back to rescue her child.

950
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,460
And she turns out to be a lot bigger than baby Gorgo.

951
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,520
I thought baby Gorgo was big monster.

952
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,240
Like, go see mama Gorgo.

953
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,940
Well, that's where them scientist stuff will get ya.

954
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,240
Global warming.

955
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,760
It was cold yesterday.

956
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,500
It was so stupid.

957
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,920
See, that's where you can't tell your husband's from your business.

958
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,340
in this. You're so

959
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,780
inorderated of these different

960
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,260
functions that you're

961
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,760
considering right now. If they've all run

962
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,440
together right square in your mid-range,

963
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,420
close to your corpus callosum,

964
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,660
that part there where all the lines

965
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,680
go in different directions and tell different

966
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,860
parts of your brain different stuff you don't want

967
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,560
to communicate.

968
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,560
So, you've

969
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,720
got a hold of that, sure, but you're

970
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,820
just grasping it too firmly, and I think

971
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,080
you're going to put it out of its misery.

972
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,600
Oh, no.

973
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,740
It sounds like the isthmus

974
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,140
of business to me.

975
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,800
Of business, yeah.

976
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,480
But

977
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,800
Stan is only a commercial entrepreneur

978
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,020
on paper.

979
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,160
In reality, he's more like a

980
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,100
dandy.

981
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,480
An interstellar fop. Goes to different

982
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,420
planets and makes speeches.

983
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,500
He gets paid in

984
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,060
U.S. dollars, but

985
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,340
you know, who's paying

986
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,680
the checks? That's what I want to know.

987
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,900
Or the Slovenians.

988
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,400
Oh, Dave's...

989
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,260
That's a good question.

990
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,580
Okay, I get the hint, Dave. I get the hint.

991
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,260
Good question.

992
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,480
Okay, the checks. Okay, it's in the mail, okay?

993
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,820
No, I was talking

994
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,080
about the X, you know,

995
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,380
the X marks the

996
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,940
people, or whatever they are,

997
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,420
who signed them

998
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,220
for you.

999
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,980
I can't breathe.

1000
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,680
No, I'm all right.

1001
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,800
People don't even sign checks anymore.

1002
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,320
No, that's why

1003
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,700
cursive writing has come to a

1004
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,100
dismal end.

1005
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,680
And we're going to lose our...

1006
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,020
Well, we're not going to lose our thumb

1007
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,540
because of texting and stuff.

1008
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,320
I'm glad that appendage,

1009
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,580
the good old thumb,

1010
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,180
good for putting in people's nostrils

1011
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,280
or eyes or ears to throw them off

1012
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,940
balance and perhaps

1013
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,080
fight with them or...

1014
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,100
It's important for

1015
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,180
flipping coins and snapping your fingers.

1016
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,440
Have you done that with your tongue?

1017
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,740
The coin flipping?

1018
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,720
No, I have not.

1019
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,820
Yeah, because that...

1020
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,700
It's pretty poisonous and toxic.

1021
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,540
I guess this whole family

1022
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,880
of Amish people somewhere close to where we're not

1023
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,520
right now, we're not really there

1024
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,340
right now.

1025
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,520
But they all threw mushrooms

1026
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,260
together with coins

1027
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,140
to see if there was any copper meaning

1028
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,540
poison in the mushrooms.

1029
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,660
And they didn't know that there was

1030
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,100
no copper in pennies anymore.

1031
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,740
And so then they ate the mushrooms

1032
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,360
and then they...

1033
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,960
I had a public execution

1034
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,680
or...

1035
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,540
election or erection

1036
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,120
or one of those words that starts with that E.

1037
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,500
Oh my God, I just realized something.

1038
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,420
Given a straight line and any point not on this line

1039
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,760
through that point, there's only one line

1040
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,560
that's parallel to the given line.

1041
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,260
Good God.

1042
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,460
Do you realize what this means?

1043
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,800
One could invent a calculating machine.

1044
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,460
An abacus, if you will.

1045
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:26,860
Perhaps.

1046
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,580
Or a tiny microchip computer

1047
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,920
from 1983.

1048
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,080
Or he could just hire some brainiac.

1049
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,020
But where am I going to get the money

1050
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,180
to hire the smart guy?

1051
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,200
Rob the 7-Eleven!

1052
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,580
Okay, I've got it figured out.

1053
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,900
I know where we're going from here.

1054
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,340
He's somehow obsessed

1055
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,380
with straight lines between points.

1056
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,800
I don't know what happened,

1057
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,180
but something has happened.

1058
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,160
It had to do with the timeline.

1059
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:53,740
They're finite.

1060
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,980
That's the interesting thing.

1061
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,840
The reassuring thing...

1062
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,060
is as long as it's between points,

1063
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,580
then you can get some kind of a handle on it.

1064
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,320
It's when you take one of them damn points away,

1065
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,140
you better leave that one to Bob.

1066
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,780
Let Bob follow that line.

1067
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,420
Because ain't nobody but Bob's going to come to the end of that little booger.

1068
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,020
It's a godzillion points long.

1069
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,840
That's the party line he's been following for quite some time.

1070
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,780
Oh yeah?

1071
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,520
Well, if you're so smart, Mr. Holy Man,

1072
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,500
what about a godzillion and one?

1073
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,380
Well, I don't know.

1074
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:26,380


1075
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:26,380


1076
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:26,380


1077
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,520
Is there a number so big that God can't count up to it?

1078
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,160
No, that's more like a little 11-amplifier.

1079
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,320
Come on, Padre.

1080
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,060
Come on, that's got to be an answer.

1081
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,420
I like the way you call me Padre like that.

1082
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,120
I can just see you like ripping the chest hair off.

1083
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,180
Well, it's actually a merkin you're wearing right now,

1084
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,000
but ripping your chest hair off.

1085
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,500
Bless me, Father, thrive soon.

1086
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,000
Three times in the last 45 seconds.

1087
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,400
That's Catholic.

1088
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:55,840
No, no, no.

1089
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,160
Some Catholic priests aren't pedophiles, Dave.

1090
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,460
You shouldn't spread those kind of stereotypes.

1091
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,480
There are some that don't molest little boys.

1092
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:05,880
What's that have to do with the chest merkin?

1093
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,420
No, that's the Egyptian mystery scribe priest.

1094
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,480
That's a whole different cult altogether.

1095
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,420
They don't have chest hair.

1096
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,400
They've wounded themselves with toilet or lacquer.

1097
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,120
How about them Amazon ladies?

1098
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,260
I bet they didn't have chest hairs.

1099
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,820
I think they just pushed one booby down a little bit.

1100
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,920
They were real hard and stuff.

1101
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,220
And so if they had to shoot a bow and arrow,

1102
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,620
if they were left-handed in their...

1103
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,540
Never mind, that isn't worth seeing.

1104
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,100
Now, okay, if an Amazonian was in a rock band and played guitar,

1105
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,800
which side of her shoulder would she put the strap on?

1106
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,100
Um...

1107
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,060
Say she was in a topless guitar.

1108
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,820
The reason I ask this is I saw a picture on the internet earlier today.

1109
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:03,360
Of a 60s all-woman rock band who performed in strip clubs without their shirts on.

1110
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,160
And wouldn't you know it, the subgeniuses were all going,

1111
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,040
wow, look at their guitars.

1112
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,580
Whoa, look at those old retro synthesizers.

1113
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,480
I'm like slapping my head going,

1114
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:24,280
boys, do we need to go back to sex ed 101 subgenius kindergarten style?

1115
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,520
Does Kegazongas mean anything to you at all, lad?

1116
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,240
That was, I couldn't, I couldn't...

1117
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,500
I think you're forgetting some of the most important things in life.

1118
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,720
I thought I was weird.

1119
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,260
Jeez, man.

1120
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,700
Now, there's some of them that don't think a girl is pretty

1121
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,560
unless she doesn't look like a girl.

1122
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:46,320
She has to look like a drawing and have the head of a beast.

1123
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,600
An animal.

1124
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,180
No, I'm not kidding.

1125
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,860
There's a lot of people out there who have conventions now.

1126
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,800
No, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.

1127
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,720
I'm just saying, God, that's weird.

1128
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:03,200
Yeah, really, how far are they going to go with this sort of...

1129
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,800
It makes me want to bully them, you know?

1130
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,640
It makes the bullying come out in me.

1131
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,020
To me, it just makes the sarcastic critical,

1132
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,620
now I'm going to go and hang myself part of them and come out.

1133
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,420
Of course, that's a...

1134
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,220
Well, that took long enough.

1135
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:18,700
God.

1136
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,160
Almost the whole show.

1137
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,700
Usually we get into that point by the, you know,

1138
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,600
the 25-minute mark.

1139
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,720
No, no, I always find our conversations,

1140
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,700
you and we are illuminating and exciting and somewhat fabricating,

1141
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,220
at least, you know, from a suburban standpoint.

1142
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:41,320
And I just like, I drool on my pants when I think of the many years

1143
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,320
that you've managed to, you know, push this fall to roll

1144
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,540
and have it fling so well.

1145
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:51,440
I think I'll owe you a debt of gratitude and maybe more than $30,

1146
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,480
but you're never going to get it, so why worry about it?

1147
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,540
And so there.

1148
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,060
I mean, it is a valid means of expression for some very lonely,

1149
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,940
inarticulate, substandard people, but we keep trying.

1150
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,640
We keep working towards that goal, comrade, whatever that might mean.

1151
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,360
Um, the goal.

1152
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,100
The goal.

1153
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:15,780
Yeah, that's right.

1154
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,440
The subgenus must have slack.

1155
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,460
I knew there was a reason for all this.

1156
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,220
Yes, that is the goal.

1157
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,940
The slack is most important to me.

1158
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,680
The subgenus must have slack.

1159
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:24,680


1160
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,360
The subgenus must have slack.

1161
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,900
Okay, well, that settles it.

1162
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,660
Now all we have to do is figure out what slack is.

1163
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,920
For each and every single dues-paying subgenus.

1164
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,100
The gimme bobs, we don't have to worry about them.

1165
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,180
They think they get slack, but it's false slack.

1166
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,460
And as Reverend Carter LeBlanc said, he said this.

1167
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:49,880
He said, as G. Gordon Gordon said, false slack is better than no slack at all.

1168
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,600
But false slack is no slack at all.

1169
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,300
So there.

1170
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,300
Praise Carter LeBlanc.

1171
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1172
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,220
Praise be upon him.

1173
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,040
For his knees are wobbly and his ears are strong and weak.

1174
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,820
About time.

1175
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,260
Hey, I have a conundrum in the last two.

1176
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:13,540
Oh, wow, man.

1177
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,620
I got one of those one time and I couldn't fit it all in right.

1178
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,060
Well, we've only got about two and a half minutes left in the show for conundruming.

1179
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,200
And my conundrum is.

1180
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:32,620
Now, I've been playing songs lately by a subgenius called Reverend Max Slack.

1181
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,540
Yes, yes.

1182
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:41,880
And and it's because I was I've been assembling a new set of subgenius albums.

1183
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,540
Actually, Suds and Pisces Pasha have been helping me.

1184
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,040
We've been trying to assemble three new Bob songs albums.

1185
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,220
Praise Suds and Pasha.

1186
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,180
And there were two Max old songs by Max Slack.

1187
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,080
On each album.

1188
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,340
And we were about to release them.

1189
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,700
But I thought I talked to that guy forever.

1190
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,960
So I emailed him and said, we're thinking of using your various songs and they're going to be down.

1191
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,280
They'll be pay per download.

1192
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,680
They're not going to be on a.

1193
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,840
Well, they were actually I would also put them on a CD.

1194
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,740
And Max Slack said, no.

1195
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:23,260
He said, you can play my music for free on your radio show.

1196
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,620
And you can give it away for free, but you can't give it away.

1197
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,080
You can't charge money for it.

1198
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:33,600
And I said, OK, what if we charge for the other songs on the album but not charge for yours?

1199
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:39,080
He goes, no, you can't play my song in any collection that has that makes any money for anybody.

1200
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,160
So.

1201
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,640
First thing I thought was, well, he must be rich.

1202
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:49,600
And the second thing I thought was, well, that's a shame because I can't afford to give his stuff away for free.

1203
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,160
So I have to quit giving it away for free.

1204
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:52,580
But he did.

1205
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,180
Send me one last song.

1206
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:58,840
So this will be the last of the Max Slack songs.

1207
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:07,560
But if you want to hear more of them, he's at his stuff is all at the easy to remember site called Max Slack dot net.

1208
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,660
Don't you see?

1209
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,020
You can sign that right here.

1210
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,400
Max Slack dot net.

1211
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:19,760
And I think I can play his his last song, which is called The Funny Side.

1212
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,980
And this is the last.

1213
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:29,480
Time I can give his stuff away for free because I'm going to play those other songs again on the show for another five years.

1214
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,900
There'll be a rerun.

1215
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:35,320
So and we can't put them.

1216
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:46,360
We can't distribute them in a way that would make money because I guess some subgenius is are simply allergic or they're already overdosed on money.

1217
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,480
Or there's so much cooler than me that I can't even imagine.

1218
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:58,360
But the other thing is, when I when I had to remove two songs from those three albums, had to replace them with stuff.

1219
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:06,780
The six fisted tales of Connie stuff that we found that was recorded at X days over the years was so much more subgenius.

1220
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,260
So I'm happy.

1221
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,540
Anyway, Dave, we have to go now.

1222
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,900
Well, just before going, I'd like to say who cares about your happiness, man?

1223
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,640
I mean, I'm more concerned with my own.

1224
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,580
But on that note.

1225
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:24,560
Okay, I ran Bob put it in on Randy.

1226
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,320
He did.

1227
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,580
Yeah, Bob put it in on Rand.

1228
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,960
So it's a show just last week.

1229
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,360
No.

1230
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,340
Okay, Colonel.

1231
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,600
See you later.

1232
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,460
Finger licking good.

1233
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:38,820
I.

1234
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,260
I.

1235
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,020
I.

1236
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,140
I.

1237
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:44,460


1238
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,260
I.

1239
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:45,600


1240
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,300
I.

1241
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,460
I.

1242
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:47,660
I.

1243
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:54,500
You got to like if not, you hurt.

1244
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,720
I you got to.

1245
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,340
If not you cry.

1246
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,600
See the bunny side?

1247
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,860
Is a sunny side.

1248
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,620
The place we love.

1249
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,280
The funny side.

1250
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,500
is the sunny side

1251
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,920
can't get enough

1252
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,720
you know what to do

1253
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,920
if they can't take a joke

1254
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,440
you know what to do

1255
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,640
if they can't take a joke

1256
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,480
you see the funny side

1257
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,740
is the sunny side

1258
