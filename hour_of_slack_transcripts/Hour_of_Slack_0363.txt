I'm afraid here it is.
We're being aware of it.
And now, the Self Genius Hour of Slack!
I think that we're both confused now.
And we're saying we need to know what's going on.
We're both crazy and it's great.
It's great.
Yeah, baby, give me a call.
I'll take care of that problem.
God bless you.
While this song is blasting, let me take the echo down.
You can come over here and share this mic.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Psychopath Finder,
I'd like you to meet the Reverend Ivan Stang.
Oh, my God.
My Lord.
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, I've been listening to your show for minutes.
Minutes and minutes.
I've been...
That's one of our tens of fans.
You were talking about my dad, Arnold Stang.
Yes, he was the original Chunky Man.
No, wasn't he?
No, no, why did you...
We're so slow to acknowledge the fact that you're...
He was the original.
Some of his work.
Well, some of his work, I think, was monumental
as far as the delivery was concerned.
We like to remember him best with...
Hercules in New York.
With Arnold Schwarzenegger.
The two Arnolds, the great...
The great...
Oh, it feels so good to be back on the air.
I just don't feel real unless...
But where are the headphones?
I feel like I'm naked.
Oh, there's some.
I'll grab these.
Then I'll know...
Can you say Chunky Choo-a-click?
Oh, that's so much better.
Oh, I feel the power now.
It's a form of...
It's a kind of power that leaves you very quickly, though.
I'm afraid a lot of people have to resort...
To unusual, like, baths and ointments.
You must do one thing.
Oh, keep rubbing those ointments on.
Oh, that feels so good.
Okay, you can't do...
Well, you guys, this isn't great.
This station is so much...
You can't do it too much.
I'll let you...
I'm sorry.
They don't...
They don't...
They don't take such good care of us...
Do we know...
...at the Dallas station.
Well, I...
They attribute at least...
We don't get the ointments.
For one moment, to the mighty breaths of the Salvador Dali partner...
I thought it was spa time again.
Jays, it's time for your final slogan...
The weather man...
Something...
Something...
Something...
Something...
material?
Alas.
What in the world?
D governo مس� makes him an oasis of death?

Goodbye.

I was on my cult team...
I was on my cultиля goline...
M stream.


I see.

You're gonna stay?
I'll be...
Okay.
All right.
You wouldn't play dumb there if it's the smart bar, right?
Well, it won't be called the smart bar when we're through with it.
What's it going to be called?
I don't know, but we'll take any brain cells that were available,
any extra brain cells, the ones you don't need.
Friends, if you come to the smart bar, you'll leave so stupid and so, so happy.
You will have slack.
You'll have slack just running down your pants leg.
It's such a lovely, lovely thing.
To have that love snot.
Hi.
You can't say love snot.
It's not midnight yet, is it?
What?
Hello?
What kind of a station is this?
I'm going to call the SEC right now.
What type of station is this?
I'll take a look.
You talk, you're on the air with Reverend Ivan Stang, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,
and a room full of people.
We have a cast of zillions.
Did you check out the retinue that accompanied me into this station?
I got a question, Reverend.
The wives of Bob who are here?
The wives of Bob?
Yes, including Sister Mary Squarely.
I could tell by the way they were emanating, you know, that halo thing?
Because I never saw that before.
And the little black patch that appears over their eyes as if by magic.
My retinues were damaged through dark abuse.
What is the meaning of slack as to by when whom by them?
Because many don't know, because there are a lot of 12 year olds who, uh,
we have many 12 year olds.
Yeah, they're...
And they need to be told.
And demographically and vision power.
People have lied to them about slack.
They've said slack is working for a living.
Uh, they've said slack is being responsible citizen.
Obviously, you know, I mean, in our school system today,
that they would teach the children things like that.
Slack, those who know don't say, and those who say don't know.
You know that.
We shouldn't even be talking about it.
Well, we have to preach the message of slack now.
Even though the nuns know.
The nuns know slack.
Know slack.
None for me.
No slack.
None for me.
Yes, just say no to slack.
Go ahead, do what the conspiracy of the normal people says.
Just say no to slack.
That's what they want you to...
That's not...
I mean, they are not just telling you to say no to drugs.
They're telling you to say no to things that I'm not allowed to say on the radio.
Frextits.
Yeah, for instance...
Thought control.
Frextits.
Forensics.
Forensics.
Forensics slack investigations reveal that when J.R. Bob Dobbs was shot and, well, they
like to say killed, that what ran out of those head wounds was pure slack, not blood.
And it was bottled by the greedy vampires there on the stage.
And we have bought those little vials of Bob's blood for sale.
Ah, yes, if you'll just send us your love offering, we'll send you back a tiny vial of
the blood of J.R. Bob Dobbs, a proven aphrodisiac, and Hurricane Bob water, and JFK brain parts.
There's a Hurricane Bob water?
Talk about your head launchings, man.
That was quite a splattage, but what is Hurricane water, the holy water of Bob?
Hurricane Bob?
Yes.
Hurricane Bob water.
You know, there were two Hurricane Bobs this decade.
Hurricane Bob, when Bob voids his water, it can become a vast maelstrom, a vortex of...
That was the voice of the Magma Lin.
What those hurricanes was Bob was, uh, disflatting himself.
He was flatulat- pyroflatulating, we call it, like Mount St. Helens.
There's pyroflatulat-
The pyroflatulation of Bob.
Uh, and or, and or, you never know about Connie, though.
She's more ladylike.
I mean...
Hers are more like the mud springs that, in the Hawaiian Islands, you know, just kind of blurping.
Oh.
Oh, ain't that so true.
Who is that singing?
I think it's Doris Day with a herniated thing, or, no, it's, um, Plasmy, uh, Claudine Lange, doing her True Colors.
Colors.
Her...
Spelled with a U.
Oh, that's her Colostomy Bag album, right?
That's the one.
That's the one that got her banned in Brazil and four or five other countries with, uh, hard to pronounce names.
You know, have you heard the rumors about Frank Sinatra and the Colostomy Bag?
Well, I, I, one was alluded to, uh, but I didn't, what did you hear?
That's what I heard, and you don't, I mean...
Right. When you're talking about the man, you know...
Yeah, let's not, uh, well, you don't want to do an Albert Goldman on him, and, you know...
Yeah, you could find a horse in your shopping cart or something. Or, no.
That's right. That's exactly right.
I would not spread any rumors about Frank Sinatra unless I was completely, completely...
I have something in my throat.
Oh, here, let me get it.
Oh!
Oh, went.
Boy, there's a bunch of them. Look at that. They're like little pearls on a string.
Keep, keep moving it.
Hey, I bet that feels good, doesn't it?
Uh, it felt better, I think.
Oh, there's the last one. Oh, it had a little fish hook on it.
What is that squirming thing at the end of it?
I was floundering on Long Island in the spring, uh, this, uh, yesterday.
Let's cook it up, man.
Okay, uh, if you're ready.
Oh, okay.
Let's cook it up.
Now, that's real home, home style down, home style. That's a meal in one, I think, isn't it? Or three?
Now I feel like I need to clear my throat.
Oh, uh, what?
No, I've got one, too.
Oh, Christ almighty, that thing is pink. What the...
It's glowing.
Kill it! Kill it!
How did, how did you drive here? What way did you take to get here?
Oh, we went through the flats.
Yeah, well, that explains that thing. It's burning a hole in the floor. Somebody put some water on this thing.
Oh, that won't, that won't stop. It'll burn its way through a spaceship hole.
There it goes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And if you go to the Smart Bar, you can have these things burst out of your chest, too.
And some of them may land there and never come out.
That's the best kind, the ones that you can keep as little pets deep inside you.
They speak to you late at night when no one else can hear them.
Little tiny cerebral sea monkeys that lodge in your notochord, I think.
Like a little family living in your stomach.
Well...
Did you ever buy sea monkeys? Did you ever order sea monkeys?
No, I captured some and enslaved them once at a house somewhere south of here, but there was an ongoing investigation.
I remember them well, though. They smiled at me. They were happy. They were...
I loved them. I did love them. That's why I had to do what I had to do.
I, I can't... I don't know how to love. I, I, I don't know how.
If you are a victim of...
Codependency on sea monkey...
Sex...
Please call 823-749-0567-1974...
...
Now, that's the apocalypse number. Now, if you want the regular 800 number, just hang around by the dumpster for a few more hours.
Some of you have been there for a while.
Okay, nothing's changed yet.
I can't wait for a signal.
Okay.
I remember this song. God, that was a great band.
Was that brain cancer?
I think it was brain cancer. That was when they, uh, the, the, the lizard women were slashing their wrists.
It was like a group of four or five people, and they dedicated themselves to jump off that precipice and do that for, for...
There was no reason. There was no reason. It was senseless.
Is that what they used to call cock rock, or was that glitter rock?
That was glitter clock...
...clock rock.
Glitter clock rock. It was elliptical. You know, I mean, I don't...
It was, man. That was, uh, I was elliptical. I was at one of their concerts.
I kept coming back.
Yeah.
Or going around and around, or something. Yeah, I got, but after a while, the one guy...
...
The, the one feller, I think he died of a heroin overdose, or heroin, heroin, uh, something.
Yeah, it's a shame, people, in our...
...in our...
...in our great land feel the need for those sorts of false slack.
Those taking them laughers and screamers, popping them vomit ultrasauruses and little P-dog pills and anti-P-dog pills, which are called, uh, uh, bladder control pad tat tablets.
It's a sad thing.
And, you know...
...they need slack. They need slack. And they can get slack.
Well, here's some slack that they can get.
Hey! Where'd that voice come from?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Magical world of radio.
Oh! We've got someone in the studio over there.
Okay. Uh, no, the slack that the public can get tonight, immediately...
...is probably not.
...will be giving away a pair of tickets to the rant and rave at the Smart Bar...
...this coming Saturday...
No, that wasn't...
...the third.
It was...
One pair.
It was actually many, many Saturdays ago.
The Smart Bar is in another city where you can't go.
What do these girls have to do to qualify for these special rave tickets for the Smart Bar show Saturday night?
The subgenius revival of the Smart Bar...
...in Cleveland several months ago.
Find a payphone.
Find a payphone.
Find a payphone.
Find a payphone.

It's about a coinciding...
Inciding .
Inciding .

These guys in the studio. I tell you. They are clever.
How do they do that?
That's amazing!
Amazing!
It's amazing the way they move the echo tunnel in and out of this little room and...
...put it around our heads and then they...
Move the space.
Move the space.
Oh, come on!
That one got my eardrum.
They pulled it right through the headphones.
And that's what we try to do to you, dear reflection.
And that's what we try to do to you, dear reflection.
Uh-oh, I think we did it.
We were just kidding, man.
Don't call the cops.
We didn't really do that to you, dear.
We wouldn't, you know, we wouldn't want to tear your brain in half.
Not a lot.
Unless you wanted us to.
We'd tear it a little bit.
And I think...
We can blend it up.
We can...
And Connie is so good with a blender.
We can put it on liquefy.
And we could just liquefy those little tiny pieces of blended flesh.
Right on up.
Oh, I'm just wicked with a blender.
I bet some of you, boy, and some of you gals,
all some of you furry squids would love to come and take a ride
in Connie's special electronic blender.
At that amazing...
Nice show.
Connie, show them how your blender works.
Do we want to see?
Yeah, we want to see.
The special effects are cheap on that.
Let's see the blender.
Come on.
Well, you see, Reverend, you kind of push the liquefy button and...
Ooh, I say do that again.
That looks like some sort of percussion instrument.
And it gets...
Sure is.
Ooh, it's doing it now.
Oh, man.
Can I watch this on the radio?
I don't know.
You have to.
I have to.
Recommended for mature audiences only.
Parental permission required for audiences under 13.
The Smart Bar Saturday Night Subgenius Rant and Rates.
And you, you two can actually come and see in real live person.
What?
The Vistas of Loveliness right in front of me now.
Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs.
Sister Mary Squared, au contraire.
These wives of Bob will have you men clutching your scrotum in terror.
Why?
Well, I'll be...
There they go again.
Where am I? Thank you, Reverend Stagg.
Why?
Why?
I'll wind them up and they think for themselves.
And watch out, boys.
Here they come.
Tell me I'm pretty.
Oh, I want to holler that the town's too small.
Yeah.
Thank you, sister.
Thank you.
Thank you, sister.
Dancing men.
Live dancing men.
Dancing men.
Big dancing men.
And great big drinks.
You know what?
It's great being a subgenius preacher.
You get to preach to a big room full of sinners that are all drunk.
Now, you know, some of these more regular preachers, that's too much of a challenge for them.
They'd rather go to a...
Sure.
It's...
They'd rather have a smelly tent.
They can't...
They can't language.
They can't talk the language of a...
of a drunken, obliterated...
Sinner.
Sinner.
Oh.
They...
They can't reach them.
They...
They try.
They...
They go into the void, but they...
They can't come back out.
They can't get a response.
That's...
That's right.
They don't talk the sinner's language, because they ain't sinning enough.
No, they ain't.
And I don't care what...
how much of a sinner you think you are.
You could sin more.
You could sin more if you only knew how, right?
You've got...
Sinning and grinning and sinning and grinning away.
That's what we mean here.
You've got the excuse.
Bob is the excuse.
Now all you need is a few new ideas for sins you haven't tried yet.
Yeah.
Let's think of a few sins that we haven't done recently.
How about appendix puffling?
When was the last time you puffled your appendix?
Well, come to the Smart Bar and you'll not only find out how, you'll probably see hands-on demonstration.

You can marry...
That's right.
You can marry your appendix.
And then puffle it.
And if you have qualms religiously...

Tipple your cross...
Cross...
Are you hung up with religious qualms about puffling your appendix before marriage?
You can get married Saturday night for a 24-hour period.
Yes, a mass...
But Reverend Stagg.
Short-duration marriage.
But Reverend Stagg.
Yes.
Yes, my child.
Why would we need a short-duration marriage when we have the almighty excuse in Bob?
Why would we need a short-duration marriage?
We can just go on sinning and sinning and sinning and sinning.
We don't need no marriage.
Because you want the certificate to show at the office the next day and go, you would not believe it.
You wouldn't believe what I did this weekend.
He's my friend.
If I told you what I saw Saturday night at the Smart Bar, you wouldn't even believe me.
You wouldn't even believe me.
That's what you'll be able to tell your friends Monday morning.
And besides, Reverend Stagg, it'll be their only chance to marry me and Bob.
At the same time.
And I want you all the way to number 666.
Oh!
Oh!
I'm all alone.


I'm all tired.
Let he who has wisdom know.
I'd like to remind you beings that you're listening to WC in Cleveland.
That's 89.7 FM.
And it's a radio station.
And it hurts your ears as much as it can.
And, you know, depending.
We don't want to get into any sort of insurance problems with FCC and the Federal Bureau of Demonology.
Seen here in slide number 7.
It's puzzling evidence.
Oh!
Oh!
I almost forgot.
We can't show that one on the airwaves like this.
Oh!
That one.






You don't have anything like this all night long.
You know that show goes from 6 o'clock in the evening to 6 o'clock in the morning.
12 hours of sinning, sinning, sinning.
Freed.

Steven Stan.
I'm an angel.
Hair, breathe.
Hair, breathe.
Whoa.
Yeah, I just wanted to say hello to Dan and the self-conscious rules.
The self-conscious rules?
Self-conscious does rule.
Rule number one, do not endlessly intone the rules.
Rule number two, do not endlessly intone the rules.
Rule number three, this is production control.
Could you lower the music a little bit, please?
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, production control.
You're tuned to WCSU.
No, you're not.
You're tuned to KFM 3 FM in Dallas, Texas.
Dear friends, and I suppose I probably should cut in and tell you what's going on here.
Several months ago, just before we did the first Rant and Rave show in Cleveland,
I was lucky enough to be a guest on Lonesome Cow.
The Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Scabby and Psychopath Finder show on WCSB in Cleveland.
It's a wonderful show, obviously.
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and I really hit it off in that spouting manner.
And I just got back from doing the second Rant and Rave show in Cleveland.
It was a beautiful thing.
And those wives of Bob were indeed a-preaching.
Sister Mary Squared, Princess Wee, and Sister Melodious Chops, not to mention Miss Communication.
Man, it's a different world up there in the Cleveland land.
And Pope Sterno Docks was part of that show.
And we hope to be bringing you some edited tapes from the special parts of those shows.
Those live subtenues, devivals.
In forthcoming Hour of Slack shows, you are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack,
voice of the Church of the Subgenius.
I'm your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.
And if you've never tuned in to an Hour of Slack show before,
I should point out that they're all different.
Well, every now and then, they're the same.
But for the most part, they're all different.
And this one's all different.
This is one of my favorite tape moments.
And it's 90 minutes long, so we won't even begin to get to the end of it, dear friends.
But if you do have a further interest in the Church,
and want to know just the, well, the highly organized and linear background
to the rather unlinear...
spouting that you're hearing,
you can always write for free information on the other activities of our mighty Church.
I'm going to give that post office box number.
I just got a call from somebody who sounded like they listened to the show all the time
and still didn't have that post office box number.
So obviously, we cannot say it enough.
And too much is always better than not enough.
And that number to write is post office box 140306.
In Dallas, Texas, 75214.
Once again, that's box 140306.
Dallas, Texas, 75214.
And we would be glad to let you know what's going on.
I will admit that the show, the amazing show that we constantly refer to on this tape,
actually happened in...
Cleveland many months ago.
And it's way too late for you, but...
Well, we did videotape it.
And there's always the...
Well, you could go buy...
Well, I can't...
I can't tell you what all you could go do,
because this is a public-supported radio station.
I cannot advertise our other materials and products,
and just how easy they might be to find,
where you too actually poke around.
So...
So what the heck, man?
So what the heck, man?
Production control at the smart bar.
Brian, you didn't have to turn it off just the moment.
So you, production control, you think you have control?
So you, just who has control?
So you, just who has control?
This is amazing.
We have a production control tonight.
It is not unprecedented, but...
I've never experienced production control.
That's where they clean up the sound.
You can actually understand what the personality is saying.
No, it's the other way around.
Oh, oh, oh, well, that's the kind of...
That's the kind we take.
You know, as Reverend Ron,
who's the sound maniac whiz on Saturday Night Show...
Oh, Reverend Ron.
He said,
He said,
Three can kill an elephant.
I can take five.
I don't know what he was talking about,
but you too can find out May 23rd.
That's 523 for you distorting.
At the smart bar.
And oh, it's so cheap, too.
It is.
It's cheap.
It's cheap.
It's down.
We can't tell you how much,
but it's eternal salvation or triple your money back.
Well, yes, we can't do it.
It's on your absolute...
Well, there's a fine line between...
That's one of the collars.
Now, see, they won't allow me to take collars
on the Hour of Slack show in Dallas
because we get these kids, you know, calling up.
We don't have any delay.
There's no seven-second delay.
I'm sure there isn't here either.
The kids who move, they move from Dallas.
They move from Dallas up here to harass us.
Oh, okay.
Oh, that's where those collars are.
They're not even in your town anymore.
They're just up and gone.
Well, did they come with a little collar flushing device?
You can't, you know...
I don't know.
Well, let's see.
Start pushing buttons,
and when you hear the screams of them disappearing into the vortex,
then you know you've treated the collars
just the way they really deserve
and in a way they want to be treated that way.
They look to us for leadership,
oral,
leadership.
That's A-U-R-A-L.
They like to be kicked and kicked and kicked and hit all over again.
I say, do that again.
Oh, honest.
Oh, Lord, thank you.
How could I become a reference?
Let's see, kid.
Are we able to give the price amount of a love offering?
No.
Why, my friend?
20,000 leagues under the sea.
You can give the address for information.
I can give the address for free information
on the Church of the Subgenius
and how to become a minister.
I can even give you a card.
With your little membership card
and your four giant issues of the Stark Fist of Removal
X-triple-double-X-rated magazine.
And that post office box number is,
got your pencil ready?
I bet you do.
Just, just write to Bob.
That's B-O-B.
You got it? B-O-B, Bob, B-B-Bob
at post office box
1-4-0-3-0-6
in lovely Dallas, Texas.
1-4-0-3-0-6 in lovely Dallas, Texas.
7-5-2-1-4.
Ah, yes.
Once again, now that's box 1-4-0-3-0-6.
Dallas, Texas.
7-5-2-1-4.
And I'd like to remind you all
that you are listening to E-M-O-B-S-O-R-E-A-R-N-W-C-O-S-E-R-E-A-R-N-O-C-R-E-A.
The most immediate way to see Bob
is to take a hammer,
a common, everyday hammer,
wrap, don't be silly about this,
wrap it up, wrap a cloth around it
so it's sort of blunt,
so it can't actually crack your skull
and tap yourself with some force
squarely in the center of the forehead.
You will see Bob,
although you may not be able to understand
what he's trying to tell you,
much less reach into your wallet
for the payment for the non-slap to go away.
Now, Rev Boy, I've heard that
many of your Zen boobages
had worn accoutrements like that
around their neck and had slapped themselves
to attain satori.
Now, what particular state
would a person attain to,
you know, climbing the pyramid, so to speak,
upon seeing Bob?
Would it be like a nirvanic state of bliss?
It would be what we call
control.
Contracted consciousnessnessnessnessness.
Miss? Miss?
Contracted consciousnessness,
which we're practicing right now.
We squeeze the brain
and get rid of the excess brain cells,
which caused people originally
to be able to do math
and other boring, tedious things,
jobs and so forth.
And we give the brain cells back.
Now, don't get me wrong,
we give them back after we clean them.
We wash them.
It's called brain watching, actually.
We watch the cells grow, and we put them back in, and they work very differently after that point.
You can, why, I've gone back to the clinic again and again and again, and you will too.
Could I say, for instance, jog or maybe do my laundry while I was in this contracted state of unconsciousness?
That's the best way to do your laundry.
Yeah.
Jogging, you know, it depends.
Hire clean air.
Jogging, it depends.
Yeah, it depends, or any of the other good control pads, or you can work with those.
That is to say, if you were, like, running on a pair of control pods or some sort of other device like that, if you,
oh, I'm sorry, I lost my train of contracted consciousness.
That's the idea.
Well, I'm starting to begin to understand, I think, a little bit morally more about this.
Oh, that's a bad sign.
That's a bad sign.
No, you.
Okay, it's a bad sign.
Okay.
Put the pads on your feet.
All right.
Okay, now you're ready to slide.
That's the way we do it.
You slide.
I'm afraid, though.
With the pads on your feet.
No, no, well, we'll go out to a country road or someplace to start with.
You don't want to do it next to traffic.
That's what I'm saying.
If you do it next to traffic, it will hurt you.
But if you make fun of, though, also, I mean, you know, what sort of protection as, you know, a spiritual amulet or some sort of totem could provide.
It will.
And I appreciate that fact that God gave me.
God would that for me.




Now I'll be not what it comes to.
Sir, tell me, what's wrong with your eyes?

Well, it was a wok if you liked the video, excellent for that.
For example, if I really like my life, I'll disspeare the alone thing until that very end.
If I'm too out, I'm hot, wasn't that good.
Really?
Yeah.


Now, let's see, let's see.
to demonstrate on the radio. That's okay.
Okay. And now you
put the pads on your feet.
Okay. Now, concentrate.
Really, really concentrate.
On what?
Come on. Just anything. Okay. Just concentrate
on the pads. Concentrate on the pads.
Oh, no. Look, he's leaking on the pads.
No, no, no. Don't concentrate that hard. You're leaking
the pads. Look, if they get all
encrusted like that,
they won't slide.
They won't slide. Okay. Now, get in
the boxcar. Okay. Okay.
Roll the tilt control.
That boxcar's tilting. Now, do you feel it?
Are you sliding?
We'll leave him in that boxcar
now. He's sliding.
I can feel sliding.
I can feel it.
I can feel it. Okay.
Now,
what you are experiencing is a state
of slack.
That's it?
Well, that's not all
there is to it. Now, don't be disappointed.
There's more. There's a little bit more.
It's beginning slack, okay?
But we'll need another
check before you can...
Do you have a MasterCard
or anything like that?
Because you've achieved stage
one of slack, but in order to become
completely clear, you're going to have to go
through a couple more little initiation
rituals.
...with spontaneous breast enlargement
or any other diseases.
I have a few
syndromatic diseases which I wonder
if life may be studying any kind of
you know, an exacerbated
form of religious thing would get me
into trouble, you know.
That was the spontaneous breast enlargement.
I thought you were just puffing up like the
common garden toad to frighten off
enemies as sort of a bluffing
defense. No, he
shaves his kneecaps for that.
Oh, well, that's the part
of something else, yes. And it frightens away
the predators
and other... You know how we males are, don't you?
I mean, you know, it's a thing.
You have to frighten everyone.
Oh, yeah, I know how us males...
I'm not one of those guys that
doesn't know how we are.
How does Bob, you know,
how does Bob take care of
aggression?
How does Bob take care of your
aggression?
He lets you
just have it out.
You didn't like that third grade school teacher?
No. He will
look her, he will find her, he will bring her to
Dobstown, he will put her in the gladiator pit,
the poor...
pathetic old hag, and he will
hand you the baseball bat with nails in it
and let you go at it to your heart's content
and you will... That's stage 17
of slide. That's real justice.
It's true justice.
This is an objectivist,
rationalist church, and we believe
in justice above mercy.
Justice first and mercy later.
Get the
evil, old, nasty third grade
teachers out of the way, and then we can
talk about mercy.
Well, I'm a convertible already. I can feel this.
This kind of abstract power you've been
blowering all over the place since you've walked in here.
You're starting to seep in through my body right now.
Um...
And the operations
are cheap. That can all
be corrected, but...
And we have easy credit plans
for your
personality reintegration, as we
call it in the...
What sort of people...
What sort of person needs to find...
...
...
...














debe a paramedic?
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
revolutionary uh the political uh hatred of the right wing and the left wing and the middle of
the road it's just uh an actual attack on everything and for those of you like i say
those who just love to hate but not the pathetic of just piddly little hate of oh i hate my job i
hate myself i hate president bush this is this is like the kind of hate bob has
all include galactic hate a hate so big it's bigger than most christians idea of love that's
a stinking big green hate and that's the kind of hate i could get behind take a big whiff of that
hate it's just a festering away and that's what we grow new churches from intoxicated
you
new hateful extremist groups and bizarre crackpot visionary kook stuff it all builds up from that
fine fine compost of hate all the things that ever bothered you in your life can be expelled
and sweated out when you dance your soul away there at the smart bar saturday night this is
one chance one big chance for hell don't blow it now one last is this on is this coming on
hey
is this coming on you don't have to yell into it man
i was wondering coming down i think what form like i've been in harry krishna festivals and i've
noticed the dancing there yeah hi krishna harirama here's a flower with my dollar that's what i that's
the way i heard it now when the people in churches of genius hands it what kind of figurative
outline do they do is this like a little jolly golly goose stepping or more of a mumble step
dancing or is it like square dancing or it's however the hell they want to do it it is absolutely
however you want to do you dear friend you you can dance however nobody nobody made games say
you know if you were ever a terrible and stupid look the kind of dancer that people that you just
knew people were laughing at you after 15 minutes in the smart bar saturday night you will not care
you frankly won't care what they think and that's where we're trying to get to our aim and Korra
get you. We're trying to put you in that place where you can truly say, as Bob has said so
many times, if they can't take a joke, then beep them. Beep them, my friend. Beep them
if they can't take a joke. That's what the Church of the Subgenius is based on. That
is the rock upon which this church was built. The ship that sank the beach of hypocrisy
unto which Bob built his mighty church. His edifice of glory and slack and pornography.
Now, Bob's gory edifice takes a lot out of you. It does. Oh, my hand. Ouch. It hurts
my hand so much to rant like that. When you're testifying, as you are waving your fronds
around and making those big grandiose gestures while you're pontificating. Yeah, I studied
films of Hitler to do that. And Lenny Reifestahl's School of Drama. That's right. Those little
jerky movements. It's very attention-getting. But we can't talk about the other practices.
How about Edward?
Edward Reifestahl's School of Drama. This was a famous sub-Tutonic night or something,
or afternoon or something. It was some sort of esoteric behemoth or something.
Who?
Adolf Hitler. That he had been schooled in the marginal arts of psychomimetry. Or magic,
magic it was.
But it wasn't powerful enough to defeat that of Bob, who throttled him with his bare hands
in that bunker.
Everybody wondered who did it.
And ran off with evil brawn.
He's dead, right? Bob's living, so what the hell, right?
All I found were the panties. And Kennedy's brain laying there in a jar.
All subcutaneously and simulaculously. It makes you wonder what the hell the world's
coming to all at once backwards and forwards.
We want those files released. Why is the CIA still holding on to Kennedy's brain and Eva
Braun's panties?
I think it's...
The proof of Bob is right in there. It's there.
It's necromantic though, I would say. I think these people are probably involved in some
sort of necromantic skirrage.
And they...
I think that...
I don't think anything after that.
It's best...
That's best not to.
It is best.
Let's, uh...
There's some things man was not meant to know.
I know, and that's why the veil can never be lifted unless, of course...
Praise Bob.
Unless, of course, yes, praise Bob. Unless, of course, we are a witness and we, you know...
Can I get a witless? Can I get a witless, my friend?
You got like five in this room.
Ah...
I'm witless!
Now are you beginning to catch on why it's called the...
It's called subgenius rather than Church of the Ultragenius or the...
That's right. We all fit that category.
So many do.
Micro or macro.
So many do. And if you...
And if you're a genius who doesn't qualify, we know just how to handle that. You'll be
plenty ready for Bob's church after the...
The little ice pick through the nostrils we do. We don't leave scars anymore. We go through
the corners of the eyes and the nostrils. And it's done with lasers. It's no stitches...
It's a no-muscle...

No fuzz operation anymore.
No more of those Frankenstein-looking...
I heard of... Some guy said he was a developer in Idaho. He said you had some kind of clinic
going on out there. And a lot of these peoples was having big hemorrhages, brain hemorrhages,
contusions and whatnot. And they were calling up a lawsuit against the Church of the Subgenius.
That's all part of the satire. That is the mental illnesses, the diseases, the injuries.
That is part of the satire on... It's a relevant, socially relevant, artistic thing. I mean,
this isn't like porno or some... It's just...
It's just a simple satire.
What, sculpting?
See, that's all it is.
Just a joke.
A little sculpt, little mastic bones here and there, twisty little...
Exactly.
Yes.
Well, we use the human body as a canvas. It's performance art, you see, officer.
I...
That's all. We're not... I mean...
Well, I...
You don't think anybody takes this seriously, do you? Oh, gosh, that would be... So I would
think...
When were you in Gainesville five years ago? I'm sorry.
Hmm?
Never mind. You said no one took that seriously, and I asked you if you were in Gainesville
five years ago or something.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
That's kind of a slow and disgustingly mellow groove.
But they're singing Bob. Did you hear that?
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob. I heard it. I heard it.
What a coincidence. Golly! Did you hear that? They said Bob! You said that guy's name was
Bob. Let's prove they're Bob Dolph. You will. God. People take such obvious...
That's Princess We Are Doe. Queen. Queen of all.
Of all.
the ufos lonesome cowboy day yes i heard is it true i heard are you gonna be at the rant and
rave i will uh yeah you are yes on hands and knees i'll be crawling uh you don't need to be

Here it Is
Hahaha
For instance, if someone were to answer a very particular question...
I have a pair of tickets to give away.
I'm allowed to give away a pair of tickets.
What is J.R. Bob Dobbs' middle name?
We'll do that later.
If you can answer that question, you get one of the free tickets.
We only got two, though.
There you go. You're on the air.
It isn't Rincon.
Yes?
His middle name.
All right, say his full name again.
I have ESP.
Yes, I'm afraid of the retinue now.
These are the denizens of erst.
You're lucky that they don't let you go to the farm.
They're twisted the wrong way.
The DNA is spinning opposito.
Oh, look at that poor little collar going down that drain.
Round and round and round, and he just disappears.
What a loss.
I feel so...
Hello?
Bob's middle name.
What is it?
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Well, there's the winner.
Yes.
That's it.
That is absolutely correct.
On Bob's birth certificate, it says J.R.
Quote Bob, unquote, Dobbs.
Okay, what's your name?
John Costolo.
Okay.
I just called and asked about the free tickets, as a matter of fact.
Okay, wait a minute.
And never got an answer.
Figures.
Sub-genius.
Hey, why do you think they call it sub?
You may already be a wiener.
In fact.
True.
Okay.
You know all about it?
Bob.
Do you know all about it?
Baby!
You were just gonna...
Woo!
Okay.
Well, listen to the radio.
Bye.
Just show up at the door and you'll have two tickets.
Two tickets.
I believe there's been a manifestation.
Oh my God.
What?
Turn around.
Has there been a miracle?
Oh my Lord.
Oh my God.

I think I have to leave.
Copyright infringement.
Number...
Oh my Lord.
My friend, I'm sorry.


I think I'm gonna go get some Elvis Presley records out.
I'll be back in a minute.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
A crimson manifestation glinted in through the room and I turned a few heads.
What a manifestation.
Into cabbage.
Into cabbage.
Oh, turn camera number three.
Yeah, there we go.
Go up on the monitor.
There is...
Is that Connie Dobbs herself, itself, I should say?
Well, her name is...







How are you doing these days anyway?
I'm a elf, now, Reverend Stagg.
How are you?
It's been a long time since I've seen you on some cowboy day.
How are you doing these days anyway?
I'm very sling along as usual.
Look at him react.
I'm all set to come with me down to the Smart Bar.
I'm as ready as I can...
How ready is all everybody...
Another one of these things.
We just can't show these things on the radio.
You can't show them.
You can...
You can indicate, though.
With the minds left...
With the mind's ear eye.
The eye of the ear, isn't it?
No.
That's right.
It's television for the blind, as he said.
But it's not, as you said, it was, I forgot what I was saying.
And really, it's not very dignified to just spell these things out.
I mean, it's sexier if you don't show everything.
You know what I mean?
I mean, it's just, the old movies were so much more romantic.
Connie was one of the top stars.
If you're more elliptical.
That's a description of a circular thing, though.
Hyperbolic, I think, would be more.
Hyperbole, elliptical is more graphically descriptive.
Life is a metaphor, and we, life is like a metaphor, actually.
Life is a simile of a metaphor.
And like a metaphor, it's like a bad, it's like bad whiskey is.
It burns like the truth is like bad whiskey is, like a bad metaphor.
Like a joke that's been told too many times.
Three, four times too many.
Well, I suppose I told it.
That was a different one, though.
Well, I have to pretend like, well.
Oh, I wasn't reacting to anything.
I have to hear something.
Say goodbye to all our company.
M-I-C-K-E-Y.
Why?
Because we hate you now.
Oh, hell cares.
Oh, oh, oh.
Hey, I like that.
That is cheese curdling.
I never heard that song sung that way.
Oh, speaking of cheese.
Connie, would you, when I was growing up, I saw you in so many movies.
Would you tell us about the sex life?
And the sex life of some of the stars that you worked with?
Or Bob.
What do you and Bob do?
Any of that gossip?
Well, Reverend Stan, what Bob and I do is very hard to describe over the airs of the radio.
But it involves a bit of prairie squid.
And it involves a bit of this and that.
And of dilling and gelling and milling and milling.
It's just two mucking.
fudge.
Hubba hubba.
Hubba hubba, why?
I can just,
my mouth water's just thinking about it.
It's better than french fries
most of the time.
Did you ever use the tantric deviation
sexual practices as preached by
B.P. Wow
of the Wow Foundation?
Well, I'm always
in for a good wow
now and then, but I've developed
my own sort of
tantric deviation.
I am capable,
Mr. Shang, of the tsunami
orgasm. Now,
tsunami is the Japanese
word for hurricane, so as you can
imagine, my tantric
positions just
overflow with
ecstasy. Tidal waves
of pure
pleasure.
Ah, yes.
Bubba
doves, he's no sub, bub doves, he's
no fool. He's the head of the subgenius
church. He is super cool.
That's Glass Madness,
a folk.
No, he lives in Hawaii.
Hawaii now, actually. He lives on
the island of
and he
sings those cute, he does the nice
subgenius songs.
Actually, there's a nice
subgenius song maker here in
Cleveland.
Reverend Melodious Chops.
Sister Melodious Chops will be
performing three new
all-unclosed
Bob songs
Saturday night
May 23rd
at the
Marshall Bar.
Yeah, right.
Ryan Stang.
Yeah, you tell him, pal.
Oh, dear friends,
I'm gonna flip that tape.
Do continue on a little bit,
but perhaps I should give the
additional subgenius post office
box number you can write to
here at the
near the end of the broadcast
with my good friend
Jimi Hendrix in the background.
Yeah, this is
the broadcast of a
well, yeah, they like call it a
damn church or
something like that.
And that's just
exactly what it is.
And
and
, you know,
you can find out the
more explanatory
information or at least all the
little ads and things.
If you write to
Bob at post office box
one four zero three zero six.
That's box one four oh three oh six
Dallas, Texas, seven five two one four.
And rather than doing our usual
unusual tonight, playing bits and pieces,
from all over the country and here,
we're playing bits and pieces only from
this Cleveland radio show that I was lucky enough
to be a guest on.
And, you know,
Will Adob's wasn't here tonight.
I've been answering the phone and now I see what he goes
through with all kinds of poor little kid.
Lee, I don't know what, you know,
fanatics trying to call us up and do and not say
that.
You know, prank calls real.
If if they, you know, if they've at least,
you know, say something stupid or smart.
That's the kind of prank calls we can get into.
Heck, we record them and play them next show.
But they just have to do it.
They just have to do it rival cult style.
I guess.
But anyway, back to the fun and horror here.
Have you got the new one with the infinite control
with knob, the one that goes all the way up to 11.
Connie, if you've got that.
Yeah.
Fourteen eighty nine.
Yes, I've got that down.
Graved in my head, memorized word for word and verb.
Item and I just might give you a gander if you can get
your little goodies down to the smart bar on five twenty three.
Get on and get one.
Mate.
It's alive.
Get one.



Like a rave.
I mean, come out and have a bloody rave.
Rave out with Bob.
You know, Bob.
Don't know if it's Church of Subcom or whatever.
Like a rave.
It's trendy.
It's like what they do in London.

Who the hell is Bob?
Lost and drunk.
What about Tom?
Bobby's show up and try to.
What about Harry?
What about Connie?
Bob.
Hell, Bob.
Yes, it was praised, Bob.
But it's hail Connie.
Hail Connie.
Hail Connie.
Where did you get that dress?
Hail Connie.
Hail Connie.
Where did you get that dress?
Somewhere deep and hot and oozing with snot.
And she cooks up a hell of a hamburger, dear friend.
I sure do.
I sizzle it.
I fat fry them little bovine creatures.
Moo, moo, baby.
Try that burger, Connie.
My eyes are running already.
That's the onion.
That's your space onions.
You were talking about tantalizing deviants.
Tantric deviations.
Oh, my God.
That already sounds exciting.
That's why those monks never leave that chamber.
Which monks are you talking about?
Are you talking like Nepalese temple bald heads or something?
The Nepalese temple bald head monks.
Tantrism?
Ancient lamas.
The temple bald head monks.
They use them too?
Uh-huh.
They ride on the lamas.
Jesus almighty.
We got camels so far.
Now we got lamas and monkeys too involved in this also.
I don't know if Cleveland is ready for this.
This is a bird, man.
I mean, I know you guys got a kulak and the whole thing going together all over the country
and everything, but I don't think you could have animals like that performing.
Well, maybe you could.
Could you?
Well, I mean, legally I know.
They did it on Noah's Ark.






They did it on Noah's Ark.
Noah's Ark, my friend.
They must have.
Just read your Bible.
They did it on...
They didn't do it.
They didn't have room for the dinosaurs, but they had room for AIDS mosquito, I noticed.
Well, we're leaving it to the conspiracy.
Uh-huh.
They figured something out.
Yep.
I think the Communist Party and Frank, the guy that made Gallo wine, had conspired...
Frank Gallo.
Frank Gallo and, well, it was Gorbachev.
Bishop Hensley there who started the Thunderbird wine in Modesto, California.
And all of those people...
America's fine aperitif wine.
Methylated spirits.
They served very cold.

And that's what causes the AIDS virus to proliferate.
The green bottles.
The green bottles, I think.
Was it the green bottles?
Yeah, that's where it started.
After they invented it in Fort Detrick and stuck it into the polio inoculations that were going to Africa and...
Well, that was a brilliant...
Red Cross.
Brilliant stroke of genius on everyone's part.
And that's how the little...
Yeah, that sounds...
Yeah, wonderful.
And that's why you see so many Dobbshead scarification tattoos as ritual amulets sort of...
To ward off the diseases, you see the Dobbshead scars on people's backs and foreheads and things because, you know, you can't buy a sandwich in some parts of the Third World without the mark.
Yeah, the mark of the barking...
The best.
The mark of the best.
The best.
Yeah.
That's what we're trying to do, you know.
I would never use it with anything but Hellman's mayonnaise.
Bring life to thee.
Image of the best.
Bring it.
The best that you can be.
Because you only go around once at a time.
Life to thee.
Image of the best.
That Dharma guy I was talking to said you only go around 6,000...
Life to thee.

See, you only go around once at a time.
Life, life, life, life, life, life, life...
So many lives.
Image of the best.
Image of the bet.
Yeah.
And you'll win that bet if you bet what Bob bets.
You are listening to ESO Radio.
And what did Bob bet?
He made a wager.
And it wasn't the wages of sin he was talking about.
He was talking about something a little more deeper, a little more macrocosmic, something that encompassed almost each and every one of...
And touched our lives so...
Not too deeply, actually, but sometimes it did.
What was I talking about?
Forgiveness.
Forgiveness.
And peace.
And peace.
And prosperity.
This is a church prosperity.
Forgiveness.
Forgiveness.
But peace.
And pee.
And pros...
Forgiveness.
Forgiveness.
Forgiveness.
And prosperity.
And...
Forgiveness.
And...
Forgiveness.
And peace.
Yes, Bob does not bring forgiveness because he doesn't think you need to be forgiven for anything you did.
He's not that well connected anyway.
But...
But...
And it's a...
As they say on the radio, it's a big...
It's a big...
But you got there.
Yeah.
That's so clever, man.
I love that phrase.
I like you get to use that about once a year.
No, no.
We use it every time.
But you got there.
We use it every show.
But you got there.
Big...
But you got there.
Who is chasing us around this room?
That's reincarnation.
Proof of reincarnation.
Big...
But you got there.
Big...
I...
