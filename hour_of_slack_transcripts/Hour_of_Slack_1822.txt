Excellent.
Thank you, Lee Murr.
Most of this show is straight out of Cleveland.
The bulk of it is Sheridan, the mysterious weirdo who provided another massive 45-minute media barrage.
And at the end, we'll hear a classic, beloved tune from...
Cleveland's Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
And some acid garage punk jazz by the Swingin' Love Corpses.
But first, get out your ear protection because here comes Sheridan.
Shock.
So tell your friends the next time Feature Shock comes on.
Hey.
Do what you want to do.
Just have a party.
But check it out because it's heavy.
It's heavy for you and it's yours alone.

I think we can begin to broadcast.
Oh, we're already broadcasting.
Primary and secondary circuit head commencing now.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
Screen lights across the board.
Yes, the show is warming up.
Yes, and you can see your radio light up.
And if you look inside the speakers real close, you may be able to see the picture.
This is not a broadcast.
After children first learn to talk well enough for other people to understand,
they sometimes like to use their...

I almost said something.
I'm trying to make it seem like it.
It's good enough time and attention for a question to happen.
Having a clear understanding of what we're doing.
And as tombstones are knoppeling, as churgogs and places of worship are nautilizing,
flags dust of trivialized tution.

You saw this right there around here.
And you missed me at a crisis.
Because I'm hell on earth.
Was here for 8 weeks, eight months and still no response.
You're insane.
And you're the equivalent of not even 아니е anyeremy 유.
Now, lemme see.
Isn't this way I'd go home and sleep tonight?
Where are our haggars doing here?
I got some big fat 2bc in here I got a little pound and a crackle crackle tea I got some
Google Pauls I got some peyote peyote peyote and that's it then I also have a stabilizer
I got some big fat 2bc in here I got a little pound and a crack crack tea I got some Google

I got a boy who lies to his teeth by demonic records and smokes the dope
Of course what I mainly do is just take the stuff that people send me and I just take

the stuff that people send me and I just take the stuff that people send me and rip them off to the max
Aha! Aha!
You like to speak that?
I like to talk that!
I like to talk that!
That, how do you say that, picklepuss
I like to talk that!
I like to talk that!
Nothing!
Nothing?
I think we understand it a little more maybe
as a public than we used to
but I would say that I still don't
think that the public awareness
is up there
in sync with actually the impact
That's terrifying
Look if this happens to your kid
or if you look at this and if you have children
you say could this happen to my child
out of some kind of rebellion
how would a parent
be aware?
Many youngsters are into it, teenagers and younger
and the clues are there
Aha! Aha!
Hello doh!
Hello doh!
Rosbanius you ought to be in the future team in your garage
that, how do you call it, that frog head
yeski teski
what did you say
got it something else, you know
Rosbanius you ought to be in the future team in your garage
I want to see that!

I want to see that!
You have to use so many cuss words
What the f*** are you talking about?
What the f*** are you talking about?
I'm going to call the consultant too of our show
you know
The premise
is simple
we invite famous celebrities
musicians and authors
in for a one on one interview
the
very first
time they say
you know
the interview ends
and the next guest comes
in for their turn
this
process repeats until we're
out of famous people
and we begin interviewing the staff
here in the studio
an
added feature is that
one half of the you know
point is
awarded for each time the
guest unnecessarily
uses like
in a conversation
beginning
a sentence with so
will be frowned upon
but not penalized
so
we're ready for our next
guest
please welcome

oh
he didn't care
he put us in a room
with a crappy boy track
cheap microphones
pork rinds
and a lot of beer
and that was all
our business
and our equipment
did he at least
supply the chrome tape?
oh yeah
Toyota chrome weather stripping tape
I think it was
it was
the least he could do
given the budget
so
how about your upbringing
I mean

You're a financial supporter of this show, aren't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss that money.
Go.
Just go.
Go break up some speech or something.
Our next guest is...
Patrick Stewart?
What the hell is that?
I can't interview without some research.
Tell him to come back next week.
Damn.
Well.
Well.
Well.






Let's welcome back our cameraman.
Cameraman Curtis.
How the hell are you, Kurt?
I'm good.
You know, the amaretto scones in the bike room are almost gone.
Patrick Stewart likes them.
Well.
That's all we have time for.
Tune in next time for...
Uh.
I gotta go.
You know.
I'm sorry for what we're doing with music in the name of the area.
It's, uh...
I'm sorry for what we're doing with music in the name of the area, guys.
But, uh...
Stop it, you know what I'm talking about.
So, play the flag.
Play the flag.
I don't think I've heard enough music as mad as I can.
You accept yourself as a unique and valuable person.
You're open, honest, and direct with your relationships.
Demagis.
I take the but.
that you are exceptionally talented and highly collegiate.
Ah, ah, ah.
That I am heavy.
You got some slick chicks?
Oh, a wolf.
I'd like to see some babes myself.
Me too.
Ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah.
What we need is a real live target.
Oh, a volunteer.
You'll do.
We'll throw the knives at him.
Oh, no.
You have nothing to worry about.
If either one of us hit you, we lose.
Oh, that's difficult.
And no.
Don't worry, ordinary people talk of running it.
You need to know that.

Then there's this crowd out there drinking beer

And they're not even drunk.
They're either drunk or drunk,


The writer has no responsibility.
Except to jack off in bed alone
and type a good page.
I felt there was nothing out there,
there. So I had to continue because they were so bad, not because I was so good. And I'm
still not so good. But they're still very bad. There's still room for somebody to step
in here, you see. That should be enough right there for that bottle of 55 poets. That should
cure them. Good night. Goodbye. And happy reading.
Good night.

the
very









things, especially living things, are what they are because they possess some inherent
essence, something we are born with biologically and define who we are really.
That in turn can lead us to believe that there is some essence, a fixed, immutable essence
that defines who we are.
We are also tuned to moral attributes.
We want to make sure that other people are cooperative, that we can trust them.
So that is another computation that might inform that.
Why we think that people are good, though, this is a little bit of a mystery.
So maybe it's just a wishful thinking.
Maybe, you know, I'm more likely to cooperate with you if I believe that you are inherently
good, although that can also have quite a bit of cost associated with it.
So no, we don't quite know where this belief arises, except for people have this belief.
They were all born with a belief.
They're almost okay with that polarity, right?
Knowing that maybe I see myself one way, other people see me another way.
At that point, really, I have a choice to make.
You know, does it matter?
Do I want to change my view?
Do I want to work to change others' views?
Or is it okay for them to be slightly different?

What did you learn?
This was even greater of a problem than I sort of expected.
What we discovered was that 95% of people believe that they're self-aware,
but only about...
10 to 15 percent of us really are.
With the right approach, anyone can get there.
People say, well, if you're just old enough and you've had enough life experience,
you'll be self-aware. As it turns out, that's not true.
There is a 0.0 correlation between age and self-awareness.
The Matrix isn't that bad, I guess.
You can still have that lobster dinner in the Matrix.
And yet,
And yet,
we perceive ourselves as well as others
such that underneath all this, you know, mumble-jumble,
there is a single protagonist.
There is a single true self.
There is a single true self.
There is a single true self.
Then, if you feel a bit guilty about it afterwards,
we can dig a grave and you can throw up into it.
There's always this tension between who we think we are and how others see us.
This is not a rerun.
Sometimes we don't even actually see it.
Things are happening in the 맞아 the way it was in the first plays.
Statistics got in my hair even when I pero reserved them.

But that's already proven to be how we feel.

I'm sorry, Phil.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Now my confidant's alone in a drift
In endless black and white dotted mist
I'll help you and heal you and love you, she hissed
Then slid from the shadows and gave him a kiss
I may be a nobody, but I'll always have one
Lack of a sense of purpose, yes
In time there means nothing at all
In space the earth is quiet and small
Then I thought I'd call a glimpse of you
But I'm hiding somewhere in Eurasia
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Do you read me?
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Do you read me?
A primitive day, I'm in you
One pilot thought he flew alone
In endless black, nowhere from home
Then shadows sizzled and crackled and spun
And again she slithered from out of the dark
Who are you, he thought, but did not speak
She answered his question without missing a beat
I'm you, she says, I come from within
And now you've unleashed what you're not to begin
In time that means nothing at all
In space the earth is quiet and small
Then I thought I'd call a glimpse of you
Hiding somewhere in your edge of the world
Where
I was alone
So I head back home
All right, I told my wife
To call me to me
And I said, I'm going to be
Hello, how do you read me?
Hello, how do you read me?
Now they float alone in dark spotted mist
Companion in white, embraced in a kiss
She knows him and he needs to see her like this
And know that the shadows hide all that he is
In time that means nothing at all
In space the earth is quiet and small
Then I thought about it
A glimpse of you, I am somewhere in the range of the blind
You read me now?
In the range of the blind
Open the pot they door
That's where I'm at
Open the pot they door
You read me now?
In the range of the blind
So how do you read me?
In the range of the blind
That's where I'm at
In the range of the blind
So how do you read me?
Open the pot they door
Open the pot they door
You read me now?

I'll be at the Florida one only, but I won't be running things.
Argus Fox and Pease are organizing it,

The shiny snowflakes
Inside your mind
Extract
Just like the flowers
In your soul
The flowers of your sky
The clouds inside your soul
The sun inside
Your doorway
And the souls inside your home
The
world
The technology inside your mind
Is like a graveyard to your soul
The sailboats in your sea of hate
Are carving a deep hole
As you pass the snowflakes
The sea inside your heart
The sky erupts in magma flow
It's a torn up photo
All of your dreams
All of your dreams
All of your dreams
You try to tell someone
About the way you feel
But you can't escape
The sound of the wheel
Is burning inside your mind
Like an expression
The soul that you can't leave behind
But there's nothing you can try as your own
All you've got that you will never forget
Is space
Is its name
Are you still living?
Are you telling yourself
view
What more could you want?


You have to do things right here.

It's like that for you.
