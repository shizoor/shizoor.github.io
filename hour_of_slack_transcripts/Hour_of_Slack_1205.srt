1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,920
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,140
The subgenius power of

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,320
SWAT.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,040
Now, I want all privately owned radios to be immediately impounded.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,040
After you've done that, report back to me.

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,500
Ladies and gentlemen, our grand entrance.

7
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,900
Thank you.

8
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,740
Thank you.

9
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,240
Hello, everybody.

10
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,240
I come here today to ask you one question.

11
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,720
I want to know what happened to the soul power.

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,760
See what we need today.

13
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,780
Hey, it's soul.

14
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,560
We forgot about from which we came.

15
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,720
But I got somebody here today just to let you know.

16
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,220
Yeah, you know what it's all about.

17
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,640
Okay, all right, well, cool, whatever.

18
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,120
All right, let's get started.

19
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,020
Okay, let's go.

20
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,620
Our first broadcast ever.

21
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,780
Yes, you are now tuned in to the sights and sounds of the

22
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,920
virtually unprepared and highly nervous.

23
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,000
And now I have an announcement.

24
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,320
I don't want any red-blooded fellow or girl anywhere to miss hearing.

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,080
And if any of your friends aren't listening in tonight,

26
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,340
I hope you'll do me and them the big favor of telling them

27
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,020
what I'm going to do.

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,180
I'm going to tell you right now.

29
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,040
Listen.

30
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,560
Now a message from the famous winner of the typical American boy contest,

31
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,700
Popsicle Pete.

32
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,580
I'd give my arm for good grass.

33
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,420
Who wouldn't?

34
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,400
It's over here.

35
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
It's the door. Stand back.

36
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Here, in here.

37
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,440
It's right through here.

38
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,860
Cigar?

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,920
Is it safe?

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,620
Well, it's pretty good grass.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,020
I was uncomfortable.

42
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,560
I was unconscious for about a month for six months afterward.

43
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:28,940
Ah.

44
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,940
So you'd better start saving bags right now.

45
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,800
Oh.

46
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:33,980
Here.

47
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,820
Uh-huh.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,640
Dobbs?

49
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,420
Yes.

50
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,520
Dobbs.

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,800
Well, what do you think now?

52
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,040
Maybe I've stopped thinking.

53
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,780
Yes.

54
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,260
Hello?

55
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,700
Oh, just a second.

56
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,860
Is that man?

57
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,180
He's gone again.

58
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,580
Dobbs?

59
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,120
Uh-huh.

60
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,280
Okay, give me the phone.

61
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:00,900
Here.

62
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,340
Hello?

63
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,300
Hello?

64
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,640
Hello, Dobbs?

65
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,280
Hello?

66
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,280
Do you think he means it?

67
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,640
I don't want to believe him.

68
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,140
Sometimes I don't, but...

69
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,820
But what?

70
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,760
Two days later, Dobbs visits me in my apartment.

71
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, it intrigues you, doesn't it?

72
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,460
It's a hoax.

73
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,380
The whole thing is a hoax.

74
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,860
But they laughed at me.

75
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,480
You see?

76
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm known now as a crank.

77
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,640
Dobbs, I...

78
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,660
I don't...

79
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,380
I don't know.

80
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,020
Correct.

81
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,480
So, well, goodbye.

82
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,840
Hello, I'm Tony Perkins.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,960
Having an abortion?

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,160
Boyfriend.

85
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,960
Abortion?

86
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,480
Depression.

87
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,340
Guilt?

88
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,920
Drug abuse.

89
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,440
Doctor?

90
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:45,880
No.

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,480
Fighting about everything?

92
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,720
Losing your boyfriend?

93
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,240
Domestic violence.

94
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,900
Relationship problems?

95
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,740
In most cases, had an abortion.

96
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,700
The moral of the story?

97
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,340
Choose psychological.

98
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,140
Drug abuse.

99
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,860
Babies.

100
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,320
Babies.

101
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,800
Babies.

102
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,380
Relative.

103
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,440
Christian Schiller.

104
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,260
Hello, I'm Tony Perkins.

105
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:03,860
On men.

106
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,620
O-R-G.

107
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,380
Uncle Bob was nice to you, wasn't he, Connie?

108
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,160
Always.

109
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,360
Well, what did he do?

110
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:17,460
Well, we were skipping some rocks along the water in the stream, and all of a sudden Uncle Bob hit me and knocked me down.

111
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,100
Sounds like he was under some sort of hypnotic spell.

112
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,820
Don't blame him for what happened.

113
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,280
He got up to leave and...

114
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,340
Then just passed.

115
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,060
He got on the floor.

116
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,940
When you praise Bob, you never stop.

117
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,220
You just keep smoking the frog, and you never flop.

118
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,480
No more poker terms.

119
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,140
No more biological terms.

120
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,240
No more bullshit.

121
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,700
A person burned like that, and you know he's conceiving.

122
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,980
Preferably Italian or Dutch.

123
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,620
Motherfucker.

124
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,140
Go back.

125
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,620
Smoke it.

126
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:50,960
Yes.

127
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,240
Men.

128
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,240
In just a moment, we'll find out.

129
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,260
What happens next in the strange case of Cremel, Herr Tani?

130
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,480
Now, Dr. Watson, what happened?

131
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,560
It's against my rule to take a drink before breakfast, but this morning I'll break that rule.

132
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,120
Oh, no.

133
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,760
Hold it.

134
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,400
Buy a bottle of Cremel daily for better gout.

135
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,180
Unseal his lips.

136
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,840
Here's the door.

137
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,560
Oh.

138
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,180
Oh.

139
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,880
Oh.

140
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,520
Oh.

141
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:21,700
Oh.

142
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,060
Oh.

143
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,640
Oh.

144
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,020
Oh.

145
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


146
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


147
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


148
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


149
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


150
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


151
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


152
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


153
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


154
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


155
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


156
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


157
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


158
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


159
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


160
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


161
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


162
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


163
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,460


164
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,540
Come on.

165
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,160
Nobody can come in.

166
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:26,680
What?

167
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,340
Here, here, here, my boy.

168
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,360
Here.

169
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,440
Drink this.

170
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,360
You'll feel better.

171
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,900
You got leather?

172
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,400
Well, I'm afraid not.

173
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:36,860
Yes.

174
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,480
Here.

175
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,260
Oh?

176
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,080
Listen.

177
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,540
Sir.

178
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,960
We hope you will call upon us at your earliest convenience.

179
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,200
Faithfully yours, J.R. Dodds.

180
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:47,820
Come.

181
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,280
Come in.

182
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,320
Good.

183
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,400
Oh.

184
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:51,800
Ah.

185
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,080
You spoke of brilliant music.

186
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,300
of unearthly colors, of a distorted space and time.

187
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,380
All induced by the drug cannabis indica, more commonly known as hashish.

188
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,920
Good heavens, what shall we do?

189
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,900
Good heavens, Holmes.

190
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,820
After all, the best we can save him for is a living death in a madhouse.

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,900
To lock him up like animals.

192
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,360
Is that your opinion?

193
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,580
Certainly.

194
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,240
Poor chap's absolutely so defiable.

195
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,080
Perhaps it was best it ended that way.

196
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,400
But, Holmes, I still don't understand.

197
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,040
It's not difficult if you study the window.

198
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,740
Where there stands a giant figure in full evening dress, his hands covered by white gloves.

199
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,660
Just the weirdest pure nonsense that I've ever heard.

200
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,660
I wonder, Watson.

201
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,120
I cannot see.

202
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,840
Oh, I cannot see.

203
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,060
Sweet, sweet thing, do.

204
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,540
It's certain, it's certain, it's certain.

205
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,940
That is my do.

206
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,140
That, that, that, that.

207
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,300
Sweet, sweet.

208
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,820
Whoa.

209
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,800
I cannot see.

210
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,900
See, see, see, see, see.

211
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,160
It's stunning.

212
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:33,800
Ew.

213
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,200
Try the wine.

214
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:37,960
Huh.

215
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,160
I would like the subgenius.

216
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,680
Our old swank.

217
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,700
It made me real sick, a lot of it did.

218
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,480
Fear and nausea.

219
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:51,940
Sir!

220
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,980
Why me, Lord?

221
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,600
What have I ever done?

222
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,420
What did I ever do?

223
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,880
What have I ever done?

224
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,060
Wasted.

225
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,260
Try me.

226
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,180
Wasted.

227
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,180
Help me show.

228
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,680
Well, maybe.

229
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,120
No.

230
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,080
Wasted.

231
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,140
Can I ask you just one question, though?

232
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,460
What is it that is exactly the same about

233
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,600
every single vacation you have ever taken?

234
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:24,840
You.

235
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,700
You're the same.

236
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,500
No matter where you go, there you are.

237
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,440
It's always the same old you.

238
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,680
Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.

239
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,040
And I know, it sounds wild.

240
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,560
It is the latest thing in travel.

241
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,760
We call it the ego trip.

242
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,780
You're gonna love this, Doug.

243
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,480
We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.

244
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,680
I mean, face it.

245
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,800
Why go to Mars as a tourist when you can go as a playboy or a famous jock?

246
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,340
I don't want to spoil it for you, Doug.

247
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,440
But you rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, kill the boy, and you're done.

248
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,820
You're gonna kill the bad guys and save the entire planet.

249
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,180
Cool.

250
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,680
Now you tell me, isn't that worth a measly 300 credits?

251
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,240
Easily.

252
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,760
Oh.

253
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,500
It's your foot!

254
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,400
Back up all right.

255
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,660
Where does it start?

256
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:38,680


257
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:38,960


258
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:38,960


259
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:38,960


260
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:38,960


261
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:38,960


262
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,100
Oh, that's it.

263
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,100


264
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,100


265
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,100


266
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,160
There you are.

267
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,160


268
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,900
It's expense, too much trouble out there.

269
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,240
And you declare your own.

270
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,820
Once you're out of town, you're equal to all those rich AmericansGameSkills.

271
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,480
They make me unhappy.

272
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:50,580
Really?

273
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,000
See, Dr. God didn't kill that little girl.

274
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,660
Fate didn't butcher her.

275
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,520
Destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.

276
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,200
God saw what any of us did that night.

277
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,000
He didn't seem to mind.

278
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,580
No, no, no, no.

279
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,420
God doesn't make the world this way.

280
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,840
We do.

281
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,720
None of you seem to understand.

282
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,180
I'm not locked in here with you.

283
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,420
You're locked in here with me.

284
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,360
This is the...

285
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,060
Funny show, huh, kids?

286
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,860
Come on.

287
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,700
Come on.

288
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,560
Come on.

289
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:50,760
Come on.

290
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,240
Come on.

291
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,240


292
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,300
Come on.

293
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,300


294
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,300


295
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,300


296
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,300


297
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,300


298
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,300


299
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,300


300
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,940
Take a drink.

301
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,780
Take a drink.

302
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,160
This is so awesome.

303
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,680
I love it.

304
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,340
Yeah, we're really partying tonight on the show, friends.

305
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,200
Awesome.

306
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,120
I love it.

307
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,900
Well, whatever.

308
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,640
Whatever.

309
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,020
I love it.

310
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,640
What is Liquid Crystal Dave going to call in?

311
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,280
So?

312
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,460
So, I don't know.

313
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,760
I don't know.

314
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,540
Licentious chrysanthemum, Dave?

315
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,320
Liquid Cowboy Display would be calling in soon.

316
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,860
But, meanwhile, friends, I'm not locked in here with you.

317
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,680
You're locked in here with us.

318
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,080
And us includes the material we've been playing,

319
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,640
which was mostly by Fernandinande Leemur,

320
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,120
the great mister.

321
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,620
Fernandinande Leemur.

322
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,580
And other great Reverend Norell Preff.

323
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,000
I say those names together, but they actually work completely separately.

324
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,580
And I don't know if they even listen to the show anymore.

325
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,120
They just do that stuff.

326
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,720
And I just keep playing it.

327
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,020
And also, there was a little bit of the kleptones.

328
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:20,340
You can find the kleptones spelled with a K, as in kleptomaniac, at kleptones.com, I think it is.

329
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,300
Yeah, you can look it up.

330
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,540
And Norell Preff is at Norellpreff.com.

331
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,920
And Norell Preff has one O and two Es in it.

332
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:40,180
As we record this particular show, friends, it happens to be Mother's Day of 2009.

333
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,820
And so I'd like to wish Happy Mother's Day to my daughter.

334
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,280
And to Lonesome Crystal Display.

335
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,340
Whenever he shows up.

336
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,360
Because he's one mother.

337
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,400
Oh, Princess Wee is here.

338
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,240
We want to wish Happy Mother's Day to all mothers.

339
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,780
Well, but you know, when everybody's special, nobody's special.

340
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,340
Princess Wee and I went to see Star Trek.

341
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,880
And before Dave calls in, I'm going to give you some spoilers.

342
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,300
Okay, so put your hands over your ears if you haven't seen Star Trek.

343
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,380
But Khan, the bad guy you may recognize from The Wrath of Khan.

344
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:20,560
Yes.

345
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,240
Is, goes back in time.

346
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,060
I can't believe you're doing this.

347
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,200
In order to kill, oh, they're going to hear about it anyway.

348
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,920
Khan goes back in time to kill the young Captain Kirk while he's still a space cadet.

349
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,600
And they get in this huge battle, of course.

350
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,040
And it ends up being like almost a sword fight.

351
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,200
And at one point, Khan finally reveals to Captain Kirk that he is Kirk's father.

352
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,580
And you're blowing the whole thing.

353
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,380
And Kirk's so freaked out, he lets Khan cut his hand off.

354
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,400
And I think this would be the man Dave.

355
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:03,520
We have noticed we have found many, many new artifacts in the zone that you have been speaking to.

356
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,860
Oh, I'm glad that you were listening and knew what we were speaking to, Dave.

357
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:14,940
And these artifacts we have taken to many libraries and museums and universities.

358
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,540
Yes, and carrying Captain Kirk's hand around like that has, you know, is a very important thing.

359
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:20,540


360
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:28,960
You keep it in a cooler, but sooner or later, you know, after all those people looking at it, it gradually starts to get stinky.

361
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,500
It's like Otzi the Iceman.

362
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,800
He is now preserved in his own juices and is no longer stinky.

363
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:44,300
And you can notice many, many different things on the body which have amused and enlightened scientists since this discovery.

364
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,400
Acupuncture, as we know it, probably existed 2,000 years before.

365
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,500
We believe it is.

366
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,740
Oh, yes, but acupuncture is primitive compared to acubeating.

367
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,360
Or wait, maybe I have it backwards.

368
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,820
Maybe it started with acubeating and then moved up to acupuncture.

369
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,740
Well, beating...

370
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,560
Acupuncturing is different from acupuncture.

371
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:19,600
Well, in combination with Doppler smacking and various refugees being stirred into the mix, we have a whole unusual tie.

372
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,120
Yes.

373
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,360
And these are unusual times, my friends.

374
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,900
As the old Chinese curse said, may you be born in interesting times.

375
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,860
And I'm afraid that fits us all.

376
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,420
How interesting.

377
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,840
One size fights all here.

378
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,300
One size fights all.

379
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,240
The church of the subgenius, the hour of slack, the liquid crystal of Dave.

380
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:49,900
Well, since we're in such forms of derision and smallpox, might as well talk about the other fronts.

381
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,260
So to speak, on the invisible warfare things going on.

382
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,140
I don't know what that means per se.

383
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,140
I know you know what it means.

384
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,840
We just can't say what it means per se.

385
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,480
If we had the fur...

386
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,800
Per sentence.

387
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,400
We can say it per hour, but not like per minute.

388
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,180
Right.

389
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,840
If we had the fur, we could infer it.

390
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,160
We could say per...

391
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,480
Say.

392
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,280
Yeah.

393
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,420
If you had fur, you'd smell a lot worse.

394
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:32,780
Especially if you blasted their juices at the same time you synchronistically mind-melded like Spoke, or whatever the hell his name is, into their heads.

395
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,280
He's not in the new movie.

396
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,520
Well, he doesn't have a fucking mind-meld.

397
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,180
No, Colonel Spoke is not in it because the actor wouldn't...

398
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,540
Go around.

399
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,220
They couldn't get, what's his name, Leonard Nimoy for it.

400
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,020
So they used...

401
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,620
They did use a clever simulacrum.

402
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,360
I wanna know, in fact, I'm curious to know who played Leonard Nimoy in that.

403
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,980
He's been dead for years, right?

404
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:03,260
Well, so has Mr. Nasal, our early childhood television star, and yet no one mourns his memory.

405
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,380
Captain Kangaroo, Mr. Peppermint.

406
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,040
Bob, when he had the pipe actually growing out of his snout as part of one large proboscis.

407
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,700
Howdy poody.

408
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,180
Howdy poody.

409
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,640
I cried when howdy poody got, well, whatever that dysfunction of the brain is.

410
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:19,680


411
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,120
Betty Bim.

412
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,460
Oh, I remember White Fang and Hippie.

413
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,100
You remember them?

414
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,860
On the Super Sales Show?

415
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,080
Well, let's see, yeah, and there was that other kid's show, The Baby, the Immigrant,

416
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,660
and the Guy on Mushrooms.

417
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,500
That was great.

418
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,260
That was my favorite.

419
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,540
Oh, man, that was my least favorite because my, you know, when your toes curl up real

420
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,320
bad and they actually grow into your feet?

421
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,260
No.

422
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,900
That's when your grandmother has to warn you for the last time.

423
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,380
She, uh, I never, you know, it's funny you should mention that because my toes have

424
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,360
grown all the way around to the point where if I cut them off, I wouldn't be able to walk.

425
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,160
I mean, my toenails, my toenails have grown, not my toes.

426
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,760
Obviously, of course, that would be ridiculous.

427
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,500
Crazy, I guess, yeah.

428
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,960
Talking crazy talk.

429
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,460
But so you can't actually walk with your toes or without your toes?

430
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,540
I can talk the talk, however.

431
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,000
It's the walking the walk.

432
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,380
As long as I don't chew gum or talk on the phone at the same time, I'm okay.

433
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:28,580
Like many subgeniuses, you know, we're a jack-off all trades and we try to just do

434
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,280
one trade at a time.

435
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,620
It's rough, rough trade.

436
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:39,520
But, you know, we're trying to open people's minds to, hey, look, you know, not everybody's

437
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,140
white bread same as you, you know.

438
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,720
Yeah.

439
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,180
Yeah.

440
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:43,820
Yeah.

441
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,560
What do they call it?

442
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,820
Metro sexual.

443
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:46,740
Yeah.

444
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,180
Metro.

445
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,660
We're not all, you know, not everybody's the same way.

446
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,980
Some of us happen to like, say, a prairie squid.

447
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,440
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

448
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,840
Right.

449
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,520
You can like it or you can love it or you can, you know, it's like, oh, I love that

450
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:01,920
food.

451
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,300
It's also, you know, oh, I love her.

452
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:11,340
But, you know, some you'd love like your grandmother or I love it because it gives me so much pleasure

453
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,520
when I, you know, do that.

454
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,820
I love that thing that we're not allowed to anymore.

455
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,640
But I think when anybody's around.

456
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,740
Well, it's clearly an observer created reality.

457
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,100
Everybody's blind.

458
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,600
Right.

459
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,280
You have to wait.

460
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:29,420
And so I told my little boy that one time you have to wait until nobody's around to

461
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,540
do your private thing.

462
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,020
And as he said, well, Dad, would you leave then?

463
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,100
I want to do my private thing.

464
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,460
Wait a minute.

465
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,780
The part I don't get though is your son actually had one of those like Native American sounding

466
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,600
names was that one time?

467
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,680
No, no.

468
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,240
I was just saying I was talking about that one time.

469
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,060
The boy has a perfectly normal American name.

470
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,700
It next.

471
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,100
Oh, it next.

472
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,660
And it next.

473
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,140
Yeah.

474
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,580
Oh, yeah.

475
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,140
We just we just call him Eddie.

476
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,240
What does it mean?

477
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,600
He's not referring.

478
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,860
I can't even tell you what they used to call me.

479
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,560
Why not?

480
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,580
Because it's illegal to say it on the radio.

481
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,040
Well, both of the words are illegal.

482
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,440
Well, no, the first one's OK.

483
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:09,960
Dumb.

484
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,540
You can say that.

485
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,760
It was what followed.

486
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,260
But it rhymes with my human slave name.

487
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,200
So it was a takeoff.

488
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,900
It was a joke.

489
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,380
They didn't really mean that I was a dumb.

490
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,200
Turtle egg.

491
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,420
Oh, man.

492
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,760
There's nothing worse than being called that or actually having to resemble one during

493
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,340
the process.

494
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:36,300
I wondered if you why you didn't take the same name as your estate like so many slaves

495
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:36,800
did.

496
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,240
Yeah.

497
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,540
Yeah.

498
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,200
I was.

499
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,560
I was.

500
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,980
I was.

501
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,280
I was only quote whatever they were, you know, stanks the stanks.

502
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,540
Yeah.

503
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,140
Yeah.

504
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:53,700
My real name is my my actual name would be from my original tribe is Rasputin.

505
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,660
Rasputin.

506
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,220
Well, Rasputin slash Romanoff.

507
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,180
So nobody believes me when I say that.

508
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,960
So just forget.

509
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,500
Don't even you can just pretend I didn't even say it.

510
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,860
I don't understand.

511
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,580
I'm referring to listener.

512
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,160
I.

513
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,260
I.

514
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,380
I.

515
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,620
I will never ignorant, stupid listeners pretend you don't know who I'm referring to.

516
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,120
I will never mention slash Romanoff.

517
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,420
Yes.

518
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:22,500
I will never mention that you claim to have an ancestor or you are the ancestral line

519
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,840
of the illegitimate child of Rasputin.

520
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,460
And what's your name?

521
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,260
Zarina.

522
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,260
Zarina.

523
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,400
Alexandra.

524
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,580
Alexandra Romanoff.

525
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:32,920
Yeah.

526
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:33,940
Yeah.

527
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,220
Yeah.

528
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:34,440
Because.

529
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:34,520
Because.

530
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,940
Because crazy people have been known to claim that they're the heir to the crown jewels

531
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,180
of the Russian throne or that they're a secret agent, a part of the intelligence community.

532
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,060
Because then when you go, well, do you have any proof of that?

533
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,840
Of course not.

534
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,740
It was secret.

535
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:58,020
So it's you find then many people claim to be psychics, spacemen, people from the future,

536
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,620
or even from the distant past.

537
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,560
I'm from the far distant past.

538
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,180
I thought you said you don't wait for me from outer space.

539
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,060
No, no, no, no.

540
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,760
You said.

541
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,580
Some people actually are from outer space.

542
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,360
You said.

543
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,220
Princess.

544
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:11,620
Right.

545
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,580
Is queen of all the UFOs.

546
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,280
But I agree with her.

547
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,800
Unidentified FOS.

548
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,240
See, but you don't even understand what she's saying.

549
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,180
I agree completely with her.

550
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,920
And I forgot what I was going to say.

551
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:30,120
I'm going to have to agree with her for she is she who must be heard.

552
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,880
I feel something.

553
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,140
What's that?

554
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,260
I don't know.

555
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,900
She is she who has must be whatever she says to do done.

556
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,340
What's that tinkling sound?

557
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,420
So now do it.

558
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,000
It sounds like a tinkle tinkle in my ear.

559
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,940
Like it looks like there's a little mouse in there running around in my head.

560
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,940
It's we.

561
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,060
It's weird.

562
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Oh, it's a tinkle tinkle.

563
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,100
Now my brain swelling.

564
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,360
It feels like it's going to pop out of my skull.

565
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,320
There went Dave.

566
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,200
The lonesome.

567
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,860
I'm going to go.

568
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:02,860


569
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:02,860


570
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:02,860


571
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:02,860


572
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:02,860


573
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:02,860


574
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:02,860


575
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:02,860


576
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:02,860


577
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,440
Chris.

578
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,360
Dismal display has shut off, but I bet we can tickle it back into shape.

579
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,000
I'll just run around inside his ear a little bit more.

580
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,940
Things inflated here.

581
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,520
Hope that shows the subgenius is actually can use tools under some conditions and have

582
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,940
been known to make the show to give it kind of a hook shape, then dip it down into the

583
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,620
ear of the listener or of the day.

584
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,380
That's the case.

585
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,780
Might be.

586
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:29,800
Yeah.

587
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,460
Yeah.

588
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:30,760
That's right.

589
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,100
The other.

590
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,160
And then the only.

591
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,460
Yeah.

592
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,060
Attention.

593
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,600
You're in this.

594
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,960
And eventually suck the attention out of the listener or the days.

595
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,240
Of course.

596
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,440
We have some actually.

597
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,300
Must be placed close to the.

598
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,660
It relates to the cerebral cortex.

599
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,340
And that way I've lost it.

600
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,480
To get out here.

601
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,060
Go be closer to the table.

602
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,720
Take a look at what I'm doing here.

603
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,080
Opening up the.

604
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,340
Well, is that.

605
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,100
It's not.

606
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,340
The force.

607
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,260
We all know.

608
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,020
Choco Choco.

609
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,760
This is the actual force.

610
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,920
And it's the.

611
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,360
Corruption.

612
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,260
Which we can find the.

613
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,660
Way.

614
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,820
Get out.

615
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,380
Or it is.

616
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,700
You're breaking up.

617
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,040
You're cracking up.

618
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,400
You're not cracking me up.

619
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,720
No, no, there's no way to do that.

620
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,460
Short of a.

621
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:25,980
Hammer.

622
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,020
You have to have a very expensive filter to do that.

623
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,440
We obviously can't.

624
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,440


625
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,440


626
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,440


627
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,440


628
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,440


629
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,440


630
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,440


631
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,440


632
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,840
Afford the good filters.

633
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,900
So we hold our mouths real close.

634
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,660
And then we cut them like this.

635
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,020
So that.

636
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,460
You sound this weird quality.

637
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,340
Is cracked.

638
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,180
Cracked.

639
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,460
Cracked was a.

640
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,640
Cracked actually was a crappy.

641
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,740
Imitation of mad.

642
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:50,980
But.

643
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,060
The cracked.

644
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,020
Dot com.

645
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,460
Website has actually shown some pretty funny stuff.

646
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,640
But they're out.

647
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,560
If you're into humor.

648
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,320
They're out.

649
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,600
For the.

650
00:25:59,640 --> 00:25:59,940
Human.

651
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,160
Was.

652
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,420
You.

653
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:00,420


654
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:00,420


655
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,000
Are.

656
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,000


657
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,000


658
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,000


659
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,000


660
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,000


661
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,000


662
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,000


663
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,000


664
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,000


665
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,180
Dopey.

666
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,440
E.

667
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:01,820
Guy.

668
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,120
Or.

669
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,500
Something.

670
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:02,660
Like.

671
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:02,940
That.

672
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,300
Yeah.

673
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,460
They were obviously.

674
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,540
A.

675
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:05,920
Rip.

676
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,700
It was like a Canadian rip off of the original true Dobbs.

677
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,560
You might say.

678
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,140
I just think of all the things.

679
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,340
Those.

680
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:12,860
Rats.

681
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,180
Think.

682
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,680
Canadians.

683
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,880
Have stolen from us over these years.

684
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,320
As well as the Mexicans.

685
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,420


686
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,940
All of the country.

687
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,380
Right at the neck of the Mississippi River.

688
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,880
They will eat your brain.

689
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,780
Watch out.

690
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,000
It's a cyclops.

691
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,340
Type of suction.

692
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,180
Friends.

693
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,740
There's water leaking out of our country every second.

694
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,060
Pouring into the ocean.

695
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,080
Through the Mississippi River and other culprits.

696
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,340
What are you going to do about it?

697
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:55,100
We must bring these tributaries of the water and watersheds to justice.

698
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,720
And we must do it now.

699
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,720
It's scandalous.

700
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,340
What the hell.

701
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,300
Millions for defense.

702
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,300
But not one cent for tributaries.

703
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,000
Small degree of help.

704
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,640
But we need a big fence.

705
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,240
A really big fence.

706
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,560
Friends.

707
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,180
A fat one.

708
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,560
Around.

709
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,120
Yes.

710
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,880
A fat fence around America.

711
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,280
Especially the oceanic parts.

712
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,040
Because people could swim ashore.

713
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,480
You see.

714
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,060
Yes.

715
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,760
So we must.

716
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,700
We must wall off the ocean.

717
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,500
As well as the borders.

718
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,920
With Mexico.

719
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,660
And they have to be really high walls.

720
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,120
Because people have planes now.

721
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,600
Airplanes.

722
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,380
So they have to be high enough that a plane can have two planes fly.

723
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,280
40,000 feet.

724
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


725
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


726
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


727
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


728
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


729
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


730
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


731
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:35,600
We need a wall more than 40,000 feet high.

732
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,600
Going all the way around the contiguous continental United States.

733
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,240
Mr. and Mrs. America.

734
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,500
You can do it.

735
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,260
We can do it.

736
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,460
We'll pull together and build the largest wall ever created on the face of the earth.

737
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,160
The artist Christo could do it.

738
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,280
Communicators and satellite will notice the wall.

739
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,200
People in outer space will notice the wall.

740
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,640
The Venusians will finally take note.

741
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,180
Are we going to let the Chinese outwall us, friends?

742
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,120
Yeah, look what they did 5,000 years ago.

743
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,360
Right.

744
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,680
That was 5,000 years ago.

745
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,560
And their slaves were hardly paid compared to our slaves.

746
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,800
They had more fish.

747
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,380
We have more prisoners than they do now that we could put to work building the great wall

748
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,180
of America.

749
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,820
But they still had more fish.

750
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,100
Not North America, but the United States of America.

751
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,080
Because you know, North America includes the Mexicans and the people in Canada.

752
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,980
And also the people in Papua New Guinea.

753
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,260
Right.

754
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,660
And the electorate.

755
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:36,560
And I say just to, because it'd be too complicated to deal with Hawaii and Alaska and Puerto

756
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Rico, I say just let them go.

757
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,720
Sink them.

758
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,000
Drop them.

759
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,900
Cut them off.

760
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,660
They're too far away from the precious bodily fluids which we're extracting and re-expreting.

761
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:46,880
That's right.

762
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,380
We've got to protect America.

763
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,220
And you know, once you've got a 40,000-foot wall in place all the way around, and it would

764
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,520
have to be a mile thick or so to stand that high.

765
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,160
Then you've got to put a 9,000-foot wall in place.

766
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,320
And you've got to put a net over it.

767
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:08,280
A large, very finely meshed but impenetrable net.

768
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:16,220
A net not just of jet planes armed with bombers, but a literal, physical net.

769
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:22,340
So things might be a little bit shady inside the United States after we've boxed it in.

770
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,560
Well, essentially what we need to do is get a giant U.S. shaped box.

771
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,620
That is perfect.

772
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,000
That we can open the top.

773
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,140
Oh, yeah.

774
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,240
And we can lock it up every now and then, let the light and air in.

775
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:38,120
But keep it to where we can't let anybody else out.

776
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,160
We can actually lock it up.

777
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,760
We can actually figure out.

778
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,260
That's all we've got to do is just build a big enough box around the country.

779
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,060
It won't even really be a wall.

780
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,440
It'll be hermetically sealed from the top to the bottom.

781
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,180
We can even dig underneath and build barriers close to the center of the earth so nobody

782
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,540
can actually seep up into our native land.

783
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:56,560


784
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,260
We would need...

785
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,000
Somehow desecrate our precious potluck.

786
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,880
Yes, yes.

787
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,760
You could put the whole nation on lockdown.

788
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,660
Yes, yes.

789
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,320
We would have to actually put the walls out.

790
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,740
How far out in the ocean do we have territorial rights?

791
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,180
Well, we take whatever territory.

792
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,240
50 miles or something.

793
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:13,640
Let's put them in Europe.

794
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,780
Let's put it right next to Europe.

795
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,260
Let's spread it all as close as we can to those places that might want to...

796
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,820
Oh, that's crazy.

797
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,280
We have treaties and things with those people.

798
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,060
I'm sure everybody has treaties.

799
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,080
Treaties.

800
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,280
We'll take care of that problem too.

801
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,200
We'll kill all the trees and then we'll use them to fill the box.

802
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,380
Chop down the treaties.

803
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,440
Like we did with the Indians.

804
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:41,440
George Washington chopped down the very first treaty with the Native Americans.

805
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,700
That is true.

806
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,400
And then he said, I won't lie about it, I chopped down that treaty.

807
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,660
He used that accent, by the way, because as we know, George Washington was a native Texan.

808
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,300
We can only imagine what George Washington...

809
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,000
He might have sound like...

810
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,480
Texas belonged to Mexico then.

811
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,960
So technically, our first president was a Mexican national.

812
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,320
And he was skilled at cunnilingus as well.

813
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,840
Many artifacts don't understand that because the pipe's growing out of their snout.

814
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,420
I missed that.

815
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,120
Okay, he wasn't as good as you are.

816
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,000
I know what you're trying to get me to say.

817
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,380
Yeah.

818
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,900
I don't know what I'm trying to get you to say.

819
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,740
I don't know what I'm trying to get me to say.

820
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,440
I know.

821
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,240
It's been a problem for all of us for the last several, I don't know how many years.

822
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,260
But that won't stop us from doing a radio show.

823
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,180
Not having the slightest idea of what we're going to say.

824
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,580
Never.

825
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,640
It's never slowed us down, not for a minute, nay.

826
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,080
And why say anything to begin with?

827
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:41,600
Just the sheer luxury that those people out there enjoy, listening to us violate all the rules and tenets...

828
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,240
Lucky, they're so lucky.

829
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,800
God, I envy those listeners who get to listen to us.

830
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,020
I wish I could sit and just listen to us go on and on and on and on and on...

831
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,240
Well, Mr. Stang, I'm a little reluctant to tell you this.

832
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,780
But I'm afraid it has to be told.

833
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:02,440
I've been reading the demos, you know, the demographics on some of your shows.

834
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,080
I've been running through the Nielsen's and checking out some things.

835
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,600
And apparently there are, let me see if I got this right, I don't want to hurt...

836
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,900
Three people who listen to the Hour of Slack.

837
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:14,760
Yes.

838
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,440
So we've decided...

839
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,160
Actually, it's four now, counting you.

840
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,040
Well, counting the guy in the other room there.

841
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,200
Well, actually, I've never really listened to the show.

842
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,400
I'm just supposed to...

843
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,220
The legal department here wants to...

844
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,240
They wanted me to call you and let you know that we're...

845
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:35,660
After next season, we're going to have to either let you go or something here is in the works.

846
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,740
You're just not picking up all the people you said you were going to pick up.

847
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,200
You mean...

848
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,040
Wait a minute.

849
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,340
You mean we don't have to keep doing this every week for the rest of our lives?

850
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,580
No, unfortunately...

851
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,160
Oh, my God!

852
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,440
No, no, no, no, no.

853
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,120
Thank you.

854
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,280
I'm getting out of here now.

855
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,120
I'm afraid...

856
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,900
Wait, Mr. Stang, I'm afraid...

857
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,320
Mr. Stang, you can't.

858
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,440
We need you.

859
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,260
Mr. Stang, I'm afraid...

860
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,460
The listeners need you.

861
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,540
I'm afraid you misunderstood something.

862
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:10,460
You still are required, as per the contract, to perform and submit the show on time as

863
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,780
per usual for the remaining 24 years of the contract.

864
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:22,080
Unfortunately, there will be no re-witness payments or any sort of reimbursement as

865
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,140
you have, as you know, already been paid.

866
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,880
Unfortunately, you're not going to be able to do that.

867
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,740
No one will hear you, but you will still have to do the show.

868
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,580
I'm back now.

869
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,780
Did I miss anything?

870
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,560
Hey, uh, Stang?

871
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,440
Yeah, uh...

872
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:36,860
Dave?

873
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,500
That legal guy just got off the phone.

874
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,900
We still have to do it.

875
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,880
Oh, one of the legal guys?

876
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,700
What?

877
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:49,180
The guy from the network said that we got to still do it, even though we won't get

878
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,420
any more money and nobody will be allowed to listen to it.

879
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:52,840
What do you mean, more money?

880
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,040
We never got any money.

881
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,880
Well, I know.

882
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,860
I think it's just a little bit of a change.

883
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:55,860


884
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:55,860


885
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:55,860


886
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:55,860


887
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,700
I think we were about to explain that to him, but he was very, uh, just did his

888
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,740
appeal and got off there.

889
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,520
Bob is that way, man.

890
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,180
He just, he will not do small talk.

891
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,560
He just, he comes in and goes, nope, sorry, you're not fired.

892
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,600
Stay.

893
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,060
It's all business.

894
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,320
And then, yeah, it's like, uh, and then he just turns...

895
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,340
No small talk.

896
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:14,720
Right.

897
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,780
And then, yeah, no, not even the common human decency to give you a reach around, you might

898
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,060
say.

899
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,560
Yeah, and why, what I want to know, if you're supposed to be so palsy-walsy with him, why?

900
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:25,820
I don't know.

901
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:25,820


902
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,380
Maybe he's just not the type of guy that you want to be.

903
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,960
Yeah, I mean, you know, somebody from the legal department called up instead of him

904
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,080
and say, hey, uh, hey, uh...

905
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,180
Ivan.

906
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:33,960
Ivan.

907
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:34,780
Ivan.

908
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,620
Hey, Ivan.

909
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,960
You know, um...

910
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,180
Yeah?

911
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,980
I've been wondering, man, uh, things aren't going too good for the show.

912
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,380
I mean, you've got like, you know, marginal one listener or something like that.

913
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:46,660
I know.

914
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,380
That's why we quit.

915
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,960
That's why we're not on the air now, are we?

916
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,800
I mean, I've walked out.

917
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,340
I'm on my cell phone now.

918
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,800
So, yeah.

919
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,200
I'm not talking to the show.

920
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,800
I'm just talking to you out in the parking lot.

921
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,380
Yeah.

922
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,520
Yeah, Stang came in and said, wham, man, you still gotta do it, man.

923
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,800
Well, I left the phone thing open.

924
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,400
I mean, I left it on the...

925
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,460
It'd be illegal to just leave empty air space.

926
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,960
You can't do that.

927
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,840
Well, no, unless the parking lot is animated with many technotronic sounds, I would say

928
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,140
that you're, um, either...

929
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,280
See, that can't be here.

930
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,480
I can hear the background there.

931
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,460
That can't be in the parking lot, can it?

932
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,620
No, that's...

933
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:33,200
I left, um, I, uh, this excellent CD running in the background when I left the station.

934
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,220
Of your head.

935
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,120
Yes.

936
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,740
Boy, excellent.

937
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,500
Yeah.

938
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,280
No, because, see, we're actually on the air hearing a...

939
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,600
We're on the air right now.

940
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,240
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

941
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:49,040
So, if you're in the parking lot, simultaneously in front of the console there...

942
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,900
Well, eventually, um, Rob or somebody will come into the station and turn us off.

943
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,720
That's what I'm praying.

944
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,200
That's what I've been praying for 20...

945
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,880
How long have we been doing this show?

946
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,320
53 years?

947
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,640
24...

948
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,660
No, more like 30.

949
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,160
I started...

950
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,560
It was October 13th, 1985, was Hour of Slack number one.

951
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,960
This is Hour of Slack number 1205.

952
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,080
So...

953
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,720
Oh, my God, man.

954
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,340
That translates to 24 years of slave labor in Dobstown.

955
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,980
Well, that...

956
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,880
No, that means I get 24 years off of slavery.

957
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


958
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


959
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


960
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


961
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


962
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


963
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


964
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


965
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


966
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


967
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


968
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


969
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


970
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


971
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


972
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:23,880


973
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:31,640
I've only got 50 more years of slave labor in Dobstown that I have to put in because I've

974
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,700
already done Showtime, you know, for 24 years.

975
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,420
But that's the point I'm trying to make.

976
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,800
But I'm ready to quit.

977
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,760
I've had it.

978
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,500
I've had enough to hear with you people, hoss and hosses.

979
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,040
That's the point I'm trying to make.

980
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,800
And don't cut no ice with me, see.

981
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,740
He just wants to quit his job for Bob.

982
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,360
Right.

983
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,200
That's what Bob said.

984
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,300
Quit your job, repent.

985
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,520
Quit your job and slack off.

986
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,460
Well, it's about time we followed his advice, don't you think?

987
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,420
No, I don't understand a damn thing you're saying.

988
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,180
Throw our microphones to the stage.

989
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,460
Bob is not going to let you do that.

990
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,820
He listened to their cost to the producers, as Pope Meyer used to do.

991
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,760
Man, he had spirit.

992
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,700
Back in those days, preachers didn't care how much Stang would have to pay for the microphone.

993
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,400
They'd just slam it to the stage to show their passion.

994
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,280
Bunch of rotten kids, if you ask me, just ruining everybody's life.

995
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,540
Spoiled, rotten, spoiled, spoiled, spoiled.

996
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,260
They'd hit you head.

997
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,940
They were giving too much slack.

998
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,400
I know I wrecked your stuff, but I was really having fun.

999
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,960
I hope you don't mind, Rev Boy.

1000
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,360
Well, Bob used to dunk people in slack, and he didn't even charge them.

1001
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,000
But then they'd come back and go, Bob, dunk me in the slack again.

1002
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,380
He'd go, well, look, I showed you how to dunk yourself.

1003
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,940
Well, it soon became like an opaque pitch.

1004
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,040
But they couldn't dunk themselves.

1005
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,280
They couldn't dunk themselves.

1006
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,560
It's like once Bob dunked them once, they'd have to come back, oh, Bob, dunk me again,

1007
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,220
dunk me again.

1008
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:03,020
It also had the anti-dunk repellent shield built right into the substance itself.

1009
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,300
He gave them—

1010
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,600
And that's why we advise anyone to use the dunk to use the repellent as well, or else

1011
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,140
the dunk will never work again.

1012
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,260
He'd give them the fishing pole.

1013
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,300
He'd show them how to put the worm on the hook.

1014
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,280
He'd cook—he'd show them how to catch the fish.

1015
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,480
He'd cook the trout.

1016
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,240
He'd fix them some trout almondine.

1017
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,560
And they'd call him up the next day and go, Bob—and he'd give them the pole.

1018
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,340
And the worms.

1019
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,720
And go, now you know what to do.

1020
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,780
And they'd call him back the next day and go, Bob, I'm hungry.

1021
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,480
Fix me a trout almondine again.

1022
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,340
But that wasn't the fine part, was tooting the knobs.

1023
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,640
Well—

1024
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,400
Bringing it up here, tweaking it down there a little bit.

1025
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,520
Needless to say, tweaking and turning the knobs is what it's all about.

1026
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,480
The pots and pans coming up and down.

1027
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,420
Reverend Stang said as he tweaked and turned a knob.

1028
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,460
Mmm, that fish is good.

1029
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,280
I got more than one knob, too, honey.

1030
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,280
That fish is bad.

1031
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,340
There's some things I only got one of, but there's a bunch of things that I got a bunch of.

1032
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,460
Oh, one of these almonds actually flew into my nostril and it lodged there.

1033
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,220
It gives new meaning to the term cluster love.

1034
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,840
Mmm, mmm.

1035
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,120
And that's what this show is, friends.

1036
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,840
It's a big cluster love.

1037
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,960
Pounds of monkeys pounding each other.

1038
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:29,980
They're regeneratively and figuratively and literally and furiously as each and every one of them longs for something better than they ain't got.

1039
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,660
There's only one way around it, friends.

1040
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,260
Let's sign up and reenlist or die.

1041
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:40,560
Or join the church of the, uh, uh, uh, Mr. Ding Dong, the O.M.E.

1042
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,840
It's the slickest poo flinging you'll ever experience.

1043
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,900
Mmm, yeah.

1044
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,020
Whether you're the target or the flinger.

1045
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,000
Whether you're the flinger, the flingee, or the flinglonger.

1046
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,300
It's lots of stinky fun for everyone.

1047
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,660
Yes, we will...

1048
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,060
Ha...

1049
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,840
We'll stink up the airwaves for a good long time, won't we, Reverend Stank?

1050
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,500
And we won't only get not a dime.

1051
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,040
We'll only not only never be seen.

1052
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,420
We'll not only only not not not only be never heard.

1053
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,880
We'll not only only not not only only not not not only.

1054
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,120
Only, only, no, only, only, no, never.

1055
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,400
We'll never be allowed to perform.

1056
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,500
And the, and the dude in front of so few people again.

1057
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,280
And then...

1058
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,880
Well, we do have one more X Day before the saucers come and take us away.

1059
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,460
Take away us faithful subgeniuses.

1060
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,860
And the, yes, the saucers always come and take us away.

1061
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,860
Every year.

1062
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,520
In our minds.

1063
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,100
In our dreams.

1064
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,900
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1065
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,820
It's a trap.

1066
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,460
But I'm not going, my faith remains unshaken.

1067
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,320
An X Day is, you know what's surprising?

1068
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,780
It creeps up on you.

1069
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,960
It's a concentration camp.

1070
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,640
We're surrounded by barbed wire.

1071
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,440
Big, rough German shepherds with sharp fangs and stuff.

1072
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,360
I have a song.

1073
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,220
Don't mention that.

1074
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,120
Barbed wire, barbed wire, barbed wire, you're mean.

1075
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,800
The black choppers slobber overhead.

1076
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,260
You rip up my britches and tear up my jeans.

1077
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,800
Oh, down below they're having parties and flinging, uh, slings.

1078
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:18,800


1079
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,800
And having a hell of a good old time in the name of Dobbs.

1080
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,360
That's what the hour of slack is all about, baby.

1081
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,140
Meanwhile, all around them are the instruments of the megastate.

1082
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,680
Of the authorities from outer space.

1083
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,160
Meanwhile, they're having fun and saying, let's get slack and ha, ha.

1084
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,240
And there's barbed wire.

1085
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,320
It's metal, but it's like sharp as any real barbed wire.

1086
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,780
Actually, although I'm not a fan of barbed wire, I'm not a fan of it.

1087
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:48,780


1088
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,360
I certainly can't do a call to action or anything.

1089
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,720
I can mention that some of the features of the upcoming X Day will include brand new

1090
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:07,940
electrostimulo negative reinforcement wristbands, which are actually labeled as such and are

1091
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,020
collector's items.

1092
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:16,040
The 13th person there will get number 13013, which spells out Bob, by the way, for you

1093
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:16,800
ignorimuses.

1094
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:17,980
And...

1095
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,800
Also, we have John Deere tractor beam beach party.

1096
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,280
Well, that's another great thing I was just thinking about, too.

1097
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,980
The never ending searchlight beam.

1098
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,960
That's another thing that we got going on full time this year.

1099
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,100
The never ending searchlight and the beach party.

1100
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:38,380
Like I said, if somebody wants to bring bikinis, hula hoops, beach blankets, bingos...

1101
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,840
Explosive beach balls are what we're really looking for.

1102
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,340
Beer and whatever else.

1103
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,000
But what do people, what do men wear at the beach today?

1104
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,760
Heavy fur cover ups for your bathing suits.

1105
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,820
Because it gets to be like 30 degrees at night there.

1106
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,020
Yeah, the hot plasma balloons.

1107
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,460
Yeah, the baby will be so...

1108
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,340
You have hot metal, hot plasma balloons will keep everybody warm.

1109
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,300
And the hot foam.

1110
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,440
It's one of those hot foam...

1111
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:00,460
Oh, man.

1112
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:00,860
Hot foam.

1113
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,960
Self-heating foam beach parties.

1114
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:12,020
There's no ocean for many, many miles from Brushwood to the site of X Day festivities

1115
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,360
where we await the end of the planet.

1116
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,740
The total and utter destruction of everything on planet Earth.

1117
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,800
Except for what we, the saved subgeniuses, save.

1118
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,740
Exactly.

1119
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,780
There are oceans of smiles and slack though.

1120
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:36,620
Oceans of smiles and slack that we must preserve and keep in our escape vessels if we want to preserve them.

1121
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,560
How about the flying chest merkin?

1122
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,880
The huge flying chest merkin that resembles a flying carpet man.

1123
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,860
If you want dubs on...

1124
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,300
Literally by the device hitting me in the head.

1125
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,300
You can have that.

1126
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,720
You want milk dubs on?

1127
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,700
If you want dubs on that, then you have to toss them yourself.

1128
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,300
It was wonderful.

1129
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,300
And in some really oblique way.

1130
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,500
I'm still trying to deal with on both an emotional and whatever level.

1131
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:06,980
But it is often very great just to smell the rarefied air of the helium balloons and...

1132
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,840
It's grating to me.

1133
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,180
Exploding children out there in the woods.

1134
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,140
It grates on my nerves like this show does.

1135
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,760
And like the woods do.

1136
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:16,980
And like...

1137
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,560
But, you know...

1138
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,440
You've become an existentialist and not a slackie.

1139
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,560
A slacker.

1140
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:23,700
Oh, no.

1141
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,120
I am...

1142
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,400
This year, I am going to be a slacker.

1143
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:32,380
You know, I used to knock myself out to make sure everybody was ready to get off on X-Day at 7 AM.

1144
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,480
But this time, I'm letting the kids do it.

1145
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,640
The little babies.

1146
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,840
The babies that...

1147
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,240
Baby subgeniuses are running X-Day this year.

1148
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,920
Baby priestess Pisces.

1149
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,240
Baby Moda Mac.

1150
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,580
Baby Dr. Legume.

1151
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:48,860
Baby...

1152
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,560
All the little...

1153
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,080
Baby subgeniuses.

1154
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,840
The ones who didn't join the church by 1982.

1155
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,600
Which is pretty much everybody on the planet, if you ask me.

1156
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,660
But why are they still babies then?

1157
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,760
They're so small and stuff.

1158
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,160
Are you...

1159
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,740
Have you perfectly pigmented them?

1160
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,860
Compared to Philo and me, everybody is a baby.

1161
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:18,540
I thought you had maybe even actually pigmified them in some sort of weird bonsai tree way as your child slayed.

1162
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:22,780
Yeah...

1163
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,620
I like dog spirits.

1164
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,040
They're unrivaled...

1165
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,040


1166
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,320
You know what I'm talking about.

1167
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,320


1168
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,320


1169
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,320


1170
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,420
It perfectlyifies them, but we'd love for them to dance or swim around.

1171
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:47,420


1172
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,480
We have them dance around the tables, catch and run.

1173
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:48,520
They all dance and what side will they push me, give me a Ace?

1174
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:48,520


1175
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,840
people we don't even know.

1176
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,620
The crazy

1177
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,180
magic stories made up by

1178
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,980
preacher types.

1179
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,220
Imaginative, nearsighted

1180
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,980
dorks who couldn't

1181
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,800
work like regular folks.

1182
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,400
They come up with this mumbo jumbo

1183
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,840
and the next thing you know, you got

1184
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,280
everybody facing the same direction

1185
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,100
every five minutes.

1186
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,200
Making the same movements and saying

1187
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,180
the same things.

1188
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,180
Praise Bob, every five

1189
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,220
minutes. It's the same old song.

1190
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1191
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,360
Yep, praise Bob. Praise Bob.

1192
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,180
Praise Bob.

1193
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,140
Because you know what, Bob don't never

1194
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,100
change. Unfortunately.

1195
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,820
He bites the same Bob.

1196
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,180
It's the same Bob that you saw

1197
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,240
this morning. It's the same Bob that you

1198
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,280
see tonight in your bed

1199
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,980
but creeping up behind you.

1200
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,680
Bob does not change.

1201
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,720
He's got your...

1202
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,200
He may appear to you to change

1203
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,120
when he's handing you

1204
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,960
a free ticket to Key to the

1205
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,100
City, then he's a good Bob.

1206
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,140
When he's taking away your

1207
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,620
virginity from

1208
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,480
the same direction, he's a bad Bob.

1209
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,740
But Bob himself

1210
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,860
does not change. Only your

1211
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,880
attitude towards Bob changes.

1212
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,820
He himself is the eternal

1213
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,520
good, evil,

1214
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,520
good, bad.

1215
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,460
He's the ambiguity

1216
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,540
at the center of the universe.

1217
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,560
Virginia!

1218
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,580
He's where you zero your meter about

1219
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,560
good or evil.

1220
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,900
You know, in reality, that Bob

1221
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,960
represents the wellspring

1222
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,300
of all variety.

1223
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,020
Bob is not only the only

1224
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,760
one and only one and only.

1225
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,060
No, he's ten. You're zero.

1226
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:31,880
Huh?

1227
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,920
He's one and one and one and one and one

1228
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,820
and one until he's ten. He's like

1229
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,140
the father, the son,

1230
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,020
the mom, the Holy Ghost

1231
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,320
and a whole bunch of little

1232
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,900
rugrats. He's the perfect

1233
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,680
balance of what is right

1234
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,800
and what is wrong.

1235
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,960
He's like a whole neighborhood unto himself.

1236
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,100
He's the village.

1237
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,560
It's a danger. Not a pleasant neighborhood.

1238
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,020
Not a very clean neighborhood.

1239
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,980
But it's a homey.

1240
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,540
And it smells like an ashtray.

1241
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,320
The whole Bob neighborhood.

1242
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,400
It's a funny kind of place.

1243
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,080
His love for you is like

1244
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,040
an ashtray.

1245
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,980
It's almost as if you yourself

1246
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,000
were...

1247
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,620
Think about it.

1248
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,160
Now, my friend, think about it.

1249
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,800
Aren't you, in a way, aren't you Bob's ash?

1250
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,880
Don't you wish you could

1251
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,100
slice him?

1252
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,880
And it produces

1253
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,840
waste matter.

1254
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,440
He's gotta dump that waste matter somewhere.

1255
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,700
He pries something open and dumps out that stuff

1256
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,160
in that pipe. What's he dumping it into?

1257
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,340
He's dumping it into your head.

1258
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,840
Oh, he keeps talking

1259
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,580
to your head, but you keep listening.

1260
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,560
He opens up your ear

1261
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,600
pan and pours the

1262
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,080
fruits of his smoking

1263
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:44,600
in.

1264
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,560
Everybody have a burger.

1265
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,360
Which is out.

1266
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,780
That pipe grown out of my snout.

1267
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,720
So, if you're a religious

1268
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,760
subgenius, if you truly believe,

1269
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,480
then you're Bob's ashtray.

1270
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,960
It means you're bound to get snuffed

1271
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,100
one of these times.

1272
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,780
Why not get snuffed early?

1273
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,720
Well, you get emptied every now and then.

1274
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,280
That's the thing. He fills you up and then he empties you.

1275
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,280
I want to go next

1276
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,440
to the aloe plant.

1277
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:13,580
No.

1278
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,300
You're going to go into the

1279
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,340
trash bin along with every other

1280
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:17,740
Bobby.

1281
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,920
I want to be fertilizer for living

1282
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,760
things. I don't want to be

1283
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,340
discarded like a piece of

1284
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:23,340


1285
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,920
You won't go away forever.

1286
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,380
You'll be part of the great

1287
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,960
dump heap of Dobbs Town.

1288
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,020
The compost, as it were.

1289
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,200
Nothing ever dies.

1290
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,460
It's the circle of life, Dave.

1291
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,580
It's along with the worms.

1292
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,980
Think of the worms.

1293
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,400
You wouldn't

1294
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,280
deny the worms

1295
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,240
that they're just

1296
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,640
dessert, which is you

1297
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,800
after you've been ripened in the ground

1298
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,680
for a few years.

1299
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,340
Build up those sugars.

1300
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,200
Enriching the loam.

1301
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,880
The worms.

1302
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,760
Why, they're Bob's greatest

1303
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,700
customers. There certainly is

1304
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,560
most numerous. And they

1305
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,140
outweigh us as a

1306
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,680
life form. Did you know that, Dave,

1307
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,500
that the creatures that live in the ground

1308
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,600
outweigh the

1309
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,880
creatures that live above the ground

1310
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,820
all taken together?

1311
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,280
And rich in the loam.

1312
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,800
Come on, we all

1313
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,540
headed back home.

1314
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,280
Come on, come on, and take

1315
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,420
a bunch. We're all gonna

1316
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,420
fructify in the sun.

1317
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,320
Yeah. Hi, kids.

1318
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,140
I'm Dr. Death. I mean, Mr.

1319
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,860
Hello, I'm Mr. Death.

1320
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,360
And we're all gonna be like French-fried

1321
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,900
bananas someday.

1322
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,320
Out in the hot, steaming

1323
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,520
blue sun. So wake

1324
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,500
up and go back to sleep.

1325
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,260
Shhh!

1326
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:49,980
No!

1327
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,180
No!

1328
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:53,980
Friends,

1329
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,160
you too can be a master of the

1330
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,440
stoogely arts.

1331
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,540
And they're

1332
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,960
heard in the background here.

1333
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,720
In the far skin, there.

1334
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:06,860
Uh.

1335
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,040
Uh.

1336
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,100
The background is getting louder, Stank.

1337
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,680
Ooh!

1338
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:13,680
Yay!

1339
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,360
There she is.

1340
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,720
She's so beautiful for a reptile woman.

1341
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,400
She kind of resembles

1342
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:21,900
Dole.

1343
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,880
In some kind of cheesy...

1344
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,240
Oh, and here's another spoiler about

1345
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,160
the new Star Trek movie.

1346
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,380
Kirstie Alley

1347
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,140
appears as one of the green-skinned

1348
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,180
naked dancing

1349
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:35,980
girls.

1350
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,040
I can't believe you're telling him this.

1351
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,140
It's like a cameo.

1352
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,220
It's kind of funny. They play it for laughs.

1353
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:43,700
Stank!

1354
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,600
Or, um, uh, bazoombas.

1355
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,660
How can you ruin that movie

1356
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:51,660


1357
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,140
You can...

1358
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,280
Everything's a bazoomba.

1359
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,560
Your precious listeners.

1360
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,640
Anywhere you grab on that thing, there's a bazoomba.

1361
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,260
Or something like a bazoomba.

1362
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,140
Some flappy, flab...

1363
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,120
floppy thing.

1364
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,120
Some soft, round thing

1365
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,820
that you can

1366
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,320
do things with.

1367
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,020
Oh, yeah. Look, I think it's the

1368
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,060
self-perpetuating fly.

1369
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:17,900
Fly in flyswatter.

1370
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,460
Look, here it comes.

1371
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,600
Here it goes.

1372
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,100
See, it recreated itself

1373
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,760
in one little fell swoop.

1374
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,520
One swell foop.

1375
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,000
Yeah, my Australian

1376
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,400
boss used to say that.

1377
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,700
One swell foop.

1378
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,060
It's swelling. It's swelling

1379
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,740
more and more and more and more.

1380
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,520
Uh-oh.

1381
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,040
I can see the light

1382
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,500
coming in through the window on it.

1383
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,180
It's getting bigger

1384
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,000
instead of...

1385
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:48,660
Help!

1386
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:50,920
No, wait.

1387
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,360
It's supposed to do that. Some guys have to take extra pills

1388
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,140
just for that to happen.

1389
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,800
If the foop swells up enough, it can explode,

1390
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,520
can't it?

1391
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,820
It can, and I took my pills.

1392
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,380
What's wrong with my skin?

1393
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,500
Wait, that's somebody else's skin.

1394
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,160
What's wrong with my...

1395
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,520
What's conceptually wrong with me,

1396
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,440
Dr. Stang?

1397
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,620
I want to know what...

1398
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,440
Dave,

1399
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,220
the list would require...

1400
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,000
a scroll that would reach from here

1401
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,040
to your scroll-tum on the moon.

1402
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,560
It would require

1403
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,520
a computer hard drive

1404
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,420
so big that it would

1405
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,280
keep the entire Akashic

1406
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,440
records of all

1407
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,240
time and space.

1408
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,500
That list of your

1409
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,760
flaws would be so

1410
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,360
very long, but

1411
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,720
the list of promises

1412
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,520
that Bob makes to you

1413
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,360
is a thousand billion

1414
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,220
godzillion times longer.

1415
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,560
So you're saying, in effect,

1416
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,960
that Bob is flossing us

1417
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,280
of our flaws?

1418
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,720
Bob is the ultimate fluffer.

1419
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,240
By slackening our...

1420
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,240
What did you say?

1421
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,560
He's fluffing you.

1422
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,940
He's fluffing you are.

1423
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,340
He's preparing you, but not all the way.

1424
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,160
Just for the right kind of

1425
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,640
photograph, sir.

1426
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,320
He could be plumping you

1427
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,020
for the right juices?

1428
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,900
If you're prepared to...

1429
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,480
plump up?

1430
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,780
If you're ready to step behind

1431
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,220
the new X-ray machines at the airport

1432
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,400
where we can see just how fat

1433
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,420
and out of shape you really are.

1434
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,020
And mock you.

1435
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,940
We actually surround the electro-sphere

1436
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,280
of the body with... But don't worry.

1437
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,780
Ray radiation, which is

1438
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,940
quite exciting to watch on the...

1439
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,160
It tickles. And when you're going through that new

1440
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,620
fangled X-ray machine, friends, remember...

1441
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,080
On the other end,

1442
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,260
if you're going through the...

1443
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,620
You'll notice you'll go through a different...

1444
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,940
Men go through one line, women go through another line.

1445
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,860
Well, the people

1446
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,900
watching the screen, it's always

1447
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,640
men watching the women

1448
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,900
on the see-through X-ray machine

1449
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,800
clothing-removing

1450
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,060
vision device.

1451
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,280
And it's always women looking at the men.

1452
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,840
Homeland security

1453
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,020
trained men and women

1454
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,580
looking at you.

1455
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,200
The opposite sex.

1456
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,060
And leering, drooling, drooling, drooling, drooling, drooling.

1457
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,500
But more than that, laughing.

1458
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,860
No, have you ever seen

1459
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,540
how those new

1460
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:22,820
X-ray things work?

1461
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,860
They see through your clothing

1462
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,260
and your bags of drugs

1463
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,900
and explosives.

1464
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,420
But not your skin.

1465
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,520
So they don't have to look at your ugly old bones.

1466
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,240
They get to actually see

1467
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,260
why you're wearing that truss.

1468
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:39,920
Exactly.

1469
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,920
How much that bra is padded.

1470
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,880
They can really see through you.

1471
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,140
If you know what I'm saying.

1472
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,900
The dagger within your boot.

1473
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,220
Right.

1474
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,820
Wow, that was really succinctly and

1475
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,700
eruditely put.

1476
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,400
Why, thank you.

1477
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:59,000
Princess, we've been smuggling daggers and boots for a long time

1478
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,160
but we can't do that anymore.

1479
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:00,640
No more.

1480
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,920
No, sir. Ever since 9-11.

1481
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,660
It changed everything.

1482
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,940
At least when they bombard us

1483
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,840
with this dose of X and gamma ray

1484
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,700
radiation, at least

1485
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,900
only our clothes get the tumors

1486
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:15,800
and not our bodies.

1487
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,760
And we can thank Mr. Homelander for it.

1488
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,900
And he is a great...

1489
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,240
He's...

1490
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,840
And that's wonderful of him

1491
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,180
to do that for me.

1492
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:26,360
Don't you think?

1493
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,840
Every time.

1494
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,780
Let's not mince words.

1495
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,000
Let's slay them.

1496
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,840
It's explosively wonderful.

1497
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,580
Let's set them on fire.

1498
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,940
Let's torture them first.

1499
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,100
Let's mince words, but first let's torture them.

1500
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,180
Until they talk.

1501
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,640
Underboard those words until they...

1502
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,900
Until they spill.

1503
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:50,560
Word.

1504
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,520
We'll spill words all over.

1505
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,020
We'll wordboard them.

1506
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,440
No way. That doesn't work.

1507
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,180
Boy, that is even more erudite.

1508
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,080
I can only sit in lackluster abandonment

1509
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,900
back here in my

1510
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,100
uneasy chair listening to that.

1511
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,480
I don't think it's ever been put better before.

1512
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,420
It might have been taken away from us,

1513
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,040
but it's never been put...

1514
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,300
Bob will put it to you, friends.

1515
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,060
J.R. Bob will put it to you, friends.

1516
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,960
Bob Dobbs and his spokespeople,

1517
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,420
we, and myself,

1518
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,680
on the Hour of Slack,

1519
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,900
and Dave. All of we.

1520
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,920
It's listless curmudgeon, Dave.

1521
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,280
Listless curmudgeon.

1522
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,420
I actually like that.

1523
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,600
I personally wish

1524
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,200
in all his holy

1525
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,280
sanctum, whatever it is,

1526
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,080
that Bob would at least

1527
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,600
allow us three more weeks

1528
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,720
with the national audience

1529
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,060
we have for crime and murder.

1530
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:45,220
I don't think we're allowed.

1531
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,640
I mean,

1532
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,640
they say three people were listening.

1533
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,260
Three more weeks!

1534
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,000
Three more weeks!

1535
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:55,860
Three more weeks!

1536
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,820
Three more weeks!

1537
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,180
How long is it till next day, though,

1538
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,260
actually, as of this broadcasting?

1539
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,020
It's like

1540
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,260
a month and a half.

1541
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,180
A little more than a month and a half.

1542
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,940
Up to the

1543
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,080
most of our listeners who hear it

1544
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,860
tragic numbers

1545
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,900
of days later than we

1546
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,040
broadcast it, or even a week

1547
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,460
or two later, it's only a month away.

1548
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:25,720
Friends, are you ready?

1549
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,100
No, I don't mean are you ready to

1550
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,080
look at subgenius.com

1551
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,900
for information. I mean

1552
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,900
are you ready to meet your

1553
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,620
maker, or your un-maker?

1554
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,960
Are you ready? Because you ain't gonna meet your maker.

1555
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:40,980
Are you ready to mince

1556
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,580
your monkey? Unless your makers,

1557
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,940
your parents, are subgeniuses.

1558
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,920
Then the whole family gets to

1559
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,020
escape to Planet X on your

1560
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,780
own personal escape vessel.

1561
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,080
You're not gonna be stuck on board with a bunch

1562
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,620
of Bobbies. Nope.

1563
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,960
Nope. You're not. It's not like that. Answer my question

1564
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,900
right there. You're not gonna be stuck on

1565
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,660
board with those idiots, the fellow

1566
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,960
numbskulls at X Day. You're gonna have your

1567
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,840
own, well you can be if you want to,

1568
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,780
if you can force them to.

1569
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:08,060
Friends,

1570
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,680
we're approaching

1571
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,740
the end of this hour of Slack.

1572
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,000
And Dave, I'm gonna cut

1573
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,500
you off forever.

1574
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,560
Could you cut me off in a

1575
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,920
sentence so it sounds kind of...

1576
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,560
What were you saying Dave? I didn't

1577
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,960
get that. What was that Dave?

1578
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,320
Okay.

1579
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,540
Okay. He's gone.

1580
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,020
A little bit unusual. Oh no, no, no.

1581
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:32,860
Bye Dave.
