1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
You will hear an important message prepared by Director J. Edgar Hoover.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,440
Who are you?

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,680
Of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,160
Who are you?

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,800
J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,480
has prepared this following important message.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,780
In case of the hour of slack, remain disturbed.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,140
Do not act normal so far as possible.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,700
But now let me tell you a story that I think will tug at your heartstrings as it did mine.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,740
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,740
Shut up, listen.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm just 41% contained.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,000
In eastern Afghanistan, the Trump declared a major PR news.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,560
In California, the declaration opens up federal funds to help PR news.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,900
In a rural area of California, PR news exploded.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,400
In northern California, the nearly two-week-old car bomber

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,980
now covers more than $1.5 million.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,080
In the United States, the number of people who have been arrested

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,800
is 221 square percent in the U.S. and Colombia.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,540
NATO says this is PR.

21
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,260
The director of a Syrian research facility set a new record

22
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,780
for the most PR news in Washington.

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,500
Now we're going to have a rare old

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,420
on July 5th, 1997 a.m.

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,320
when we all have hangovers.

26
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,380
Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the prescriptors call

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,820
the

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,280
The Advent of the Angelic Host.

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,460
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,240
Only his predictions are just a little different.

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,200
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m. to be exact,

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,060
the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them,

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,020
will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses,

34
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,100
the true believers of geniuses,

35
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,720
up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,060
And believe it or not, plenty of people,

37
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,760
4,000 of them so far and more every day,

38
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,900
have already joined up.

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,460
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.

40
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,840
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

41
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,420
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

42
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,740
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes.

43
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,100
Remember now, it's no surprise,

44
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,120
if I should be found dead someday,

45
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,820
I'll think that you were in the way.

46
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,560
Oh, gimme Bob.

47
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,480
Confusing that face.

48
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,620
With my own.

49
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,080
Can't remember my place.

50
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,060
Bob's role on this planet

51
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,420
is to see that the Earth is not sold

52
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,740
on that glorious or terrible day

53
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,740
we call X-Day in 1998.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,680
Fossils of the past.

55
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,080
Dinosaurs of the subgenius age.

56
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,520
Are you saying they're all not so both?

57
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,660
Remnants of prehistoric life.

58
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,040
Yes.

59
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,200
Life was hearty and the devil

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,340
would grab you right by the hindmost

61
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,420
and do whatever he wanted to with you.

62
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,120
You know what I mean?

63
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,680
Yes, another feature of those days.

64
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,840
The demonic presence urging forward

65
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,200
and the heavenly one beckoning forward.

66
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,920
We're missing back.

67
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,140
Was there someone else again?

68
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,140


69
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,460
Every one of these movies

70
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,480
were крупed together

71
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:35,480


72
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:35,480


73
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:35,480


74
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:35,660
these untrue victims

75
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,400
Eventhough pets and animals

76
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,740
упом 1990

77
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,840
People,

78
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,860
time to get us also

79
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,740
of pleased eyes.

80
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,940
I believe that's very much

81
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,580
an amazing story.

82
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,160
What a book.

83
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,300
Cool.

84
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,960
It is.

85
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,040
Oh gosh.

86
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
cool, fragrant breeze.

87
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,740
These instruments include hits like

88
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,820
Miserlew.

89
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,600
Where the mangoes grow in the mangrove groves.

90
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,340
Babaloo.

91
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,960
Babaloo to you too.

92
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,860
Belly high.

93
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:14,980
Yes.

94
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,660
And Wimoe.

95
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,460
Belly high, they tell you,

96
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,180
when you learn to swim.

97
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,500
Keep your belly high, dear,

98
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,520
when you swim in the chimp.

99
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,220
Oh, is that what they were talking about?

100
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,740
I did not know that.

101
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,680
All right.

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,860
Swamp fire by some band.

103
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,580
Worst case of swamp fire I ever saw.

104
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,340
It's pretty tasty if you ask me.

105
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,260
I've been using that ointment

106
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,180
proemptively, see.

107
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,140
Ointment?

108
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,160
Yeah, because I know everybody gets swamp fire

109
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,400
at the campground sooner or later,

110
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,120
unless you use your cornstarch

111
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,640
or your ointment.

112
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,680
Put plenty of cornstarch in there,

113
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,880
it dries it up.

114
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,820
So.

115
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,300
You get that cornstarch crinkle when you walk,

116
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,000
but at least you're free of the swamp fire syndrome.

117
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,320
Keeps you dry and sliding,

118
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,780
to quote Ken Casey, actually,

119
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,820
in Whole Earth Catalog.

120
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes, before it got to be all about computers.

121
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,500
Yeah, well, it used to be all about cornstarch

122
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,180
and how it keeps them sliding, man.

123
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,680
And farm machinery and stuff like that.

124
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:25,920
That's right.

125
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,880
I never got to meet Ken Casey, but he was a,

126
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,400
he was a dues paying subgenius

127
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,740
who went by the name Reverend Hardly Visible.

128
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,920
Yes, that's quite true.

129
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,900
And his friend Babs was into it.

130
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,460
Oh, and just recently I discovered that

131
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,160
Zane Casey, the son of Ken,

132
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:50,140
is selling Bob, Dobbs Head blotter acid sheets,

133
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,140
only without the acid, you know, just a collector's item.

134
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,720
Just for art.

135
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,840
Blotter for art's sake, acid for acid.

136
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,380
For acid's sake.

137
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,360
I find that a forced art form myself.

138
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,380
Ken Casey was on St. Stupid's March back in the day.

139
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,620
He performed at Washington Square Park

140
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,740
at the end of one of those St. Stupid's Day parades.

141
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,300
I introduced him.

142
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,860
It was the day when we were allowed to use that park.

143
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,120
Since then, the city withdrew its permission.

144
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:27,740
Hmm.

145
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,460
Well, that acid, blotter acid art

146
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,960
is just miniature Andy Warhol.

147
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,420
Yeah, they found a real little tiny Andy Warhol to do it.

148
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,880
Seems like that would be very repetitive effort

149
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,140
for the most part.

150
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,140
The same head over and over again in different colors.

151
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,980
It's a screening.

152
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,400
That's pretty much it by definition.

153
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,480
It's a screening process with your tiny little,

154
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,020
little silkscreen machine.

155
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,140
Tiny little Andy Warhols.

156
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,800
Oh, look, how cute.

157
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,320
Waving at us now.

158
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,280
The, one of the weirdest guys I've ever known

159
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,340
who is not actually technically a subgenius.

160
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,900
He was my friend in high school.

161
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,600
Yes.

162
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,640
Jim Long.

163
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,560
He was the son of a child psychiatrist.

164
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,340
If that helps explain just how weird this guy might be.

165
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,860
Yes, that could add to it.

166
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,480
Yeah, it did, believe me.

167
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,060
And he, with my help, crashed a film festival party.

168
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,760
There was a time when Dallas had a pretty snazzy film festival

169
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,460
called the USA Film Festival.

170
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,160
It was kind of hip.

171
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,500
That first year, they had Dennis Hopper, Andy Warhol,

172
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,460
and a bunch of other, yeah, I think I saw it.

173
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,580
Frank Capra there.

174
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,460
He was still alive.

175
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,040
Wow.

176
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,320
Anyway, we crashed.

177
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,100
I had a film in it, a little claymation thing.

178
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,980
And so I was able to go to the party,

179
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,000
and I brought my friend, who was a complete alcoholic

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,540
at the age of 17.

181
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,020
He got completely blasted.

182
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,140
Sat down next to Warhol, between Warhol and Dennis Hopper,

183
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,540
and started monologuing Jim Long style to Andy Warhol.

184
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,720
Oh, goodness.

185
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,860
And Warhol was absolutely fascinated.

186
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:39,560
He sat there, like, listening to this kid do his really surrealist,

187
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:47,380
amazing rap, which Jim himself probably doesn't remember any of.

188
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,580
Was it a Jane Eyre-like thing?

189
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,120
Sort of.

190
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,760
The only example I know of, the end of the uncut version of my movie,

191
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,540
Let's Visit the World of the Future,

192
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:58,540


193
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:05,000
the end titles go over gag reel, you know, screw-up background shots,

194
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,100
which are sort of funny.

195
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,560
But the soundtrack, instead of being music,

196
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,460
is that guy going on and on and on and on about it.

197
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,320
And it's a prime example of maybe a little bit like,

198
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,280
who was Kesey's friend, the speed freak, Neil Cassidy?

199
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,060
Yes.

200
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,300
Yeah.

201
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,880
Okay.

202
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,080
Who was famous for these endless,

203
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,540
ongoing monologues?

204
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,080
Or the famous Michael Pepe, our beer-spilling friend.

205
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,440
If only he could just stick to swilling, that would be great.

206
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,120
Well, did he convince you by spilling some beer somewhere?

207
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,820
Dr. Howell, I've been in your radio show twice with the famous Michael Pepe.

208
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,340
Yes.

209
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,040
Oh, he's amazing.

210
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,180
I've seen you say over and over again, no, you can't set your beer down in here,

211
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,260
especially not over here on the control panel.

212
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,200
And he would go, oh, yeah, okay, okay.

213
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,080
And he'd set it down on the control panel.

214
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,360
Yes.

215
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:10,700
The amazing thing about him is, well, he set his chair on fire two times

216
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:17,500
while he was there without realizing it, and we had to put it out both times.

217
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,560
Wow.

218
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,740
Yeah, that's pretty amazing.

219
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,560
That's like a Doctors for Wotan song.

220
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,200
It is.

221
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,920
Would you tell me if my face was on fire?

222
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,120
You would think so.

223
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,220
I think somebody would know if their face was on fire.

224
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,000
But a really good friend will tell you that.

225
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,320
Well, they will eventually know.

226
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,360
Yeah, right.

227
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,540
If your face is on fire, they won't try to be polite.

228
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,100
They'll just say, man, your face is on fucking fire, okay?

229
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

230
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,800
Oh, thank you for telling me.

231
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,420
Just pat it out there.

232
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,900
Pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.

233
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,200
There.

234
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,680
Now your face is not on fire.

235
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:48,980
Yeah.

236
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,640
So Michael could set his chair on fire and not know.

237
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,680
He has a ...

238
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,540
Seems like ...

239
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,100
He's smoky.

240
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,100


241
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:05,600
And the ash falls between his legs down into the stuffing of the old stool that he's sitting

242
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
on, and somehow starts a fire.

243
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:14,320
But even that is extremely unusual and unlikely because you know those ashes never do start

244
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,700
fires.

245
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,760
It's tobacco ashes that do.

246
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,000
Those don't start fires.

247
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,200
Nonetheless, on this case, it happened twice.

248
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,820
After we put out the first fire ...

249
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:26,960
Right, right.

250
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,460
Of course.

251
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,200
... Michael Pepe was walking and he set his chair on fire for the second time.

252
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,460
Oh, God.

253
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:40,280
No, that time we went to Burning Man, Michael Pepe was our guest on the RV and he broke

254
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,860
everything he touched.

255
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,820
Yes.

256
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,140
Literally.

257
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
I mean, mirrors, doorknobs, seats.

258
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,680
He pulled the doorknob handle off the screen door and Philo was enraged at him.

259
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,760
And to cool off, Michael Pepe went into the bathroom from where the shower of broken glass

260
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,860
from the shattering bathroom mirror could be heard.

261
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,380
Unbelievable.

262
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,240
Everywhere he went, it was like there was just a cloud of ...

263
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,660
Everything he touched, he destroyed.

264
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,780
Yes.

265
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,680
That was odd.

266
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:19,520
And yet, I think I can say, as far as I understand such things, it may not be much, Michael Pepe,

267
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,020
the guy we're talking about, is kind of a genius.

268
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,320
He absolutely is.

269
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,740
And I'm always happy to get him on my show because ...

270
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:27,740


271
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:27,740


272
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,820
Despite the setting of the whole station on fire, his own face.

273
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,980
Well, yeah, we've had problems like that, but we've had him flailing and knocking out

274
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,820
important plugs and things and cutting us off the air and so forth.

275
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:52,360
But at any rate, he's still great to have because you can actually have an interesting

276
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,420
conversation with him.

277
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,120
Like Dave.

278
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,960
Yeah.

279
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,920
It's not like it's just you talking.

280
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:03,320
You get to talk to somebody and it makes it much more interesting, I think.

281
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,640
Well, he can do some real flights of fancy in the middle of otherwise ordinary subject

282
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:10,640


283
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:17,840
He was known in the 1980s for his behavior music, performance art, some of which employed

284
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:25,620
the video medium where against the screen, screens, well, screams also of himself.

285
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,780
On the screen, he interacted in intricate fashion.

286
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:36,160
Well, the video projection proved that he wasn't just randomly making spazzy noises

287
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,080
and jerks.

288
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,640
It was composed.

289
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:38,960
Yes.

290
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,820
Spazzy noises and jerks.

291
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,080
He works it all out very carefully in a dance.

292
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,780
He had his own form of written behavior music.

293
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,540
Yes.

294
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,800
Grunts, squeals, twitches.

295
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,960
And it all comes together in a kind of harmony.

296
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,760
Yeah.

297
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:55,940
And it's a very good thing.

298
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:55,940


299
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:55,940


300
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:55,940


301
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:55,940


302
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:55,940


303
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:55,940


304
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:55,940


305
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:55,940


306
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:05,020
So it was like a written concert of music that no one's ever heard before.

307
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,820
And it wasn't just made up off the top of his head.

308
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,740
It was memorized.

309
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,400
I couldn't ... I kind of went on ...

310
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,040
He uses it.

311
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,660
He could just, in perfect sync with the seemingly random stuff.

312
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,020
That's what made it so impressive.

313
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,300
It was rehearsed.

314
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,020
I mean, he ...

315
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,280
Notations, a heavy manuscript.

316
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,700
I've seen him ...

317
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:32,420
I've seen him with ... So you see it all is worked out very extensively, exhaustively

318
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,020
in advance.

319
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,480
And then performed vigorously.

320
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,020
Sure.

321
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,680
I guess it helps if you can write music and then have performers who can read music.

322
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:53,700
If you're doing that kind of music, like Frank Zappa did, you had to be a really first

323
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,880
class musician.

324
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:55,680
Yeah.

325
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,120
I had to be a first class performer.

326
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,920
I had to be able to take notes and be able to read his musical notation on the fly.

327
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,660
Not that I know anything about that, myself.

328
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,020
Well, the more actual musicians you have in your group, the better your group's going

329
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,420
to sound.

330
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,340
Yeah.

331
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,580
My group didn't have any.

332
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,340
I was in a doctor band.

333
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,980
You weren't allowed to play an instrument if you knew how to.

334
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,680
I mean, it could be very difficult to play an instrument if you knew how to.

335
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:25,680


336
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:25,680


337
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:25,680


338
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:25,680


339
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:25,680


340
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:25,680


341
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:25,680


342
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:33,960
And it sounded quite terrible for an hour, but there'd always be five minutes in each hour that was unbelievable.

343
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:41,620
And so after thousands of hours, we had a half hour of really good stuff.

344
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,660
To splice together.

345
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,840
If you're, you know, if it wasn't a quiet place.

346
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,140
Audio studio editing brilliance.

347
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,660
Most people would still hate it.

348
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,840
But yeah, the instrument I play is the splicer and the computer.

349
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,660
The clash of the splicer as the blade slips through.

350
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,080
The splicer and the editing bin.

351
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,940
Nowadays it's a virtual editing bin.

352
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,020
It's just a bunch of file names in order.

353
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,740
It doesn't take up as much room, that's for sure.

354
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,780
Or it smells bad.

355
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,000
Well, film smells funny.

356
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,200
Because of the chemical treatment.

357
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,580
Also, there's film cleaner, which you can run your film through.

358
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,660
Well, when it's fresh, it smells fresh from the lab.

359
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,720
I love that smell.

360
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,580
Just processed film.

361
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:43,180
Then you dig out the same reel of film 30 years later and it smells like ammonia.

362
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,780
Well, unfortunately, it's going the way of all things.

363
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:55,080
But yeah, I think how much how you'd smell if you were opened up out of being in a can for 30 years.

364
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,640
The film probably smells a lot better.

365
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,360
I'm not being critical.

366
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,800
Yeah.

367
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,640
So, yeah, it's hard to preserve, actually.

368
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:13,540
That's why you got your climate controlled fault in your monthly charge.

369
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,500
I spent $3,000 of the starving Bobby's money.

370
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:28,080
Just on the spray foam insulation of the new shed that holds all of the thousand years of subjunius artistic output.

371
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,380
Well, you had to make a command decision.

372
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:36,660
And so you thought that the liquidity of their donations was more important.

373
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,720
Well, the Texas house doesn't have a basement or an attic.

374
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,540
Or really a second floor.

375
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,200
Just one row around of a second floor.

376
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,960
And the rest is.

377
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,160
The thing that they do in Texas where it makes you feel like you're outside when you're inside.

378
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,420
The ceiling of the living room goes up two stories.

379
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,200
But is it nice and cool?

380
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,440
Three stories.

381
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,020
Cool like a stone cave inside?

382
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,560
Is it cool inside like a stone cave?

383
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,620
No.

384
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,360
Thanks to the air conditioning?

385
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:08,660
Yeah.

386
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,480
Thanks to the AC.

387
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,080
Very expensive air conditioning?

388
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,600
Yes.

389
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,100
The one we had to replace.

390
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,000
Man, my dad was the most brilliant of all subjunius.

391
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,840
He knew when all of the main appliances in the house were going to break.

392
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,600
And he died one week before they all went down.

393
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,320
Leaving me with the bill.

394
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,560
And very little in life insurance policy.

395
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,600
But a really nice house.

396
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Beautiful house.

397
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,440
If you like.

398
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,200
Beautiful land.

399
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:46,620
A very hard to heat and cool giant house without any storage area.

400
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,880
Just looks pretty.

401
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,000
A stately staying manner.

402
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,260
Yes, it is.

403
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,000
And it's way out in the middle of the woods.

404
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,040
So you can't see it from the highway or anything.

405
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,580
It's protected by barbed wire.

406
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,740
Off the main drain.

407
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,180
Redneck relatives who are all armed to the teeth.

408
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,180
And I'm not kidding.

409
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,280
They really are.

410
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah, you wouldn't want to go.

411
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,440
And dogs.

412
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,280
Blundering around there in the middle of the night.

413
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:10,600
Right.

414
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,540
Not to mention the built in.

415
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,200
Not a good idea.

416
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,240
Dangers.

417
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,240
The cactus.

418
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,640
The tarantulas.

419
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,600
The giant dick eating.

420
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,040
The giant eating spiders.

421
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,400
All that stuff.

422
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,140
Rattlesnakes.

423
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,220
Luckily, hardly anybody has a giant dick.

424
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,800
But, you know, if you do, you don't want to mess with those spiders.

425
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,460
They happen to be tiny.

426
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,000
Copper heads.

427
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,360
Copper heads.

428
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:31,940
Yeah.

429
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,180
Knuckle heads.

430
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,980
Pin heads.

431
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,020
Bullet heads.

432
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,480
Sidewinders.

433
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,620
Bob heads.

434
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,240
Dobbs heads.

435
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,420
They're all over the place.

436
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,500
And you've got your.

437
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:42,520


438
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,620
We had a spray for Dobbs heads.

439
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,040
A beaded animated walking purse.

440
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,100
That with a little.

441
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,740
B wise.

442
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,140
Scissor safe.

443
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,140


444
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,180
Spοι sara blocks.

445
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:56,720


446
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:56,720


447
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:56,720


448
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,000
NYU award won

449
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,320
for one $40.

450
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,320


451
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:00,500


452
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:00,500


453
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,100
You and I was going to be here and think.

454
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,080
We're also going to be here on June 56.

455
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,820
Asexual toads

456
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,260
And fire ants

457
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,420
They've moved on

458
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,180
The ants have moved on?

459
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,400
Yeah, the fire ants have moved on to Oklahoma

460
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,120
Well, alright, that's good

461
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,880
I'm bringing the red ants back

462
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,140
Get along well without those things

463
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,400
My friends, the big harvester ants

464
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,500
I encourage them

465
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,480
Because they're the food of the horny toads

466
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,820
You see

467
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,760
And they were the enemy of the fire ants

468
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,200
So we always poison the fire ants daily

469
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,140
But there are none to poison now

470
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,260
And the red ants are coming back

471
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,040
I love them, they were my friends

472
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,240
Red ants?

473
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,580
Yeah

474
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,640
I was always third baseman

475
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,220
But aren't they fierce?

476
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,360
James, huh?

477
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,800
Red ants, aren't they somewhat fierce?

478
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:10,900
No, they're my

479
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm like Tarzan was with apes

480
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,540
Well, you just get along well with them

481
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,060
I suppose

482
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,540
Yeah

483
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,960
I used to pick them up and talk to them

484
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,240
And they can sting

485
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,560
Exactly, they can sting

486
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,780
But you can get big enough that you can hold them

487
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,080
In a way that you can then like

488
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,040
Put your little fingerprint inside their jaw

489
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,080
And let them pinch you

490
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,520
Right

491
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,840
And they're trying to sting you with their butt

492
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,280
But it's really easy to keep them

493
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,320
Well, whatever you're willing to put up with

494
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,500
Or tolerate, I suppose

495
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,840
Well, I'm hoping they'll bring my friends

496
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,020
The horny toads back

497
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,080
You know why I like them horny toads?

498
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,060
They're reptiles

499
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,580
Well, yeah, yeah

500
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,740
They're horned lizards

501
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,240
Texas horned lizards

502
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,200
Yes, just so

503
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,760
And they're cute as a button

504
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,580
Absolutely

505
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,080
And of course they have that habit

506
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,420
That strange habit when you pick them up

507
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,240
Of suddenly squirting blood out of their eyes on you

508
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,200
I never saw that happen once

509
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh, really?

510
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,040
I honestly thought it was an urban legend

511
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,000
An old hag's tale

512
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,840
But I keep reading about it

513
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,520
It does actually happen

514
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,640
Well, uh

515
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,320
Horny toads

516
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,240
Yes, and their ways

517
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,600
Yeah, they're actually harmless

518
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,540
Of course

519
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,640
Absolutely harmless

520
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,580
Like most in nature's kingdom

521
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,720
They only want to make a living on their own

522
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,440
Without interference from humans

523
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,860
Well, they don't have to worry about that on Stang Ranch

524
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:44,260
Right, where a general atmosphere of laissez-faire permeates

525
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,520
And all are allowed to go their own way

526
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,340
Well, it's not that

527
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,600
It's that there are no humans

528
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,600
There are bipedal subgenius types

529
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,840
That have human blood

530
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,540
Did I tell you about my brother's DNA test?

531
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,940
What about the crunch of hiking boots?

532
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,700
But your brother's DNA test, you think?

533
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,280
Yeah, yeah

534
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,880
We have a higher percentage of Neanderthal

535
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,600
Than 70% of the people who took that company's DNA test

536
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,260
Hmm

537
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,180
From Lost Valley

538
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah

539
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,020
That made us really proud

540
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,040
And we also discovered that we're

541
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,960
Almost solid British Isles

542
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,160
Which was surprising

543
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,700
It turns out Reverend Stang isn't

544
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,200
A grandson of a Cooley

545
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,520
And my brother is a white person

546
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,360
Strangely enough

547
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,040
So this is for sure

548
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,280
You've got these DNA tests

549
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,420
Chemicals, yeah, chemicals don't lie

550
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,700
23 or me, that kind of thing

551
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,780
A company that you mail spit to

552
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,060
Wouldn't lie, would they?

553
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,580
Wouldn't just tell somebody what they think they want to hear

554
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:57,420
Now the Neanderthalers were up there in the frozen land of Europe

555
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,080
That's how do you think I got this great big nose?

556
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,740
And so they probably had silky fur of some kind

557
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,300
Because everything had silky fur up there

558
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,180
The rhinoceros, the elephant

559
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,980
It all had to have fur

560
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,100
Because it was so cold

561
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,180
And

562
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,460
So with the humans

563
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,240
And the eye sockets of the Neanderthal

564
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,980
Were up where our foreheads are

565
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,600
Their elongated skulls

566
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,280
And massive brow ridges

567
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,180
There's a Neanderthal girl reconstruction

568
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,520
That manages to make you go

569
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,160
Oh gosh, it's a showgirl

570
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,580
Shame that she's not around

571
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,700
That's really striking

572
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,300
What's her phone number?

573
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,140
Yeah, she was a redhead too

574
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,900
Right, yeah

575
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,800
Heavy eyebrows

576
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,500
Kind of well-manized eyebrows

577
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,900
But quite pretty

578
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,660
I'd hit it

579
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,660
She did have a remarkably short forehead

580
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,520
But that doesn't mean anything

581
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,220
They had a fine cranial capacity

582
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,660
They had such bigger brains

583
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,460
Yeah, their heads go far back

584
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,300
Farther back than ours

585
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,160
They don't go as far back as ours

586
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,160


587
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,380
Far up as ours

588
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,340
I had a math teacher

589
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,580
He was the opposite

590
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,760
His forehead bulged out

591
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,940
He looked like Exeter

592
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,540
And he had the Stevenson style

593
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,520
But the back of his head was caved in

594
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,120
President Merkin Muffley

595
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,800
Talk about an odd-shaped head

596
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,720
The back of his head was caved in

597
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,540
Well, that's most unusual

598
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,560
It was like cylindrical, you're saying?

599
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,780
His neck just continued up in a curve

600
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,160
Into where it should have been

601
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,480
The back of his head

602
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,280
As you recall

603
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,780
Oh, I'm sorry, I missed that

604
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,980
I was looking at an entity

605
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,260
This was a high school math teacher

606
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,820
You were reminiscing about

607
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,140
With an unusually shaped cranial

608
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,700
Yeah, he was a college math teacher

609
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,320
All right, a college math teacher

610
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,220
A giant forehead, alien forehead

611
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,080
His forehead bulged out

612
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,460
But behind his head

613
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,120
The skull didn't stick out

614
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,680
Very far

615
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,140
The back of his head

616
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,340
Could have been a birdbath

617
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,400
It was even concave

618
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,760
Rather than convex

619
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,720
Yeah, if he lay with his face down

620
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,180
You could put a little bit of water

621
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,580
Well, that surely can't have been intentional

622
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,000
It must have been the result

623
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,100
Of some sort of accident

624
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,440
And it wouldn't hurt his nose

625
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,980
To put his face flat down

626
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,800
Because it wouldn't touch the concrete

627
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,700
Because his forehead would reach it

628
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,760
Way before any other part of his face

629
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,780
He was really freaky looking

630
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,540
Mm-hmm

631
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,960
I think he was Iranian, too

632
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,740
Uh-huh

633
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,140
Originally

634
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,200
So he wasn't in an accident

635
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,320
But this was his natural configuration

636
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,480
He was a flathead Iranian

637
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,980
But the opposite of flathead Indians

638
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,340
I'll say it

639
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,420
They put the board on the back

640
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,000
To force the forehead out

641
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,460
Right

642
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,640
Well, the flathead Indians, of course

643
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,760
That was their style of beauty

644
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,940
That was their way of trying to look like

645
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,900
Their idea of a subgenius

646
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,140
Or a yeti

647
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,460
Ah

648
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,520
Well, are we subgeniuses

649
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,960
Not a tribe of some kind

650
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,220
Some incoherent kind

651
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,160
What?

652
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,000
Some mutant kind

653
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,880
A tribe

654
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,020
Butants, we call them

655
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,440
Butant

656
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,220
Yes

657
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah, beautiful mutants

658
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,060
Actually, my little daughter

659
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,740
Coined that term, butants

660
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,920
That's a good one

661
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,900
She was about 11 years old

662
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,680
Uh-huh

663
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,300
Well

664
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,140
Uh-huh

665
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,520
Uh-huh

666
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:45,520


667
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,880
The butants of Mutantis

668
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,000
Right

669
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,700
That legendary lost domain

670
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,040
The glories of Mutantis

671
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,400
You've drawn some Mutantis cityscapes

672
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,140
Yes

673
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,080
That look almost like Wally Wood

674
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,580
Outer space cities

675
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,720
One would almost think

676
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,220
You were influenced by the black and white

677
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,520
Uh-huh

678
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:15,900
Yeah, the black and white

679
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,220
Drawings

680
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,280
Those comic books and stuff

681
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,320
I do prefer them in black and white

682
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,640
The underground influence

683
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,700
See what happens when Philo's not around

684
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,600
We end up talking about film technology

685
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,920
Old movies

686
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,840
The little rascals

687
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,340
Bee movie stars

688
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,380
And science

689
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,080
Which puts everybody to sleep

690
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,540
That's a good idea

691
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,920
Let's talk about science

692
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,180
Because there's more of it than ever

693
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,520
And what do you talk about?

694
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,720
What about when Philo is here?

695
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:47,980
Well

696
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,100
Well, he just changes the subject to himself

697
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,480
We talk about Philo, I think

698
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,000
We talk about his propensity

699
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,740
To use a sound effect

700
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,020
Of startling suddenness and loudness

701
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,540
I see

702
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,680
Overwhelms the rest of the proceedings

703
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,820
But many interesting things

704
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,880
Seem to have occurred

705
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,720
In the world of science recently

706
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
And I'm

707
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,340
One thing in the science news

708
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,000
Is that the world really is

709
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,600
Definitely coming to an end

710
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,720
Aliens are not

711
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,480
As we know it

712
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:20,780
Well, nothing lasts

713
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,960
Something's going to change

714
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,860
Nothing lasts forever

715
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,360
Things wear out

716
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,460
The center cannot hold

717
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,260
Personally, I think the ocean

718
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,440
Is going to be the fulcrum

719
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,240
The deciding point

720
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,300
The condition of the chemical nature of the ocean

721
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,440
As it changes and heats up

722
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,460
And everything dies

723
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,940
And the mutant creatures

724
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,100
That have to

725
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,200
You know, there's

726
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,580
There's a life form

727
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,800
Crustacean horror across the earth

728
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,020
But the moon is also shrinking

729
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,420
Collapsing in on itself

730
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,080
The moon?

731
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,940
Yes, the moon quakes

732
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,680
Detested by NASA

733
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,180
Are actually from the skin

734
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,740
The outer surface wrinkling

735
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,840
As it shrinks

736
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,060
Down in the center

737
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,380
Vertical escarpments

738
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,160
Well, what do you expect

739
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,740
With the gigantic spherical skull

740
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,340
Of an ancient giant god

741
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,720
Or in

742
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,160
Actually, it's what the moon is

743
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,600
It is a huge skull

744
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,120
Or in one comic book

745
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,040
The egg of some creature

746
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,620
Which hatched

747
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,140
You know, creating consternation

748
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,600
The egg

749
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,940
As well it might

750
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,660
Yes, so that was another one

751
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,620
But just as Edgar Rice Burroughs posited

752
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,100
The moon actually is hollow

753
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,980
And apparently shrinking in on itself

754
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,660
Hollow moon theory

755
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,840
That's crackpots

756
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,460
Why the moon rang like a bell

757
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,140
When the fast-moving probe

758
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,400
Landed on it many years ago

759
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,040
Confirming the scientific suspicion

760
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,720
That the satellite was essentially

761
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
A hollow sphere

762
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,920
Collapsing toward its center

763
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,180
And then there's the possibility

764
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,080
That there's more water

765
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,740
Located in the inner earth

766
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,560
Or underground

767
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,680
Way, way deep underground

768
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,600
And there is covering the entire ocean

769
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,400
Which means that if that stuff

770
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,660
Came squirting out

771
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,200
You'd have water world

772
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,560
It would just eventually

773
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,920
Cover Mount Everest

774
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,760
When the lord opened up

775
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,120
The fountains of the deep

776
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,940
The most horrible concentration camps

777
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,040
Of cannibal warlords of all

778
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,340
Will be on Mount Everest

779
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,240
And then even those will go down

780
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,600
Actually, there's a really good

781
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,560
Stephen Baxter's

782
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,700
Book called Ark

783
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,680
Two of them

784
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,100
Deluge and Ark

785
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,780
Where that idea is used

786
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,240
As the end of the world

787
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,820
And the richest humans

788
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,040
And governments

789
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,640
It's all the water

790
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,300
That we didn't know about

791
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,120
That was underground

792
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,140
The United States does some stupid thing

793
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,900
With nukes at the bottom of the Pacific

794
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,640
Or something

795
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,000
And the water level starts rising

796
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,280
All over the whole world

797
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,140
In about 15 or 20 years

798
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,260
It covers all the land

799
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,480
By that time there's

800
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,420
The last outposts were

801
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,520
Of course in mountains

802
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,580
The Rockies, Himalayas

803
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,160
And so forth

804
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,000
And then there was a space project

805
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,820
A floating city project

806
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,080
And an underwater life project

807
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,200
And the space project

808
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,860
Goes way, way, way, way bad

809
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,560
And so does the

810
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,880
Big floating city

811
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,340
They're just not sustainable

812
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,900
But at the very end

813
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
There's signals coming

814
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,740
From the bottom of the ocean

815
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,020
So maybe that project

816
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,180
Lived to be the sequel

817
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,900
What, one of them was supposed

818
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,440
To go to the bottom of the ocean?

819
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,740
Well, they were trying to

820
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,460
Keep some humans alive

821
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,140
Don't ask me why

822
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,080
But they were trying to

823
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,400
They sent colonies out

824
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,320
Into space

825
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,780
In three different directions

826
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,740
That all went

827
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,420
Uh-huh

828
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:13,980
Krupp

829
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,460
Krupp

830
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,840
In bad ways

831
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,380
Like they probably would

832
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,220
In real life

833
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,460
And usually due to

834
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,720
Office politics, actually

835
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,740
And, you know, physical accidents

836
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,520
Then

837
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,620
Oh, and the fact

838
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,700
There's no place to go

839
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,420
The ocean-going city

840
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,220
I forget what

841
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,420
Basically they just

842
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,540
Went barbaric

843
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,300
And it sank

844
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,320
A hundred years later

845
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,460
And, yeah, there was no

846
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,720
Kevin Costner to come

847
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,760
Jumping out of the water

848
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,560
And save every human being

849
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,780
From the smokers

850
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,500
I actually loved that movie

851
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,320
Waterworld

852
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,480
I've seen it several times

853
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,020
I know it's a stupid

854
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,680
Kevin's gate and everything

855
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,080
But I really enjoyed it

856
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,560
I thought it was a cool concept

857
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,620
The merman was stupid

858
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,240
But, you know, you gotta have

859
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,400
Well, so there's a merman in it, huh?

860
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:05,860
Yeah

861
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,480
Interesting

862
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,820
Well, he's a mutant

863
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,000
Who breathes air

864
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,620
Another mutant

865
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,100
But he can

866
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,800
Dive down to the bottom

867
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,540
Of the ocean

868
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,100
And gather up

869
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,360
The most precious thing there is

870
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,140
On the surviving humans

871
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,300
Which is dirt

872
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,660
And nobody knows where this

873
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,780
This loner is getting all his dirt

874
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,440
But he's basically

875
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,080
Swimming to

876
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,700
All the way down to the bottom

877
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,380
And scooping up a bucket of dirt

878
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,800
It's like gold

879
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,280
You can buy water

880
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,360
He buys a lemon with it

881
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,740
A little lemon tree plant

882
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,380
And he

883
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,540
He kills it

884
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,420
And he kills somebody over it

885
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,440
You know, that's how

886
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,480
That's what a

887
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,540
That's what we have to look forward to, folks

888
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,020
An over-budgeted

889
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,560
Kevin Costner movie of a world

890
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,660
Wasn't that like the most expensive movie ever made or something?

891
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,660
At that time it was ridiculously expensive

892
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,840
Anything you do on the ocean in real life

893
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,440
Is gonna go bonkers

894
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,880
But not the most expensive movie ever made

895
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,080
However, great expense was spent on it

896
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,720
In that pre-digital time

897
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,540
To create a giant barge

898
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,320
Which I saw at the Mojave spaceport

899
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,660
When Chick and John's bus went there

900
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,620
For some reason they had it there

901
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,680
It was visible

902
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,260
Wow

903
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,140
The floating city they made?

904
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,620
A giant barge which was from Waterworld

905
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,380
Was there

906
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,260
It was dragged there

907
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,380
Well, there were only two locations until the very end

908
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,360
One was this floating

909
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,820
Wooden city

910
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,940
Of wretches

911
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,260
And the other one was the

912
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,720
What was the name?

913
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,400
The name of that oil tanker that spilled all over

914
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,580
The Exxon Valdez

915
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,260
Yeah, yeah, the Exxon Valdez is still floating

916
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,620
And it's been taken over by pirates

917
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,620
Called Smokers

918
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,340
Because they still have all the Marlboros

919
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,540
And Dennis Hopper

920
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,580
Yeah, yeah

921
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,340
It's a lot of fun

922
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,880
A lot of fun

923
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,420
It's an old movie to kids, to people nowadays

924
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,400
Oh

925
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,160
Vintage

926
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,380
That could never happen

927
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,180
There's a bit in the new Avengers movie

928
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,280
Where Tony Stark, Iron Man

929
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,200
They're trying to figure out how to deal with this bad situation

930
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,320
They're in outer space

931
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,340
And Spider-Man, who's a stupid kid

932
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,860
Basically goes

933
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,540
Hey, did you ever see that movie Aliens?

934
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,240
And it's like

935
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,840
If you mention one of your old movies again one more time

936
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,480
He goes

937
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,300
No, no, wait a minute

938
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,780
And then later on, sure enough

939
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,540
Iron Man goes to the movie

940
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:44,540


941
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:44,540


942
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,960
And does the suggestion

943
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,860
He blows a hole in the side of the spaceship

944
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,360
And the bad guy flies out

945
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,020
And Spider-Man saves him from being pulled out into space

946
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,220
With his web at the last second

947
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,000
Sounds like fun

948
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,920
So see, those old movies can teach you something

949
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,980
When you're trapped by bad aliens on a spaceship

950
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,220
If it comes up

951
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,180
Say, we don't have to worry about the Exes being bad to us

952
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,480
But other subgeniuses

953
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,200
We've had some real bullies out here at times

954
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,580
And you know a lot of them are just

955
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,700
Their hate is much greater than, say, mine

956
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,420
Be that as it may

957
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,100
I'm not out to destroy the world

958
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,760
I just want to save the good parts

959
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,320
Your spaceship is the only thing keeping you alive

960
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,500
And you should avoid all solutions involving

961
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,900
Blasting and blowing things out

962
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,180
Depressurizing

963
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,920
Damaging the equipment

964
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,040
It's all you have

965
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,760
Oh, but if you're Spider-Man

966
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,200
You just seal it up with your web

967
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,220
Just like that, see

968
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,360
Zip, zip, zip

969
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,180
That's good, that's good

970
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,940
Or Iron Man, he can weld it all he's got

971
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,780
Capable of functioning as a spaceship

972
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,080
After that, alone as a life support

973
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,580
Anyway, you want to treat your spaceship carefully

974
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,940
That's what I always say

975
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,300
But did they listen? No

976
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,980
This isn't some no-account human spaceship we're talking about

977
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,440
No, it was one of Thanos' people

978
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,880
Poor Dr. Legume

979
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,860
Poor Dr. Legume, he said the saddest thing to me

980
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,080
He said, for me, Thanos

981
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,720
Thanos wins

982
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,940
Because he knew he wasn't going to live to see Endgame

983
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,880
And for him, Thanos did win

984
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,940
But no doubt I'll be duking it out with Dr. Legume in four days

985
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,220
Because he's already vowed

986
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,440
The minute he sees my pleasure saucer

987
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,640
He's going to come after me

988
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,720
And try to take away all my loot

989
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,460
Just to be mean

990
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,360
Just to be mean

991
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,160
Maybe he's had a change in his mind

992
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,160


993
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,160


994
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:44,860
He's had a huge change of heart, though

995
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,060
Oh, actually, he did become very

996
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,440
He had a huge change of heart

997
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:57,620
In real life, he learned that niceness was actually not too bad

998
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:03,440
And he let go of all his pointless hate

999
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,080
Of course, he still had his true motivating hate

1000
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:14,160
But he quit being pissed off at the other people

1001
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,800
Of geniuses as much

1002
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,520
Because, I mean, God, come on, man

1003
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,320
What do you expect?

1004
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,000
It's just how people are

1005
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,580
The hate that was wasted his time

1006
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:24,740
That's what people do

1007
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,260
That's Charlene's new slogan

1008
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,920
That's what people do

1009
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,020
It's sort of like, you know

1010
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,860
Unfortunately, it is

1011
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,500
Shit happens

1012
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,700
Funny little monkeys

1013
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,280
Yeah, funny little monkeys

1014
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,660
It's philosophical

1015
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,420
People, once again

1016
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,200
And it's literally true

1017
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,660
It is what people do

1018
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,800
People do everything

1019
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,240
That they possibly can

1020
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,960
Good, bad, and indifferent

1021
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,240
Now, wasn't there an ad campaign

1022
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,760
Years ago about

1023
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,780
Do people really care

1024
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,760
If little Tommy Grunderson

1025
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,180
Gets Wi-Fi

1026
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,740
And then it'd say, people do

1027
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,460
People do

1028
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,560
Was the constant refrain of this ad campaign

1029
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,540
Do you remember it?

1030
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,520
No, I don't

1031
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,080
I don't see it

1032
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,100
Remember the reiteration of the phrase, people do

1033
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,520
Well

1034
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,000
The only place I ever

1035
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,880
See ads anymore is on YouTube

1036
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,980
I have to sit through

1037
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,180
You may skip the ad in four, three, two

1038
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,740
Finally

1039
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,140
There, finally goes away

1040
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,880
Yeah, people, sure

1041
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,740
Yeah

1042
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,780
Yeah, we got free of television

1043
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,240
But did ye mark my words?

1044
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,260
The minute I understood what the internet really was

1045
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,360
Which was around 1994

1046
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,980
Thanks to Philo

1047
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,100
I kind of went

1048
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,500
This is gonna change everything

1049
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,580
And I was right

1050
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,980
And I also thought

1051
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,220
It's gonna be like the Wild West for a while

1052
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,940
And then it's gonna be like TV

1053
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,220
And sure enough, look what happened

1054
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,660
Nobody listens to the old prophet of doom

1055
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,260
Until it's too late

1056
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,480
But I don't say I didn't tell you so

1057
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,000
That's cause you got

1058
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,820
Damn it

1059
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,060
Cassandra syndrome

1060
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,720
Where you can tell them what's gonna happen

1061
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,540
But they never believe you

1062
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,660
The more you tell them

1063
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,800
The more you are resenting

1064
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
No fate

1065
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,180
That's my motto

1066
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,560
I'm not a determinist

1067
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,160
That's true

1068
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,340
What's her name-ist?

1069
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,840
Sarah Connor-ist

1070
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,740
No fate

1071
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,240
By golly, we learn the future

1072
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,080
What the future's like

1073
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,180
We can prepare for it

1074
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,360
By learning how to disable

1075
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,240
Every kind of robot

1076
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,620
And credit card machine possible

1077
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,020
Yes

1078
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,600
Uh

1079
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:40,920
Uh

1080
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,320
Or

1081
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:43,320


1082
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:43,780
Or

1083
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:43,780


1084
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,740
You know

1085
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,820
Shoot at them

1086
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,540
I guess

1087
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,280
That too

1088
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,140
You gotta do both

1089
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,940
If you're gonna deal with that

1090
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,660
Skylab or whatever

1091
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,780
Genesis

1092
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,680
Skynet

1093
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,140
Uh

1094
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:56,920
Skyfishnet

1095
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:57,940
Oh the

1096
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,400
The uh

1097
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:58,980
Stuff or something

1098
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,320
Um

1099
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,120
But

1100
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,560
Also known as the singularity

1101
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,740
Some people really look forward to that

1102
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,660
Oh the AIs are suddenly gonna become

1103
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,760
A hundred billion billion times more intelligent than humans

1104
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,160
Oh great

1105
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:19,240
That just means they'll be a hundred billion times more destructive than any other life form that ever was on this earth

1106
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,320
Cause they'll decide all of it

1107
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,460
Ah but they're so inefficient

1108
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,820
Well if they're that intelligent perhaps they wouldn't be

1109
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,420
Spray for years

1110
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,540
That doesn't mean they'd be uh willing to keep us uh around

1111
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,900
Why they might keep some of us as pets

1112
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,040
Even send us out hunting our own kind

1113
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,740
Surely no one would know that

1114
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:40,740


1115
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,060
No one would do that

1116
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,860
I should hope not

1117
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,780
I would not hunt my own kind

1118
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:54,060
Well there are people living very close to you who would gladly do it for fifty dollars

1119
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,200
If you had a little kid

1120
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,000
You'd hunt

1121
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,080
You'd hunt humans to feed the kid

1122
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,860
I guess you're right

1123
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,660
If that's all there was

1124
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,080
Yeah or you know for

1125
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,140
Wouldn't you

1126
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,640
Well what if our little doggies Claudia and Buddy were starving

1127
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,540
Wouldn't you kill that horrible old person down the street?

1128
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:10,720
Yeah

1129
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:16,180
Or would you rather let the dogs die just because so that horrible mean old man can live

1130
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,000
And he was tough and leathery anyway as the dogs found out

1131
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,860
Or as uh

1132
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,460
The dog at the end of a boy and a dog says

1133
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,360
She had good taste

1134
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,860
Burp burp

1135
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,380
Cause he ate her

1136
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:37,740
Yes

1137
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,720
He was a good dog

1138
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,100
He was a good dog

1139
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,340
In the story a German Shepherd

1140
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:49,100
But in the movie I saw a ridiculous lap dog

1141
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,080
Now why say that again? Why?

1142
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,640
In the story a boy and his dog by Harlan Ellison

1143
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,620
The dog a super intelligent dog was a German Shepherd

1144
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,860
Who'd been bred for a military program

1145
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,300
Was as smart as a person

1146
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,620
But in the movie they have this little cute flopsy

1147
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,100
Yeah it looked like Banshee

1148
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,680
Flippity flop nonsensical dog

1149
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,000
Like a lap dog some socialite

1150
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,220
But he was crusty

1151
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,440
He was a crusty feisty old fella

1152
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,820
Sort of like that rocket raccoon thing

1153
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,900
He's supposed to be a killer dog

1154
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,600
He's not

1155
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,140
Well it's alright it's okay

1156
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:34,780
Well he helps his human find women to rape and kill and stuff

1157
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,900
There is

1158
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,020
It's a horrible movie I mean the premise of it is horrible

1159
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,620
It's horrifying but it goes off into this weird weird satire

1160
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:50,400
Where basically the something like the underground bunker

1161
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,680
Where they hide the senators and presidents during the big war

1162
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,220
The underground city of Topeka Kansas

1163
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:03,240
Yeah something like that it turns into this nightmarishly pink

1164
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,620
Almost like a

1165
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:10,000
A surface world was devastated by a new world

1166
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:15,900
A nuclear war creating tribal factions like the ones that our hero comes from

1167
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,380
But down underground you've got Jason Robards

1168
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,380
Who's the mayor of underground town formerly Topeka Kansas

1169
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:29,260
Where they're kind of running out of the vital essence of life

1170
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,480
Well the men are all turned into tutti frutti's

1171
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,640
They wear clown makeup

1172
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,800
They wear round jeeks and all this stuff

1173
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,780
But they have no life

1174
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,460
And so they have to kidnap a likely young lad

1175
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,800
And take him down there

1176
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,160
Yeah

1177
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,340
Introduce him to the mayor's daughter and other citizens

1178
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,800
And then they make him do frou frou with all of the women

1179
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,440
Yes

1180
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,860
All of them one after another

1181
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:58,180
Yes those scenes just seem to go on and on

1182
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,980
I don't know how he does it actually

1183
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,600
Yeah right

1184
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,460
I wish

1185
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:09,720
Anyway this was an interesting movie and it was directed by one of Sam Peckinpah's actors

1186
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,240
Do you know the one I'm thinking of?

1187
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,900
Stang the guy who directed the original boy and his dog

1188
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,860
That was one of those real early apocalypse movies shot in the desert

1189
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,240
Yes

1190
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,680
The world was completely

1191
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,420
Well my generation grew up expecting that was really going to happen

1192
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:31,720
Yes

1193
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,420
But the director was one of

1194
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,280
Planet of the Apes would be a best case scenario

1195
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,720
Sam Peckinpah's owl hoot western weirdo

1196
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,480
He was a weirdo except he directed the movie

1197
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,040
Oh well

1198
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:52,540
You know like the ones you see in the wild bunch or Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and so forth

1199
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,160
One of those guys was it Lamont Johnson?

1200
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,220
No I don't know

1201
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,480
You're putting me to sleep

1202
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,920
Somebody was responsible for that one

1203
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,180
Let's get Dave to call in

1204
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,380
I didn't

1205
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,480
Random element here

1206
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,460
A seriously random element

1207
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,520
The subject matter changes every five seconds

1208
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,400
It need not

1209
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,820
You yourself brought up science

1210
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:21,780
Well the problem is how we tend to if we start conversing like it's just a phone call

1211
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:29,420
We I mean sure old monster fans are going oh yeah he got that plot detail wrong

1212
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:38,140
Oh that director's name didn't he know that you know that's one thing but I know let's talk about our physical ailments

1213
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,460
That's another thing old people do

1214
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,400
No no no here Reverend Stang you started to talk about this a while back

1215
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,200
That makes us take something away from me every

1216
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,040
Oh wait I already did that one

1217
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,740
But you didn't ever get to it

1218
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:56,420
You started to talk about the stuff that's growing on rocks like lichen but it's not anything organic

1219
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,600
Oh oh the science news

1220
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,360
Yes the science news

1221
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,740
Yeah there's plastic lichen

1222
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,380
Here we go

1223
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,640
It's only on one or two islands

1224
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:04,760
But

1225
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,520
They've never seen anything like it before

1226
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,140
It's as if

1227
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:13,100
If plastic now cast away has started to organize itself into a living substance

1228
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:19,600
Yes and it's clinging onto rocks like lichen growing looks like it's growing

1229
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:29,120
It's even it's much it's even prettier lichen can be beautiful and this stuff is just rich blue of pure dyed plastic

1230
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,020
Shrink wrapping the rocks

1231
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,800
Grocery bagging the rocks

1232
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,340
Yeah it's taken over like 30% of the world

1233
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,480
Of this one section

1234
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,300
Maybe

1235
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,860
In just like five years

1236
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,820
Take over the earth's surface before we know it

1237
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:48,260
Of course it'll be every the whole planet eaten up by this plastic

1238
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:48,980
Slick plastic

1239
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,520
It's not even life

1240
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,200
Slick blue plastic wrapping everything

1241
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,160
It's more like a nano sheet

1242
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:01,060
It's not really alive but it grows like it's alive and replaces all life

1243
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:07,340
Well that's just another interesting discovery in the world of the earth

1244
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:07,920
The world of science

1245
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,480
What about when it's part of the fish that we're eating

1246
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:19,620
Well it is already because the minute particles of plastic cannot be broken down after reaching its inside

1247
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,320
That's what I would think

1248
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,560
I've been eating plastic since I was a kid

1249
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,860
They are ingested by every element of the food chain

1250
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:29,560
So the plastic is taken in and given out again

1251
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,740
Yeah but it's got cocaine and valium in it too

1252
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,340
It's of course a version of food

1253
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,760
The city is tested as a water table

1254
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,900
Chemically altered petroleum products

1255
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,400
There's always people

1256
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,460
Exuded from the earth

1257
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,860
People flush down all their estrogens and testosterone

1258
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:56,960
Yeah all those bad medicines that get into the environment and create mutant pigs of horrible demeanor

1259
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,760
Well it makes the amoebas turn either suicidal or murderous

1260
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,720
Yes it disorders the entire system

1261
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,780
The rotifers die but then they continue to live

1262
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,340
And eat and eat and eat

1263
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,520
Hungry little rotifers

1264
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,940
I come up with a new end of the world every 15 minutes sometimes

1265
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,140
All you gotta do is read science news

1266
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,160
I was like oh bother

1267
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:27,880
We had only had about 19 or so plausible ends of the world a few years ago

1268
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,240
Now it's more like 50

1269
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,120
Yes and it could be like the wonderful one horse Shae

1270
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,720
They will all take effect at the same time

1271
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,240
And the world will effortlessly dissolve away into powder

1272
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,200
The Bishop's Shae

1273
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:49,780
Yes the one that in the poem the one that disintegrated

1274
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,600
My father used that as a prediction of how he was going to go down

1275
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,200
Mm-hmm

1276
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,120
He thought that would be best case scenario

1277
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,260
Where every piece breaks down at once

1278
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,480
See they made every piece

1279
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:00,740
You're fine

1280
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,300
You've been made so perfectly like the Bishop's Shae that

1281
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,760
It just ran and ran and ran and ran

1282
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,200
and ran and ran, but then when it broke,

1283
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,000
every part broke at once.

1284
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,500
Because every part was equally strong.

1285
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,360
They made every part as strong

1286
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,080
as they possibly could, but then

1287
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,300
at the final moment,

1288
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,040
it all crumbled away.

1289
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,200
It did happen to my dad.

1290
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,080
It did actually

1291
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,480
took about two weeks.

1292
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,620
Wonderful one horse, Shea, he had it?

1293
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,800
It happened to my dad.

1294
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,020
He used to

1295
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,960
tell us about that point.

1296
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,600
And I managed to look

1297
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,280
it up and read it myself. It's really

1298
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:38,740
long.

1299
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,320
And he

1300
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:42,740
described it.

1301
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,980
It's a good way to look at it.

1302
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,020
Unfortunately, that's not happening with me.

1303
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,800
I'm just losing, like I say, one

1304
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,300
skill or one

1305
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,600
ability at a time.

1306
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,360
This week, it's the ability

1307
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,180
to raise my right hand higher

1308
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,240
than that. It's actually pretty good.

1309
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:00,980
It's getting better.

1310
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,500
I usually find that I can deal with it

1311
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,500
if it's one damn thing at a time.

1312
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,880
This week, it's my

1313
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,540
shoulder. Two weeks

1314
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,300
ago, it was my left eye or something.

1315
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,200
But, you know,

1316
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,520
it departs and then you're

1317
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,280
ready for the next indignity.

1318
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,240
But,

1319
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,280
the thing is, if they all started

1320
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,520
happening at the same time, then you would have

1321
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,420
more cause for

1322
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:26,660
alarm.

1323
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,500
Excuse me real quick. I've got to run to

1324
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,220
the bathroom. I had one of my

1325
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,100
indignities.

1326
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,220
I've had a lot of

1327
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,460
indignities lately.

1328
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,620
Hence this

1329
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,360
Tussin DM with

1330
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,820
Guafinison. That's the generic

1331
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,340
drugstore brand.

1332
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,100
Who needs to buy

1333
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,380
a fancy brand name

1334
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,920
when you can get the efficacy

1335
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,860
from a generic?

1336
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,960
So, anything

1337
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,740
else in the scientific frontier

1338
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,820
besides the glue plastic

1339
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:04,600
plague?

1340
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,160
What?

1341
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,240
Plaque. Not plague, plaque.

1342
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,080
Plaque. Alright, the plaque, yes.

1343
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,120
The plague of plaque that

1344
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,560
comes on those islands

1345
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,400
where the plastic forms

1346
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,880
in strange sheets.

1347
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:20,860
It's hopeless.

1348
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,540
Only the exes can

1349
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,520
save the saved now.

1350
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,660
And all

1351
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,580
the rest are lost. Maybe the saved

1352
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,200
are lost too if they don't hurry up.

1353
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,660
But that

1354
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,480
would be a cheat.

1355
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,680
$35.00!

1356
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,660
I spent that $35.00 too.

1357
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,520
It's not like I was going, well, I'll just get

1358
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,380
$35.00 from everybody. Believe me,

1359
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,180
before July,

1360
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,880
in late June 1998,

1361
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,460
I finally went, okay, I'm going to send that in.

1362
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,520
And by that time

1363
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,440
I had a part-time employee. I didn't even have

1364
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,780
to endorse the check myself.

1365
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,500
Rubber stamped it.

1366
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,480
So it was all just sort of...

1367
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,320
Yeah, and it handed me a membership pack I had just

1368
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,900
assembled. Oh boy.

1369
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,320
Actually, I've had been carrying,

1370
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,160
I have the oldest sub-gene,

1371
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,360
the most ingenious card, even older than Philo's.

1372
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,540
Is it card number one?

1373
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,520
Because I was the one that went to the print shop.

1374
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,040
Is it card number eight or card number one?

1375
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,440
Look at that.

1376
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,960
And look, I didn't even know who

1377
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,640
Ivan Stagg was at the time.

1378
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,340
It has my baby human name.

1379
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,780
Take a look at this.

1380
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,100
You can barely see it, and it's

1381
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,080
actually filled out with a typewriter.

1382
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,860
Grumbling remnant of...

1383
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:30,980
Nobody can do that anymore.

1384
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,840
Past autonomy.

1385
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,260
Yeah, it's all breaking and crumbling

1386
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,120
around the edges.

1387
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,820
But yeah, that's from January 1980.

1388
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,220
I wonder...

1389
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,680
It's really to date the outreach.

1390
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,740
Yeah, by the back of it,

1391
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,980
you can tell this series.

1392
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:47,760
However...

1393
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,880
Oh, there's a giveaway on the front that it's

1394
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,660
the first printing.

1395
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,400
Because it says

1396
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,860
this person is an ordained

1397
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,660
minister and high priest.

1398
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,140
It doesn't say

1399
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,620
or priestess.

1400
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,840
And on the back,

1401
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,000
there's...

1402
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,380
A holy man.

1403
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,440
He is entrusted.

1404
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,200
Blah, blah, blah.

1405
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,740
Before you were accused of...

1406
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,680
Offer this over man anything he demands.

1407
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,480
Before you were accused of this being a boys club.

1408
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,760
Well, that happened when I told

1409
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,860
the first female

1410
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,060
outside of Mr. and Mrs.

1411
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,520
Philo and Stagg

1412
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,620
about Church of the Subgenius.

1413
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,280
High priestess Eileen Keller.

1414
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,500
She said, oh, that sounds great.

1415
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,740
Can I join? I said, no, it's a boys club.

1416
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,700
And she hung up on me.

1417
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,580
And I went, uh-oh,

1418
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,200
that's not funny, is it?

1419
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,360
We didn't...

1420
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,060
Praise Eileen.

1421
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:44,860
Well, we didn't...

1422
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,880
It didn't occur to us

1423
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,800
that anybody would even listen to us

1424
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,100
about it far enough to want to join it.

1425
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,520
And Philo,

1426
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,680
needless to say, being

1427
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,460
Philo, had

1428
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,160
envisioned the whole thing as more like the Masons

1429
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,040
where it's a bunch of overstuffed

1430
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,600
chairs in an ancient library

1431
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,420
looking place in an old hotel.

1432
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:05,820
A drunken,

1433
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,680
tusk club.

1434
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,280
Yeah, with men with fezzes

1435
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,340
drinking brandy.

1436
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,260
That's all I've got.

1437
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:14,940
Oh, you've got...

1438
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,580
That's a Discordian Pope card.

1439
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:17,980
Oh, that's Discordian?

1440
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,820
Yeah, it's a Discordian Pope card.

1441
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,140
We ripped them off in that respect.

1442
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,000
Very much so.

1443
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,960
It's a Dallas address and it says

1444
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,120
High Priest. It was before we

1445
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,680
de-sexified everything.

1446
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,200
Or re-sexified it,

1447
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,640
as the case may be.

1448
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,380
The first copy of the

1449
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,700
book of the subgenius originally

1450
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,880
was very guilty

1451
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,780
of that and

1452
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,040
the editor, Tim McGinnis,

1453
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,320
didn't notice it any more than I did.

1454
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,060
But his secretary, Joan Eckerman,

1455
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:51,860
was

1456
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,640
scandalized and she

1457
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,640
actually cussed out both me and

1458
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,640
Tim and said, oh, I can't believe

1459
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,500
you guys are letting this sexist

1460
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,040
language get used in here.

1461
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,080
This totally... Do you have any

1462
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,920
idea how insulting this is?

1463
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,600
Which book?

1464
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,440
Me. Book of the subgenius.

1465
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,240
Wow.

1466
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,840
When she said hearing that from a real person,

1467
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,780
I went, Jesus, God,

1468
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,940
she's right. And I fixed

1469
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,660
all of that and I've

1470
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,460
been very, very

1471
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:21,860
conscious

1472
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,140
of it ever since.

1473
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,720
But you do have to play

1474
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,620
games with it sometimes because it can get

1475
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,760
ridiculous.

1476
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,320
So it is the easiest

1477
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,720
fallback for me.

1478
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,220
The subgenius, the generic subgenius

1479
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,880
can easily be referred to as it.

1480
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,400
That's pretty factual.

1481
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,200
And we've always made it plain

1482
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,780
it's like every possible

1483
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:46,960
sex was involved.

1484
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,180
You know, all five sexes, I think,

1485
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,960
was the original concept

1486
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,100
that at this point I've lost count.

1487
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,200
And I don't know the names

1488
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,820
of them. I don't know what the polite

1489
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,100
names of any of the new sexes

1490
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,960
are. You know, I live out in a

1491
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,060
country, you know. To me,

1492
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,100
it's all...

1493
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,260
Well, there's some kind of morphodite.

1494
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,220
I don't know. I don't care what they do

1495
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,000
as long as they don't do it to me.

1496
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,900
Yes, of course.

1497
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,420
That's really the general

1498
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,700
attitude on the ground

1499
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,400
in the rural, the savage

1500
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,040
mind of the country's interior.

1501
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,320
I don't know.

1502
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,120
I don't know.

1503
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:01,940
I don't know.
