1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
Well, I do, I do, I do.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,920
I tried one last year, and that coolness was too much of a change for me.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,040
But maybe I ought to try again, as you suggest.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,400
Clue.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,320
Ah, here I am on my fifth or sixth spud.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,520
Funny, I don't taste the menthol the way I did at the start.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,120
Say, that's a clue worth tracking down.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,300
Smoked spud.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,800
Menthol-cooled cigarettes.

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,640
Yes, sir.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,520
The proof is in the second pack.

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,940
Well, I don't even notice the first pack anymore.

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,540
But it has its points.

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,580
Ah, there's one.

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,560
Makes the tobacco taste better.

16
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,700
Keeps my mouth cool and clean and full of a long white tube.

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,560
Mouth happiness.

18
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,400
That's it, by golly, the Angston Fisher Tobacco Company,

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,900
incorporated from Louisville, Kentucky.

20
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,860
I smoke them, I eat them.

21
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,360
Spuds.

22
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:49,580
Spuds.

23
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,120
Spuds.

24
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,160
Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,500
Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,060
That you hate to make him wait

27
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,040
But you just gotta have another

28
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,220
So genius.

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,000
Our own

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,200
Spud.

31
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,720
Spud.

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,180
And speaking of which,

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,420
I'm hearing a clicking and a clacking sound.

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,780
I'm not.

35
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,100
Who gives a sh... about you?

36
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,000
That means it's not going on to the tape.

37
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,740
And all I care about is the tape.

38
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,940
I don't care about the listeners.

39
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,960
The audience, screw them.

40
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,060
I...

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,300
All I care about is the tape that no one ever listens to.

42
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,480
You've actually physically tried to screw the audience.

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,500
For years and years, it's been like one of your main back-of-your-mind-type fantasy dreams

44
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,640
is to literally screw everybody in your audience.

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,340
Well, it's to pay them back for all the slack I've vampirized off of them.

46
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,540
Every time they listen, I feel the power.

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,760
And they're granting a certain amount of power over their mind to us.

48
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,360
With your dirt on your chest.

49
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,040
Just waiting for the sun to rise.

50
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,940
The sun to go down.

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,380
It's better in a... in a... in a night... a bar.

52
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,600
A vampire sucks blood.

53
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,160
When you're up on stage and all those primate eyes are looking at you,

54
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,520
you sap off the energy.

55
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,380
Yeah.

56
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:09,940
Yeah.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,280
No, no, not just the money.

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,660
And the green blood comes out.

59
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,860
It's the soul, man.

60
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,760
Your life essences.

61
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,180
The soul is real.

62
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,600
Your psychic juices.

63
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,680
And a sip of the sweet wine of another soul

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,280
is enough to make you puke sometimes.

65
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,240
A sip of the wine.

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,300
To suck of the meat of the soul of the believer.

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,800
This is the appetite of the religious holy man.

68
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,440
You know, preacher.

69
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,700
Yeah.

70
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,120
This is the rite of the...

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,040
And the rock star.

72
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,000
This is the wheel and the mandate of the...

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,180
And the politician.

74
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,960
They're all vampires.

75
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,260
They're slack vampires is what they are.

76
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,380
They suck.

77
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,020
They suck.

78
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,020


79
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,020


80
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,020


81
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,020


82
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,520
This here text break we're gonna cook up for you.

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,200
It's gonna make every American so damn happy just to...

84
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,480
We're gonna open up the Alaska Williams.

85
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,660
Oh, yeah.

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,380
This is gonna make everybody in America so damn happy just to...

87
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,300
They drink our life's blood.

88
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
What about the Americans who hardly ever have...

89
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,100
They spread on cheese a nickel waffle-thin pieces of white bread

90
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,580
and pass them out amongst themselves in poet rooms.

91
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,260
You there, do you constantly worry about your finances?

92
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,900
Do you wonder why your job doesn't guarantee the satisfaction of your tireless effort?

93
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,440
Oh, friend, look no further, for what you're missing is slack.

94
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,300
If you feel the need to ask, you'll never know, for slack is not a physical object that

95
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,980
one can possess, but rather a non-materialistic perception of the world.

96
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,020
On the film's screen, you'll find a list of the most important things you can do to make

97
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,020


98
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,020


99
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,080
Studies—your life as a professional computer-装 reboot

100
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:12,900
You can turn your tech key on to play free music or escape from doing whatever it takes

101
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,600
to feed yourself to

102
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:13,600


103
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:13,880
Neat

104
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,560
chit-chat

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:16,800
and

106
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,900
ho invincible

107
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,440
crises

108
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:19,440


109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,920
virtual space

110
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,020
Nothing

111
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,900
You're starting

112
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,940
They want to control your mind!

113
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,220
EVERYTHING!

114
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,400
We're going into a subconscious!

115
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,500
The question is, will you become a slave to their games?

116
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,320
Or will you become a slack master?

117
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,040
As the human race loses more slack and becomes more restless and violent,

118
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,200
the world as we know it will plunge into chaos!

119
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,160
That which once seemed logical and sane will be flooded with conspiracy theories

120
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,800
and powerful ideas pushed and pressed by the Buffetmasters Society!

121
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,100
Come travel!

122
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,260
Welcome to your Elvake Vape!

123
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,140
Well, sir ma'am, that was a song from a new contributor.

124
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,980
Let's call him Reverend Trevor B.

125
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,140
Although the song title says, featuring Ramsay on it.

126
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:34,420
Before that, some old ESO radio from 2001, right after Princess Wee and I got married, in fact.

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,900
And the ad for Spud was from the Firesign Theatre, as is this wonderful religious piece

128
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,980
from the recent collection of very old material, Dope Humor of the Seventies.

129
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,500
Do you know, Lord, if you're going where you're going?

130
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,380
Does you know that this is Easter Sunday?

131
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,140
Do you know that the rock and the roll pulls the rug?

132
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,960
The rock and the roll pulls the rock away.

133
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,880
You got the rock and the roll the rock away today,

134
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,260
because it's Easter, children, and what do that mean to us?

135
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,720
What do it mean to us, I say? What do it mean?

136
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,180
What do it mean?

137
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,200
You mean they pull the rock away, they pull the rock away.

138
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,940
What did they find, Reverend Theth?

139
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,240
Thank you, Jesus, they found nothing.

140
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,060
Nothing?

141
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,040
No, they found nothing, brother.

142
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,460
They found nothing. Thank you, Jesus, and I thank you, Jesus.

143
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,900
There was nothing there.

144
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,740
They didn't find nothing.

145
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,000
Nothing to be afraid of.

146
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,600
There was a rock in front and they took the rock away.

147
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,360
Thank you, Jesus, and the rock was not there no more.

148
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,500
Thank you, Jesus, he was gone.

149
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,640
Gone, nobody there.

150
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,380
He was gone.

151
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,480
Where'd he go?

152
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,980
Thank you, Jesus, where did he go?

153
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,140
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

154
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,920
Where did he go?

155
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,280
Oh, that's right, sister, he went to a gas station.

156
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,980
Oh, yeah, thank you, Jesus.

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,320
Thank you, Jesus, he went to a gas station.

158
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,460
Give me your watch, darling, darling.

159
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,900
What did he ask for there?

160
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,440
Yes, he asked for a gas station.

161
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,960
Gasolene.

162
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,240
He asked for some gasoline.

163
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,900
Yes, gasoline.

164
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:58,900


165
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,300
That's right, thank you, Jesus, he asked for some gasoline and some methadrine.

166
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,320
Methadrine.

167
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,400
He said fill up the tank with Methadrine, Jesus.

168
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,280
Methadrine and gasoline, he asked for.

169
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, yes indeed, yes.

170
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,980
Thank you, Jesus.

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,060
Thank you, Jesus.

172
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,440
And then he drove away.

173
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,280
Where'd he go?

174
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,820
Where'd he go?

175
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,300
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

176
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,480
He went to Bakersfield.

177
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,600
He went to Bakersfield.

178
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:14,880
He went to Bakersfield.

179
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,660
People can go to Bakersfield.

180
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:15,980
Thank you, Rob.

181
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,900
He got all the way, all the way to Bakersfield.

182
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,880
Thank you, Krishna.

183
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,820
Metha, Methadrine, yeah.

184
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,200
Thank you Krishna. He got right there and what did he do when he got there?

185
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,140
He went to the Hacienda Motel

186
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,120
And he parked his car

187
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,780
And he parked his car and he parked and he locked it to discourage

188
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,280
Thieves, thank you Jesus to discourage thieves and he went inside the coffee shop Lord. Yes. Thank you Jesus

189
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Inside the coffee shop and he opened the air-conditioned door and he went inside and he sat down at the table

190
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,600
Oh, thank you Jesus

191
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,720
And he ordered some food Jesus. Oh, we got more food. He ordered himself a hamburger

192
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,740
Yes, Jesus he added himself a hamburger

193
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,600
With onions

194
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,240
And pickles, thank you. Thank you Rama

195
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,080
And he ordered some lettuce and a side of tomatoes and some french fries and a big glass of coke

196
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:23,560
Praise the Firesign Theatre friends the Church of the subgenius might never have existed without them

197
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:23,640
Praise the Firesign Theatre friends the Church of the subgenius might never have existed without them

198
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,700
In fact every time I say dear friends, that's a tip of the hat to them

199
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,900
Yes, it's actually from Pastor David Epley a real preacher

200
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,500
The music in the background is the Empire Jazz Orchestra

201
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,920
our buddies

202
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,220
I'm tired today

203
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,880
because we discovered two stray puppies cowering under our cattle guard three nights ago and

204
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,180
Now we're a family of three old subgenius bipeds

205
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,500
40-year-old newt

206
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:04,880
Three cats and four dogs the puppies seem to be little German shepherds who were probably dumped by poe buckers

207
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,740
The boy's name is Yeti and the girl is Chupi for Chupacabra

208
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,820
They already consider our

209
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,140
Themselves to be our babies, but we spent a lot of time in the last few days either playing with them

210
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,280
cleaning up the puppy poop or comforting the

211
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,960
Terribly insulted cats. So we're tired

212
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,760
Where was I? Oh, yeah. Yeah, we run a religious role. Here's some more Easter stuff from

213
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,120
ESO swamp radio from around Easter 2001

214
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,640
Isn't it terrible? Yeah

215
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,620
You guys realize that today is not?

216
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,280
only Friday the 13th, but

217
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,180
Okay. Now the guys talking Japanese, right?

218
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,980
Were you saying something in Japanese like I don't know this guy

219
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,580
This this guy. Yeah

220
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:00,340
We're saying that today is both the first Friday the 13th of the new millennium and Good Friday

221
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,860
Any comments on that anyone? Oh, of course, you know, we can come in up to watch

222
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:11,020
2,000 years ago it happened. Come here break. What happened? What? Come on

223
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,740
Baby, it really really believe it happened. Don't you really get the idea?

224
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,540
Each being crucified every day of the last 2,000 years. I mean every

225
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:28,780
Friday the 13th every time every night that the humans sit and watch TV all night long

226
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:35,080
They're like itself crucifix. That's like putting a knife at Mary's heart. It's like Mary's heart

227
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,780
It was a virgin cry every time every night that you make a wish that hit bitters a survivor show

228
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,760
Jesus cries Jesus weeps

229
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:57,120
Get on up there on Good Friday and get those nails out and hammer and pound at home, baby

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,540
Self up on that cross and how you gonna get the other hand in after you done the first hand, hmm

232
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,820
But boy, do we have a great deal on crosses for you for this?

233
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,960
It's coming Good Friday coming up tomorrow actually today. It's actually today

234
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:21,640
Well, I really like a lot of this lumber is absolutely porous and will not stain any of your articles or deniments you I'm sorry

235
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,160
Go ahead

236
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,640
praise Chaz and Dave in WCSB

237
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,120
Dave's book neighbor world is still available

238
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,380
Neighborworld by Dave DeLuca and I'm finally getting my shipment a book of the subgenius reprints

239
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,180
But hey, let's get real like we got for director Sandy Boone

240
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,720
Who did the?

241
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:48,560
marvelous documentary about the church called JR Bob Dobbs in the Church of the subgenius which just became free on

242
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,140
Amazon Prime and it's also on YouTube in a couple of places

243
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,360
Here's a clip from it in which we yes get real

244
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:09,360
It began in the heart of the Bible Belt in Dallas, Texas, but it's membership is spreading across the nation

245
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,440
Their prophets name is Bob and their followers are legion

246
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,800
everybody in every mass media like Church of the subgenius because it was this crazy thing that they could just

247
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,360
inject into their own stream

248
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,020
In the absence of the internet it was kind of a meme for media people

249
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:37,080
4,000 of them so far and more every day have already joined up suddenly the joke has become serious at first it was a joke

250
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,300
But there was something much deeper

251
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,280
And more life-affirming and I even realized y'all are out to put down

252
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:53,500
Outrageous cult groups what does this mean no no this is an outrageous cult group the church was meant to never be mass marketable

253
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,880
We never really wanted to have a lot of followers basically

254
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:04,260
I was a very lonely weirdo in a small, Massachusetts town finally got a boyfriend who was a member of the church

255
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,880
And he showed me the pants I said this is it they imparted to me the values that

256
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,820
Have got me where I am today

257
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,800
We got this attention a lot of attention and I started to fear that this thing's gonna get

258
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,720
Too big what the hell do you think you're doing?

259
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,000
Dragging your butt through the day selling body and soul to a bunch of bland

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,200
Normals there is a simple answer dear friend. I feel like I'm part of something now

261
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,300
Yeah, I feel like I'm finally being represented by something

262
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,620
I'm the next president of the United States of Ireland

263
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,340
Mr. Bob Starr

264
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,740
You were voted by Time magazine as the fraud of the century

265
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:51,380
You get any flack from folks from mainstream religion not nearly enough there was a little wave of people going

266
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,260
Oh, they're corporate now. They're huge. They're sold out. They're pink now well

267
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,000
Not really. Oh, we got will at just the right time counting checks huge wad of cash

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,340
Here we go again like any other prophet Bob preaches about the end of the world only his predictions are true

269
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,440
I guess a little different the men from Planet X will arrive to

270
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:20,400
Rupture the true believers of Jesus up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

271
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,680
Why do you do this? We offer eternal salvation or triple your money back?

272
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,480
Probably your money

273
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:37,080
Because world gonna end that's what I'm asking you is did you have a prophecy of doom here the world will end for those who?

274
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,240
deserve it all right

275
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,640
Now we're getting somewhere. Yeah, all right. We are so basically here's your deal

276
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,440
For 30 bucks you don't die at the end of the world

277
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:56,360
Thank You sandy boone for making such an entertaining and accurate movie about Bob's outreach and its drawbacks

278
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,880
Well, I guess there's no escaping office politics

279
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:09,080
Even if you're the oldest established permanent floating cult game with no office and now puzzling evidence

280
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:17,460
But then more fire sign specifically the late Peter Bergman solo more ESO more everything more on and on

281
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Now did you say you were on LSD now do you want us to talk you down?

282
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,880
No, I feel like I'm one of us do you like your name?

283
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,640
Well, that's the point. That's right. We're going to do that

284
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:37,920
We want to create flashbacks and those people that have them, but if you get in a bad trip, we can talk you down

285
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,340
We have a say he's a we have a

286
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,480
Expertise his brother did you put on some elements brother? So tell me if are you tripping now?

287
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,360
LSD

288
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,320
Okay, well

289
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:56,560
You know the experience of being on this drug yes, can you tell me what that's it like being on LSD?

290
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,420
Yeah, don't know was that shot out of a cannon for six hours being shot out of the skin while listening to the show, right?

291
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,820
Well the show goes right you how long did you do this in fact?

292
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,360
It never had LSD. Yeah couple years. Yeah, the show was

293
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,300
This show is hours for 20 years. So at some point you heard the show

294
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,900
Well, that's what has happened well, he did about 23,000 hits

295
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,140
But sometimes you never come down

296
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,580
Awesome. You one time I went up to the top of Doc's

297
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:35,260
I got trapped up there. I climbed up to the very very tip-top. I took every kind of drug. No demand

298
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,620
I got so high I was like

299
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:45,860
Smoking banana peels I was scraping up the the inside of the every kind of weird seed

300
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,640
You know those like those Hawaiian wood rose seeds weird stuff

301
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:57,600
Finally I was so high at the top of Doc Stock Mountain that I couldn't come down

302
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:06,320
Hi, I was stuck up there well both I mean the mountain is symbolic for the Marco knows that feeling the man is just a metaphor

303
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,640
Have you ever done?

304
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,860
Porta potty at Grateful Dead concert you mean like snorted really a lot of potty at Burning Man concert

305
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,860
I've injected for the party, but I snorted a ranger

306
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,860
I've had to peel people's minds out of the port-a-potty

307
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:25,720
I snorted some port-a-potty one time some bad that blue stuff man don't do that. It'll really rips your nose

308
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,960
Boarded body white. It's like little fish hooks. It's like snorting fish hooks

309
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,000
You have to dilute it with something the one that's named for a party

310
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,340
And so you gotta make it up with something. Yeah, you got a

311
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,000
Cut it man. You gotta let it crystallize. I have always used

312
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,280
baby baby

313
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,780
powdered milk

314
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,980
always snorting

315
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,280
lactose

316
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,380
Lactic acid

317
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,720
Shut up or stand up. That's the main thing station. Are we listening to that would be

318
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,460
He'll come to eat baby

319
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,140
So I read every number I know no, but he's not

320
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,360
Yeah, baby

321
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,740
KFC and the fungus shrouded Valley

322
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,360
Don't touch the fungus you'll get so apart

323
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,660
You're getting too high you can't come down

324
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,580
Oh no

325
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,300
Too late

326
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,820
And then you know what as soon as you get so high you can't come down you have to move your tent

327
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,860
I was a new other player

328
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,560
Then you have to get all your stuff

329
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,440
And the tents all up and you're too high you can't do anything in fact you don't even pack your tent

330
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,180
You just you just pick it up off the ground

331
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,380
We gotta go go

332
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,180
Stick it in the truck

333
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,740
You just drag the tent

334
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,040
Some people just drag their tents behind them

335
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,860
Just pick up the tent and throw it in the truck

336
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,780
And one guy is driving your car and he's so high that he can't breathe

337
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,960
You know he's laying out of the side of the truck

338
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,960
Dragging along the ground while the tent is being dragged behind the truck

339
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,560
I never should have bought that tent anywhere you know

340
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,820
Somebody put Bob right under the word stop on all the stop signs

341
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,860
It's all over Arkansas

342
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:05,920
Well you can get anything everything's possible. I mean assuming that it doesn't violate the law of identity or existence

343
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,020
Blob stop

344
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,420
I want to go to that one

345
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,500
In Amsterdam it's on November but I'm not going to miss it

346
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,240
Why why why

347
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,520
This story is of little importance

348
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,500
But the automatic pencil with which it is being written is

349
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:32,420
Automatic variety marbled plastic with a plastic copper dividing ring and the initials MC embossed on the bronze cap

350
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,320
Marien Keren purchased it along with his wife and second passport

351
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,740
From a Jew in London who dealt in black market silver and the rearranging of identities

352
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,400
This was 1850 and today in another century the name of Seren outside of diplomatic circles is entirely unknown

353
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,240
That I should with such ease and equal certainty assume the pencil to be his is due first to luck

354
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,940
And second to my growing up under unusual circumstances even for the time

355
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,820
Berlin was busy pulling out the props from beneath her artists by murdering their patrons

356
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,280
And the news from the south was warm and reassuring as usual

357
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,240
When I still in the gymnasium and unaware of anything save my uncle the beer maker Stein

358
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,880
Made the acquaintance of Jakob Blumwald

359
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,320
Who later during the winter in which all the porcelain ovens in our house remained cold

360
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,900
Turned blue and froze to death

361
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,200
Shaving for the first time in front of a wood framed mirror

362
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,680
That his grandmother the wonder healer she had a hot mud cure for cancer that cost her her life in rural Poland that fall

363
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,300
So beautiful too

364
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,020
Gave him the summer before

365
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,940
Long before his death when we met

366
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,940
Jakob would scrawl artistic signs on the windows of the Espan

367
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,380
And tell me secrets that his family and his people had been hiding

368
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,980
One was the secret of identities

369
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,040
Which when I was young and first heard it

370
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,480
Came across to me as an incantation a rough hebraic map of the new world

371
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,580
Now this same secret ironically enough I should be penciling with Seren's own tool

372
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,280
I am enough of a Jew to believe in Jesus

373
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,700
And I am enough of a Jew to believe in names

374
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,320
Although I've stopped believing in them or they

375
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,060
Because it doesn't help and because the secret that was revealed to me

376
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,100
Makes me see everything differently

377
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,480
No what I mean is that everything is different

378
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,380
Only the difference is only in name

379
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:26,220
In 1739 Rabbi Mordecai Elwin Ossolski addressed a gathering of the remnants of Europe's Orthodox

380
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,500
And a small but attentive representation of the Levant

381
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,760
The Holy Land and a very few to the east of that

382
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,280
Ossolski announced that he was going to be a pastor in the church of the Holy Land of Poland

383
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,100
He announced the arrival of the end of the world

384
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,420
And surprised the gathering by asking them to stay

385
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,040
In what would have been under ordinary circumstances

386
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,900
A time of mourning gathering together

387
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,860
And the setting off of great deeds that cannot be done outside of death

388
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,140
Ossolski outlined a plan for the continuation of the race

389
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,880
He would have said survival but the rabbi refused to consider even the race of the chosen people beyond infinity

390
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,620
He said we'll die

391
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,280
But this is the end of the world

392
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,960
This time along with everybody else

393
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,440
And maybe if because of the great dietary laws

394
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,520
We should live even a little longer

395
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,100
It will be all over especially among friends

396
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,240
Saran Alba, John was surprised to begin with

397
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,940
Wasn't he the best pupil of the Mutabel Halhodim

398
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,020
Whose very life, whose very body had been transmogrified

399
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,640
For the increase of knowledge into a tool, a fine instrument

400
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,200
His veins were glass, his flesh transposed

401
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,280
Evaporated and carved to a thin layer of glass

402
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,340
Thin translusions, the color of cornelian and peach

403
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,520
Through the silvery esophagus the mercury was collected

404
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,100
Flowing from every artery and vein

405
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,520
Under the watchful eye of his disciples

406
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,020
The Mutah knew at the age of fifteen

407
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,760
That his body was a barometer of psychic pressure

408
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,860
That as the weight grew

409
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,640
So must the liquid in his realized body push toward the top

410
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,940
Reaching the level of his pituitary gland at that moment when

411
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,300
The end of the world had arrived

412
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,320
Alba, John had seen that moment come

413
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,960
Thirty-eight years after the Mutah had become his new self

414
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,860
Through purification of heat

415
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,000
Which only the complete intoxication of the scientific method

416
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,080
Allowed him to withstand

417
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,020
It was inevitable

418
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,700
The mercury had been rising at an increasing rate

419
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,900
Since the invention of the pistol in 1689

420
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,120
Little else was needed

421
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,720
The Mutah's pituitary exploded on July 11th, 1756

422
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,960
Killing a young Moroccan girl who had come to gain knowledge

423
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,960
By gazing into the Mutah's eyes

424
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,780
Even before the news of the patient one's death

425
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,860
Had reached outside his native land

426
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,120
The league that assembled before Ossolski knew of it

427
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,640
Had pondered it

428
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,420
Had digested it

429
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,040
The world was over

430
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,680
Only Ossolski's reputation as a man of original ideas

431
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,580
And tremendous personal charms

432
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,440
Had led them to Lebenstadt and the cold Carpathians

433
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,280
Blumwald's eyes lost their social distance

434
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,640
And the world was in a hopeless glaze for just a second

435
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,120
As he reached this part of his tale

436
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,180
And for a second as the Nicolase station reappeared

437
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,220
I thought I recognized something beyond mere racial pride

438
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,540
In his tone of voice

439
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,620
Perhaps Ossolski's charisma was penetrating

440
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,720
Like ancient heat into Yaakov's being

441
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,020
The moment was too brief to tell

442
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,840
But I felt a short blast of steaming Carpathian air

443
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,860
On the back of my neck

444
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,660
As the door opened on Nicolase

445
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,220
Ossolski said

446
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,240
The name of death is name

447
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,840
The name must change

448
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,820
Reversed, upside down

449
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,740
Then let the stranger devil cast his spells

450
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,480
And place oil over the mouths of the newborn

451
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,120
He will cast spells with names that are not what they are

452
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,340
Casting spells into a mirror and cursing himself

453
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,580
Rothman the elder shifted uncomfortably in his seat and died

454
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,240
The wealthiest man in Belgium

455
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,300
Was uninterested in plots and schemes

456
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,060
To perpetuate an existence he felt he had fully tasted

457
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,080
Rothman was already suffering the nausea

458
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
In those three days of journey to the meeting

459
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,820
And the color of the trees and the dull thud

460
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,640
Of unrealized wheels drowning clump

461
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,680
And being born again

462
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,920
In the Flemish clay

463
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,080
Brought him the sense of death

464
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,400
And now the sense of being dead

465
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,820
And now the being dead

466
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,560
Stein Pollard to his left

467
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,220
Noticed a strong fixed interest

468
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,160
That remained in the corpse's Rothman's eyes

469
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,980
His eyelashes were curled

470
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,160
Like the cornices of the Brussels trading buildings

471
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,960
Dead, dead he was still collecting gold

472
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,440
And so not dead

473
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,000
He hardly seemed less vital

474
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,840
The other members of the league found him a little harder

475
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,680
No less pleasant and perfectly capable of voting

476
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,940
The rest were sheep

477
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,200
Except La Raza from the city

478
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:01,560
From Madrid

479
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,740
Ossolski spoke to him

480
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,060
This is no little game of monies

481
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,620
This is greater than the short supplies of food and fuel

482
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,580
And the appropriate and just percentage of despair

483
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,500
That we, but not you, exist by

484
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,000
But this is greater than the numbers

485
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,460
And this is greater than the book

486
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,680
La Raza lived by changing the mundane numbers of the world

487
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,620
A position so subtle

488
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,640
So powerful

489
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,680
That of the few who knew him

490
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,120
Only one had challenged his preeminent position among the self-appointed

491
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,100
And now Ossolski

492
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,820
The other was a king of Russia

493
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,460
Who discovered La Raza through a medium

494
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,280
And fought him in his chariot of stone to a standstill

495
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,860
In and among the narrow white marble canals on the astral plane

496
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,920
He woke to live only three months

497
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,140
The numbers and weights of things changed without explanation

498
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,600
The collective spiritual mind of the Russian people adapted to him

499
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,680
Absorbed it

500
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,960
And thought with a laugh

501
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,180
That that was the way things were in a world of big winters and big summers

502
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,980
The collective economic mind of the Russian race was paralyzed

503
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,740
And confusion turned to panic and the nation collapsed into oblivion

504
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,160
But Ossolski was right

505
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,020
The name is greater than the number

506
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,300
And La Raza gladly gave his tenth vote to the minion

507
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,500
And it was done

508
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,160
What remains is what you see

509
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,320
But by what name?

510
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,220
We are approaching the Steinplatz station

511
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,040
Yakov and I

512
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,340
He frozen in the corner

513
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,920
And I thinking of the end of the world

514
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,980
Call it future and space

515
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,440
Not empty

516
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,580
Name it full

517
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,220
And how you can't turn an egg upside down

518
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,480
And of this pencil

519
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,040
Automatic variety

520
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,260
With no initials on it

521
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,920
And a million letters

522
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,800
Living out of people are dancing

523
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,440
The beautiful people are dancing

524
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,200
The ugly fat people are dancing

525
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,000
The tall skinny ugly ones are dancing

526
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,920
The little fat hairy ones are dancing

527
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,680
The ones dressed as nuns are dancing

528
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,580
The ones with a strap on are dancing

529
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,340
Well

530
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,120
The season's begun

531
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,960
I was out at Brushwood last weekend

532
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,320
Oh I bet it's beautiful out there

533
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,980
Is the ground

534
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,380
When does the ground get carpeted with apples?

535
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,720
I guess that's the end of the

536
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,460
That's the end of the

537
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,100
That's in fall

538
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,160
Man it's so weird

539
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,600
It's like everywhere you step you're crunching apples

540
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,280
And you're eating tiny little wild apples

541
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,660
And it all smells like

542
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,120
They scream really loud

543
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,640
Apples

544
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,240
And you take them home and skin them alive

545
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,080
Well some of those

546
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,120
Apple brown Betty

547
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,760
Some of those apples are little teeny tiny people

548
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,440
They conceal their heads that way

549
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,860
They act

550
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,260
They're actually little small brains

551
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,100
Encapsulated in those pectin laden apples

552
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,840
That are so delicious to it

553
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,940
Chaz takes those apples home

554
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,180
And makes Yankee wanky apple jacks

555
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,240
Sometimes don't you Chaz?

556
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,500
I've never done anything like that

557
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,120
Yes you have

558
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,980
You said you used to squish it between your toes

559
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,900
Like a mammoth kazoon used to do

560
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,260
And you'd jump around and sing songs

561
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,280
It's Friday the 13th

562
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,500
Well it always is

563
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,560
You know what I mean?

564
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,660
Oh no

565
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,280
What a terrible epithet to hurl at someone

566
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,040
It's Friday the 13th man

567
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,860
You're telling them you're gonna have bad luck

568
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,420
If you go down into your basement and Bob's sleeping down there

569
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,540
That means you're gonna have real bad luck

570
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,440
What if Bob was one of us?

571
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,300
What if Bob was concealed in a pecan pie

572
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,860
And as we opened that delightful juicy pecan pie

573
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,820
He became one of us

574
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,720
He had a moonlighting job doing that

575
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,660
Where he would hide inside of a giant pecan pie

576
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,440
Or different kinds of pies

577
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,220
And they'd cart him out at business women's luncheons

578
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,940
And Bob would jump out and strip

579
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,280
Well then if God was one of us

580
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,980
Then Bob would be something entirely different

581
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,660
Bob is a man

582
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,100
He is only a man

583
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,020
And God is...

584
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,000
You could say God is one of us

585
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,200
Because Bob is God

586
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,600
But we are not

587
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,440
But Bob is not one of us

588
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,160
They are not like us

589
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,080
If God was one of me

590
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,420
I'd kill all the white power

591
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,440
You need something to power that mighty anus

592
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,320
The guy actually breathes smoke out of his mouth

593
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,880
I thought he was gonna say some subgenius-like thing

594
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,500
No it was a colonoscopy

595
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,380
A colonoxomy from one of the curious

596
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,280
It was clay underneath the underworld

597
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,500
White power

598
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:57,780
I know

599
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,400
That's funny

600
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,640
Ship him down to Cincinnati

601
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,740
Let him get a job in the police department

602
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,880
I'm into white power and black power

603
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,980
And all shades in between

604
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,040
I like different colors

605
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
I think color is very powerful

606
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,520
I'm into subgenius power as opposed to human power

607
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,600
Subgeniuses can come in any

608
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,540
Are you into pink power though?

609
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,340
Oh yeah sure

610
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,060
I'm into pink

611
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,460
I believe in slavery Chaz

612
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,060
I'll come out and say that

613
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,040
I believe that slavery is cool

614
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,860
Well they are

615
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:30,860


616
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,600
Well they are of course

617
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,100
You've got it

618
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,980
You hit it on the head

619
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,120
They're already slaves

620
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,260
To the conspiracy

621
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,700
The problem is exactly

622
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,800
They're slaves to the wrong people

623
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,500
To the conspiracy instead of us

624
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,960
If they're gonna be slaves

625
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,440
You know I think they'd enjoy what we put them to work doing

626
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,580
I think you're going to love slavery

627
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,320
If you become a love slave of the church of the subgenius

628
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,360
Well they also have to dig ditches and shit

629
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,040
I think you're going to love your long life

630
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,080
They'll build pyramids in the daytime

631
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,680
I wish I was a love slave

632
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,980
and be love slaves at night

633
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,240
That's what I wanna do

634
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,260
And they'll have to take microscopic bricks

635
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,960
to make these mighty three thousand foot high pyramids

636
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,280
Hey what's up with that racial collar?

637
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,160
You need to say filthy

638
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,600
Sli

639
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,060
Parma calling in

640
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,740
I thought it was

641
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,980
It's just one of the guys who had the medulla oblongata beat out of him

642
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,000
and that happens sometimes

643
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,620
I'm fucking crazy

644
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:26,620


645
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,580
sometimes they'll strap you so hard.

646
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,820
Isn't that right, Chaz, when you're going to denizen school

647
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,300
with your little tiny baby?

648
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,580
Well, what's really funny is how...

649
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,080
They'll just strap the back of your neck

650
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,080


651
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,840
What's really funny is how people like that

652
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,740
are going to be left behind.

653
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,560
You know, and they won't be around.

654
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,400
They'll be extinct.

655
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,420
Well, some of us already consider them leaving.

656
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,400
They sure won't like it on the escape vessels

657
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,980
of the sex goddesses.

658
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,560
No, no.

659
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,000
There's many different hues of women.

660
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,400
Because what they most fear...

661
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,440
They're going to be kind of freaked out.

662
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,860
What they most fear will come true

663
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,680
as well as what they most desire, you see.

664
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,300
Reverend Ding Dong is going to bend them over a log.

665
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,300
I think it's something like that, right?

666
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,100
Right.

667
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,620
They desire the reach-around,

668
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,760
but they're afraid of what goes with the reach-around.

669
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,740
That guy with the...

670
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,420
They're going to have to take both.

671
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,740
Oh, come on.

672
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,820
We know that's like a homoerotic cover.

673
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,240
Those guys that call in and say that stuff,

674
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,180
you know what they really want.

675
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,040
Just picture them, you know, like...

676
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,460
Well, you notice their girlfriends don't call in.

677
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,100
Right.

678
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,680
Did you ever notice...

679
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,920
You know, it's one of those skinhead rallies.

680
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,500
There's always like 90 fat guys with like breasts like women

681
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,960
and stuff like that and shaved heads

682
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,580
banging into each other,

683
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,680
screaming words that come from Africa.

684
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,380
It's sad when bald, fat, white men

685
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,840
with little teeny, tiny penises...

686
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,620
And large breasts.

687
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,000
...call up.

688
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,340
Don't forget.

689
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,220
And large breasts and tiny, little, teeny penises call up.

690
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,200
Hey, now, some big, fat guys with tiny, little peckers are cool.

691
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,200
Sure, sure.

692
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,920
Hey, man, I mean, you know, we're not prejudiced here

693
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,340
or anywhere else.

694
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,700
No, man.

695
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,600
Our eyes are white.

696
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:54,860
Our eyes are wide open.

697
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,960
And that's why the tears are running...

698
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,340
You have to whiff each individual before you hate them.

699
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,620
You whiff them and then hate them.

700
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,140
Hey, can I air my actual wound?

701
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,760
Or forgive them or rip them off as...

702
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,880
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, put me on hold

703
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,280
so I can listen to the show, could you?

704
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,720
Okay.

705
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,260
Okay.

706
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,940
Would you like to have your accent wound cleaned,

707
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:17,140
licked clean, licked clean like a little dog would do it?

708
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:17,700
Do it?

709
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,720
Because our server's down.

710
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,580
Oh, right.

711
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,380
I wanted to listen to the show by putting them on hold

712
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,580
because our server's down.

713
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,740
You can't hear it on the internet.

714
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,100
So he's actually from a parahoot type...

715
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,760
From that windstorm we had today.

716
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:31,880
Where's...

717
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,560
He's from Flagelandspilk, New York.

718
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,080
Hey, I want to talk about my car accident.

719
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,220
Okay.

720
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,040
I think he already did.

721
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,960
He explained what happened and how he arrived where he is today.

722
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,500
He's already explained how he got rear-ended.

723
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,000
He's a muttered chimpanzee with a wrap around with a clan-dressed...

724
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,280
Yeah, I just...

725
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,580
I don't know.

726
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:50,780
I'm trying.

727
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,280
I got the image of a guy with one of those clan uniforms.

728
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,520
I'm giving him the old...

729
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,640
Isn't there more and more dung...

730
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,600
There's just more...

731
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,300
Ape shall not kill ape.

732
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,780
There's more and more dung flinging going on.

733
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,700
The apes are...

734
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,880
Fresh dung.

735
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,160
Dung.

736
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,560
Woo!

737
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:05,900
That...

738
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,680
You should ask what sort of psychic laxatives are in the air, Chad.

739
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,160
And locking around their arms up and taking the stick

740
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,760
and banging the stick into the ground.

741
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,100
Yeah.

742
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,940
That's the question you must ask, boys.

743
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,760
Some kind of cosmic wave is passing.

744
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,120
What happens...

745
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,740
It's a laxative for these violent apes of some kind.

746
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,040
It's some sort of migratory laxative that...

747
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,580
Like a...

748
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,700
Like a bird invades their consciousness and makes it...

749
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,880
I mean, that's like little kid poo-poo stuff, you know,

750
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,000
when you want to start banging things around, you know, and...

751
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,200
Getting mean.

752
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,400
As my grandpa Dimples on Stinkworth used to say...

753
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:37,760
Can I get in on the sewing circle?

754
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,400
What?

755
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:38,740
Sure.

756
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,100
Can I get in on the sewing circle?

757
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,540
Sure, if you're ornery enough and we can pull your eyeballs out.

758
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,220
Why would you want to do that?

759
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,980
Because you have no eyes.

760
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,660
You see with your mind.

761
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,300
You can't look at your own eye.

762
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,500
What you gonna do?

763
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,460
Pull your left eye out, turn around and...

764
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,560
That's what we're gonna do.

765
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,560
What we're gonna do to the pink boys on X-Day.

766
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,700
We're gonna say, look at yourself, man, and we'll pull out the left eye.

767
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,500
Just gently enough.

768
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,980
Without severing the optic nerve so that it can sort of see the other eye.

769
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,780
Take a good look, boy.

770
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,040
Take out the nose drill and place it very, very, very far.

771
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,560
Marijuana by Stephen Knight, grade six.

772
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,520
Marijuana or marijuana the Mexican name...

773
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:24,760
Shh.

774
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:30,300
...for a narcotic drug obtained from the leaves of the plant cannabis and generally used in cigarettes.

775
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,200
Introduced from Mexico about 1910, probably at New Orleans or in the southwestern states,

776
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,840
its use has spread at an alarming rate in the United Snakes.

777
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:50,260
Known by a variety of local terms, reefers, foo, moo-ca, mez, muggles, Mary Warner, the weed,

778
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,200
it is considered by many authorities to be the most potent drug,

779
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,580
and it is considered to be the most potent drug in common use.

780
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,060
In what?

781
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,020
Common use.

782
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,620
What?

783
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,540
Although the effect of marijuana is often unpredictable and may range from

784
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:11,720
extremulation to profound melancholy, the result is almost invariably accompanied by a loss of restraint and self-control.

785
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,160
With subsequent erratic behavior, hallucinations of sight and hearing are not uncommon.

786
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,280
Here come the guys on the horses.

787
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,580
And delusions of strength may lead to feats of endurance without sense of fatigue.

788
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,400
Hey, boy!

789
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,040
Although the long-run effects of the continued use of the drug are disputed by medical authorities,

790
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:37,600
it is thought by some that chronic addiction leads to a loss of mental ability, stupor, and indolence.

791
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:49,520
And that in case of such irreparable damage is done to the brain tissue and insanity may be the result.

792
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,140
Did you see that guy?

793
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,640
That guy that just came to Dr.

794
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,580
Um...

795
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,380
Yeah.

796
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:53,880
Dr.

797
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,700
Dr. Uh...

798
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,020
Uh...

799
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,080
I remember him.

800
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,640
Dr. Memory.

801
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,300
Dr. Memory!

802
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,020
You got it?

803
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,660
Dr. Memory.

804
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:58,940
Dr. Memory.

805
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,320
That's it.

806
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,080
That's the guy.

807
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,860
Dr. Memory.

808
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,320
Good, good.

809
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,360
I think we're ready, darling.

810
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:04,520
Yeah.

811
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,340
Ta-ta-da.

812
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,380
Ta-ta-da.

813
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,340
Ta-ta-da.

814
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,940
And then...

815
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,140
A miracle!

816
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,540
Oh, please, no miracles.

817
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,040
We're a nice guy, Barton.

818
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,620
Drink up.

819
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,440
Thanks...

820
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,840
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's Showtime!

821
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,000
Prend pisto.

822
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:52,140
Watch on, watch on, and drink up!

823
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,280
Dr. sew Resūla, voqa avoc symptom there.

824
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,280


825
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,280


826
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,280


827
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,280


828
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,440
crunch jistrung?

829
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:53,700
Come on.

830
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,720
That's my audio system.

831
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,300
After you get there, most people seek to control life events

832
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,220
in order to secure a more positive, productive, and free existence.

833
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,140
Often, however, the objectives of others conflict with our objectives.

834
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,000
Now, most people, common people, really,

835
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,320
can barely manage to control their own self-centered, myopic existence.

836
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,780
They command armies of lawyers armed with paper weapons,

837
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,180
attacking with spiteful, vengeful, cowardly litigation.

838
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,960
Others operate within elephantine bureaucracies.

839
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,180
We'll all get fired.

840
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,300
Cut to a promo. Start tape.

841
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,640
We ain't no home for the brave

842
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,000
Heartbreak, evidence

843
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,400
I see heartbreak, evidence

844
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,260
Heartbreak, evidence

845
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,280
Heartbreak, evidence

846
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,500
Heart in your heart

847
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,880
Heart in your heart

848
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,640
Heart in your heart

849
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


850
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,840
Heart!

851
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,060
Heart!

852
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,680
How dare you editorialize so blatantly?

853
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,720
You have just violated the most sacred canon of journalism.

854
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,100
Millions of Americans were listening to you.

855
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,060
Now what is the idea of screaming at me in the middle of the night?

856
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,940
I was ignoring you.

857
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,200
What's the big emergency?

858
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,880
It started this morning.

859
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,340
Every station's making like it's the 1950s.

860
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,320
We got static, we got snow, all kinds of distortions.

861
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:39,720
Unexplained disturbance and the hysteria that it's causing are incredible.

862
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,500
How would you describe what you are seeing?

863
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,860
It is clearing the mountains, moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor.

864
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,000
The meteor, widespread panic, has gripped the countryside as...

865
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,220
Thousands have taken to the streets.

866
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,380
It is confirmed.

867
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,100
There it is, the strange atmospheric phenomenon.

868
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,480
It is apparently what we've been causing all the distortions in our broadcast.

869
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,800
So far the phenomenon has not caused any damage.

870
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,980
We have to ask you to try to stay calm and it's important for everyone not to panic.

871
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,680
We have a fix on three of the occurrences about to appear over American City.

872
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,440
All right, fine.

873
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,540
Um, she wants to buy me my own radio station.

874
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,080
And so, as of 10 a.m. tomorrow morning, this will no longer be...

875
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,080


876
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,320
A classical music station.

877
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,680
We're gonna try a talk radio format for a while, see how that works.

878
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:30,320
Oh, also we're changing the call letters of the station to KRZY.

879
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,920
I can't believe you're the same person I listen to on the radio every day.

880
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,600
I thought you'd be...

881
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,820
I don't know, older.

882
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,680
Not so attractive.

883
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,660
It's weird.

884
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,660
I mean, I listen to your show every night.

885
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,280
And your voice, I know that this is gonna sound strange.

886
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,080
But it's becoming so clear.

887
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,880
So familiar to me.

888
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,400
So comfortable.

889
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,000
I feel like you're a friend, home with me every night.

890
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,500
Keeping me company.

891
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,380
Why don't you come back with me to my place tonight and have some wine?

892
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,020
You can tell me how you come up with all those crazy things you do on the air.

893
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,320
Maybe you can even tuck me into bed.

894
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,340
What are you talking about?

895
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,240
I'm talking about the show.

896
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,980
We gotta become more outrageous.

897
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,620
We gotta tap ourselves, otherwise we'll lose our numbers.

898
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,000
More outrageous? You think that's possible?

899
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,540
200,000 people down there listen to me and you on the radio every night.

900
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,720
We are right on the verge of getting what we wanted.

901
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,480
I'm starting to get offers to syndicate nationwide.

902
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:39,600
If our numbers keep growing, I'll be taking our show into 50 cities across the country.

903
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,540
We are entering a new age.

904
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,420
Old taboos are falling away.

905
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,020
People...

906
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,760
People are now as afraid to tap into the dark side of themselves.

907
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,720
In fact, they are fascinated by depravity.

908
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,980
I want to do a new segment and call it My Best Crime.

909
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,400
People call us up anonymously and they talk about a crime they committed.

910
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,060
And we're not talking shot lifting here.

911
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,800
Isn't that a little hardcore?

912
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,320
The absolute cutting edge.

913
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,020
Sure, we'll get a lot of crank calls.

914
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,920
But we'll also get a lot of real calls.

915
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,100
There's a whole city of perversion down there.

916
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,560
And we can plug into it.

917
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,020
Use our 55,000 watts of power to spread it to every single corner.

918
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,020
I don't know, man. It sounds way over the edge.

919
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,060
I mean, you gotta admit, it sounds crazy.

920
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,500
It'll be fascinating.

921
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,840
We'll have people glued to the radios.

922
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,280
We'll have them asking, who's gonna call tonight?

923
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,920
What sick confession will I hear this evening?

924
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,020
I bet we get a 25 share our first month.

925
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:47,700
And from there, you and I are a signature on a contract away from going from team coast to coast.

926
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,740
Makes a great gift. Not available anywhere.

927
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,640
Oh yeah, and I suppose Jones Town was just a plumber party.

928
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,240
We used to stay true to love.

929
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,000
Please don't stop me.

930
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,060
Please don't stop me.

931
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,040
Please don't stop me.

932
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,620
All our best warriors are gone, man.

933
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:20,740
John Wayne, Sir Lancelot, Joan of Arc, Nelson, Wellington, hell, baby, even Doris Day.

934
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,300
They've all died in battle, man.

935
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,180
Anything like that would put me right over the edge.

936
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,440
I wouldn't joke about anything else that happened here tonight.

937
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,840
Now don't tell me you're taking all this seriously.

938
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,520
Aren't you?

939
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,660
I really love your show. It's all that keeps me going.

940
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,440
I think I better get off now.

941
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,660
Sir, please stay on the line.

942
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,260
I'll go back and get you.

943
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:41,640
Don't hang up.

944
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:42,740
Hello?

945
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,560
Who is it?

946
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:10,700
I'm still busy.

947
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,300
Okay, I'll get it done, but as soon as you're done, go ahead and call on the next отнош 주 Vargas,

948
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,300


949
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,300


950
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,220
Damn it, brain beats makes cases, man.

951
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,760
Well, what do you think of the Jon hanno show?

952
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:14,760


953
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:14,760


954
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,080
Yeah, and also, you can help me take just a little nerve to start a new gluttony.

955
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,780
where rumors spread like wildfire

956
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,380
and truth can be bought for pennies

957
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,000
at the corner marketplace in any town USA.

958
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,300
And here they are now, those two lovable old con artists

959
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,300
who will steal your heart away if they can make a profit from it.

960
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,120
Mutt and Smut.

961
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,320
Smut? Smut?

962
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,420
Yes, yes, yes. What is it, Mutt?

963
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,620
Did we get that order of 500 wolf stools in

964
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,760
from the Chinese trader on Cock Bridge?

965
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,440
What was that?

966
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,120
It should be in the back there

967
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,640
under the crate of electric neck warmers from Italy.

968
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,860
Well, listen, it ain't here.

969
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,320
It ain't? Blast it!

970
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,320
Listen, it's on top of the crate of artificial

971
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,420
old English brand abdominal shields.

972
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,660
Oh, well, thank goodness.

973
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,220
You really gave me a bad moment there, Smut.

974
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:02,960
Why is that?

975
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,080
Well, we're supposed to send them back.

976
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,040
The government claims they're faulty.

977
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,360
That's crazy, Mutt.

978
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,580
The government didn't say no such thing as know-how,

979
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,340
you dumb old coot.

980
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,820
Oh, yeah? Then you just read me.

981
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,920
This here piece of official blue notepaper

982
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,440
the government man dropped off here this morning

983
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,060
while you were still on the subway

984
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,100
coming to the studio.

985
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,660
Your lines are longer than mine these days, you know, Smut.

986
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,560
Well, let me see that ding-dang thing there.

987
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,700
Oh, yes, okay.

988
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,740
Indonesian leg sleeves.

989
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,540
Order number B1239 slash 9.

990
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,220
One gross Japanese wolf stool.

991
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,500
There it is. Order number K67-855

992
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,400
slash slash slash .2.

993
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,560
Has to be returned brown paper wrapper

994
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,580
subversive.

995
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,060
Subversive?

996
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,440
Slow brain.

997
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,720
Cootness is subversive, not faulty.

998
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,860
Same thing, Smut.

999
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,540
Same thing.

1000
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,960
We can't sell them or you know what'll happen.

1001
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,160
Yeah, yeah, well, okay.

1002
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,500
I guess you're right this time.

1003
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,300
Listen, I'll go into the back room

1004
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,520
and change the name on the crate

1005
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,820
and send them down to that Indian school

1006
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,040
along with the melted crayon.

1007
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:01,920
I'll get it.

1008
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:02,740
Hello?

1009
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:03,680
Oh.

1010
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:04,920
Howdy, Doody.

1011
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,980
It's Doody Fenster probably asking about her daughter again.

1012
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,940
Sure, Doody, sure.

1013
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,860
I always got time to talk to you.

1014
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:12,920
Smut?

1015
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,600
Yeah.

1016
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,240
I just don't know what to do about that pretty young thing of mine.

1017
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,200
Why, Smut, I swear.

1018
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,360
She acting so dang uppity.

1019
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,480
Won't do her homework.

1020
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,200
Yeah, yeah.

1021
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,260
She won't watch the TV.

1022
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:23,700
Yeah.

1023
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,960
Won't drive the car on the freeways no more.

1024
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:26,220
No.

1025
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,220
Won't argue with Daddy Fenster about the war.

1026
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:28,640
Oh, my.

1027
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,060
Refuses to take her diet pills

1028
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,320
or sleep out back in the tent we made for her.

1029
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:32,660
Oh, my.

1030
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,500
The house is crowded with her boyfriends.

1031
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,960
Never been so scandalized.

1032
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,020
If I dare call him that, I'm telling you, Smut,

1033
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,620
I have every reason to be.

1034
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:40,920
Yeah, all right.

1035
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,280
Excuse me, Mr. Doody.

1036
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:42,860
I'm Mutt.

1037
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,860
Smut's in the back room.

1038
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,040
Oh, well, don't make no difference.

1039
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:45,460
Yeah, okay.

1040
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,420
Just hold on a second.

1041
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:46,980
I'll get him.

1042
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,340
Smut!

1043
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,520
But I said it's okay.

1044
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,360
Smut!

1045
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,080
What the heck?

1046
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,020
The Reno isn't now.

1047
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:51,880
Don't blast it there.

1048
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,000
Well, Miss Fenster wants to talk to you, Smut.

1049
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,880
Well, bust me.

1050
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,660
I ain't got nothing to say to her.

1051
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,240
Well, just listen then for cop's sake.

1052
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:58,480
Here.

1053
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,300
I'll go in the back and sort out

1054
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,780
the hooded velvet angels and portrait balls would come in.

1055
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,060
Ought to be a run on them

1056
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,560
as soon as that article we planted in the Mixville Rocket comes out.

1057
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:06,920
Hello.

1058
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,800
Hello, Doody.

1059
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:08,400
What?

1060
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:08,720
What?

1061
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:09,540
What?

1062
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,460
Thank goodness you're back.

1063
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,200
Oh, God damn it, Miss Fenster.

1064
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,620
You're as soft as a rotten squash.

1065
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,460
Now, you know that.

1066
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,160
Anyway, Mutt, as I was saying,

1067
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,300
Daddy and I have an overreason to believe

1068
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,280
that pretty young P-Sides is mentally demanged.

1069
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:23,980
Demanged?

1070
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:24,980
What'd you say?

1071
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,380
I said, did you say demanged?

1072
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,120
I'm sorry.

1073
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,920
I meant to say deranged.

1074
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,020
Oh, my God.

1075
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:31,640
What'd you say?

1076
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,460
Listen to me here, Miss Fenster.

1077
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,020
Call me Miss Doody, Mutt.

1078
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:35,860
Daddy old...

1079
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,980
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1080
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,140
That's a good idea, Miss Doody.

1081
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,260
I'll call you.

1082
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,020
I'll call you, okay?

1083
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:40,800
Okay, bye now.

1084
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,020
Bye.

1085
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,680
Oh, my glory.

1086
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:43,540
Mutt?

1087
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:43,940
What?

1088
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,560
I think you better stop seeing Doody's daughter.

1089
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,780
I can't stand to talk to that woman no more.

1090
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,860
I just can't do it.

1091
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:51,980
Howdy, Mutt.

1092
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,760
I come to get that mail order for Miss Goldbrick

1093
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,180
up at the old Mellon Park Mansion.

1094
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,480
I got a copy of the list right here.

1095
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,640
Well, let me see that now.

1096
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,120
I can't make this out at all.

1097
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,860
It's all smudged.

1098
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,460
Oh, yeah?

1099
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,280
Well, uh, that on...

1100
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,800
That on...

1101
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:10,560
Excuse me.

1102
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,180
I tried to learn...

1103
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:11,900
Speak English, Mutt.

1104
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,420
Oh, yeah.

1105
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,160
Oh, yeah.

1106
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,200
Well, uh, that on account of the burnt cork

1107
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,040
all over my hand here.

1108
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:18,860
I...

1109
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:19,240
Here.

1110
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,720
I read it for you.

1111
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:21,040
Okay.

1112
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,520
Now, just a minute there, Tarface.

1113
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,000
I'll get Mutt out here to help.

1114
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:24,820
Hey, Mutt?

1115
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,160
Mutt?

1116
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:25,340
Mutt?

1117
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:25,440


1118
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,040
Tarface Pork out here at the other toilet roll

1119
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,000
for Miss Goldbrick's estate.

1120
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,160
Okay, okay.

1121
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,660
I'll get the ladder.

1122
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,180
What is it?

1123
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,060
Okay, just a second.

1124
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:34,600
Yeah?

1125
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,640
I'm gonna get my wife porcelain

1126
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,560
to help me cast on this stuff.

1127
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,080
Okay.

1128
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:39,500
Okay.

1129
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:40,360
Now, for her,

1130
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,240
by turning off the microphone.

1131
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,540
Honey?

1132
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,080
What is it you want, ball of fire?

1133
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,520
I...

1134
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,040
Come on in.

1135
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,040
Now, Miss Porcelain.

1136
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,300
Oh, come on.

1137
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,340
Well, I'll read you...

1138
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,880
I'll read you some of this stuff, uh, Mr. Mutt.

1139
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,300
Yeah, what do you want?

1140
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,380
You got any clown flashlights?

1141
00:50:59,440 --> 00:50:59,820
Well, I'll look.

1142
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,260
Any artificial breath owls?

1143
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:02,740
Hold on.

1144
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,840
You got any adjustable toe regulators?

1145
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,580
Austrian scrubbers?

1146
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,440
Edwardian change poises?

1147
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,080
Just a second.

1148
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,000
Nipple softens?

1149
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:10,420
Yeah.

1151
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,200
Yeah, or do you have any of them imported snowboard boxes?

1152
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:15,500
Oh, wait a minute.

1153
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,320

Joint holders?

00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,140
Yeah, that stuff.

1162
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,220
Oh, well, she want three of them portable

1164
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:29,620
Wait a minute.

1165
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,220
Some adjustable jester rings.

1166
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,140
Yeah, that's the kind with a little diamond on it.

00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,560
how about an elbow and heel healer?

1174
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,500
Maybe some of them Swedish pornographic angel times.

1175
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,020
And a gross of Rosenthal fancy brand Christmas plates.

1176

Oh.

00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,600
And a pack of cigarettes.

1184
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:10,900
Oh.

1185
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:11,500
What kind?

1186
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,860
Boy, seems like Ms. Goldbrick's planning another party, eh,

1187
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,440
Smut?

1188
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,860
Yeah, she's going to have a lawn picnic and lynching soon.

1189
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,700
That a luncheon, honeyface, not lynching.

1190
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,720
Oh, that's what you think, dummy.

1191
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,280
Ah!

1192
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,400
Say, say, then, perhaps your mistress

1193
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,120
could use 500 fancy government-improved wolf stools.

1194
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,120
Hey, what my mistress got to do with this?

1195
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,640
Oh, you big-nosed face.

1196
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,360
He talking about Ms. Goldbrick.

1197
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,000
I knows.

1198
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,720
I knows.

1199
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,140
Well, Lester, that's a real swell idea.

1200
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,580
I sound a little like Smiley Burnett, don't I?

1201
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,600
And I think she wouldn't notice.

1202
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,200
That is, if and, well, uh.

1203
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,200
Yeah, what is it, tarface?

1204
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:56,100
Well, that is, if you could also include in the order there.

1205
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:56,820
Well, what?

1206
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:57,800
What for court's pity?

1207
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,240
What?

1208
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,220
Well, you gentlemen come over here.

1209
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,500
Now, look, in the window there, you got all right,

1210
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,760

fancy brand pistol and matching glove set for the Playroom.

1212
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,460
And if you could add a few thousand round of ammunition,

1213
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:12,920
well.

1214
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,660
Well, you know, tarface, I got to hand it to you.

1215
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,500
Here you go.

1216
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,580
Thank you, gentlemen.

1217
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,440
Yeah, yeah.

1218
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,440
You know how to make a deal, don't you?

1219
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,420
Yes!

1220
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:27,980
Yuck, yuck.

1221
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,300
He watch a lot of old television.

1222
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:30,940
Yeah!

Yes!

1224
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:31,980


1225
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,340
Yes!

1226
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:32,580
Yes!

1227
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,780
So long, now.

1228
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,600
Just carry your stuff on out, and we'll see you next week

1229
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,180
at the picnic.

1230
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,700
Oh, and by the way, you're going by the Mindless

1231
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,900
Fellowship Parkway, ain't you?

1232
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,740
Anything you say, boys!

1233
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,240
Well, could you do me a little favor and drop Miss Fenster's

1234
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,420
lovely little daughter off at the Tallahassee Bridge?

1235
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,420
Why, sure!

1236
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,020
Thanks kindly, neighbor.

1237
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:50,880
Missy!

1238
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,820
Right on!

1239
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,540
Goodbye!

1240
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,660
Goodbye.

1241
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,720
Goodbye, dear friends.

1242
00:53:54,840 --> 00:54:00,640
On Blueberry Hill, when I found you.

1243
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,920
Friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack episode

1244
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,700
1,816, which was a great day.

1245
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,540
It was composed mostly of carefully plucked and washed

1246
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,280
clips from older subgenius shows, ESO from WCSB Cleveland,

1247
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,780
and puzzling evidence from KPFA Berkeley,

1248
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,860
plus the Firesign Theater from the newly released old album

1249
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,660
Dope Humor of the 70s.

1250
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,040
I'll be preaching next week on Valentine's Day weekend

1251
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,500
at the virtual Winter Star Ball on Zoom.

1252
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:39,540
See starwoodfestival.com for details and the online Ask

1253
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,740
Dr. How is the second Sunday of each month.

1254
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,540
And there's a weekly subgenius Zoom chat called the Diaspora.

1255
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:54,120
Subgenius.com has all the details, often right on the front

1256
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,440
page.

1257
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,720
For logs of this show, archived older episodes, videos,

1258
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,940
subgenius books like the new sci-fi novel Eyelash,

1259
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,080
face masks, shirts, pins, soaps, other shows, dangles, bangles,

1260
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,700
bling, and sling blades, see subgenius.com.

1261
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,520
And don't forget to subscribe to the channel.

1262
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:09,520


1263
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,640
And praise Bob.

1264
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:20,120
Oh, this week's hour of slack features a great version of Greasy Grimy

1265
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,600
Gopher Guts, that beloved old song.

1266
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,640
So everyone tune in, 9 o'clock, Sunday.

1267
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:37,780
Greasy grimy gopher guts on third avenue, on 14th street.

1268
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,500
I'm all about the gopher guts.

1269
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:39,500


1270
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:39,500


1271
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:39,500


1272
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,220
It's time to say goodbye.

1273
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:03,920
I don't feel like little children ought to be exposed to that kind of thing.

1274
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,740
First you take the train to respond.

1275
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,380
Now, my love, you're in trouble.

1276
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:09,480


1277
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:09,480


1278
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:09,480


1279
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,600
All the water today is like a lake.

1280
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,740
Canarsie Beach is filled with all the happy people.

1281
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:23,380
On a sunny day where there's no haze, you can look all the way down the beach to Coney Island.

1282
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,600
And you can still hear the fat lady singing.

1283
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,600
Singing so, so far away.

1284
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1285
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,900
Did you boys get your new ESO's Hour of Slack list?

1286
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,180
Best of CD or latest CD release?

1287
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,220
You missed the release party.

1288
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,400
Yeah, I did.

1289
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,860
Then I hadn't.

1290
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,540
About all I did was put a little ad on the website.

1291
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,340
But it's the greatest subgenius CD ever.

1292
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,140
ESO's subgenius best of number one.

1293
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,740
May 12th, Saturday night at the Euclid Tavern.

1294
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,860
Reverend Ivan Stan, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Einstein Secret Orchestra.

1295
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:03,520
Who else?

1296
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:08,720
Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket will take us all to hell and back, friends.

1297
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,460
If you can make it down there, well, you really shouldn't though.

1298
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,400
It's not for humans or people.

1299
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,340
It's just for subgenius.

1300
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,180
Can you live through this experience?

1301
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,920
Do you dare to try to live through this experience?

1302
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:28,400
Enjoy a virtual night out with the Church of the Subgenius.

1303
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,120
If you can survive, if you can stay alive.

1304
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:38,320
But now, it's time to get high.

1305
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,240
Come on, let's get high.

1306
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,100
Hey look, there's pretzels in the pedenda.

1307
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,000
Good night, ladies.

1308
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,320
Gorgomol.

1309
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,040
Good night.

1310
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,560
Buenas noches.

1311
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,660
I'm missing my other half.

1312
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,520
Come on now, everybody get up.

1313
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:04,320
I'm missing my other half.

1314
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,380
I can't get up right now.

1315
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,300
I don't need this.

1316
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,400
The bolts from the...

1317
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,500
The back of my neck.

1318
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,480
It's a lonely Saturday night.

1319
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,900
There goes the machinery for the bottom of my golf cart.

1320
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,920
It calls me on the telephone.

1321
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,380
Everything else is gone too.

1322
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,380
I put another record on my stereo.

1323
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:31,520
But I'm still singing a song of you.

1324
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:35,520
It's a lonely Saturday night.

1325
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,120
Now if I...

1326
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,740
If I was an actor or a dancer who is glamorous,

1327
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,000
I would know how to fly.

1328
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,220
I would soon be my own man.

1329
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,700
I would soon be my own man.

1330
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,480
But now the tinsel light has started.

1331
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,900
I'll change your face when you're up and standing by.

1332
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,680
My heart breaks.

1333
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,640
My heart breaks.

1334
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,080
At eleven o'clock I watch the network news.

1335
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,620
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1336
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:08,200
Something tells me that you're really gone.

1337
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,100
Something tells me that you're really gone.

1338
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:12,200
You said we could be friends, but that's not what I wanted.

1339
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,120
Oh yeah, I thought we had a long time, man.

1340
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,240
We'd all have had it anyway.

1341
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,180
My TV din is almost gone.

1342
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,780
It's a lonely Saturday night.

1343
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,340
I need to tell you it's a lonely Saturday night.

1344
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:33,780
One more once it's a lonely Saturday night.

1345
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,780
I can hear the birds in the back of my house.

1346
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,600
See you next week, kids.

1347
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,920
May 12th, Saturday night.

1348
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:38,360
Leave me a comment.
