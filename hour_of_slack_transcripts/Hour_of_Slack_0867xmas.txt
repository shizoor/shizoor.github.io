I need you here.
I need you here.
Ah, yes, dear friends!
It is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know
that we're not gonna dis-do the same old three
Christmas hour of Slack show reruns in a row.
No, I'm going to compress it
and send you some links.
all into just this one intensive total rerun show.
Except that actually it's not.
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of selling.
Selling.
Yes, oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.
But anyway, happy whatever you do.
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.
It's cool, man, cool.
And, uh,
Praise Bob and who...
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong
And stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree
Who put the slump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong
Who stuck the wood where I poop-sheep-poop-sheep-poop
Who put the stick up my hip-day-dip-day-dip
Who was that man?
He shoved it up my can
And left me alone with a little bit of a grudge
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree
Yeah
Will you stop it?
Woo!
When this angel heard
Chop-a-pa-pop-a-chop-a-pop-a-pop
A dreadful fear went right into my heart
Those pine-tree needles sting me
Ram-a-jam-a-ram-a-jam-a-rim-a-ding-dong
You'll never know how much they sting me


That's smart
So who put the slump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong
Who stuck the wood where I poop-sheep-poop-sheep-poop
Who put the stick up my hip-day-dip-day-dip
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush
He made this angel beg for mercy, please
No!
I might squeeze him too tight
It's that psychedelic time!
Well, it's the time of the year
Do you know where your brain cells are?
It's already 9pm
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him
Don't go walking down to the bar
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard
I mean, the apartment store
Stand to the right
Paul, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw
Yeah, and I ain't gonna let you use your brain cells
Till I get the damn chainsaw fixed
And back in my arm the way I want to!
Well, it was Tuesday
Now you boys be good and I'll give you some of this here
Apple mango pie
Ain't no good of a child
That dog's running off with them brain cells
Can you do something about that, boy?
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right

Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.
That's enough of that.
Oh, he's got headphones now.
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.
It's been increased in size.
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.
Look, it's swelling.
I actually have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.
I'll put more pills out for everybody.
Oh, those pills.
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied crystals.
I'm shocked by you.
The red pills are really good.
I like to take the red pills.

The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.
Once upon a time.
There was the baby Jesus.
And he had two eyes made out of coal.
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.
And he wanted his two front teeth.
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.
And he took all the presents.
From Hoover.
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.
But he couldn't.
He wanted 10s and 20s.
10s and 20s.
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.
And he got Zuzu's pedals.

Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.
He wanted an electric train.
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up.
He had a picture of the whole thing, and he would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes.
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy looking train set with locomotives and freight cars,
and a station and a gateman,
the water tower, and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.
So grand that you might think Tommy was wishing for something that just didn't exist.
I wish he hasn't.
Like me.
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.
So sympathy, so sympathy...
Now you are in my clutches, Bob!
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you straight.

Now you're blaming Jesus.
You're blaming our Lord.
I sort of understand because...
I understood the way any old fool would understand.
There was no Jesus.
No flatulent old woman waving her panties on the hill.
It's not that you don't want to.
It's that they won't let you.
No, there's just a crime in wilderness.
They're ashamed.
And the hot pursuit of wolves.
Wolves everywhere in the background.
I'm ashamed of them.
It's cold.
I'm leaving that city life behind.
I can't get my finger off the paper.
I can't get my needle back in the pan, Jan.
Come on, cowboy.
No, man, I was trying to hear a can against this here tree,
and it started whispering to me, man.
No, you've been drinking.
There's the face of Madonna right up there.
There's the face of Virgin Mary.
I swear to God, look at it.
It is.
What?
It's her Christmas.
It's your Christmas witch coming true.
Wow.
A Christmas witch?
I'll be whole.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I guess it does look a little bit more.
Her breasts are so cold.
I know she must be a true witch.
I guess you could call her that if that's what she's packing down for real.
She's running by hovering Christmas ornaments.
It looks like a radar device.
What?
Yo.
Yo?
It's her.
What up?
Nothing.
What's up?
What a deep voice.
The first Christmas witch.
Ha, ha, ha.
Hmm.
Here we go.
Mm-hmm.
Here she goes.

I know.

Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
Hey, Mother Mary, your blessed lady.
Hey, Mother Mary, I fell in love with your son.
Hey, Mother Mary, turn me on and on and on.
Hey, Mother Mary, thank God for you and your son.
Right on, right on, right on, right on.
Right on.
I am yours truly, Rudy Ray Moore, bold and still beautiful.
Baby, I want to talk to you.
This Christmas, because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmastime.
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece,
and the health department made us take them down.
I remember my father well, you know.
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.
He used to have, you know what caused it, Ben?
He used to.
Put a stocking cap on his head and put a knot right in front of it.
Daddy wake up with that stomping headache.
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.
He said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas,
but he's going to bring you something.
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air
and come back inside and told us the biggest lie ever heard.
He said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new season?
Century?
They even come to questioning now.
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan Claus?
Oh my God.
Dang, come on.
His father, Paul Bunyan, and his mother, Big Sister,
Did they have Christmas before there were malls?
Before there were malls, there was no such thing as Christmas?
Yes.
The Pilgrims for Babies?
There was a down-home Norman Rockwell style,
it's a wonderful life type of Christmas.
It was a...
It was a...
It was a kite-flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas,
not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.
It was a...
When your little brother broke through the hole,
it fell through a hole in the ice,
and you went and saved him.
You didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.
It was a wonderful life back then.
I remember when Uncle Bud would come in with a key and candles,
like most people have to do at Christmas.
He would have that smile on his face and a big red nose.
But today, Christmas is lost its meaning.
He'd have beaten the crap out of Santa Claus.
He would have...
Scott, you made your choice.
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.
And to your eternal soul,
you have found that all that could you afford
to give to God that which was his,
you have been so...
You have been so...




You have been so...
You have been so...
The Senate still stands.
As promised,
he knew outer darkness,
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.
I don't want to go to hell, sir.
Sir, no.
I don't want to go to hell.
No.

No.
No.

Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.
Dare I ask it?
Yes.
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?
The answer?
Yes, definitely.
Take that and shove it up the tube marked certainty
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.
Merry Christmas to all!
Now you're all gonna die!
The night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nick went insane
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain
Well the workshop is gone now
He decided to vomit
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet
And he tied up his helpers
And he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage
He got desert francer
With an old German luger
And his friends were all dead
He slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger
And he picked up a flamethrower
And a barbecue blitzer
And he took a big bite to say it tastes just like chicken
The night Santa went crazy
The night Kris Kringle went nuts
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole
Without stepping in reindeer guts
There's a National Garden
And a party in the FBI
There's a van from the eye
We're just loose
And helicopters circling round in the sky
And the bullets are flying
The bodyguards rising
And everyone's dying to know
Who's Santa why?
My, my, my, my, my, my
You used to be such a jolly guy
Your ?!
Ah!
He knows when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you can do good
So be good, for goodness sake
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Have yourself an advanced Dogmatic Christmas song thing called
Santa is Coming by F. Gillespie and F. J. Coote.
ElectricElf at loop.com can tell you more about that.
But now...
Who gave the Lord the claptrap?
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.
The time of the Lord, of the fact that...
How many before you reach your limit?
Jesuses?
Yeah, how many can you bag?
How many messiahs can you bag?
Mail.
Jesuses.
If you're doing it in season, if you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit.
Oh, you never do one.
And you can only take one.
You never bag the Lord in C.
You bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound.
But when they're in season, it's every God for himself.
This is the season for the fighting Jesus, obviously.
We are between a rock and a hard place.
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea in the old age and he got a very, very hard foot?
And he got elephantages of the rectum.
You know, it's not...
It's not something well known by many Christian scholars.
Messy, messy, messy disease.
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was...
Well, I like the story.
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies and then comes here to America and settles, you know, tames the West.
I like when he moves into a trailer park and...
Jesus fought for the Confederate army.
The ranger.
I like the...
The Texas ranger.
Jesus, Texas ranger.
Johnny Ripple was a Jesus.
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police, for maybe the Hopi police force.
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.
He was the white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal.
Well, what about old Peacemaker, the Jesus of the Iroquois, who was actually Huron?
A Huron.
You didn't know that, did you?
See, I got you.
Thin rod.
Jesus.
Elrond.
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus you've ever seen.
Oh, it tastes like butter.
It's a different Jesus.
It tastes like...
A future Jesus.
A future pie, children.
A future Jesus.
A pipe smoking Jesus.
Hey, Dave, you know where it is.
Go kick that window open.
I already kicked it.
I'll kick it again, though.
Kick it good this time.
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God.
We hope that...
We thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving.
Clapping.
We appreciate all that.
And we're just trying to insult your fan club.
That's all.
That's why we do this blasphemous stuff.
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?
Right.
I could hear him say that.
Praise God and Bob and Jesus.
Next topic.
Next topic.
Terrorist insurance.
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?
And science.
Well, that's the life of Brian, isn't it?
And Greek mythology and Norse mythology.
Listen to the sounds of hell.
Jingle, jangle, jingle.
We're on the road.
We're on a sleigh ride to heck.
Santa and his reindeer are really wicked.
Wrapped in wrapping paper.
We're gonna break our necks.
Got a rocket in my pocket on a sleigh ride to heck.
Sleigh ride to heck.
Sleigh ride to heck.
Sleigh ride to heck.
Sleigh ride to heck.
The elves are full of cheer.
The kids are tucked in bed.
Santa ain't coming.
We're on a sleigh ride to heck.
Their dreams are filled with toys.
But they're out of luck.
Because Satan is coming.

Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to f**k.
Sleigh ride to heck.
Sleigh ride to heck.
Sleigh ride to heck.
The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends, from his new album, Don't Trust Whitey, James
Kochalka, Superstar.
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith that he not only can accept somebody making
fun of Bob, stomping on a picture of Bob, he'll do it himself.
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.
Now we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,
but we subgeni may be bad.


But our way of bad is holy.
Is holy compared to the evil of so, not all, by any means, but so many American fundamentalists,
charismatics, evangelicals, etc. in general.
Of course, they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, etc.,
if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about.
I'm...
We're...
Jesus and Bob, like we say, our old drinking buddies, got nothing against Jesus.
It's just his fan club.
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief, just like you or me.
But the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief.
Uh-uh, no.
Because God's perfect.
He doesn't even sneeze.
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us and we
have to go in the secret.
The secret room.
The bathroom.
To do awful things.
But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.
Oh, and he's male.
But he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do.
Because we sinned.
Oh, yeah, we all sinned.
We're bad.
We're worthless.
We're no good to God unless we sign a contract with his agent.
We interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.
We turn.
Bob and the bastards of Israel.

The universe will be back after this message.

Is, is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob, as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?
It's so separate, it's so separate.
The great joke is...

sight of Santa Claus!

Fuck Christmas!
