1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Bob, Bob, love you.

2
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,240
Bob, Bob, love you.

3
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,720
Bob, Bob, love you.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,720
Light your prop eyes up and test it back.

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,240
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.

6
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,320
Praise Bob, Bob, and Connie's rack.

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,980
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,960
All bow before the great metal lord.

9
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,000
Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage.

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,760
We're all here tonight to praise Bob.

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,960
He's kind of shown us that Devo works in parallel ways with other pockets of humans on this planet.

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:29,980
Where we thought we were alone, we know there are now other human forms that believe in God.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,540
And we know that Bob is a conscious mutation.

14
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,240
As he knows, Bob is merely an enema for a constipated society.

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,400
These people here are here to help a constipated society blow it out their ass.

16
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,160
Have you ever met Bob?

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,980
Well, like I said, Bob would appear in my bedroom and chase me around, making me do jumping jacks.

18
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,540
He's got food.

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,160
I know what you do.

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,600
Cause I do it too.

21
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,620
Intelligence.

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,880
No, no, no, no, no, no.

23
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,780
Intelligence.

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,680
No, no, no, no, no, no.

25
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,840
Am I as smart as I think?

26
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,220
Probably not.

27
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,080
That's good.

28
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,120
Daily disease cannot feel pain.

29
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,980
Daily disease cannot feel pain.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Nobody eats and drinks in the beginnin'.

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
No, no, no, no, no, no!

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,940
We do the things we do because we want to.

33
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,140
We fight with them.

34
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,140
I'll take on humanity's repository of man.

35
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,140


36
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:47,400
Mutter words of silence,ALLY During the 거 connected corresponds with the

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:58,660
corresponding level three we just blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

38
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,420
held on August 10th in Cleveland.

39
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,400
The third annual one

40
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,460
organized by several old subgeniuses

41
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,620
and fellow Devo fans.

42
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,400
Reverend Toth Wilder,

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,340
Reverend Scott Orsi,

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,100
the good Blinker Boy at AOL.com

45
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,640
and help from Steve Sinek.

46
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,340
And friends, it's just been,

47
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,480
it's great.

48
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,940
Because I love the Devo's.

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,320
We have a lot in common,

50
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,860
the church and the Devo's.

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,240
We're both owned by Bob.

52
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,440
We were both controlled by Bob

53
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,300
completely for quite a long time.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,380
And we both share a philosophy.

55
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,640
We don't always have the same kind of music,

56
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,900
but sometimes we do.

57
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,240
We always have the philosophy.

58
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,220
A special philosophy,

59
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,460
a little different,

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,300
depending on which cult you're talking about.

61
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,200
But it is a philosophy for the different.

62
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,780
You know, in pamphlet number one,

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,780
what the hell?

64
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,180
This is Herb Alpert here in the background.

65
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,180
Friends, did you know that Herb Alpert

66
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,400
was the guy who signed Devo

67
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,680
to their very first big time record deal?

68
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,100
Anyway, friends,

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,060
the church of the subgenius

70
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,380
has called itself the spaz church

71
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,520
of macho irony.

72
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,120
And as I enjoyed the various cover bands

73
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,200
covering Devo

74
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,220
and the new and old and rare Devo materials

75
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,480
that were dredged up

76
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,020
for each of these conventions,

77
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,040
I got to thinking and pondering

78
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,100
about the spazfulness of the great spaz bands.

79
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,080
And the ones I was thinking of primarily

80
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,340
are ones from the 80s.

81
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,740
Elvis Costello,

82
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,340
who I actually used to sort of resemble

83
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,480
back in the day.

84
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
And Talking Heads,

85
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,440
I never was that into Talking Heads,

86
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,720
but they were a great spaz band, I suppose.

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,880
And David Byrne is a deuce paying subgenius

88
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,720
twice over,

89
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,300
just as are several members of Devo.

90
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,860
Ah, friends.

91
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,240
But you know, some people,

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,960
and then of course there's spaz bands today,

93
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,100
and we'll be playing a lot of that.

94
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
But you know, some might say

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,400
that the spaz,

96
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,720
the spaziness and spazitude

97
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,060
of the weirdos

98
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,600
shows no dignity.

99
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,580
That it is somehow silly and unmanly.

100
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,660
But,

101
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,380
nay, my friends, nay!

102
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,600
I say the ability to spaz

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,160
is our treasure,

104
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,180
and the inability to spaz

105
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,120
is the curse of the blockhead and the pink.

106
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,340
Because think,

107
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,080
is not the sexual orgasm coming?

108
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,560
The ultimate,

109
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,400
spaz attack?

110
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,500
The spaz of sex, friends.

111
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,440
The spaz of letting your own mutant abnormality out.

112
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,240
Do you really care what the others think?

113
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,360
Well, sure you do.

114
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,700
But, why let on?

115
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,600
Friends, as Bob Dobbs said very recently

116
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,680
to his young ward, Dr. Onan Kanabite,

117
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,480
Bob said,

118
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,640
I'd rather have the right people laughing at me

119
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,120
than have the wrong people laughing with me.

120
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,460
I'd rather have the right people laughing at me

121
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,460
than have the wrong people laughing with me.

122
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,720
Friends, you think about that

123
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,380
as you spaz out in this, uh,

124
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,040
friends, white, you just white.

125
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,620
You just white.

126
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,460
Is there anything religion can do to help me?

127
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,180
Help me find my friend?

128
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,020
Well, we could join together in prayer.

129
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,840
Uh-huh.

130
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,780
But is there anything useful we can do?

131
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:02,840
No.

132
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,480
Oh, man.

133
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,220
Oh, man.

134
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:07,960
Oh, man.

135
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:07,960


136
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,840
Whoa.

137
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,900
Whoa.

138
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:10,620
Whoa.

139
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:11,680
Whoa.

140
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:11,740
Whoa.

141
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,240
Whoa.

142
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,480
Whoa.

143
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:14,480


144
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,280
Whoa.

145
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,280


146
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,280


147
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,920
Whoa.

148
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:16,920


149
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:16,920


150
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:16,920


151
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,740
Whoa.

152
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:38,900
Whoa.

153
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:38,900


154
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:38,900


155
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:38,900


156
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:38,900


157
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:38,900


158
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,260
Oh, why, why?

159
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:40,680
Whoa.

160
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,160


161
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,460
Why should I be?

162
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,160
Oh, what a nophone.

163
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,120
Oh, why should I be behind this?

164
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,120


165
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,800
Why?

166
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:44,820


167
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,620
Boy, why, why should I divide this like

168
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:46,620


169
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:46,900
Oh, boy.

170
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:46,900


171
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:46,900


172
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:46,900


173
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,440
While we left and did it

174
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,380
While the right hand goes to work

175
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,760
I said we left and did it now

176
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,460
While the right hand goes to work

177
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,520
You've got both hands

178
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,480
You've got both hands

179
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,280
You've got beret in hands

180
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,500
You've got beret in hands

181
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,400
Take me for no man

182
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,360
Take me for no man

183
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,560
Okay relax

184
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,140
And assume the position

185
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,360
Going to dog is a mission

186
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,920
Once around we've done today

187
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,580
Always do what your mama done say

188
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,000
But some people don't follow way

189
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,460
Once around we've done today

190
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,840
As soon as they love their jalass

191
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,820
Just try to stay cool

192
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,320
Just fly power în the air

193
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,660
Go ballin' like a trit

194
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:01,660


195
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:01,660


196
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,680
You got the whole scene

197
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:02,680


198
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:02,680


199
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:02,680


200
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:02,680


201
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:02,680


202
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:02,680


203
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:02,680


204
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,200
You've got left hand

205
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,440
Well done

206
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,180
Goodnight

207
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,160
We've found something now

208
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,660
You're melting now

209
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,480
You got old hands, you got beret and hands

210
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,420
You got beret and hands, they pray for no man

211
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,400
They pray for no man

212
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,980
Okay, relax and assume the position

213
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,840
You're into doggy's ambition

214
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,880
Watch your head three times a day

215
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,380
Always do what your mama let's say

216
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,760
Bust a dick with a ball away

217
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,380
Watch your head three times a day

218
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,900
Watch your head three times a day

219
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,400
Always do what your mama let's say

220
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,820
Bust a dick with a ball away

221
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,440
Watch your head three times a day

222
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,520
A lovely, lovely rendition of Devo's Praying Hands

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,960
Performed by All The Way

224
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:12,960


225
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,560
by Occupant

226
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Who has covered a number of Devo songs

227
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,140
Which we'll hear this hour

228
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,520
Just absolutely amazingly

229
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,480
Occupant

230
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,880

234
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,280
And now

235
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,340
Through subversive measures

236
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,360
Devo passes on the word of Bob

237
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,980
By uh, we

238
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,000
If you take a look at our last album cover

239
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,360
His name's been airbrushed into the rubber hairlines

240
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,320
Of each of the band members

241
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,060
Right next to the word sex

242
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,900
Do Bob and sex go hand in hand?

243
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,320
Well, Bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex

244
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,140
Near like explosions

245
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,660
At length

246
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,040
It makes no sense

247
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,660
To faudet

248
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,020

249
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,060
Gross

250
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,060

Is conclude

252
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:34,640
That day

253
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,540
The only joke is

254
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,400
Well never mind

255
00:11:41,400 --> 00:12:02,880
the Yoni. Tell us about that. What's that? I'm sure your audience knows what the Holy Temple of the Yoni is. Can you tell us? It's the female delta. Mark Mothersbaugh on Bob.

256
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:30,540
Come in, Boogie Boy. We're late. Have you got the papers the Chinaman gave you?

257
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,380
Here it is, Dad. Is it a surprise?

258
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,700
Yes, Boogie. In the past, this information has been suppressed. But now it can be told.

259
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,300
Every man, woman, and mutant on this planet shall know the truth about D.L.

260
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,680
Oh, shit.

261
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,780
Peek-a-boo!

262
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,860

Peek-a-boo!

278
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,540
We are in the dark!

279
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,480
Peek-a-boo!

280
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,600
We are in the dark!

281
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,080
Peek-a-boo!

282
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,020
Peek-a-boo!

283
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,180
Peek-a-boo!

284
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,140
Go on!

285
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,700
We'll be right back.

286
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,420
We'll be right back.

287
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,040
A Bruiser Mix by Bruiser.

288
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,680
Whoever that is.

289
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:12,000
It came with the devotional special memorial CD.

290
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,500
A Bruiser Mix by Bruiser.

291
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,520
A Bruiser Mix by Bruiser.

292
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:51,800
A Bruiser Mix by Bruiser.

293
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,340
The song was devolving.

294
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,940
Turning back into the most simple of primates.

295
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,380
This would explain daytime TV.

296
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,300
Jerry Springer being so popular.

297
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,220
Why the hell were you not on a f***ing record label?

298
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,820
But right when I was about to tell Bubba about this.

299
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,340
He turned on Jerry Springer.

300
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,440
And as I watched.

301
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,840
That 13 year old prostitute straddle the Pope.

302
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,380
I couldn't think anything but.

303
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,960
What a damn fine country we live in.

304
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,060
God bless f***ing America.

305
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,900
Devolutionization.

306
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,640
By a group called the Cryogenic Strawberries.

307
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,420
An unusual group.

308
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,460
I think they're on mp3.com too.

309
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,340
Or somewhere out there.

310
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,060
Do a little search.

311
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,500
Cryogenic Strawberries.

312
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,140
二, into nice navies from跟

313
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,180

Today, what does it take to do the super thing?

320
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,580
I'll tell you what it takes, a very simple thing

321
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,000
Iron nerves, like the pilot of a jumbo jet

322
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,540
Or a girl, on the go who hasn't got there yet

323
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,540
Magnetic trumpets blowing, synthetic saxophones

324
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:11,440
The evidence kept growing from below

325
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,640
Hidden motivations, buried in my past

326
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,740
Still give a string for the super thing

327
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,440
The Red Alarm

328
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,140
A rude surprise every time it rings

329
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:38,640
It means it's time to go beyond the normal thing

330
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,260
Pay attention and be prepared to do it right

331
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:51,920
The super thing, the thing that makes you bigger than life

332

Signals start to travel from a distant place

352
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,380
Lights go out, electrical shock, then pleasure pain

353
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,920
Sensations unfamiliar can make you sick

354
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,260
It's a superhuman thing and it does the trick

355
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,420

Come on now, that's right, uh-huh

418
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,360
You wanna sit down when you know some crowd's gonna try and pull away your chair

419
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,380
So you stand and stand, stand and stand until

420
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,460
Now you can't stand any longer

421
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,160
Hey, you know you shouldn't have never sat down

422
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,000
That's right, uh-huh

423

People gonna, people gonna think you're spanked

426
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,500
Yes

427
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,580
People gonna think you're spanked

428
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,960
By the Elastic Band

429
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,660
A classic song of great spazitude

430
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,420
And before that, some ESO Swamp Radio

431
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,140
From WCSB Cleveland, Chaz Smith

432
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,160
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang

433
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,580
Talking about the Feast of Spazism

434
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:49,400
Speaking of which, upcoming are some amazing

435
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,740
Well, here's an example, it's not a Devo song

436
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,820
Although Little Theodore later on in the show will cover Through Being Cool

437
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,360
Here's Little Theodore with I Don't Care

438
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,760
I don't care about the economy

439
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,800
It has no effect on me

440
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,080
All I need to be happy

441
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,640
Is a woman that's cruel and a place to pee

442
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,620
I don't care about the government

443
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,560
I think it's about time it went

444
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,700
Nasty politicians I resent

445
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,500
Just like me, they're all hell-bent!

446
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,880
I don't wanna hear about big stars

447
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,060
They should all be behind bars

448
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,580
Maybe we can ship them off to Mars

449
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,880
Or take off their clothes and expose their scars

450
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,380
I don't want no more of the press

451
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,540
They're responsible for our mess

452
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,980
If we knew what was best

453
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,300
We'd live our own lives and skip the rest

454
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,800
Ah ha ha!

455
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,240

Yeah ha ha!

466
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,040


467
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,460
Yeah!

Hotfoot Quartet

479
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,880
He was a mongoloid and his friends were unaware

480
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,720
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid and nobody even cared

481
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:18,160
And he wore a hat and he had a job

482
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,320
And he brought home the bacon so that nobody knew

483
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,100
Mongoloid, mongoloid

The mongoloid, he was a mongoloid,

490
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,420
one from a song too many.

491
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,720
The mongoloid, he was a mongoloid,

492
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,400
and his friends were unaware.

493
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,920

494
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,420

495
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,440
And he wore a hat,

496
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,760
and he had a job,

497
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,820
and he brought home the bacon

498
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,880
so that nobody knew.

499
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,860

Such as this song by

590
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,480
Well, this came from the

591
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,560
Devotional CD

592
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,680
For more information on the

00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,500
Devotional, here's their

594
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,100
Well, a website that will help you

595
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,140
That's

Blinkerboy

00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,960
But Blinkerboy isn't

601
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,700
Spelled with vowels exactly

602
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,980
It's spelled this way

00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,260
Slash

604
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:28,040

Blinkerboy

606
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,380
And they, on their CD

607
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,940
I found this piece

608
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,600
By Beal and Elvin the Sewer Rat

609
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,380
Back to the sand

610
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,880
We muster tails

611
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,940
We muster tails

612
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,700
We muster tails

613
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:48,700


614
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,280
Although I don't remember

615
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,280


616
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,280


617
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,980
The little sails

618
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
I say it's on

619
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,800
The Swicking Sails

620
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,200
Or we not men

621
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,700
We are Nemons

622
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,500
Are we not men

623
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,620
Baby-be-on

624
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,220
Are we not men

625
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,820
We are Nemons

626
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,840
We're pinheads and we are not home

627
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,180
We're pinheads all the go home

628
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:35,540
Are we not men? We are demons

629
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,580
Are we not men? We are demons

630
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,180
Are we not men? We are demons

631
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,580
Are we not men? We are demons

632
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,280
From even old and business suits

633
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,900
Teachers and critics are fans of the law

634
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,540
Are we not men? We are demons

635
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,920
Are we not men? We are demons

636
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:17,920


637
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,580
Are we not men? We are demons

638
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:26,700
Are we not men? We are demons

639
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:32,280
Are we not men? We are demons

640
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,620
I say it's all just wind and sand

641
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,140
We're pinheads all the go home

642
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,880
Teachers and critics are fans of the law

643
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,560
Are we not men? We are demons

644
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,680
Are we not men? We are demons

00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,300
Are we not men? We are demons

646
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,780
We are demons

647
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,020
We are todays.

648
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,020


649
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,020


650
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,020


651
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,020


652
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,020


653
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,020


654
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,660
But let's leave things of this world behind

655
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,180
and walk now down the path of Bob

656
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,720
for this brief minute of slack from the church of the sub-genius.

657
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,540
And we find then the family falling apart.

658
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,680
Oh, they wail and gnash their teeth, our rival churches do,

659
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:41,440
about how the children are getting exposed to too much this and too much that.

660
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,020
What they ain't being exposed to is a little bit of mom and dad.

661
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,440
Forget the pornography, I don't care.

662
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,240
It makes me mad, my friend, the hypocrisy.

663
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,180
Now, I have nothing against hypocrisy.

664
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,160
Every religion must have its fair share of hypocrisy.

665
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,840
As Bob Dobbs once said, I don't practice what I preach

666
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,760
because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

667
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:05,300
But that preacher can get up there on TV and, oh, he's so glad to keep you normal,

668
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,440
keep you working so hard you don't even know your own wifey anymore.

669
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,400
And your kids, you don't know your kids any better than your employees.

670
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,100
So, friend, let there be slack.

671
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,220
Salutations.

672
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,580
Today I feel a sense of urgency as I speak to you for Devo Incorporated.

673
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:32,720
There is a direct connection between Devo's work in the music field and a big wiggly world around us.

674
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,360
You may not be aware of this, but we are in the middle of World War III.

675
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,720
It is not nuclear bombs that we must fear.

676
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,800
The weapon is the human mind or lack of it on this planet.

677
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,980
That will determine our fate.

678
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,780
Capital punishment for airline passengers who attempt to save money.

679
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,140
Spud men and gas lines who forgot that guns don't arm.

680
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:04,020
And tourists attempting to catch some rays at Three Mile Island add up to a major attack of corkscrews in the brain.

681
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,000
We must fight back.

682
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,180
We must know what we want.

683
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,220
We must want what we need.

684
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,240
And what we need is duty now for the future.

685
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,580
And for the future it is even harder when you are a little kid who looks at this ship and says we are ever going to stand up again.

686
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,320
But in your place, in this world with yourégine will only carry thesenot worse.

687
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:41,700
We must move from thiskanal Videos.

688
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,100
Meaning we shouldn't lack abilities.

689
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,620
We have nothing to lose.

690
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,000
What is a god's Flash for?

691
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,180
So it is wise to have your possible result at the dispatcher scriptures as an example.

692
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,140
What you can learn is the word you have to practice in order to have success.

693
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:56,080
We can learn from various London's До Calls in this channel.

694
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:56,660
Bye.

695
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,560
Bye.

696
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:03,720
Mother's ball fiddling around on his fair light around 1984 when we helped with the RU Experience video.

697
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,700
And now, more Occupant.

698
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,560
I'm saddened.

699
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,540
I'm saddened.

700
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,840
I'm saddened.

701
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,680
Because it's hard to believe.

702
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,800
I'm saddened.

703
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,800
Oh, it's so easy to see.

704
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:04,760
I'm saddened.

705
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,580
We're waiting for a reply.

706
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,740
I'm saddened.

707
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,140
For the very last time.

708
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:10,920
I'm saddened.

709
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,760
Oh, baby, this one's for you.

710
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,920
I'm saddened.

711
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,740
For everything that you do.

712
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,820
I'm saddened.

713
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,740
Until the battle is won.

714
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,920
I'm saddened.

715
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,940
We live to fight on and on.

716
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,060
And when you had it all together.

717
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,100
And when you rolled it in a ball.

718
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,100
And when you walked in the pyramid.

719
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,140
As it's about to fall.

720
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,200
Remember you were there.

721
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,720
Remember if you were there.

722
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,320
For those who held the ground.

723
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,780
When it all came down.

724
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:46,340
Sound.

725
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:49,660
Sound.

726
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:52,860
Sound.

727
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:53,640


728
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,660
Sound.

729
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,840
Oh, baby, this one's for you.

730
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:13,740
Sound.

731
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,700
For everything that you do.

Sound.

733
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,740
Until the battle is won.

734
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:19,660
Sound.

735
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,020
We live to fight on and on.

736
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,500
Sound.

737
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,740
Oh, baby, this one's for you.

738
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:25,660
Sound.

739
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,760
For everything that you do.

740
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:28,700
Sound.

741
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:29,580
Sound.

742
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,660
Until the battle is won.

743
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:31,700
Sound.

744
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:32,340
Sound.

745
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,860
We live to fight on and on.

746
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,420
Sound.

747
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:34,840
Sound.

748
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,540
About the world outside.

749
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:37,400
Sound.

750
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:37,820
Sound.

751
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,860
Because you just can't hide.

752
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:40,520
Sound.

753
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:40,980
Sound.

754
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,680
From the plain honest truth.

755
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,380
Sound.

756
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:43,820
Sound.

757
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,920
There's so much we could do.

758
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:46,680
Sound.

759
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:47,260
Sound.

760
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,680
Oh, baby, this one's for you.

761
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,680
Sound.

762
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:50,260
Sound.

763
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:50,440
Sound.

764
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,680
For everything that you do.

765
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,600
Sound.

766
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:52,980
Sound.

767
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,700
Until the battle is won.

768
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:55,600
Sound.

769
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:55,920
Sound.

770
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:56,060


771
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,920
We live to fight on and on.

772
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,640
Sound.

773
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,800
Oh, baby, this one's for you.

774
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,600
Sound.

775
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,700
For everything that you knew.

776
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:04,580
Sound.

777
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,680
Until the battle is won.

778
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:07,700
Sound.

779
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,840
We live to fight on and on.

780
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,560
Sound.

781
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,480
I'm serving.

782
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:11,820
Sound.

783
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,520
I'm serving.

784
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,220
Sound.

785
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,200
Sound his out.

786
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:16,740
Sound.

787
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,520
I'm serving.

788
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,040
Sound.

789
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,020
Sound.

790
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:20,020


791
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:20,460
I'm serving.

792
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,660
Sound.

793
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,140
Sound his out.

794
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:22,720
Sound.

795
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,220
Sound.

796
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:23,820


797
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,400
Sound.

798
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:26,420
I'm shouting!

799
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,280
Shout it out!

800
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,480
I'm shouting!

801
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,500
I'm shouting!

802
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,260
Shout it out!

803
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,060
I'm shouting!

804
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:35,520
I'm shouting!

805
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,580
Shout it out!

806
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,300
I'm shouting!

807
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,040
I'm shouting!

808
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,240
Shout it out!

809
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,240
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d

810
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,920
d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d

811
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,820
d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d

812
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,380
We tell us that we lost our tails

813
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,860
Evolving up from little snails

814
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,920
I say it's all just wind and sails

815
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,080
Are we not men? We are the evil

816
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,740
Are we not men? The evil

817
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,900
Young Nigel doing the classic Jocko Homo there

818
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,660
from the Devotional Devo Memorial CD

819
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,560
and now Little Theodors.

820
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,360
Oh no, I'm sorry friends.

821
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,880
And now Strange Pursuit by Occupant

822
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,680
and then Little Theodors through being cool.

823
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,720
Little Theodors

824
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:47,720
Little Theodors

825
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,720
Little Theodors

826
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:46,280
Little Theodors

827
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,280
Telling you you have to, but you never turn the light on.

828
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,220
It's a great world.

829
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,240
Taking my mind and putting love into the beaver.

830
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,400
It's a great world.

831
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,160
Never get stuck when you give a glance.

832
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,620
It's a great world.

833
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:47,340
It's a great world.

834
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,540
Time to show those evil spuds what's what.

835
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:58,280
If you live in a small town, you might find a dozen or two

836
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:03,580
young alien types who step out and dare to declare

837
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,540
we're through being cool.

838
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,240
We're through being cool.

839
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,460
Thank the tank who tried to drive you nuts.

840
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,500
Time to clean some house.

841
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,240
Be a man or a mouse.

842
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,120
Waste those who make it tougher.

843
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,260
Get around.

844
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:31,380
If you live in a big place, any factions under the ground,

845
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,640
chase down Mr. Pinky Dink.

846
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,920
So don't say, can't be found.

847
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,180
We're through being cool.

848
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:15,060
We're through being cool.

849
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,040
52nd?

850
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,720
depende de itu goose.

851
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:17,720


852
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:17,720


853
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:17,720


854
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,260
The zinnies and the twits

855
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,340
Put the tape on a race

856
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,180
Rearrange your face

857
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,620
We all really like to tassel anyway

858
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,840
If you live in a small town

859
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,000
You might find a dozen or two

860
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,160
Young aliens try to step out

861
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,280
And dare to declare

862
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,120
We're through being cool

863
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,840
We're through being cool

864
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,200
Eliminate the zinnies and the twits

865
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,220
We're through being cool

866
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,100
We're through being cool

867
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,340
Spank the punk who tries to make you wank

868
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,140
Spank the punk who tries to drive you nuts

869
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,300
Smash him!

870
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,920
We're through being cool

871
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,100
We're through being cool

872
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,080
We're through being cool

873
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,800
We're through being cool

874
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,380
We're through being cool

875
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,320
We're through being cool

876
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,900
We're through being cool

877
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:39,680
You have been listening to

878
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,080
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack

879
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,140
Produced by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang

880
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:55,180
My address is P.O. Box 807 Glenrose, Texas 76043

881
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,940
But you can write for more information for free

882
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,600
Paper information from the Church of the Subgenius at

883
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:10,700
Post Office Box 807 Glenrose, Texas 76043

884
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,060
As seen on WSB-TV

885
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,640
www.subgenius.com

886
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,280
The band Devo is

887
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,000
They've got a new album coming out

888
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,300
Called Shout, which will be out in about a month

889
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,420
They've done a cover version of Hendrix's

890
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,700
Are You Experienced?

891
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:35,440
And the Subgenius Foundation in association with

892
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,640
Tele Music Corporation is going to be putting that video together

893
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,780
It'll be loaded with special effects and probably a cameo appearance

894
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,460
By the ghost of Bob Dobbs

895
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,580
And by the ghost of Jimi Hendrix, too

896
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:49,040
This is a whole, you know, combining two churches in one

897
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,320
Yeah, I'm serious

898
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,460
This ought to be quite a seance-packed shoot

899
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,760
So, but aside from the videos that we're trying to do

900
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,780
There's a lot of

901
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:03,860
The whole music video thing is kind of a funny situation

902
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:09,060
In that that whole world is loaded with what I consider false slack

903
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,760
And, you know, endless repetition of the same thing

904
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,040
But here is the whole deal

905
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,100
The other side of all that I can tell is that

906
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,100


907
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,160
I feel like probably

908
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:21,160


909
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:21,220
I don't believe it

910
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:21,880
Hey, you know Bob says

911
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,300
That you say

912
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:22,300


913
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:22,300


914
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:22,900
My dad d00d

915
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:19,420
Thank you.

916
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,100
Thank you.

917
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,440
Bender!

918
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,660
It's a mirror!

919
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,000
Miracle!

920
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:13,640
Ah!

921
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:19,540
This is by a wide margin the least likely thing that has ever happened.
