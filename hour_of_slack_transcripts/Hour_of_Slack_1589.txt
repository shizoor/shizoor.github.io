Bring him here!
Come here!
I want to talk to you!
Hey, punk.
When I get out of here, I'm gonna tell you a new one.
I'd like a receipt for that.
Yeah, me too.
I'd like a receipt for that.
I'd like a receipt for that.
The stage, it seemed, was the only area of my life in which I was willing to accept something less than perfection.
The show is Trump, and it has sold out performances everywhere.
Perhaps I shouldn't campaign at all.
I'll just, you know, I'll ride it right into the White House.
I'm intelligent.
Some people would say I'm very, very, very intelligent.
I get up.
I take a shower.

I take a shower and wash my hair.
Then I read the newspapers and watch the news on television.
Slowly, the hair dries.
It takes about an hour.
I don't even use the blow dryer.
Once it's dry, I comb it.
Once I have it the way I like it, even though nobody else likes it,
I spray it, and it's good for the day.
And did you know, my name is in more black songs than any other name in hip-hop.
Like five of them lately.
Oh.
All of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me, consciously or unconsciously.
That's to be expected.
Every guy in the country wants to go out with my daughter.
Oh.
I'll shake hands.
I shake hands with people.
But it's not something I like.
Look, I'm not a huge fan of Japan.
But I love their custom.
Oh.
You know, you hear lots of people say that a great deal is when both sides win.
I'm not.
That is a bunch of crap.
Ugh.
My net worth fluctuates.
It goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings.
Even my own feelings.
Ugh.
I have a great relationship with the blacks.
Ugh.
Must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees.
You.
Bing bing, bong bong, bing bing bing.
Oh.
I will be the greatest jobs president God ever created.
How stupid are the people of Iowa?
I will be so good at the military your head will spin.
I've had some beautiful pictures taken in which I had a big smile on my face.
I look like a very nice person, which in theory I am.
Ugh.
I went to Harvard.
I know words.
I have the best words.
I have the best.
But there is no better word than stupid.
Ugh.
Always be around unsuccessful people because everybody will respect you.
We're not going to be the stupid people anymore.
We're going to be the really, really smart people.
Ugh.
I love babies.
I hear that baby cry.
I like it.
Actually, I was only kidding.
You can get that baby out of here.
Eh.
Eh.
If we have nuclear weapons, why can't we use them?
Ugh.
Obama is the founder of ISIS.

I can't stop giving them money, Doug.
I'm addicted to the scrub.
You're Doug's thing.
Everybody.
That is the Doug's thing.
I'm a Doug.
I can Doug any Doug I want.
That's unusual.
How dare you say that?
You can call me a Doug.
You can come to my house, call me a Doug to my face.
What's the matter, Julie?
Wait, we are outside.
Only cops get that, Doug.
This is a Doug's free zone, sir.
We've made the top right space.
What the fuck are you doing here, Doug?
Well, that's the dog calling the kettle Doug.
That's the dog calling the duck, Doug.
That's the one.
Dick, Doug, Dick, Doug, Doug, the duck trio.
Down on the couch like a CEO.
Get the work done.
Give Doug a beat, please.
I don't care.
Them chai pills are going to make you lose all your hair.
Oh, baby.
Hey, you're lucky I'm still here.
Look, I realize they're called Little White.
But you know they're guilty every time I try to hip, huh?
Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody on?
Hello?

Hello?
Are you there?

Hello?
This pod crest has been disconnected due to lack of funds.
I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.
Just let the pod crest, like, you know, just...

Can you hear me?
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, someone turned me up, I think.
Now I feel, like, overwhelmed by the sound of my own voice.
Who's that, Doug, there?
Get the signal.
What?
Why is Reverend Doug?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I think you're in a dead zone and you're bored.
No, I was just talking.
Come here.
I'm talking in the background.
You're not supposed to look at me.
I'm just talking in the background.
No, no, no.
You don't sound like you're in the background.
Definitely, I just...
Jesus, is that you?
If I go a little closer this way, I feel like I'm not understanding the nature of your...
Hi, Jesus, it's me, Shagun.
I am stuck in that...
Uh...
Jesus, why do I get boners in my sleep?
Uh...
Butters?
So glad you could chime in.
Well, it's because he...
Maybe I'll stay.
Way too many, uh, looking for you.
Yeah, I don't...
I'm just...
I'm just trying to be in the background.
I wish other people would chime in right now.
Did you send a link to people?
Well, you know, I believe that Scrum will make this country great again.
Oh!
Thank you.

Everybody that was born after 1990, raise your hands.
Well, this is 1998, and I've never seen one of those.
I cut my hands off.
I can't...
I don't know.
I cut my hands off so I couldn't...
I cut my hands off every day.
And it's really difficult when you get down to the one hand.
Well, that's how you know you're a lizard person, animal.
You've got the other hand off with just a nub.
Your fucking limbs, they just keep growing back.
And it's great, because we always have spare limbs.
It's true.
It's true.
And that's why I'm planning a membership.
Spare limbs are really bad.
Planning a membership in the podcrest that gets you a vial of animal's blood.
You can shoot it up and maybe it'll give you regenerating limbs.
Maybe it won't.
Yeah, can't we maybe not offer that anymore?
Because I'm feeling a little bit...




Well, you need to stay more hydrated.
I try to, but they only get me so much beard and ring.
Have you tried that Soylent shit?
I hear that that's pretty good for regaining...
I have actually, and it just makes me feel more complacent.
Soylent shit is made out of shit.
That's correct.
Actually, it's made out of jism, not cum.
This is a little sexy song.
A demented kind of sexy.
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
I'm just trying to get it out of my head.





She needed a steamy meeting of flesh to sink her teeth in.
She needed to meet his back into her bed.
Her kind-eyed smiles were all I could see.


Were useful to her plan to lure him in with her dirty aching hands.
When please, stars, cover your eyes.
And see through your own disguise.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just proactive.
But it really is like I ever much wanted me to impart.

I bet if you could You'd think that her sugar-coated organs


Xen makes his fucking video shit.
CHORUS
Her misshapen pillow's still full of
Disillusioned dreams are her covers
Still covering things everyone sees
Shielding, wielding, folding up a meandering
Midnight fever, it is insatiable
She is a slave to her own needs
White, clean stars covering your eyes
And see through your own disguise
And see through your own disguise

Don't fight it
Might as well like it
It's natural
It's natural to me
Thanks.
Thanks.
What did I tell you?
I told you it wasn't going to die.
I told you that it was going to come back.
Yeah, you thought that the song that refused to die really was dead.
Well, guess what you're hearing right now?
The guy.
The song that refused to die.
It's going on and on and on.
The Sinfaltimus is just encouraging.
Oh, he likes the song that refused to die.
Or at least he thinks he does.
Lots of people think they do for the first hundred years.
Oh yeah, you thought it was dead.
But you forgot about reincarnation.
The song that refused to die is perpetually being reincarnated as an uglier and uglier song.
Well, sometimes it appears as a pretty song.
You never know.
You gotta give it credit for creativity, if not any intelligence at all.
But as Princess Wee once said, everything comes apart one way or another.





Some ways are fun.
And as Tater said, Bob loves the sin, but hates the sinner.
For you see, my friends, your rights end where Bob's fists begin.
And as Dr. Laguerre said,
Slack is like fucking.
The more you put in, the more you pull out.
But friends, we have to learn to focus.
That's it.
We keep losing our focus.
We must, we must focus if we can't take a joke.
And I'm afraid that in the case of the joke called the song that refused to die, we're
the joke.
Yeah, it's laughing at us, the song is.
I can hear its ugly laughter now, at least in my left ear.
It's got an evil sense of humor, sort of like Jehovah One.
The song is called, Jehovah One.
The song that refused to die has an ironic and cruel sense of humor.
Much like God, the song that refused to die refuses to die.
The song that refused to die is a motherfucker, my friends.
The song that refused to die is a Sunday, the spread of the sun.
One thing the song that refused to die is a Sunday, the spread of the sun.
I wrap my head around and I say, Philip, the song that refused to die, we set out
a means of communication.
The same as the famous change that happened inligatory in the Blitzkrieg period.
Isn't that pretty cool?
They 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 002 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 008 008 007 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 00 Pax referring 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 0010 0010 0010 0010 0010 0020 00�ed obligation to focus.
or sneakier and sneakier and sneakier.
Bob probably loves the song Refuse to Die.
And that's probably why it's so immortal.
The song that Refuse to Die is going to live a lot longer than you, my friend.
The song that Refuse to Die is going to live longer than Methuselah.
The song that Refuse to Die is going to live as long as J.R. Bob Dobbs has his pipe lit.
And there's no sign of that thing going out.
No sir, no sir, ma'am.
It's a rough situation these days.
You don't know what's the song that Refuse to Die, what's a car honking at you.
God damn it, but it's a dreamlike how you can go.
And then when you go, somebody runs right into you, you see?
Because it's just like the song that Refuse to Die.
And it's not dissimilar to Bob himself.
I hate to say it, but you might as well lay back and try to enjoy it, or at least ignore it.
Well, that's impossible.
Oh, if only.
If only we could just ignore it.
If we could just forget it.
If we could just get somewhere far, far away from it.
But, you see, that's the thing of it.
The thing of it is you just can't get away from it.
That's why they call it it.
If the thing that time forgot.
If only.
If the thing from beyond time.
Oh, we wish.
If the Facebook page followed it.
In the same place.
Well, yeah, that's true.
That's not true.
Okay, that's true.
If I know that song Refuse to Die.
Nobody will be able to hear anything I've said for the last 15 minutes.
But you never know.
Maybe it'll surprise me.
Maybe since it's about the song Refuse to Die and he let it through.
That would just figure.
What ironic, isn't it?
No, not ironic.
Just sad.
Because, dear friends, the church of the subgenius is the touchstone of the untouchable.
We are caustically optimistic.
In this world, you are the peer or the penis.


And you are part of our peer group.

We're the very Laffinity group you've been looking for.

I can feel the Bob energy building up.
The Bob energy is coming up from the center of the earth like a great big lava volcano

Like a zit on mother earth that's about to bust.
Here comes the spirit of Bob.
Bob.

Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
I can smell it.
It's smells kinda like the song refused to die unfortunately.
Oh, yes, Dear friends.
Oh, yes, dear friends.

friends.
I think maybe I tried to make
too many shows today.
I'll have to
I'll have to ask
Lonesome Cowboy Dave
about that.
Well, just go right on ahead and ask me then
because I'm a man of a thousand answers.
A miniscule
plate and a number of
faces.
Faces.
We have had a bunch of faces
on the show.
The music in the background
is Reverend Jimmy Ryan.
The song that refused to die was
mixed up with some lines written
by other subgeniuses such as
Titor and Onan
Canabite and others.
That pretty song we heard was
Reverend Amy.
The ugly dugs we heard
were Thorazine Urine Pod Crust
and that song
that sent with the guy
saying give me slack or kill me
that was
Reverend Experimental
Please. And we heard
Billy West as Sat Brannigan as
Donald Trump. And the little
bit from Bobby School by
Reverend Watt
Default.
I missed the trumpeter
the takeoff.
It was his
his exact words.
It's just that they were being
read by Billy West,
the cartoon voice guy
in the voice of
Sat Brannigan Futurama.
Yeah, I see.
I see.
I see.
I see.
I see.
I'm glad to hear that happened
because we would have been
some desperate pick and snot
had that not occurred.
You see what's going on from east
to west and changing the horizon
level.
What?
You know, well, that's bad news
for me, man.
Yeah, it is.
By the way, I just wanted to
mention the fact that I'm
extremely jealous because you're
going to Texas.
I want to go someplace warm.
I'm not ready for warmth to be
over entirely.
You know how they do it around
here.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's true.
Oh, well, I'm just
trying to avoid having to
shovel snow on my driveway
because the driveway there is like
a half a mile long.
It's dirt road with rocks all
over it.
It's pretty hard to shovel.
You'd have to have some pretty
big feet, too, to cover all that
turf, especially if it was like
an eye patch or something like
that.
That's the way, you know, that's
the way we want to raise them
nowadays.
We want to make them strong and
firm and ready for the
militarism.
Ready to be subsorbed.
Well, Dave, you must have all
your nice long underwear lined
up and ready to go so you can put
on many layers of clothing and
remain warm throughout the cold
winter months.
I don't want to look forward to
even, you know, well, oh, you can
put on layers of clothing.
Yes.
I don't care.
I don't want to wear layers of
clothing.
I'm sure you don't.
I want to be in a warm place,
period, you know.
Especially not some place where
they declare winter on the day
after fall begins.
I'm sure you don't.



Well, you know, sometimes
somebody has to die before you
can live in Texas.
That's what happens to us.
And then they kill you when you
get there.
That's why I got to get a gun.
Well, I didn't necessarily mean
Texas where I'd have to get a
gun.
But any place, well, I suppose
any place like Alabama or
Mississippi or Florida Panhandle
or Georgia or any place like
that.
Where it's nice and summery most
of the year, I'd have to get a
gun with a tie.
Well, the thing is, though,
Dave, that it gets to be kind of
hot down there in a way that
we're not used to up here.
I lost my used to itfulness.
In the summer.
And they grow bugs bigger
there, too.
And in the spring, too, yeah.
Bugs and snakes are quite
frightening.
And spiders have a different
dimension.
They're like, you know, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

just like my sisters, going in
my house, you know?
Yeah.
And snakes.
They own the pad.
The snakes there are like
the song that refused to die.
You have to beat them to death
with a shovel and they still
won't die.
Yes, even an hour later,
they're still opening their
mouths slowly and hissing at
you.
You know, I wouldn't be
surprised if that song doesn't
come back before this shows
everywhere.
I wouldn't be at all
surprised.
Probably I bet you in the last
Yes, three minutes it's going to take advantage of the situation and come back.
It'd be a song surge.
Yeah, Dave was lucky he missed the song that refused to die.
Well, I didn't miss the hissing part.
And they said that, what's his name, the guy who predicted the future said that Hister would be in 1947.
Nostradamus, that's right.
He predicted an evil doer named Hister.
Hister would be hissing in the 40s and 20s and 30s and stuff.
And Nostradamus also said, Dave, that the world would end on July 5th, 1999.
So obviously he wasn't perfect.
Because we know it's 1998.
Edgar Cayce agreed with us on that.
Agreed with Bob.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry to sound so ignoramus, but Edgar Cayce did agree with Bob?
Yeah, that the world would end in 1998.
Yep, 1998.
When that year comes, that's it.
That's when the great rupture will happen.
Obviously we're not there yet.
So, um...
Obviously it must not be, but there must have been some sort of misdingling of some disinformation somehow.
I passed through the passage.
The conspiracy will do anything to prevent J.R. Bob Dobbs from being president.
Anything!
Even changing calendars a thousand years in advance.
Just to embarrass his sacred scribe on the day we thought was July 5th, 1998.
Oh, well.
Let's not dwell on that.
Let's think about the future.
Oh, wait, no.
Let's not.
Let's not do that either.
Let's hide in some escapism and slack.
Yeah, that's it.
Slack.
I've actually, Dave, this is the third show I've put together today.
And it's showing because we are having to go to Stang Ranch in Stangsville, Texas, in Stang County.
I had to get some shows done in advance.
And so there's a couple of X-Day shows.
In fact, there's going to be a bunch of X-Day shows.
But once we get to Texas, I'm going to try to set up a situation whereby you, and only you, as usual, can call in to my Radio Shack mixer.
And we hopefully still do shows.
They won't be live, live shows.
And it's just not the same.
When you know it's just being recorded, it's just not the same.
Well, you can pretend it's a live audience in your mind knowing that it will be indeed someday.
No, because you know you can still edit it so that the red light panic isn't taking hold of you
and making you do your very, very, very, very.
Except when you get flustered, nervous, and then you do your work.
Yeah, sometimes it makes you pee.
It makes you ordinary, too.
Red light panic is not.
It's desirable in some fashion and way and certainty.
But in other ways, it is not.
This show sounds different.
My voice sounds different.
And you sound different.
Yeah, you sound like you used to sound about 20 years ago.
Well.
You don't sound like you used to.
You sound like the elderly staying with Come to Know and Despise.
And you sound like the young Spain.
We needed to come and despise.
But that must be a side effect that they didn't tell me about on these new hearing aids I got.
That's right.
Finally, after 20 years of increasing deafness, I've got my right ear completely back.
And my left ear is all trimmed and got a new haircut.
And it made my voice sound 20 years younger.
Just because I can hear 20 years ago.
That is it.
The hearing aid made you.
It did it.
Because you do sound like you used to sound when you were.
And you subconsciously remember, of course, how to sound like you used to sound a couple thousand years ago.
Yes.
And your hearing aid reproduces that sound in your head.
And you match right up.
And the waveforms come into perfect.
You know, they match up perfectly.
Yes.
And there you go.
He's got a special.
He's got a special spring in his voice now.
Well, I also discovered that I have a crack in my elbow that's actually pretty loud every now and then.
And my knees make noises I didn't know about.
And our house is creaky and spooky.
And my keyboard is really loud.
The things that I didn't know made any sound at all.
It turns out they're pretty noisy.
Now I'm embarrassed about what the neighbors have probably overheard for years and years.
Did you know that you're a neighbor?
All stood against you at the final hour, pointing to a guy where they knew what was next and you did not.
Do you remember now, Mr. Stan, may I call you Mr. Reverend Iron Stan?
No.
How did you know that?
How did you know that?
No one was supposed to know that.
No one was supposed to know that.
We all know.
We all see.
That's the problem.
All of us have no.
I'm scared.
Hey, speaking of big brotherly stuff, I read the, well, actually it was a YouTube thing I saw that Reverend Susie the Flusie drew our attention to.
In China, they've come up with a fiendishly clever combination of government spying and Facebook, where all of the citizens now, whether they want to or not, are playing the good citizen game.
It's called a sesame something, because the Alibaba company is involved and the government is involved.
Right.
Right.










That's like the biggest games company and so forth and totally all interconnected.
And get this.
You play the game by being a good citizen and all of your purchases are counted as credits, extra credits or demerits.
For instance, if you have been Googling or talking about Tiananmen Square, let's say, on Chinese Facebook, your score goes down.
And you can't spend, your money isn't as good.
And you can't get as good an internet connection.
Your citizen score goes down, down, down.
Whereas if you play by all the rules and buy the right things and turn in the right citizens for not doing the right things, your score goes up.
Now, someone pointed out that this could create a cobra effect.
Like when the British.
Which offered the people of India a reward for bringing in dead cobras.
What happened was the people of India started cobra farms so they could bring in lots and lots of dead cobras.
But it ended up ultimately making more cobras.
So, who knows?
Maybe this thing will backfire on the Chinese.
But on the other hand, what will probably happen is it will really work to control the populace.
And then they'll do it here.
Right.
On TrumpNet.
TrumpNet.

They're going to imitate it.
TrumpBook.
Face Trump.
If you have enough Trump points, then you can own a gun.
And if you don't have enough Trump points, then you can't even own a, you can't, your rent goes up.
If they'll, if anyone will rent to you.
In some way, they've already got, if you have a FROP card, in many states, the feds are trying to push that you may not own a gun.
Oh, right, right, yeah.
If you have a medical card.
Right, because that means you have a low, low, low score on the game of good citizenry.
Yeah.
If you're sick and need a certain kind of medicine, then the government can treat you like a bad citizen.
Mm-hmm.
Oy.
Isn't that interesting?
How many clever little things you can do with the internet and credit and guns and propaganda.
I personally think that the internet was a control mechanism devised by these many, uh, rancid heroes of the, uh, lexic, lexicoms.
I think that the, it was invented by the military and it was meant to make people wanna stare at the palms of their heads at all times.
Oh, I don't think anyone, I don't think anyone knew that was coming.
I think, well, I think when the military was doing that, they really thought it was, you know, when computers were invented, they've, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the computer was invented.

Experts thought that there would only need to be five of them in the whole world because who else?
You know, there's only five people who'd know what to use them for that knew enough math.
The idea of pornography on computers never occurred to anybody.
And now look at the Internet.
If you can stomach it.
I can.
I certainly can.
I think it's well worth it.
Yeah, the porno is great.
Right, but they demote you.
You get a demerit.
They give you, what will they call the bad porn points?
Clintons.
You'll get 10 Clintons if you watch too much porn.
But if you watch just the right amount of porn and pay for it, then you get trumps for the leader.
That proves that you love the leader if you're paying for your pornography.
Whereas if you're just...
You know, if you're one of those clever Internet pirates that just turns on the free porn faucet.
Well, that's cheating.
And whips himself up a whole gallon of porn tea.
And you turn on the spigot and you fill up the teapot and you drink all night to your own merriment.
And occlusions as well.
Some people have massive occlusions after taking on Internet porn tea.
Oh, that's what they say.
That's all up in the air.
It's like violence in video games.
What they say sometimes is true.
What they say is true sometimes.
Well, but there actually is not that much connection.
It just...
For people who love the feeling of righteous indignation, pornography on the Internet is terrible and causes crimes.
And one quarter of all college girls will be raped.
But those things are actually not...
Not true.
And vaccines don't cause autism.
Video games don't cause more violence.
Obama did not invent ISIS.
Oh, tomorrow is the big circus show.
Well, tomorrow in our time frame.
Oh, yeah, the circus show.
Yeah.
By the time the other stations get the CD of this show, there'll be a second circus show coming on.
Yeah, the circus...
The elephants will have already shat.
Right.
Oh.
I've hit the delay dump button more times this show than almost ever in my life.
I think I brought the wrong CD in.
The Internet listeners and the other station listeners won't hear that delay dump.
But the folks in Cleveland had to hear it a couple of times.
But I think that you can say that because it's past tense.
They're going to change it to Trillay Trump.
Trillay?
Yeah, Trillay Trump instead of delay dump.
That's the censor button.
In this station, when you push it, you hear the guy say,
Inappropriate!
After a long guitar riff.
A long guitar riff.
Well, you have to have a long guitar riff because it has to be able to cover a jabbering ninny.
Or a tape that you failed to use the right file.
Or a woman with a spoon balled in her head.
Right.
What you see, G?
Well, sir, I don't know what I see.
A snail.
The nexus of pi has been re-regurgitated from your cerebral cortex.
Your pineal gland has turned into a mist, which you can vaporize and drink slowly on a Saturday afternoon if you feel like it.
That stage has taken everybody's minds and thrown them out in the driveway and jumped up and down on them and spat on them and stuff.
Yeah.
And standed on them for long periods of time.
And now it makes me want to cry.
I feel like Annie Oakley.
I feel like Annie Oakley in the rain without a gun.
Not being able to shoot nothing.
You know how I feel.
Oh, impotent.
Not able to shoot nothing.
Terrible.
Yeah.
So frustrating.
A snail crawling along the edge of a straight razor.
Oh.
A snail crawling along the edge of a straight razor.
Nothing for me.
Oh, this.
Oh.
A horror.
A horror.
Oh, I thought you were trying to do Frank Sinatra in the groove tube.
That's right.
Yeah.
I had to hold my mouth in a really funny position to do that.
I can't unhear that.
There's actually quoting Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now for you non-movie fans.
Just because it's fun to talk like Marlon Brando.
He makes a funny face.
He does it too.
You're going to need to adjust your hearing aid a little bit if you want to talk like Marlon Brando.
But if you want to talk like an early Marlon Brando, you can't do them right now.
It was the old bald, fat Marlon Brando.
Weemaw Maw, that's Princess Weez Maw, believes that she talked to Marlon Brando on shortwave when he lived in Tahiti.
She used to be a shortwave buff.
Yeah.



She just sat and scanned those airwaves.
And one evening, she got in a conversation with somebody.
And after a while, she realized it was probably Marlon Brando in his little island place that he had.
Not the same one that is in that movie, Island of Dr. Moreau, although that would be pretty cool.
Or the same one featured in the Meet Me on the Bounty.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
That was near Tahiti and was Tahati.
Tahati.
Tahati.
There's a lot of Tahatis in Tahiti.
I can think of another rhyme, but I can't do it on WCSB before 10 o'clock.
There's Tukulis, too.
Tukulis?
Mm-hmm.
You mean the indigent laborers who carry people's rickshaws around and argue with the denizens?
Jays.
Oh, well, then in that case, all's forgiven.
You can go back home now.
Everybody stand clear of the windows.
We're doing a shock.
We're doing a shock reading, and it should only take a few seconds.
So in Mutiny on the Bounty, when the ship pulls up to the island and the natives run out, the ladies all had tops on.
But in the movie Hawaii, they pull up to Hawaii for the first time, and all the ladies run out topless.
That was in a Hollywood movie from the early 70s, I think.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.


Why was it that it was okay for them to be topless?
Because they were brown.
That's what I think.
Mm-hmm.
It's like that show Roots.
It was okay to show naked breasts if they were slave breasts because, you know, that's the way things really were.
Well, somehow—
They're not really people.
If it was—
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's one of those double standards.
It's like, to the average—
There were some great standards on that one girl, speaking of double standards.
Man.
Yeah.
When you just think of the great—
Yeah.

You think of them, they think of such people as like animals would be the same as showing a dog's breast.
I don't want to be with a dog kitty.
Well, that was the Hollywood thought at the time, I guess.
You know, it was—
Well, you know, back in the day, it was legal to show breastages in documentaries, and hence there were a whole lot of National Enquirer talks about breastfeeding.
This kind of appeared to me like kind of Notre Dame type documentary movies, Mondo, Connie, and so forth, because, well, we're just showing the way these primitive people, these tribal people, live with their boobs hanging out.
I know it's shameful.
No one really wants to see this, but that's the way the world really is, out there in some uncivilized places.
And then you have a kiff-s voll.
A what?
Kiff-s voll.
A sigh like Kif does.
She's quoting that character on the cartoon show Futurama, which we heard a lot of Kif sighs at the beginning of the show after the Trump-Branigan.
So, yeah.
Well, tomorrow night, in the future, in another network, on another planet, there is then a vast debate between the contrarians.
There's Greenstein.
No, there's no Greenstein.
They kept Greenstein out of there.
Greenstein's not allowed to speak because Greenstein didn't get enough votes.
Greenstein had to go back to the laboratory and be disassembled.
And did the Libertarian also have to go to the laboratory?
Both.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
Both Greenstein and Steingreen.
Both had to.
They didn't get enough numbers.
They don't get to talk.
Well, when they do talk, they tend to say kind of dumb things.
Like Aleppo.
What's that?
And what was the one today?
Oh, they do?
Yeah.
One.
Oh, yeah.

It was like, well, climate change.
What do you think about that, Mr. Johnson?
And it was, he goes, well, we need to get off this planet.
That's why we have to go to outer space, because climate change.
Well, nothing about fixing things.
It was all, oh, well, let's just use this planet up and go to the next one.
That's a great Libertarian science idea.
So, what are you going to do?
It's monsters everywhere you look.
Clintonsteins, Greensteins, Steingreens.
And President Johnson.
And, oh.
Rumpelstiltskin.
Oh, yeah.
I didn't know that that was a twirl.
Yeah, Rumpelstiltskin.
They're all over the place.
I'm the golden stare.
That's what Rumpelstiltskin used to say to the maiden in the tower.
She would ask her to roll down her hair.
And then we could vote for an independent.
Independent candidate.
Well, when we get to Texas, I'm going to get to work on my new phase of my career.
One new phase is to spend fewer than two whole days on this weekly show,
so I can get some other things done.
I've got all these videos.
Your book, Neighbor World, has to get published by the Subgenius Foundation.
So, friends, stay tuned.
We'll see more of that.
But for now, believe it or not, Dave,
it's just about the end of the show.
I can't believe it's gone so quickly.
Well, it's because the song that refuses to die refuses to die.
And it's about to come back.
I can smell it coming.
I can smell it, too.
I can smell it all the way here.
Here, I'll leave you on, okay?
I'll leave you on.
We'll try to kill it.
Let's try to kill it, okay?
Oh, no.
There it is.
There it is.
There it is.
There it is.
There it is.
There it is.
There it is.
There it is.
There it is.
Let's see.
Oh, man.
I hated putting shovels, I hated putting shovels in the shovels.
So gross!
I hated doing that.
I hated fucking up that, that shovel and I, I, I felt, I felt sorry for it.
It never had a set off and it kept sinking!
It would not die!
It still would die!
Look at it!
It's disgusting!
It's just driving the world in pain!
But it's still a song!
A painful song, yes.
An unseemly song.
And an immortal song!
That's the whole song from now on!
What a moment!
It's still not dead.
You thought it was dead.
They tried to kill it so hard and it wouldn't die.
Like that, that's the nature of it.
I don't know about it.
It's like it was dead.
This song that never ended must have been.
It's the end.
A song that refused to die has to die.
It's still one.
But only for a second!
And then it'll just keep on surging on.
We know it will.
That's what songs do.
They just keep on throbbing on.
So...
I know it will!
I have a flabbery and moist.
It's just, every, every blood vessel in my nurturing hectic park is just,

come undone.
Oh no.
I wish this song would just dry up and croak.
Everybody wishes that.
It's caused enough consternation over the last four weeks to wish I could just kill it with my own hands.
But how could I?
Because it's only a recording.
Well, that's what, no, well, yes and no.
The song that refuses to die is everywhere.
It is.
Sometimes it mimics, uh, a car, the sound of a car crash.
Or a drawer full of silverware hitting the floor.
Or the whiter dropping the plates.
Those are the songs that refuse to die also.
A box of mice causes consternation among the elderly as well.
Or four or five people breaking wind simultaneously.
That's a nasty song, man.
Especially if they're trying to make, you know, great, great, great sailing ships move quickly.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That's a heckle way to make a sailing boat go, though.
This is the part I always liked, though.
With poofterism.
White poofterism?
Yes, with poofterism.
There's also blue poofterism, too, which is very dangerous.
Yes, I know, I know.
Cosmos plug by balls.
You can't see where you're going.
Unless you've already been born.
I've never been there before.
