1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
On the floor.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,920
The self-genius.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,600
Power of swatching.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,480
Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,960
Lying down on the floor.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,240
The fun is over.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:28,080
Oh, incidentally, friends, the next 30 minutes of the show was all done yesterday by Reverend Susie the Floozy.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,720
Praise Susie.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,160
The fact that some other civilizations are more advanced than we are may be humbling.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,040
You don't understand how we live here.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,180
You're an alien!

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,060
That's the way I am.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,300
You know what would happen if they found out your visa had expired?

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,740
Uh, I...

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,180
Yeah.

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,860
It exists, and it's being kept secret by the same vested interests who control our destiny.

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:59,400
The aim of the game is a world government comprising members of the cabal who are elected by no one and accountable to no one.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,320
And what are they up to?

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,960
I don't know.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,840
Tomorrow morning I want you to start working on a completely new project.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,480
What is the nature of this project?

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,760
Uh, I...

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,240
Yeah.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,340
Who are these vested interests?

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Who are you?

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,740
Who?

27
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,080
Who?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,860
Whatever, man.

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:27,400
Well, the cabal comprises the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderbergers...

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,140
Mmm, burgers.

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:38,260
...the International Banking Cartel, the Oil Cartel, members of various intelligence organizations, and select members of the military union,

32
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,500
who together have become a shadow government of much of the Western world.

33
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,420
And the plan is well advanced.

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,820
Where did you hear about Project X, Dr. Hendricks?

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,700
Oh, I heard a couple of your younger boys saying something about it.

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,080
Starting tomorrow.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,120
Oh, well, we're embarking on some sort of space program.

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,200
Space program? What for?

39
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,280
Space. It's freedom. You know what I mean?

40
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,120
Yes, I do.

41
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,820
Carry on.

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,540
They told me it was something very secret. That's right, Dr. Hendricks. It is an extremely secret research project.

43
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,960
Then there's the job itself. It entails certain, uh...

44
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,060
Well, you won't live in quite the same way as I do.

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,620
I know you did before.

46
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,500
I know this is what I want.

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,640
I hope so.

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,040
The salary was terrific, Steve.

49
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,460
Blood, whips, and guns. Or dollars. Take your choice.

50
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,380
I'm not sure.

51
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,500
I want the total figure of two of the nearest fifty million dollars.

52
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,500
Oh, that's not so much.

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,940
I'll offer you ten percent of my net profit.

54
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,680
Yes.

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,800
That's terrible.

56
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,880
Plus five percent of your corporate profits.

57
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,020
No, I don't think so.

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,660
I don't need your help, Steve.

59
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,520
Huh? Good. This is what I want.

60
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,560
Bob grinned.

61
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,060
I want it.

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,440
You want some kind of space, Bob?

63
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,060
No.

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,860
Yes, I do.

65
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,280
No.

66
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,680
I thought that you were applying me to help the project.

67
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,060
Bob's smile vanished.

68
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,640
I realize you've made certain assumptions about me.

69
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,020
Yeah.

70
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,860
I want you to think beyond that.

71
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,680
Is there no chance, though?

72
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,220
Of course there is a chance.

73
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,940
They looked at each other.

74
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,360
My interest is energy.

75
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,960
Transparency of energy.

76
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,420
Transparency of energy.

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:18,780
Yes.

78
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,940
Abandon all hope.

79
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,040
You who enter here.

80
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,240
I should have told you about my new project.

81
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,240


82
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,240


83
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,240


84
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,240


85
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,240


86
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,280
And it was the strangest thing.

87
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,900
It was amazing.

88
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,740
You turn to Bob.

89
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,700
Did you like it?

90
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,760
Not much.

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,620
You're lying.

92
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,920
Maybe he's not.

93
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,900
I know him.

94
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,500
Look at his face.

95
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,200
He's lying.

96
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,900
And then there was suppressed laughter.

97
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,320
I don't trust him.

98
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,340
Yes, Bob!

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,000
Who else am I talking about?

100
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,840
This man is obviously a psychotic.

101
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,980
The third nostril.

102
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,060
I'm not sure about that.

103
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,060


104
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,060


105
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,060


106
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,060


107
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,460
That whistling sound makes me sick.

108
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,720
All right, Bob is my only hope.

109
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,900
I think he's dangerous.

110
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,340
But please don't suppose I'm dangerous because I'm unfamiliar.

111
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,040
I ask that you believe in me.

112
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,120
As what?

113
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,740
As a friend of yours, your town, of all human beings.

114
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,220
That's all I'm taking from you.

115
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,420
Get back here, you jackal!

116
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,880
He should be destroyed.

117
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,620
Destroyed?

118
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,460
Yes, for our safety.

119
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,040
So I hear all the gossip, you know.

120
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,780
He got busted by the feds, numerous times.

121
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,880
Sure, sure.

122
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,940
Who are they?

123
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,380
Really?

124
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:30,760
Yeah.

125
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,240
Whoa, that's amazing.

126
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,320
Okay, okay.

127
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,560
Somebody should sue your ass for copyright.

128
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,360
You're under arrest!

129
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,960
You know you're my hero.

130
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,260
I've spent ten years getting ready for this day.

131
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,800
That is, if we don't let other forces destroy us before that time.

132
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,960
What other forces?

133
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,060
Never mind that now.

134
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,320
As if on cue.

135
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,600
I want to go home.

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,280
Well, not yet.

137
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,340
I want to go home.

138
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,260
Are you still now?

139
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,320
Help me!

140
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,640
Not later than 7am of July 5th.

141
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,360
It's too long.

142
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,860
Why is it too long?

143
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,080
Such nonsense.

144
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,620
Selling things to people who don't want them.

145
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,060
That's how a scam works!

146
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,060
I want to go home.

147
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,020
But please do not.

148
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,300
But this is a scam on a global scale!

149
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,180
Do you f***ing get me now?

150
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,360
Like a child.

151
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,100
Yeah, beautiful.

152
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:21,760
It's wonderful.

153
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,380
It's good.

154
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,760
Put his hands over his ears.

155
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,500
Blah, blah, blah.

156
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,320
I can't wait till that Bob-time train comes around the bend.

157
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,700
Make the man wish he had a third nostril.

158
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,680
Oh, look out, son.

159
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,220
Here it comes now.

160
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,220
We stand at a crossroads.

161
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,820
The tenuous slack that a subgenius may occasionally enjoy could be rent to shreds at any moment.

162
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,520
For the human puppets of the Elder Gods continue their senseless plunge into madness and anti-slack,

163
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,860
dragging us and our whole beloved planet ever closer to the brink of destruction,

164
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:07,540
be it by the nuclear kiss of Jehovah One, ecological disaster, or invasion by hostile aliens.

165
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,140
Which will it be?

166
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,800
Destruction of planet Earth, or eternal slack under the benevolent rule of Bob?

167
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,800
I don't know.

168
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,700
I don't know nothing of time like this.

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,300
We can't afford the luxury of thinking.

170
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,780
Hey, back off and give Bob some room to think.

171
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,580
You'll get to hear.

172
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,040
On the radio one day.

173
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,760
We hear most everything on the radio.

174
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,200
Turn something on.

175
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,140
I'm starting to think.

176
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:29,600
Click.

177
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,140
This is a Conor Brad's radio alert.

178
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,540
Normal broadcasting will be discontinued for an indefinite period.

179
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,200
Oh, Jesus! When you gonna cut me some slack, huh?

180
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,380
Does it worry you, Bob?

181
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,240
Ah!

182
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,580
Whoa!

183
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,760
Oh, my.

184
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,120
Yes?

185
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,560
Bob told me personally he will walk off this show to express himself freely.

186
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,240
Let him walk.

187
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,080
You want to make an omelet, you gotta break a cement.

188
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,960
What's going on here?

189
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
Bob, you're dead.

190
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,500
You're dead.

191
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,680
I mean it, Bob.

192
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,340
You're dead.

193
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,380
Yes!

194
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,180
And then he shut the door.

195
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,900
He can't do your nailing the damage as he did on the radio.

196
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,820
No, he can't.

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,400
Bob.

198
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,740
Hey, Bob.

199
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,760
Where you going?

200
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,100
I'm gonna get going.

201
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,360
Bob, don't leave me out here.

202
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,360
I wouldn't go too deep in the desert if I were you.

203
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,680
You might never come back.

204
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,480
In fact, maybe you better stay here with us till it's over.

205
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,740
Sorry, I gotta do this.

206
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,620
You come back here.

207
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,260
You idiots, you can't go down there.

208
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,800
You listen to me.

209
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,320
He went into the fields and into the towns and into the suburbs and gathered together

210
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,060
all those who despise pinks, perverts, and punks.

211
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,220
Silence, you perverts!

212
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,680
Bob, call for all of those that believe in his power to rise up and come to him.

213
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,720
Gather round.

214
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,860
They all turned to him as if they had been waiting for his voice and for that word.

215
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,820
High above.

216
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,820
He was naked.

217
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,600
He was naked.

218
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:51,600


219
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,060
He's got these eyes that like hypnotize you.

220
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,480
Whoa.

221
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,100
And then his thing.

222
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,420
It's huge.

223
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,140
It's like a rocket ship.

224
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,520
I dig.

225
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:01,920
Dig.

226
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,080
Time is running out on that big LP called life.

227
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,960
And the greatest disc jockey of them all is gonna come and take us by the hand and lead

228
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,200
us to the flip side of life called eternity.

229
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,280
Eternity.

230
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,640
I know all things beginning, end, and eternity.

231
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,620
Yeah, but before we grew that final date.

232
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,880
Before we head for that last eight bars.

233
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,160
We gotta make our peace.

234
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,500
Make it, Daddy.

235
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,300
Make it, Daddy.

236
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,760
Make it, Daddy.

237
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,300
Make it, Daddy.

238
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,720
You know I'm gonna make it.

239
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,560
And I want you cats to listen to everything I'm gonna lay on you as of this point.

240
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,440
Number one, thou shall not blow thy minds on school nights.

241
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,860
You're a very devout group.

242
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,900
Where'd you ever find?

243
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,180
I'm on a mailing list.

244
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,640
It's the church of the month club.

245
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,420
Number two, the pipe.

246
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:50,600
The pipe.

247
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:50,600


248
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:50,600


249
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:50,600


250
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,480
The pipe.

251
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,760
You're gonna really love this one.

252
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,920
It was a promise for anyone who smokes.

253
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,440
Will you teach us how to smoke?

254
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,640
Sure I will.

255
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,460
Sure.

256
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,840
Can I go first?

257
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,000
First what?

258
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,120
No, Susie.

259
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:03,900
Shut up.

260
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,820
I hope you're not claustrophobic.

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,280
Why?

262
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,840
Because it is sinful.

263
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,320
Hmm.

264
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,940
Oh, well.

265
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,940
Bob's smile vanished.

266
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,140
So I suggest if anybody's holding, drop it.

267
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,680
Drop her.

268
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,000
Ow.

269
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,240
Before the fuzz arrives.

270
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:16,720
Ugh.

271
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,040


272
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,440
Hello?

273
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,000
Hello?

274
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,680
Hello?

275
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:19,860
Hello?

276
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,600
Hello, 700 tomorrow?

277
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,620
Good evening, guys.

278
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,160
Great.

279
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,020
I'm Italian.

280
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,580
Hey, yeah.

281
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,680
We get a bar.

282
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:24,900
Yeah.

283
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,700
We get a bar.

284
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,500
All right, boys.

285
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:26,840
Goodnight.

286
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,440
Good night.

287
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:28,740
Good night.

288
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,180
Good night.

289
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,200


290
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,220
Good night.

291
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,360


292
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,180
Seeing the cards.

293
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,520
I see things.

294
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,260
He sees things.

295
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,460
What's this?

296
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,080
What?

297
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,020
Is that a little rocket ship of yours?

298
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,560
I don't mean that unkindly.

299
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,060
Ah!

300
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,680
Ah!

301
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,700
My ticket is open ended.

302
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,660
And my work here is never...

303
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:49,880
Never done.

304
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,300
Bob's eyes shot to him swiftly.

305
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,820
He was not smiling.

306
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,640
It's too late for this spooky .

307
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,700
It gets old.

308
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,960
I'm not gonna go back to bed.

309
00:09:59,460 --> 00:09:59,940
Bob!

310
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,920
Take a social sleep.

311
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,740
Tonight's the night.

312
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,940
Tonight's the night they come.

313
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,900
It's a freak show.

314
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,480
Do you believe in UFOs?

315
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,900
We believe that the alien will come and land on our landing pad that we are going to build.

316
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,880
It's a structure that we're trying to raise funds for.

317
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,240
So far we have about...

318
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:19,660


319
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,600
And there are people and guests and they believe that they were abducted by aliens

320
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,860
and taken to Mars or whatever they call their alien planet.

321
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:32,840
Yeah!

322
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,160
What do you think?

323
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,400
Do you believe in UFOs?

324
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,460
Oh yeah.

325
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,020
Yes sir.

326
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,640
Definitely.

327
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,700
They're out there man.

328
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,360
I've seen them.

329
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,040
I've been out there.

330
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,920
Aurora, Texas.

331
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,240
They got them little graves and stuff.

332
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,460
Yeah.

333
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,620
I've been out there and...

334
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,260
I don't know.

335
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm planning a trip.

336
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,540
We're going out to like Arizona or something.

337
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,020
We're not Arizona.

338
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,880
What was it?

339
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,960
Yeah.

340
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,740
It was Arizona, right?

341
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,200
The Air Force One where they found all that stuff.

342
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,400
I got pictures man.

343
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,080
I've seen them.

344
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,120
They're out there man.

345
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,820
And I'm flying in the plane.

346
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,020
I'm always hallucinating.

347
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,840
But who really knows what I'm looking at.

348
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,620
You know what I'm saying?

349
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,440
It's July.

350
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,440
Yeah.

351
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:06,920
July.

352
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,200
We can't wait for alien explorers to solve all our problems.

353
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,700
Do you believe in UFOs?

354
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,700
There's no such thing as UFOs.

355
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,060
Hold on.

356
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,360
I'm really lost now.

357
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,000
Radiation must have affected his mind.

358
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,740
Face it.

359
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,340
It's a mutation of this new atomic world of ours.

360
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,580
I'm no UFO freak.

361
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,320
If that's what you mean.

362
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,560
No.

363
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,300
He's a freak.

364
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,540
He's a freak.

365
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,520
He's really a freak.

366
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,360
What?

367
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,920
I don't mean that unkindly.

368
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,040
I like freaks.

369
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,340
That's why I like you.

370
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,580
Shut up freak.

371
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,200
Mmm.

372
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,880
Lord I love freaks.

373
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,540
Freak.

374
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,280
Freak.

375
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,340
Freak.

376
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,840
Freak.

377
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,100
Freak.

378
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,380
Freak.

379
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,700
Freak.

380
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:41,920
Freak.

381
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,160
Freak.

382
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,380
Freak.

383
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,720
Freak.

384
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:42,920
Freak.

385
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,060
Let the freak out begin.

386
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,540
Freak out.

387
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,420
Freak out.

388
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,380
Freak out.

389
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,100
Freak out.

390
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,920
Freak out.

391
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,700
Freak out.

392
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,480
Freak out.

393
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,380
Freak out.

394
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,320
Freak Out.

395
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,180
Freak Out.

396
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,800
Freak out!

397
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,120
Freak out.

398
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,120


399
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,120


400
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,120


401
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,800
Freak Out.

402
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,840
Freak Out.

403
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,580
Freak Out.

404
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:02,740
Freak Out.

405
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,500
Freak Out.

406
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,100
Freak Out.

407
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,100


408
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,340
Freak Out.

409
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,240
Unless your space base close to mine

410
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,480
Love

411
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,080
Freak out

412
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,600
Moon age daydream

413
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,260
Oh yeah

414
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,380
Freak out

415
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,620
Freak out

416
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,660
Freak out

417
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,520
Freak out

418
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,260
Freak out

419
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,620
On the morning of the 15th

420
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,080
On a certain day called X

421
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,800
The sun came up at 6.45

422
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,500
This is a Conorrad radio alert

423
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,780
Set official broadcast on the 5th

424
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,220
There is no cause for alarm

425
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,740
Ah crap is that the time

426
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,700
Time to get out

427
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,240
Logan the engineer had known this would be the end of the journey

428
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,480
7am July 15th

429
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,820
David Bowie

430
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,240
Alright

431
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,980
Come on give me another hour

432
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,480
Oh

433
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,220
Oh

434
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,640
Oh

435
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,540
Rise and shine

436
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,240
Rise and shine

437
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,300
Alright

438
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,980
Bob

439
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
Get up

440
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,700
Get up

441
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,840
Logan stood looking down

442
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,060
Bob lying casually on the floor

443
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,100
Eyes closed

444
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,560
Smile on his face

445
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,280
Conscious of nothing but slack

446
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,660
Bob

447
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,980
Come on Bob get up

448
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,840
Bob

449
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,660
Get up

450
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,940
Come on

451
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,900
Bob

452
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,020
Bob

453
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,480
Bob

454
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,940
Bob

455
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,220
Bob

456
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,700
Come

457
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,800
No no no

458
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,120
No

459
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,060
Bob

460
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,080
Oh

461
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,580
Wake up Portland it's a wonderful day

462
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,140
The time is 7

463
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,000
It is

464
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,420
Later

465
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,120
Than

466
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,700
You

467
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:15,500
Of course that's just the start

468
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,620
Of course that's just the start

469
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:16,620


470
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,600
of golden age

471
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:46,600


472
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:46,600


473
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:46,600


474
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:46,600


475
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:46,600


476
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:46,600


477
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:46,600


478
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:46,600


479
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,680
We're all going to die.

480
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,320
Then came the French purposeless movement of people.

481
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,900
People running out, running to one another, clattering in panic.

482
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,040
Armed forces blocking off the entrances to the city,

483
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,000
and we will take necessary precautions to ensure nobody leaves until we can contain this pandemic.

484
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,420
Or at least...

485
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,920
State and county police have set up an effective roadblock diverting traffic.

486
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,440
Keep your radio tuned to this frequency.

487
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,340
Remember, there is a traffic plan for the evacuation of the city.

488
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,560
All cars in the downtown area must follow the green lights.

489
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,940
They will lead you out of the danger area by the quickest route.

490
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,720
Do not try to cross the flow of traffic.

491
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,300
No!

492
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,520
This is the United States Army.

493
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,000
Civil defense is not apart from normal city functioning.

494
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,580
The same utilities involved in caring for...

495
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,800
the city in peace are those equipped to care for her in an emergency.

496
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,400
Great.

497
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,640
And when the siren sounds, each man knows his responsibility.

498
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,140
And now I would like a brief situation report from all departments on how we stand.

499
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,620
At the operations center, with time running out, only facts are considered.

500
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,400
Let's face facts, gentlemen.

501
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,840
There is this incident involving Vaseline.

502
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,500
Oh, my...

503
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,160
Oh, man.

504
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,020
That's ugly.

505
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,580
He did not have to continue.

506
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,580
It's based on fact.

507
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,860
Uh, Chief Simpson.

508
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,020
Oh, crap!

509
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,140
It's on fire!

510
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,660
Oh!

511
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,100
It's not fair!

512
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,040
Dr. Robert Slack.

513
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,540
We have constructed a mass deanimation facility and have nearly completed cleansing the region.

514
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,400
Witnesses have been located and silenced.

515
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,320
Local police have been supplied the misinformation outlined in film RT-514,

516
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,580
and it is being distributed to the...

517
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,300
to the area citizens.

518
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,100
It has been confirmed that four of these Soviet spies have direct involvement

519
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,560
and may be carrying on their work to spread airborne toxins.

520
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,700
These subjects have been captured, and information is being extracted.

521
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,860
It's not too bad.

522
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,860
I didn't even know about this.

523
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,780
I wasn't aware.

524
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,100
As the reports continue, it is obvious that the plan is working smoothly.

525
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,680
The place is torn to pieces.

526
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,120
They're asking for fire equipment, police equipment, and ambulances.

527
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:13,860
Okay.

528
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,180


529
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,440
Okay.

530
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,440


531
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:15,980
Okay.

532
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,260
and county courthouse are wrecked. Bob's staff find an undamaged office in the county jail

533
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,040
and go to work by flashlight. Watch your feet. I think his head is out there.

534
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,820
We've found parts of the bodies here. We've found parts of all the bodies,

535
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,460
but we've got to go back and hunt for some more. Oh, I'm keeping it. Oh,

536
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,740
I thought I dreamt that part.

537
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:18,100
I'm supposed to tell anybody about the secret of the man, but they're doing the whole world

538
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,780
anyway. So the man got pissed off and...

539
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:30,920
Our way of life has come to an end. The greater powers are coming to invade us.

540
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:38,040
Our way of life shall come to an end. They are at the door. Our time has come.

541
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,180
Oh, okay.

542
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,020
Is anyone here not a downer? Anyone?

543
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,980
And now, with a moment to breathe, it's time to be alone and think of the future.

544
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,260
All right, a show of hands. How many of you are suicidal?

545
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,660
No, I got nothing to live for. All right.

546
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,080
Wow. A lot. Okay, now...

547
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,120
God, you're so stupid. Don't you know anything about UFOs?

548
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,400
Wait a second. You think this is a UFO?

549
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,460
Cute.

550
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,300
So kind.

551
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,600
Space ship, right?

552
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,340
What the hell?

553
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,920
It's a rocket ship.

554
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,520
13, 12, 11.

555
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,060
Can you imagine the cost of that?

556
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,900
A spaceship?

557
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,080
Why the hell did they have to build this thing?

558
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,320
Stand by. It's such a waste. I don't know. It's such a waste of money.

559
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,800
Click.

560
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:33,920
Click.

561
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,660
Click.

562
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,420
akk l.

563
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,800
The matinng forums.

564
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,100
It's the end. It's the beginning.

565
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,060
Bob answered.

566
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,160
For a moment, they looked at each other as if neither could believe the other's reality.

567
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,180
Bob pressed a button under one of the dials.

568
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,640
Click.

569
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,080
Click.

570
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,460
A rectangle of tensely bluish light appeared on the wall behind Bob

571
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:08,980
Soもし inducting葉

572
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,440
a television screen to produce another version

573
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:10,440


574
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:10,440


575
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,100
the images now to see.

576
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,320
How would you like to be watching television now?

577
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,640
The strangest thing about television is that it

578
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,600
just braves in space.

579
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,420
On Eyewitness America

580
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,740
Crisis. Day one.

581
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,300
What's happening?

582
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,220
Screaming basket faces.

583
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,140
All right!

584
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,980
Telegraph poles fell like matchsticks.

585
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,960
Farmhouses collapsed into chips.

586
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,400
City buildings went down as if slashed

587
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,780
by a single second's blow,

588
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,040
with no time for a sound to be heard

589
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,680
by the twisted bodies of the victims.

590
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,400
I'm told we have a live shot coming in.

591
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,260
Let's take a look at that.

592
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,640
Well, it's just been so crazy out here,

593
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,240
as you can imagine.

594
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,760
But about an hour ago,

595
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,720
and I never heard no explosion.

596
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,720
It's just I have a huge TV,

597
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,840
and I kept seeing all these strange colors.

598
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,300
And I thought,

599
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,740
I walked out the door about 18,

600
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,840
and it looked like you were looking at

601
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,360
Afghanistan,

602
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,800
and they just blowed up two or three buses.

603
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,120
And thank God,

604
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,760
she was the only one at home.

605
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,980
But she said,

606
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,280
all I remember was I had something in a frying pan.

607
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,740
Could have been chicken.

608
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,560
And she walked away and was gone

609
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,620
just a little bit too long.

610
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,540
And it sparked a set of paper towels,

611
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,240
and from there,

612
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,920
all Hades broke loose.

613
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,700
And when I walked out,

614
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,180
I swear to God,

615
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,140
if this gentleman can pan over to that tallest tree,

616
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,760
the fireball was as high as that tree.

617
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,980
So you saw it was actually a place?

618
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,020
Oh my God, yeah.

619
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,920
Well, what would you call that?

620
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,200
50 yards?

621
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,800
But the garage was already collapsed.

622
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,100
And this was before I even knew it was happening.

623
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,440
And then when I walked out to the yard,

624
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,380
there was like 15 fire trucks.

625
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:46,020
The bedroom part of the house was collapsing.

626
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,740
And then,

627
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,480
boom,

628
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,420
the fireball went

629
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:59,680
the size of the house and up about 80 feet.

630
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,360
And thank God,

631
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,040
Tony wasn't home.

632
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:12,080
And she managed to get out of the house.

633
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,140
Can you hear what they were asking you to say?

634
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,900
Yes, ma'am.

635
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,200
But I didn't actually come in contact with her

636
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,820
until approximately two minutes after the fact.

637
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,040
And obviously, she was in a state of hysteria.

638
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,780
And,

639
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,740
they had a little dog,

640
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,840
and I'm really afraid the dog didn't make it,

641
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,160
but I don't know that.

642
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,060
Well, you're very welcome.

643
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,000
I mean, what's your name?

644
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,380
Jessica.

645
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,240
You're a very, very beautiful young lady.

646
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,420
We'll have more updates on that coming up.

647
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:50,820
But right now,

648
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,580
Dr. Bob from the Center of Disease Control

649
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,380
has some informative advice for people in the Red Zone.

650
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:55,960
Gentlemen,

651
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,780
a series of alarming events.

652
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,040
As documented in film RT 515,

653
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,420
the heretofore unknown plague.

654
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,040
The precise cause is still under investigation.

655
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,240
Victims of this plague exhibited advancing necrosis,

656
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,780
followed by clinical death.

657
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,880
Researchers from Department 37

658
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,840
are investigating the body's ability

659
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,820
to remain animated after death.

660
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,080
The only permanent solution appears to be incineration.

661
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,400
Scientists have found that applying fire to the bodies

662
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,380
and burning them to ash relieves symptoms

663
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,400
and ceases muscular animation.

664
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,880
Burying the animated bodies

665
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,500
did not offer a viable solution,

666
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,480
as they were able to claw their way free of the soil.

667
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,320
Oh, my God.

668
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,820
Your world is .

669
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,480
Yeah.

670
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,680
I don't want to live in this world anymore.

671
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,600
I don't.

672
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,740
I am going.

673
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,280
I am moving to Jupiter.

674
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,640
I cannot stay here.

675
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,380
Hey!

676
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,820
I am going to Jupiter.

677
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,560
Bye-bye.

678
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,260
Yeah.

679
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,460
So,

680
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,240
that.

681
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,640
Too late.

682
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,000
The day called X reaches its climax.

683
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,700
Ooh, hot, yeah.

684
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,860
Oh, yeah.

685
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,840
That's hot.

686
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,640
That is hot.

687
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,640
Bob grinned.

688
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,340
That's that.

689
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,680
He turned again to the sight of the Earth

690
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,160
tearing open before him.

691
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,260
Now I am become Death,

692
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,560
the destroyer of worlds.

693
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,460
How many times have I heard that before?

694
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,660
Tommy?

695
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,500
Tommy?

696
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:28,660
Tommy?

697
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,360
Tommy!

698
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,300
Tommy-

699
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,920
Yes.

700
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,860
Ah, yes.

701
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,760
Susie the Floozy did all that collage work we just heard.

702
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,260
How does she do it?

703
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,420
She did that just for X-Day.

704
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,880
How in the world does she do it?

705
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,800
And because this is the last show ever for, well.

706
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,200
It's not as if we didn't warn them again and again.

707
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:32,880
We tried because any human creature who could be saved would naturally be, well, on our side.

708
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,540
But it seems we ran into some kind of natural limit.

709
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,340
Many are called, but few are chosen.

710
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:51,500
Some plants are saved, but others are thrown with the tears into the furnace of ultimate destruction.

711
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,820
Cool.

712
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,060
Cool.

713
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,040
Cool.

714
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,460
And death where the worm dieth not.

715
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,380
Surrounded by infernal sights of crawling vertiginous horror.

716
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:12,080
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades where peace and rest can never dwell.

717
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,220
Hope never comes that comes to all but torture without end.

718
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:23,920
Still urges and a fiery deluge fed with ever burnings.

719
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,340
Suffer unconsumed.

720
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,520
So don't say we didn't warn you, because that's what's coming.

721
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,360
Only the elect will be saved.

722
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,300
I've got my ticket.

723
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,920
I'm going to be on the saucer.

724
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,660
How about you?

725
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,080
Well, friends, as you can tell, Dr. Howell is in the house.

726
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:42,600
That's me.

727
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,500
But you can't ask him anything.

728
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,160
Why?

729
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,140
Not yet.

730
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,100
Not to know.

731
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,980
Well, Dave can.

732
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,020
You have to be a member of the elect.

733
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,060
And who elected him?

734
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,680
I guess he, well, he's, yeah.

735
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,340
Well, in half an hour, Dr. Sinister's show will be on and we won't leave.

736
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,220
Then we can ask Dr. Howell.

737
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,540
That would be somewhat embarrassing.

738
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:10,100
And if you come to 17X Day at Wisteria, you'll be able to ask Johnny Depp.

739
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,080
He's taken over for Dr. Howell.

740
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,780
Yes, I've retired upward.

741
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:24,080
Johnny Depp thinks he can save his sorry epidermis at X Day by performing some menial duty that I used to have to do.

742
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,360
I let him persist in that illusion.

743
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,980
But as far as I can say here, between you and me in the gatepost, he has had his reward already.

744
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,860
In this world.

745
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,380
Well, he's got to make up for that stupid Tonto routine.

746
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,700
Yeah, that was a little bit hard.

747
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,860
Dave is going to be calling any second now.

748
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:53,780
And I wanted to say that although Susie prepared all that intense collage stuff last week, all night.

749
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,660
And all day.

750
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,180
Arthritically.

751
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,140
Hunched over.

752
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,780
Working her wonderful butt off.

753
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:12,220
She had originally made that thing an hour long and it was all interspersed with David Bowie song covers that were really terrible.

754
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,700
And I removed those.

755
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:20,440
So really what you heard was a bastardized Susie the floozy edit.

756
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,140
You said a bad word.

757
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,760
Yeah, I had to remove the.

758
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,540
The bad David Bowie covers.

759
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:30,140
Or it would have taken longer than an hour of slack.

760
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,160
And we'd never have room for you or me or Dave.

761
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Goes on under the covers.

762
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,980
Sure.

763
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,360
You know, some sacrifice is necessary.

764
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:47,080
Particularly the unwitting victims we dragged to our altar at X day.

765
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,200
Yeah, I was going to say, other people should sacrifice.

766
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,660
We...

767
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,720
Have to...

768
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,780
Too much slack for sacrifice.

769
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,060
It's been developed.

770
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,560
A cultivated faculty.

771
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,300
And my slack is swollen.

772
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,760
Eons of time.

773
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,100
And I have developed it to a high degree, if I may say so.

774
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,420
I am perfectly, completely impervious to physical pain.

775
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,640
Not my own, you understand, but other people's physical pain.

776
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:23,760
Of which one might expect there will be quite a lot at that little warp in the continuum known as X.

777
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,180
X day.

778
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,100
Well, according to the weatherman, we're in for pain.

779
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,960
Well, you don't need one of those to know where the wind blows.

780
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,140
Well, I'm like Kim Jong-un.

781
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,880
I want to behead the royal meteorologists because they've given us bad news.

782
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,380
They claim that this year will be just exactly like last year.

783
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:51,620
And that we'll be lashed and scourged with heat, wind, tornadoes, rain all night and all day.

784
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,060
Shh.

785
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,300


786
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,320
Apparently there is a small reef under which every subgenius may huddle.

787
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,780
No, it'll be much worse wind than that.

788
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,520
We had tornadoes last time.

789
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:12,680
And we're expecting earthquakes and right in the middle of a heat spell, a blizzard.

790
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,340
That would be just perfect.

791
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:21,960
Beware the all-dreaded lightning flash and the feared thunderstorm.

792
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,640
And lightning might strike again as it did before.

793
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,580
When we rehearsed for this time right in the center of our camp.

794
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,900
And the brilliant blast flowed down the hill to the grindhouse.

795
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,260
Where, miraculously, no subgenius was hurt.

796
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,000
Cue sound clip of lightning strike.

797
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,800
Don't worry, folks.

798
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,320
Oh, yeah, we put all that stuff in in post, right?

799
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:53,680
Yeah.

800
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,580
We'll put that lightning in.

801
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,840
I have it very handy.

802
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,860
Well, we need lightning also for our medical procedures the next day.

803
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,680
Particularly our persisting experiments in the reanimation of dead tissue.

804
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:15,880
First performed by Victor Frankenstein more than a century and a half ago at Ingolstadt University.

805
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,440
But now, here in our private field lab,

806
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,620
our shambling servants will attend.

807
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,620
And to our every need.

808
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,000
That sounds pretty sexy.

809
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,120
Back! Back! I created you! Back!

810
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,280
Oh, they get out of whack sometimes.

811
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,120
Only as a succotinium, as a substitute,

812
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,880
until we actually encounter the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses.

813
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,380
Is it just sex goddesses, Dr. Howell?

814
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,120
Well, that's good, because I was kind of nervous about them sex gods wanting to, you know,

815
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,180
sex me up in three ways or some kind of thing.

816
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,500
I don't know what these alien types are.

817
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,820
Well, they wouldn't do that, Ivan, unless, of course, it turned out that that was your secret wish,

818
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,020
because they penetrate to the center of all hearts

819
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,580
and know how to rip aside the veil covering the holy of holies,

820
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,420
your secret imaginative life of desire.

821
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,760
And that will be satisfied on the spot,

822
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,980
whether your conscious self will it or no,

823
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,020
because the secret...

824
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,100
Because...

825
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,100


826
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,100


827
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,100


828
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,520
The secrets of all hearts shall be made known

829
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,640
on that great day when the sea gives up its dead

830
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,320
and monsters walk the earth,

831
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:38,680
and in middle air the dreadful judge shall spread his throne.

832
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,440
Ah, yes.

833
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,460
And, you know, friends,

834
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:52,280
J.R. Bob Dobbs is like the Arnie Socknessium of your mind.

835
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,080
A great man.

836
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,580
He led the way to the center of your mind,

837
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,900
where there is a giant ocean full of dinosaurs and...

838
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,480
To a great man.

839
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,600
All kinds of cool stuff.

840
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,200
Giant mushrooms and...

841
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,060
Grow giant mushrooms in your cellar, kids.

842
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,660
And Pat Boone.

843
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,400
Yes.

844
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:09,940
Singing.

845
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:10,580
Right.

846
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,020
Yodeling.

847
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,080
No Boone to mankind there.

848
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,900
So step right up, ladies and gentlemen,

849
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,680
because we're going to reveal all.

850
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,000
It's too late for anyone to do anything about it.

851
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,580
Now you can understand what this...

852
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,440
Next day thing is going to be all about.

853
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,380
What is this?

854
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,220
What's happening?

855
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,920
Dave is calling, but you're not picking up.

856
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,800
Oh, Dave is calling.

857
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,960
Well, we'd better get him on the line.

858
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,740
Thank you for telling us, Princess Wee.

859
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,400
I haven't seen a...

860
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,460
No little red light came on.

861
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:38,860
A little light.

862
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,500
I haven't seen any kind of a...

863
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,280
No light.

864
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,000
Connection.

865
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,260
But rather darkness visible.

866
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,180
Oh, no.

867
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,240
No light?

868
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,080
Right.

869
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,580
No little light came on.

870
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,800
I've been sitting here waiting to catch Dave's call,

871
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,020
but apparently he's been...

872
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,520
Oh, look.

873
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,980
Now, Dave.

874
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,440
Dave is here.

875
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,380
Regular old experience.

876
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,220
Oh, I can hear your nostrils all the way out here.

877
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,440
There he is.

878
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,240
There he is.

879
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,040
And there you are.

880
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,600
Yes.

881
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,840
Man of Earth.

882
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,640
Sympathetic crew of...

883
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,220
Welcome.

884
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,920
Underweight, over-aged, over-militarized, hyper-industrialized...

885
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,160
Say, I take that personally.

886
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,740
...superfans.

887
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:19,400
I'm a spring chicken as far as some of these semi-immortal subs go.

888
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,620
Immortal culture, yeah.

889
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,560
Yeah, you know.

890
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,720
They give us the zap, the jolt, which keeps us going from century to century.

891
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,660
But sometimes it just gets tiresome,

892
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,660
and you just want to lie down in a nice, soft grave and rest

893
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,640
while the storms of mortality rage overhead.

894
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,300
Except you have to claw your way out through the mulch and the hummus,

895
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,800
which I understand now people eat,

896
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:48,520
in order to join the living at their pastimes.

897
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,600
Oh, yeah, that's what...

898
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,480
Oh.

899
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:51,940
Hi.

900
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:51,980


901
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,540
What are you guys talking about?

902
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,080
I had to go...

903
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,660
Oh, he's just talking about...

904
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,260
I had to go talk to Bob for a minute.

905
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,380
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

906
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,400
We get to walk around in broad daylight without disintegrating

907
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,380
because we put our native earth in our shoes underneath the soles.

908
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,020
It's an old...

909
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,740
And in or underpants.

910
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,620
That's right.

911
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,180
I know that's...

912
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,680
Oh, no.

913
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,020
Hal.

914
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,140
Now, look.

915
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,360
I smoked that stuff that was in your shoe.

916
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,640
Well, that was part of my native soil.

917
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,280
Well, there ain't none left.

918
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,020
I smoked it all up last night.

919
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,260
You did?

920
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,660
There's plenty in the other...

921
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,160
Well, no, no.

922
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,180
I finished all the last stuff off this afternoon.

923
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,600
When the sun comes up tomorrow, Dr. Hal, you're going to be dead.

924
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,420
You're the reason this happened.

925
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,100
Look at this.

926
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,800
My left foot is converted into a cloven hoof.

927
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,160
We call it an acute...

928
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,380
Right while we're speaking.

929
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,600
Wow.

930
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,720
But I'll shake it out when I get back.

931
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,140
There's enough in the other...

932
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:40,340
Oh, no, man.

933
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:45,180
I think you ought to do a few foot selfies and they'll go viral like the rest of us.

934
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,960
It's irregular.

935
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:52,520
It gives me an irregular gait, and I want to look good for certain people at X-Day.

936
00:36:52,540 --> 00:37:04,200
Yes, I don't want to show myself in monstrous ugliness, but rather make the illusion stay for a few more hours and let them think all is well.

937
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,440
And then you...

938
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,400
Yeah, well, no, bandage it up real well.

939
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:07,980
Use a crutch.

940
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,800
No, bandages are a...

941
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,940
You can all hear these sympathetic noises from young ladies.

942
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,860
No, no, no.

943
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,780
They can see.

944
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,740
They've been there.

945
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:21,040
Bandages are a key, and so you really have to make a clean breast of things and just...

946
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,260
Well...

947
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:22,520
Well...

948
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,400
They know.

949
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,960
They're subgeniuses, so they know.

950
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,160
They can smell it with their third nostril or any other...

951
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,680
Well, I hope not.

952
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,140
Cleo Denial wears designer bandages.

953
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,220
Well, yes.

954
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,620
Her pop has a line on those things.

955
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,580
See, that's why I can't stand it is that you feed normans.

956
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,360
Yes, I...

957
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,060
And these others who...

958
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,360
Hate them.

959
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,640
The elitists of the crowd.

960
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,480
Crush them.

961
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,620
They are insignificant insects that deserve to be squashed.

962
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,360
Like pieces of little, little tiny pieces.

963
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,400
Or little tiny things crawling through under the roof.

964
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,720
But now to the hat of the inflicted.

965
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,040
Time?

966
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,880
Time to go.

967
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,540
And shoot them all with light.

968
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:13,260
Monsters, demons, many-headed things, and monstrous flapping creatures on black wings.

969
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,740
But also the regular guys and gals.

970
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,680
We're all going to be together at the campground.

971
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,180
M-O-N-S-T-E.

972
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,300
We are. Monsters, monsters.

973
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:23,920
Yes, we are.

974
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,800
Yeah.

975
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,800
Take that, repulsive normals.

976
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,580
Nelkies.

977
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,240
Yeah, normies.

978
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,700
We're going to get back at those normies.

979
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,200
Yes, spalpeens.

980
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,240
Abby Norman.

981
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
I remember that.

982
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,600
Abby Normal and Mal Adjusted are not welcome here.

983
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,680
Oh, Ab-Norm-Nighthill will be an ex-guy.

984
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,400
Ab-Duel personality.

985
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,660
Oh, Ab-Duel personality.

986
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,880
You mentioned him last week.

987
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,460
Yes.

988
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,340
An interesting case.

989
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,180
It's like a schizophrenic Sunni extremist, I think.

990
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,160
We differentiate them from the reanimated dead.

991
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,880
By the way, they started a new country this afternoon.

992
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:03,640
I've read in the news.

993
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,620
Skull-garia forever.

994
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,420
Yeah, that cult, the ISIS cult.

995
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,040
Oh, yeah.

996
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,920
Those ISIS worshippers, they've decided to call themselves the Caliphate of Islam or something like that.

997
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,940
And they've declared part of Iraq and Syria a new country.

998
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,140
Hail Hydra.

999
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,100
ISIS is tired.

1000
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,280
ISIS is tired.

1001
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,020
They're doing it.

1002
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,520
They're doing it.

1003
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:22,520


1004
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:22,520


1005
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:22,900
They're doing it.

1006
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,300
They don't approve of the idea.

1007
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,960
Well, there seem to be some arguments and mass executions and things like that going on.

1008
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,140
I wouldn't want to turn on CNN with your kids watching right now.

1009
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,500
It's not safe for kids to watch that kind of stuff.

1010
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,160
Just tell them how ISIS...

1011
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:47,160
Oh, that looks sharp.

1012
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,540
Well, yeah.

1013
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,460
It may look sharp to you, but it's breaking my neck.

1014
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:51,820
Feel sharp?

1015
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,120
And my wheel powers.

1016
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,540
Well, the wheels might be retractable.

1017
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:03,020
I don't know, but they say ISIS raised Osiris from the dead with this nifty little number.

1018
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,060
I know what they really mean.

1019
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,780
The scroll of thought.

1020
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,000
It's the amazing new Horus timetable turn watch and extra degree of new inconsiderate.

1021
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,700
And it's only $5.95 on the top of it.

1022
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,540
But the commons read this document, which, pardon me, I do not mean to read.

1023
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:27,480
And they would go and kiss poor Bob Dobbs' flesh and dip their napkins in his sacred blood.

1024
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:34,380
Vast, polyphemus-like and loathsome, Bob darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith,

1025
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,860
about which he flung his gigantic, scaly arms.

1026
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,740
Hey, watch it.

1027
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,820
The while he bowed his hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds.

1028
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,520
I think I went mad then.

1029
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:47,800
Again?

1030
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,280
Again?

1031
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:49,400
What?

1032
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,340
Well, it happened a long time ago.

1033
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,100
While we were pursuing our researches.

1034
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,400
Don't get mad.

1035
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:54,640
Get odd.

1036
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,640
Well, that's all right for us.

1037
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,420
For a certain experimental subject.

1038
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,140
You see.

1039
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,460
The monster scared me.

1040
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,900
Holding with.

1041
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,740
I want to turn the inner ear of the inner apparatus into our doings here tonight.

1042
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:15,360
Especially the announcement of the profligate party down in Sunders, uh, uh, uh, Square Town, man.

1043
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,000
Send me some of what they're having.

1044
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,180
What about the prophet of Square Town?

1045
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,300
A party, he says.

1046
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,100
I was making fun of the mayor of, um, what's named Mayberry down there.

1047
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:24,840
Party.

1048
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,780
Oh, that guy.

1049
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,020
The mayor.

1050
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:36,560
That guy holding his pathetic small bit of authority as if it could withstand the subgenius tide of vengeance.

1051
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,960
Well, he's a-keeping the sheriff from coming on down to X-Day, that's for sure.

1052
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,480
Sheriff, we was just having a little fight.

1053
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,220
Oh, let him up, boys.

1054
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,620
Time to go.

1055
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,360
They're just sacrificing this child.

1056
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,220
To that huge turtle over there.

1057
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,980
My bubbling cauldron is ready.

1058
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,040
Who will be the first to drink its slimy contents?

1059
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,400
I will.

1060
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,640
Who's got the mustache cup?

1061
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,000
Oh, well, yeah.

1062
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,700
You know, um, holding with.

1063
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,860
That means you want to talk Russian.

1064
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,660
Oh, yeah.

1065
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,700
We could do that.

1066
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,340
Gewurst to studying.

1067
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,520
But.

1068
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,440
You don't need to.

1069
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:19,900
I'm not a Russian.

1070
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,900
Go for it.

1071
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,840
Go for it.

1072
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,560
This sounds deep.

1073
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:31,460
Holding with Cagle that all life is a chemical and physical process and that the so-called soul is a myth.

1074
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:38,240
Ivan believed that artificial reanimation of the dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues.

1075
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:48,620
And that unless actual decomposition is set in, a corpse fully equipped with organs may, with suitable measures, be set going again.

1076
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,360
Yeah.

1077
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:49,380
Yeah.

1078
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:49,520
Yeah.

1079
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,520


1080
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,520


1081
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,520


1082
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,520


1083
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,520


1084
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,520


1085
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,520


1086
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,520


1087
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,520


1088
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,520


1089
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,040
In a peculiar fashion known as life.

1090
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,620
What was that about organs again?

1091
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,580
Well, the organs have to be in place.

1092
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:04,520
But with this anti-catabolic, anti-entropic loop is what creates a nice undying monster.

1093
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,620
What is it with these undying?

1094
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,460
It's the spark.

1095
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,380
The electricity.

1096
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,880
It keeps them going.

1097
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,000
We.

1098
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,200
You've forgotten more than you'll ever know, Dr. Stang.

1099
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:16,680
You know.

1100
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,260
I've been working hard at that.

1101
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,720
This was your great discovery.

1102
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,360
You forgot.

1103
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,840
You've forgotten many of the things.

1104
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:39,420
But fortunately, as your amanuensis, I, Dr. Helen Dowell, am here to remind you that the psychic or intellectual life might be impaired by the slight deterioration of sensitive brain cells, which even a short period of death would be apt to cause.

1105
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,540
I didn't even know boys could have an amanuensis.

1106
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,780
Well, you can.

1107
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,180
I thought he was talking about the synapses misfiring.

1108
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,260
What's amanuensis?

1109
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,220
The synapses.

1110
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:49,320
The synapses.

1111
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,480
The crackles and the pop-popses of the human brain.

1112
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,740
They burned in the night over Orville and Wisconsin.

1113
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,820
They burned all the night in the U.S.

1114
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,720
Oh, those were the days.

1115
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,880
His head was a fire.

1116
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,000
It burned in fire.

1117
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,640
Yeah, the fire burned you.

1118
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,060
That's it.

1119
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,760
The burnt child shuns the fire.

1120
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,820
And the smoke of that burning goeth up forever.

1121
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,560
Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.

1122
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,860
It's me.

1123
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,580
Pleasion has no inferiority to hunger.

1124
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:21,640
Hefner has the habit of Chinese fishing.

1125
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:21,860
He'll burn you out.

1126
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:21,860


1127
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:21,860


1128
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,040
It's works and saying mister everything you've done in an hour for free.

1129
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:23,540
The these there, Halo.

1130
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:23,540


1131
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,220
I'll see you think right.

1132
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:39,880
And us, the Turnip.

1133
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,580
Good fucking tes, Matty.

1134
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:41,580


1135
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:41,580


1136
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:41,860
As precious as his life in the bright Paper은

1137
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:44,720
I'm telling you what, respeucken your compliance period.

1138
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:45,740
There, he you have it.

1139
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:45,840
And how do you give that a Ш?

1140
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:46,660
B free.

1141
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:47,420
Never其實.

1142
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,200
The best I can do is tell me,

1143
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,200
That's what we're going to do.

1144
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:51,860
What about you?

1145
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,820
What are you going to do?

1146
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,940
We're going to have the pleasure saucers of the sex god.

1147
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,280
How are you going to spend X day?

1148
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,220
Well, we're going to have an old-fashioned monarchy gathering.

1149
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,980
We're going to appoint us a queen and a couple of dukes.

1150
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,880
And then we're all going to rip our clothes off and start dashing our hairs.

1151
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,560
Amen.

1152
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,020
Yeah, amen.

1153
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:12,800
Amen, indeed.

1154
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,260
And we're going to praise the Lord while we're doing that.

1155
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,060
And pass the ammunition?

1156
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:21,660
And pass the onions, because we're on a mighty fight.

1157
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,640
Look at this.

1158
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,180
This is my personal side grime.

1159
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,080
It's a Stahlgrat 16.

1160
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,140
Nifty little number.

1161
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,720
Can discharge a million mini-ampoules in one nanosecond.

1162
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:39,380
Right into the gaping wound created by my special blue Whistler pistol.

1163
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,020
Pistol.

1164
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,120
Oh, I think I passed an ammunition.

1165
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,560
That's all right.

1166
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,980
Just somebody open a window.

1167
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,000
Okay.

1168
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:47,500
Just do it.

1169
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,640
Yes, this is a...

1170
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,420
For some reason, a lapse of memory.

1171
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,140
I forget the name of this one.

1172
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,540
But not only do you get a number of shots,

1173
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,580
but you also can fire a shotgun shell and send a round of blue Whistlers.

1174
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,780
So you are having an electro shot this year?

1175
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,120
You're offering an electro shot?

1176
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,500
I thought I was over that old thing.

1177
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,860
I've already been reoriented.

1178
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,840
But we do have it for the recalcitrant, the namby-pamby,

1179
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,920
and those with regressive pinkish tendencies.

1180
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,460
Nelkies and normals.

1181
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,020
They're only a far thing.

1182
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,980
They're past an apenny-penny or something very, very inexpensive.

1183
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,800
Past is not over.

1184
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,920
The past is not even past.

1185
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,100
As Faulkner said,

1186
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:37,700
No, one thing there will always be more of in the future is the past.

1187
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,360
Until there is no room for anything else.

1188
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,320
And then the future will be over.

1189
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,780
And the past.

1190
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:45,980
Time.

1191
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,260
I'm a fencing seeper.

1192
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:55,380
And all will be sucked into Bob's pipe

1193
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:00,860
to join with the smoke of the frog

1194
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,280
which riseth up to heaven

1195
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,180
as Bob exhales or passes his ammunition.

1196
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,600
Do you think I'll ever get to smoke some of that frog there, Grandpa?

1197
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,780
Come on, you can let me know.

1198
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,940
I'm a big boy.

1199
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:17,840
And I can teach you.

1200
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,660
No, that's upside down, isn't it?

1201
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,220
Aww, isn't that cute?

1202
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,180
Time to keep dancing, I say.

1203
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,460
Dance! Dance!

1204
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,660
Once we get rid of all these purple-skinned and blue-eyed monsters,

1205
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,220
Oh, you can see them too?

1206
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,340
we're gonna really, really make some money here in Sheds and Hughes and Platt.

1207
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,540
Stop trying to make money.

1208
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,900
That is something which is going to end on X-Day.

1209
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,180
No money will be necessary any...

1210
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,580
No, I'm... I'm...

1211
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,040
I'm gonna miss worrying about money.

1212
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,200
The predicted subgenius econoclasm.

1213
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
Well, it's just something I'm so used to.

1214
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,220
But it is the basis of all our woes.

1215
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,640
You know, it is idolatrous to worship money,

1216
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,920
and our entire world is in the grip of this supernatural force.

1217
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:04,880
Well, but most of us have...

1218
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,600
Something which does not actually exist.

1219
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:07,560
Money.

1220
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,740
That's right, because money is an abstraction itself of labor value.

1221
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,760
And I don't want to sound like Tovaris or none of them guys.

1222
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,760
Especially these new Groucho concepts and stuff.

1223
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,180
It's too hard to grasp right now, but they certainly have us, Tovaris.

1224
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,420
They sure do.

1225
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,320
We have Stockholm Syndrome.

1226
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:32,600
We love our prison... our warders, our jailers, the conspiracy.

1227
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,560
That's why so many are...

1228
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,780
When the time comes to lift off into outer space with the Xs,

1229
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,640
you know, you can have anything you can imagine,

1230
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,280
but a lot of subgeniuses won't imagine anything different from their...

1231
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,700
cruddy apartment and their cruddy job.

1232
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:48,640
Identifying with the old present.

1233
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,420
They'll be on the sausage, but they'll just be going through the same old motions.

1234
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,680
But haven't all of our imaginations been compromised by now?

1235
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,860
Aren't we kind of... on the edge of everything?

1236
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:06,020
Maybe primitive imaginations, such as the pinks think they are exercising,

1237
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,060
but not true imagination.

1238
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,900
What the romantic poets called fancy.

1239
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,120
In other words, just fantasy castle building.

1240
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,040
What a believer.

1241
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,040


1242
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,440
Creating imaginary scenarios where they achieve sexual success

1243
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,400
or some measure of power over their fellow beings.

1244
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,780
Not like us.

1245
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:24,560
No.

1246
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,940
You're talking about those OTO people, right?

1247
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,740
Yes, exactly.

1248
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,920
They already have their reward.

1249
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,180
But we are to receive ours in a matter of a few short days.

1250
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,760
Isn't that what Bob said last year, though, about this time?

1251
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,600
Well, he was testing us.

1252
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,340
It was a great X day, though.

1253
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,180
I remember it.

1254
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,260
Nothing I could have imagined would be in any way comparable to this.

1255
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,260
I saw the demonic, blasphemous reality that I saw,

1256
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,360
or believed I saw, last year at Wisteria.

1257
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,760
I saw them, the subgeniuses, in a limitless stream,

1258
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:00,820
flopping, hopping, croaking, bleating, urging inhumanly

1259
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,740
through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque, malignant

1260
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,840
of fantastic nightmare.

1261
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:15,260
Well, they lack in grace what they possess in enthusiasm.

1262
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,140
That's right.

1263
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:20,900
They hopped and bleated into those fires just like we wanted them to.

1264
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,840
Flapping their flippers.

1265
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,020
But they will be given new bodies after X day.

1266
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,380
At least that's what we tell them.

1267
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,220
They pay extra for that.

1268
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,740
They're happy to.

1269
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:34,720
Well, we need every bit, as long as we do respect Moloch and Mammon

1270
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,600
and those other creations.

1271
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,360
But those gods will have to take a powder.

1272
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,420
Render unto P-Dog that which is P-Dog's.

1273
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,500
You ever seen a...

1274
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,820
A personal check with a Bible verse on it?

1275
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,980
I don't have them on mine, but yes, I have seen them.

1276
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,820
But that's all part of these imbeciles with their prosperity gospel.

1277
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,580
Yeah, once upon a time I worked at a job where I used to handle a lot of personal checks,

1278
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:02,440
and I thought it was hilarious when I saw personal checks with Bible verses on them.

1279
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,340
And I think that's in the book of Matthew,

1280
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,720
where it says you can serve the Lord or you can serve Mammon,

1281
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,040
but you cannot serve both.

1282
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,240
So obviously they've decided what to do since they're about to write a check.

1283
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,680
If you're gonna put a Bible verse on a check,

1284
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,820
that should be the Bible verse.

1285
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:21,640
In the Bible it says thou canst not both serve God and Mammon.

1286
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,860
Even if you get a tattoo of Jesus, it's still heathen.

1287
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,280
Thou shalt always walk this way.

1288
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,420
Well, walk this way in the service of the Lord.

1289
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,240
In the stupor of the Lord.

1290
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,060
In the swooping...

1291
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,960
A divine stupor.

1292
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,020
...bender from a young...

1293
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,560
...hungry...

1294
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,540
...hungry...

1295
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,680
Unless we went off the gold standard,

1296
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,000
the existence of the dollar is proof that there is a God.

1297
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,360
We know that God is the ultimate source of all dollars.

1298
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,600
No, this is a supernatural invisible force which controls our world.

1299
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,700
Supernatural because it does not actually have existence,

1300
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,280
but a force because it controls everything.

1301
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,800
Money is no longer keyed to any kind of actual standard of reality.

1302
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,980
It has to do with millions of megabits-ls of information...

1303
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,160
Philo said it was that...

1304
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,540
...mated and destroyed with each nanosecond.

1305
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,700
Philo said it was that invisible hand guy.

1306
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,720
He should know, because...

1307
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,280
I put all my money into doge coins.

1308
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:18,000
Philo is right there at the heart of the nexus of the conspiracy.

1309
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,700
So he knows.

1310
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,600
There's some pause on top, but I don't know if there are any hands mixed in the follicle.

1311
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,020
Let us pause.

1312
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,500
Let's say a clove and hoof or two pushing a chest forward.

1313
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,840
Hey, no personal remarks, buddy.

1314
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,220
I'm going to get rid of this as soon as I can take the antidote.

1315
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:32,840
Well, I'm not saying you're pushing the world around with your foot.

1316
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,460
I'm just making fun of those with clove and hoof.

1317
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,640
Yeah, but Ivan didn't know.

1318
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,600
He took my dirt, and now I got my hoof, and I'll have to fix it up when I get back.

1319
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,520
You have a disease that cannot be cured, my friend.

1320
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,480
It is not a disease.

1321
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,600
It's nothing more than a smelly old barbecue foot.

1322
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:55,460
No, it's just a reversion, as it were, to one's trans-natural state.

1323
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,760
It happens to us all.

1324
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,640
You should see Ivan Stang when he forgets to take his...

1325
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,840
Yeah, but you certainly got a revision when it comes to political theory and economics right now.

1326
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,940
Well, we don't want to give away the store.

1327
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,020
After all, remember, it's almost too late.

1328
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,180
I suppose someone could...

1329
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,200
Is it possible, Ivan?

1330
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,700
They could still send in $35 and...

1331
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:19,440
Yes, as a matter of fact, whether or not they get that subgenius membership card in the mail,

1332
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:25,220
they are in the book of life at the moment that that PayPal button is pushed,

1333
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,100
the one that says, send money.

1334
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,700
Happy to see that there is a way out.

1335
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,220
At that moment.

1336
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,460
Checking the mail's postmark.

1337
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:35,960
If you waited until 6-59, July 5th, 1998,

1338
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,320
which we're hoping will be this upcoming Saturday morning,

1339
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,040
That's close.

1340
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,960
If 6-59, if you hit that PayPal button, you're in.

1341
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,060
Your friends are either on the saucers or you're off the saucers.

1342
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:54,640
And with that button push, you are on that saucer.

1343
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,280
You know, some of us, and I'm one of those guys,

1344
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,500
I'm always nervous about missing a plane or a train.

1345
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,400
I like to be there plenty of time beforehand.

1346
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,680
And you guys who wait to the last minute,

1347
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,340
what would happen if you got shut off?

1348
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:09,960
And you saw...

1349
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:15,480
You saw the great adamantium doors sliding closed to clang in their valves

1350
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,880
and the huge saucer ships ascending without you.

1351
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,320
It'd feel like you were left off Noah's freaking ark.

1352
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,260
But of course, we know from intense Bible study

1353
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:30,240
that the Lord said he'd never send another giant flood

1354
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,980
and there was no need to build an ark.

1355
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,920
He said there'd never be another water inundation.

1356
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:39,440
But he also said that there would be a fire inundation.

1357
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,660
Coming soon in the fire age.

1358
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,780
Being God means never having to say you're sorry.

1359
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,800
Well, speaking of the end of the world and the end of all things,

1360
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,620
it's almost the end of this show.

1361
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,160
It's almost the end.

1362
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,280
And there is an end to this show.

1363
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,320
And it justifies the means.

1364
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,200
With Susie the Fleece's final collage work,

1365
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,160
which I'm about to play, no matter what anybody else says.

1366
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,820
However, in...

1367
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,900
By all her stunning grace.

1368
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,620
Either next week or in the next ten minutes,

1369
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,560
this show will somehow go on

1370
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,220
because we're not going to leave the station.

1371
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,180
So, friends...

1372
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,760
How about that?

1373
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,480
Tune in next week or in the next five minutes.

1374
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,040
Same with you, Dave.

1375
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,880
And we shall meet again.

1376
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,700
In the place where there is no darkness.

1377
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,680
Don't know when.

1378
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,800
But I know we'll meet again, Josh.

1379
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,760
And with that, we go back.

1380
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,380
To Susie's work.

1381
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,120
We are now approaching Planet X.

1382
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,060
Be very careful.

1383
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,020
Yes, sir.

1384
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,680
Situation report.

1385
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,120
I sure wish I had some company and some good dope.

1386
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,240
Otherwise, I feel fine.

1387
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,840
Making adjustments on a course right for Planet X.

1388
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,380
And there's the planet.

1389
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,360
That sandy-colored semi-sphere tilting up on the left there.

1390
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,280
Focus out now there on the surface.

1391
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,800
Looks like Pismo Beach out there.

1392
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,700
We're coming in fast.

1393
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:05,160
Woo-hoo!

1394
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:05,520
Yeah!

1395
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,520
Great job!

1396
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,260
Great job!

1397
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,280
Congratulations, Bob.

1398
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:09,760
Thank you.

1399
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:09,940
Thank you.

1400
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:09,940


1401
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:09,940


1402
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:09,940


1403
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:09,940


1404
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:09,940


1405
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,540
I'll admit, I thought you were bloody marvelous.

1406
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,720
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1407
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,280
Not so fast, Bob!

1408
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,500
Oh, hi, guys.

1409
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,860
You have something you want to say?

1410
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,520
That's right, Bob.

1411
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,200
What is it this time, Bob?

1412
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,060
They looked at Bob in terror.

1413
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,900
The playboy juggled the books.

1414
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,600
This is an outrage.

1415
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,400
I would like to stay for the record.

1416
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,900
I've been had, I've been had, I've been had, had, had, had, had.

1417
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:37,900
No!

1418
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:38,520
No!

1419
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:38,960
Fine!

1420
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:38,980
And I'm alive!

1421
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,180
Brian Barnes has !!

1422
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:41,200
Young.

1423
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:41,280


1424
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,360
She's doing your mail!

1425
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,680
Here, you gotta pay up erosion!

1426
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,400
No way!

1427
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:52,480
I'm out of your balls!

1428
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,240
Got to shit.

1429
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:55,840
Oh my God.

1430
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,140
Oh, nice job.

1431
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,240
This is insane.

1432
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,000
My neck is running in shніo...

1433
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,280
24 hours hasensitive.

1434
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:03,080
23 hours an hour?

1435
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,080


1436
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,080


1437
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,720
If you're trying to stop the�く

1438
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,040
this time.

1439
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,500
Excuse me?

1440
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:08,500


1441
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,880
What the hell is going on?

1442
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,300
At that point, it was every man for himself.

1443
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,720
What's going on? I got no go here.

1444
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,960
We just lost power, like all of it.

1445
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:19,320
Way to go.

1446
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,380
Someone get down to the engine room and find out what the hell happened.

1447
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,080
No, no way. That place is spooky.

1448
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,080
Do you pay these people?

1449
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,900
A secret sky patch or some such nonsense?

1450
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,420
They looked at each other.

1451
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,380
Bowie.

1452
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,040
This is my place.

1453
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,620
Come on, I want to go with you.

1454
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,680
I don't love you.

1455
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,600
Meanwhile, in time stands still land.

1456
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:07,080
Flung from side to side, Logan the Engineer fought to pull the ship into a glide

1457
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,400
for an attempt to make a belly.

1458
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,560
Whatever, man.

1459
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,740
Boy, was that a crash.

1460
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,360
Had some problems landing my ship.

1461
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,380
Great. Now what?

1462
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,600
I think I've got athletes for you.

1463
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,820
Shut up!

1464
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,940
So, we're a bit stuck.

1465
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,180
You're stuck, yeah?

1466
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:35,960
Stuck?

1467
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:36,580
Much.

1468
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,140
And the irony is that...

1469
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,820
I'll never get off.

1470
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:39,680
Where's Bob?

1471
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:40,540
Where is he?

1472
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,160
Where's Bob?

1473
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,000
He's gone.

1474
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,040
He didn't leave.

1475
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,260
He went to the store.

1476
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,940
It had only been a matter of time.

1477
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,320
The Smiler had been humoring them.

1478
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,140
It was a joke.

1479
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,220
Some joke.

1480
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,320
He stole my gold tooth the night he left.

1481
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,980
God, how cliche can one man get?

1482
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,440
Oh, that's dumb.

1483
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,980
We've been set up from the start.

1484
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,460
We'd have probably treated you the same if you'd come over to our place.

1485
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,080
Bob's right about you.

1486
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,960
You're not a man at all.

1487
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,020
I want you to go.

1488
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:08,120


1489
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:08,260
Now, Tom!

1490
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:08,580
Oh, look at these guys.

1491
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:09,280
Now, Tom!

1492
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,660
Lord, I love you.

1493
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,400
Get on up.

1494
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,000
Let me help you up.

1495
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,840
Oh, I just had to kick you in the diddly again.

1496
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,220
How's your diddly?

1497
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,100
Hope I broke it.

1498
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,560
He turned away.

1499
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:27,980
Well, you've got to run, love.

1500
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,140
Fish is cute as squash.

1501
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,200
Strangers jerks are cute.

1502
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,280
You know how it tastes.

1503
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,220
Both of you.

1504
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:33,020
Tom!

1505
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,020
He waved his arms in some shapeless gesture of farewell and ran out of the room.

1506
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:37,880
What did we miss?

1507
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,100
We missed the fish.

1508
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,100


1509
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,100


1510
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,100


1511
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,100


1512
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,100


1513
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,100


1514
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,100


1515
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,100


1516
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,700
Blah, blah, blah.

1517
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,660
End of the world.

1518
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,700
Life on other planets.

1519
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,480
Blah, blah, blah.

1520
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,100
The guy from Labyrinth turned into a bird!

1521
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,260
I want my pants.

1522
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,480
I need my pee.

1523
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,140
No matter what happens to Bob, we have our own lives to live.

1524
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:51,380
Where are you going to go?

1525
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:51,960
I don't know.

1526
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,400
But I'm going to go someplace as far away from here as we can get.

1527
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,700
I guess you're right.

1528
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,680
I'm afraid the joke's on us.

1529
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,000
The police will find out eventually.

1530
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,140
But don't worry.

1531
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,740
They cannot arrest all of us because we all have stupid friends.

1532
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,080
Now to get me some fish.

1533
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,080


1534
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,080


1535
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,080


1536
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,080


1537
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,080


1538
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,140
I'll get you some caveman hookers.

1539
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,900
This is the first thing anyone said that makes sense.

1540
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:13,980
They're ready.

1541
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:18,580
If there really were a day called X. How about you?

1542
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:23,800
I ask you.

1543
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,520
Is there anybody here as happy as I am?
