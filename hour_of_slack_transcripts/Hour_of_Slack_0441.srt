1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,940
Climb inside.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,200
On awaits you if you climb inside.

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,480
Climb inside my little keeper.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,120
Climb inside my little keeper.

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:59,780
Climb inside my little keeper.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,600
I have returned here in the West.

7
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,720
I'm called Christ.

8
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,260
I've been sent by my father Lucifer as a divine agent of intervention

9
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:21,400
to save you from a nuclear holocaust and the destruction of the human race.

10
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,540
Be not afraid.

11
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,640
The great disappearance that has just occurred is all part of the plan.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,360
These people that were removed were highly crystallized in their thought patterns.

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,880
They would have been unable to accept the new age of Satanism.

14
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,640
And now the old is gone and it's time to bring in the new.

15
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,500
I come to bring you all to God.

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,360
All religions have strayed from the cosmic truth of God and the universe.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,680
Now I will show you all the simple path to God

18
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,980
and you shall see all of you.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,160
You shall see all of yourselves as the divine beings that you truly are.

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,180
All one in the vast synchronicity of the cosmos.

21
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,440
You will understand the great law of karma

22
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,600
and you will learn to live in peace and harmony and brotherhood among all of mankind.

23
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,880
Together we can eliminate all war, suffering, disease, hunger and injustice.

24
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:26,120
Love and light can fill the earth and we shall seal the door where evil dwells forever.

25
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,780
And the great plan can be fulfilled.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,980
The perfect plan.

27
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,620
The perfect plan.

28
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,900
The perfect plan.

29
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,620
The perfect plan.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,280
The perfect plan.

31
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,180
Follow me my brothers and sisters and we shall create a new world.

32
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,360
Today the kingdom of God has come upon you.

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,160
May the force be with you all.

34
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:59,280
My friends, that was a direct reading from a so-called radio broadcast.

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,320
It was done last week.

36
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,260
I didn't want to play it.

37
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,240
I didn't have a tape of the original, but that's the exact words of a broadcast.

38
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,120
And I'm afraid that what I'm going to say to you will shock you.

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,640
It will disturb your sleep.

40
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,900
It will make you worry for your loved ones.

41
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,960
It will give you nightmares of disaster, plague, and horrible death.

42
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,240
It will make you rethink the priorities of your life.

43
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,420
It will change the way that you look at yourself and the world.

44
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,800
There is a killer loose in the land.

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,680
This killer cuts down all that he touches.

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,640
If he touches you, you will die.

47
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,460
If he touches your child, your child will die.

48
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,020
His victims die a slow, horrible death.

49
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,360
They waste away.

50
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,320
They drown in their own body fluids.

51
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,320
They lose control of their mouth.

52
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,640
They lose their memory.

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,260
They become demented.

54
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,400
They die in vain.

55
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:57,760
They die in agony.

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,760
There is nothing that can be done to save them.

57
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,280
The killer's name is J.R. Bob Dogs, or Bob for short.

58
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:13,820
When he starts to kill you, it is said that you are slackless, an insensate, weak puppet

59
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:20,280
with no soul, an occupant of an earth ship rocketing headlong into Armageddon.

60
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,560
This killer and his cult of followers first emerged on the American scene in the 1950s,

61
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,080
rising.

62
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,140
Like an angel of grinning death from out of the oozing rivers of body fluids that spilled

63
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:41,240
like feted waterfalls into the streets of our beloved America, from the sick and sleazy

64
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,540
pleasure houses of the killer Bob and his twisted subgeniuses.

65
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,640
And yet, despite this heinous assault on all of the good and pure and virtuous traditions

66
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,400
that made America a shining beacon of freedom to all of us, the killer and his cult of

67
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,440
all the world, the authorities have done nothing to stop this terror from washing over

68
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,960
this great land like a sea of evil blood.

69
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,760
In fact, the leaders that you elected are aiding and abetting their cause, claiming

70
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,680
these evil subgeniuses have the same rights as ordinary people.

71
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:25,460
Our elected officials are daring to let these freaks and perverts hide behind the protection

72
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,380
of the Constitution of the United States.

73
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,380


74
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,560
It has been well documented that the tremendous power of organized militant groups such as

75
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,980
the Subgenius Liberation Army Corps, or SLAK, S-L-A-K, have its slimy tendrils deep into the

76
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,540
White House, the United Nations, and possibly even to the Vatican and the Council on Foreign

77
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:55,240
Relations. These swine hold most of our craven and criminal politicians in thrall, either

78
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,380
through threats and blackmail or through the use of force. They are the ones who are the

79
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:57,380


80
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:57,540
most likely to be killed.

81
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:04,880
Or else through the politicians' own naked lust for the pleasures that Bob's world offers.

82
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:18,480
You are about to participate in a great adventure. You are about to experience the awe and mystery

83
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,480
which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius power of SLAK.

84
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,180
It will take you to a place where you are never going to experience the awe and mystery

85
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,180


86
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:39,600
He was an average sort of guy. The image of us all. How can I say this. It was good in Larry and it was evil.

87
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,340
The evil part broke through, took hold. Call it an accident or call it a warning?

88
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,340
A warning?

89
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,460
I'm a reporter, not a mystic, Linda. But there are things beyond us, things perhaps we're not meant to understand.

90
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,360
If what's happened has made this all clear, well then perhaps it makes sense anyway.

91
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,360


92
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,360


93
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,360


94
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,840
Have faith, Linda.

95
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,560
Have faith in the good that's still in Larry.

96
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,340
And in all men.

97
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,320
Ain't got no car.

98
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,440
Ain't got no wife.

99
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,540
In fact, I got killed.

100
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,220
Coming over here tonight.

101
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,840
I am a dead man.

102
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,460
I'm laying on the floor.

103
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,160
I am a dead man.

104
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,600
I am deceased.

105
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,140
And what's more, I am a dead man.

106
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,340
Yes, I have discontinued living.

107
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,280
I have given up on cash.

108
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,960
Wine and women.

109
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,360
I ain't got no money.

110
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,260
I ain't got no shoes.

111
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,560
I guess it ain't funny.

112
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,220
That is why I have the blues.

113
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,160
I am so dead that I feel like a stiff.

114
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,700
If you don't believe it, just take a sniff.

115
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,200
I am a dead man.

116
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,860
Sniff me.

117
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,040
hwa-ha-ha.

118
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,040
It goes nothing, lo-la-la-la.

119
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,200
Sniffing ain't very big car to sleep on.

120
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,200


121
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,200


122
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,240
Ain't got no job.

123
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,100
Cuz I won't need it any more.

124
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,760
Can't hit the time clock.

125
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,300
Cuz I can't get up no more.

126
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,620
I'm on a permanent vacation.

127
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,360
And from here on I'm off to Rome.

128
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:10,800
With no pay, don't ask me what I think, cause I got nothing to say. I tell you I am dead, that's why I have the blues. Yes, that's what I said, now I'm telling you the news.

129
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:27,880
I am a dead man, as cold as I can be, I am a dead man, if you don't believe it just touch me, I am a dead man, I have paid the ultimate price, that's why I'm qualified to give you this advice.

130
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:39,340
I'm a dead man, D-E-A-D, I am dead, that's what I said, I am dead.

131
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:59,240
Oh yes, dear friends, and it's true, it's John Bartles there, a fine, fine performer, but we'll get back to more from the fine Mr. Bartles as soon as we can.

132
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:08,540
But you know, the power, the power of organized perversion is a factor in the suppression of the truth about this bomb.

133
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,780
And it is certainly...

134
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,580
A fact that these deviants are part of the media's push to destroy America.

135
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:33,680
If the uncensored truth about Bob were released to the American people, it would have the potential of permanently derailing the plan to submerge America into a multicultural new world order.

136
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,160
It would have the potential of waking up the sleeping American people.

137
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,680
And our map.

138
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,240
The monsters in Washington, New York, and Dobstown, Bolivia cannot allow that to happen.

139
00:10:47,600 --> 00:11:00,420
We're repeatedly told by the controlled media that the Church of the Subgenius is a joke, a bunch of crackpots poking a little fun at our sacred American heritage.

140
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,540
But that simply is not true.

141
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:10,200
In fact, they are an extremist paramilitary organization, highly trained in the art of mind control.

142
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,120
And by who?

143
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,660
By our own CIA.

144
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:19,160
That's who the Church of the Subgenius infiltrated our most secret organizations in 1953.

145
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:33,280
When a letter signed by J. Edgar Hoover recommended that a young man named J.R. Bob Dobbs be placed in charge of the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, investigating the phenomenon known as UFOs.

146
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,160
In later years, he befriended a young agent named George Bush.

147
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,780
And a soldier named Lee Harvey Osborn.

148
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,240
And a soldier named George Oswald.

149
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,580
Yes, it is some great joke, isn't it?

150
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,240
Let's hope that the rest of us survive long enough to make it to the punchline.

151
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:02,980
When Dobbs left the government payroll in late 1970s, he had by then left a long trail of twisted minds behind him.

152
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:09,980
Key government officials converted into practicing occultists in the surface of the Killer Bob.

153
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:25,000
It has been speculated that between 80 and 95 percent of children that disappear from our homes due to kidnapping are converted to the subgenius faith by means of drugs, torture, and starvation.

154
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,920
These children are smuggled out of the country and sent to one of the cult's overseas slave labor camps.

155
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:37,800
Cruel sweatshops where the children are forced to spend 16 hours a day making fake miracle trinkets.

156
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,780
Which their false prophet leader brought.

157
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:40,780


158
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:40,780


159
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,160
Bob peddles to his followers making over 17 million dollars in 1993.

160
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,660
Many of the children are sent to Thailand to stalk Bob Dobbs' many brothels.

161
00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:00,900
Some are sent to one of the 13 Dobbs Town training centers to be indoctrinated to learn the dark secrets of the cult.

162
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:07,020
And to work in their jungle laboratories manufacturing a designer drug called Gabrogfran.

163
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:20,800
In 1983, three subgeniuses were arrested for covertly attempting to poison the Philadelphia water supply with a 50 gallon dose of this potent hallucinogen.

164
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,680
The charges were dropped and the information suppressed by order of the Department of Defense.

165
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Because it seems that this Gabrogfran drug was developed by the military as a weapon under orders of CIA head George Bush.

166
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,360
During the Carter administration.

167
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,980
How many innocents must die so that the sick sex games of the perverts subgeniuses can continue?

168
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:54,800
How long must we wait before the police and the military take matters into their own hands and stop this madness?

169
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,700
What can you do to save your family and your country from this deadly menace?

170
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,960
There's a lot you can do.

171
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,820
Avoid contact with the police.

172
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,440
Avoid contact with known subgeniuses.

173
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,340
If there is a known subgenius district in your area, avoid it.

174
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,360
Do not go there.

175
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,340
Avoid the trendy or fashionable part of town whenever possible.

176
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,480
This is often where subgeniuses are to be found.

177
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,880
If you live in a rural area or small town that has preserved traditional American values, stay there.

178
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,880
Watch your family for signs of disobedience or strange behavior.

179
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,120
Stay away from the television.

180
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,980
It has become infested with subliminal messages that lure you and your loved ones into the cult.

181
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,080
Do not go to airports alone.

182
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,820
If you must go, however, be sure not to drink anything.

183
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,520
Bring bottled water.

184
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,700
Many airport water supplies are tainted by the Gbrogfran.

185
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:05,100
Teams of subgeniuses work at every airport in America waiting for the drug to take effect and loading their helpless victims into waiting planes while airport officials and the air force are waiting for the drug to take effect.

186
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,320
The FAA do nothing.

187
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,340
Make your children stay at home after school.

188
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,960
If they try to sneak out, beat them severely.

189
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,680
This is very important as this blood cult of evil targets places where teens congregate.

190
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:23,840
Shopping malls are among the best recruiting grounds for young people to be lured into Dobbs' evil web.

191
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:30,140
If you would like more information about this threat to our American way, write to

192
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,100
Ivan Stang, P.O. Box 1403

193
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,640
06 Dallas, Texas 75214

194
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,420
Thank you.

195
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,540
The path is the mask of love.

196
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,660
A way, a way.

197
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,260
The flow is the task above today.

198
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,760
There is no other way.

199
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,120
You gotta trust us.

200
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,620
When you need a friend to find us.

201
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,100
You got to look within.

202
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,180
You gotta trust us.

203
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,940
You gotta trust us.

204
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,460
Before you turn to dust.

205
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,200
Before you turn to dust.

206
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,380
You gotta see us before you see us.

207
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,180
You gotta be us before you see us.

208
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,080
You gottaB

209
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,160
who's got a

210
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,160


211
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,680
I'm a judge without pain

212
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,260
Such is his will and I hate his aim

213
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,120
Such is his will and I hate his aim

214
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,620
Well, for you, for you, with you, more of you

215
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,020
I'm just a fool

216
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:19,600
I'm just a fool

217
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:05,080
I'm just a fool

218
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:35,420
I'm just a fool

219
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm just a fool

220
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,880
I'm just a fool

221
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:27,460
I'm just a fool

222
00:20:37,660 --> 00:21:04,360
I'm just a fool

223
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,240
I'm just a fool

224
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm just a fool

225
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,880
incredible book.

226
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,720
Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon,

227
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,960
had to make the last few little cuts.

228
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,320
It's like cutting the word of God

229
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,200
out of a Bible, you know?

230
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,600
But yet, we have to do it to make the book friendly,

231
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,540
you know, to the book-buying public.

232
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,780
It has to look friendly.

233
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,960
That's what the professionals tell me, anyway.

234
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,580
Maybe the word Bob don't want to look friendly.

235
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,580
That's what I would say.

236
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,220
Anyway, this particular Christian paperback,

237
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,720
which is probably available in any, you know,

238
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,040
open supermarket in the little special Christian rack,

239
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,700
here's some quotes from it.

240
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,760
This is what's going to happen when we,

241
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,500
well, when the non-Christian forces,

242
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,440
the forces of the Antichrist, take over.

243
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,880
Imagine bands of teenagers attacking little old ladies,

244
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,760
beating them with nightsticks,

245
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,680
and slashing them with knives,

246
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,060
leading them off to prison.

247
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,560
Imagine groups of school children

248
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,960
attacking non-initiated children,

249
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,700
beating and slaughtering them.

250
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,420
Tying them up until the police arrive

251
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,820
to arrest the Christian children.

252
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,580
Imagine gangs of little old initiated ladies

253
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,020
attacking non-initiated children

254
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,140
and dragging them off to prisons.

255
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,380
And when satanic handcuffs or rope goes on,

256
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,480
it never comes off until you're dead.

257
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,940
Imagine children turning in their parents

258
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,820
and parents dragging their tainted children to prisons.

259
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,700
Imagine a group of people

260
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,220
of young teenage girls

261
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,740
attacking non-initiated men

262
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,480
with baseball bats,

263
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,140
knocking them senseless

264
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,320
and carrying them to prisons.

265
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,040
And motorcycle gangs,

266
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,660
such as the pagans and the warlocks

267
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,620
and hell's angels,

268
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,620
all charging about on their bikes,

269
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,760
hunting down and capturing Christians.

270
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,600
Most Christians will offer little or no resistance

271
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,880
to these satanic youth attacks.

272
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,880
In fact, most Christians

273
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,520
do not even own guns.

274
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,540
In their sheer stupidity,

275
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,340
they believe that owning a gun is a lack of faith.

276
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,160
And yes, some Christians will resist with weapons.

277
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,460
And this is a reference to David Koresh, friend.

278
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,600
And this is no problem for the future youth force.

279
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
They just get on their communicators

280
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,080
and call the police.

281
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,480
And a heavily armed super-trained SWAT team

282
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,400
will be called in.

283
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,440
They will easily drive the Christians out with tear gas,

284
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,860
stun grenades, and even guns.

285
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,060
And their M16s and shotguns.

286
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,020
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo.

287
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,100
If the Christians do not come out from the tear gas,

288
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,480
they will come in after them.

289
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,500
Ten-gauge shotguns and explosively charged battering rams

290
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,620
can knock down any door.

291
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,020
Plastic explosives can smash giant holes in any walls.

292
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,980
But what happens when a few Christians are heavily armed

293
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,980
with, and this is the Koresh part,

294
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,380
bulletproof vests, tear gas masks,

295
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,920
automatic weapons, and high-powered rifles?

296
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,460
No problem.

297
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,640
You just use the Philadelphia Plan.

298
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,600
Invented by Mayor Wilson Goode,

299
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,000
you drop an incendiary bomb by helicopter

300
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,380
and blow the house apart in flames.

301
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,900
And if the Christians don't run out,

302
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,200
they burn to death.

303
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,040
And if they do run out shooting,

304
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,700
they will be blown away by police snipers.

305
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,300
If they run out aflame,

306
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,880
they will either be allowed to burn to death

307
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,460
or splashed with fire extinguishers

308
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,100
and led off to prisons,

309
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,660
tossed into the death chambers.

310
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,440
No doubt they will be stripped naked

311
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,700
and kept in handcuffs so they cannot resist

312
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,760
what is to come later on.

313
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,980
They will probably be fed nothing

314
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,160
nor given any fresh water.

315
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,220
And they will have to lay in their own feces and urine.

316
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,400
Possibly stale bread will be thrown onto the floor

317
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,520
and possibly water will be sprayed in with hoses

318
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,900
so that they are forced to lap it up as dogs

319
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,840
amidst the urine, waste and blood

320
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,560
from injuries and mewnstration.

321
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,940
As it says here.

322
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,720
But who will be the future prison guards?

323
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,740
Why, the most sadistic, sick and savage ex-prisoners

324
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,400
become the new prison guards, of course.

325
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,140
The subgeniuses, the most brutal rapists,

326
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,140
murderers and perverts will be assigned

327
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,420
to take care of the Christians.

328
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,460
No doubt Christians will be selected

329
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,340
for daily beatings and tortures.

330
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,720
Select girls, boys,

331
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,580
and women will be chosen for sexual rapes.

332
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,960
In front of all, pregnant women will no doubt

333
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,780
be booted several times in the stomachs

334
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,540
to prevent the birth of another Christian.

335
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,520
This is all, once again, my friends,

336
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,000
from a Christian book called The Answer.

337
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,660
Two raptures, available at any good American supermarket.

338
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,100
And...

339
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,000
Let's see.

340
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,620
Oh, the Christians will be led to their deaths

341
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,120
in giant sports stadiums and complexes of the world,

342
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,200
such as the Los Angeles Coliseum,

343
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,400
the Houston Astronome,

344
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,800
all naked and handcuffed, beaten and abused.

345
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,000
And before the Luciferic juries and the field stadiums,

346
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,860
Christians will be given their last chance

347
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,540
to worship Satan as God,

348
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,180
or be put to death.

349
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,140
And the method of death will be decapitation,

350
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,700
beheading, we are told, in the Bible.

351
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,860
In Revelation chapter 20, why beheading?

352
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,020
Because it is the bloodiest and most terrifying

353
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,900
and most systematic death, death ever to face.

354
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,480
When the cartoroid arteries in your neck are severed,

355
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,040
the blood literally spurts out everywhere.

356
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,100
And sometimes your head is alive

357
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,860
for up to 10 to 15 seconds,

358
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,080
looking about at a stadium,

359
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,720
a Satanic stadium, cheering madly,

360
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,060
and then you are gone.

361
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,000
This terrifying form of death

362
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,620
is purposely designed to terrify the Christian.

363
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,800
And no doubt, as they are led to slaughter

364
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,400
in these giant sports stadiums and complexes,

365
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,460
the rock bands will be blaring away some Satanic tune.

366
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,760
Possibly the old Rolling Stones classic,

367
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,180
Sympathy for the Devil,

368
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,980
Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love,

369
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,340
the ELP classic, Jerusalem,

370
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,300
Atlantis by Donovan,

371
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,500
or possibly even Pat Benatar's We Are Invincible.

372
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,680
Maybe they will even slice or chop the heads

373
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,100
off of Christians in synchronicity

374
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,500
to the beat of the rock bands.

375
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,380
Oh dear friends,

376
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,940
it's a scary, scary world a-comin',

377
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,480
according to these fine, fine preachers,

378
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,940
and according to this fine background music

379
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,920
by Saint Tommy Lopez.

380
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,200
Oh, what have we here?

381
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,660
What other things have we?

382
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,420
There's not all that many tapes,

383
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,800
but there is...

384
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,440
Oh, I should mention that

385
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,780
grinning evil death rant

386
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,560
that I was doing earlier

387
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:50,360
about the evil of killer Bob Dobbs and so forth.

388
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,120
Dr. Legume actually created that

389
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,420
from an AIDS pamphlet that he found.

390
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,260
Most of the stuff we do is based on real

391
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,820
non-Dobbs-ful things.

392
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,980
And here's Dr. Legume's letter

393
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,720
that came with that rant.

394
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,420
Here's my latest still-warm-from-the-devil's-hip-pocket pamphlet.

395
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,980
I'm gonna pass out a buttload of them

396
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,620
to foolish toady Christians this Saturday

397
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,500
at the Peter Popoff Miracle Crusade.

398
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,360
You'll notice I included the sacred P.O. box,

399
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,820
so the stink trail will lead back to you.

400
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,060
Joy, joy.

401
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,940
Says...

402
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,680
Evil...

403
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,320
Dr. Legume.

404
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,700
And, well, I don't know what,

405
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,000
we've got lots of lovely, sarcastic music here to play

406
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,020
and letters from the followers

407
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,200
and some news about the pilgrimage,

408
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,240
the subgenius universal pilgrimage

409
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,380
coming up, uh, yes.

410
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,860
Ahem.

411
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,700
And, uh...

412
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,820
What do you say to this?

413
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,140
Oh, my friend,

414
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,040
how far have you progressed from the Stone Age?

415
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,540
How far have we advanced from the ooze and the slime?

416
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,080
Are the present doctors really miracle men of medicine?

417
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,760
What have they cured?

418
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,480
What have they controlled?

419
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,860
In the next few minutes,

420
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,840
you will be shown a special example.

421
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,560
My friend, this is not the 10th century,

422
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,860
but the 20th century.

423
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,400
I firmly suggest that if you are squeamish,

424
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,120
please keep your eyes closed.

425
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,860
Or better yet, leave the room.

426
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,660
I do not advise that children hear this.

427
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,040
But for you of the strong stomach and the open of mind,

428
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,900
I predict that there is one enemy we have not conquered

429
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,080
and in our lifetime we never will conquer,

430
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,440
and that is leprosy.

431
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,400
Leprosy, yes, leprosy.

432
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,940
The curse of the ancients,

433
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,660
the blemish of the present,

434
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,120
and the scar on the face of the world.

435
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,000
The festering face of the future.

436
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,580
Leprosy inhabits the bodies of the damned.

437
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,340
Leprosy is highly contagious.

438
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,340
The Chinese know that even a look from a leper

439
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,340
can bring you down with this dreaded disease.

440
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,140
Leprosy is called the walking death.

441
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,840
Leprosy, the indwelling devil.

442
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,620
Leprosy, the result of yesterday's sin, tomorrow.

443
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,660
Oh, my friend,

444
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,080
we talk about this just for you

445
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,140
to show you the karma

446
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,160
of the 20th century.

447
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,120
These pour on the face,

448
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,240
this spreads to the face,

449
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,560
leaving it puckered and thickened.

450
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,780
The eyesight dims and is soon gone.

451
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,780
The voice goes to a heavy whisper

452
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,460
and then stops.

453
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,180
The nerve vanishes.

454
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,700
The bones of the fingers rot, decay.

455
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,760
Also the toes then drop away.

456
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,760
And then you stumble into the pits of death.

457
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,900
Close the quote.

458
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,680
So says the good doctor Joseph Neely Hopkins.

459
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,280
Now...

460
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,660
Oh, thank you, doctor.

461
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,080
He's ready to lick my wallet.

462
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,960
What we need is someone to take this church off our hands

463
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,700
is what we need.

464
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,560
Okay, what's your church and what's your name?

465
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,960
First Church of the Good Discount, House of Faith.

466
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,260
Hey, that's my church.

467
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:14,960
That's your church?

468
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,920
Hello?

469
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,680
This is a true story.

470
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,020
You're giving the church away?

471
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,280
No, we're actually...

472
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,280
You're man enough to take it.

473
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,400
Oh, well, what if you give it away?

474
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,560
What are you people gonna do?

475
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,920
Well, we're gonna do something fun.

476
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,840
Oh, yeah?

477
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,280
Yeah, we're gonna quit working for God.

478
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,340
We're gonna go to Green Hill and get glanscating.

479
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:30,760
That's right.

480
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,400
It's part of the plan.

481
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:38,040
They'll come up, and there will be the sickening and the healing.

482
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,560
What happened to all the doctors?

483
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,140
What happened to the exploding golf ball?

484
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,520
And what happened to the patient that caught fire on the table?

485
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,480
This is Reverend Terence Austin Stritch.

486
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,240
Well, listen, the phones are ringing off the wall,

487
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,780
and we'd like to help you out, but honestly,

488
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,040
we're just gonna have to turn your tape off because...

489
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,540
President Nixon is on the phone.

490
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,980
Line 3, Dr. Puzzling Evidence, and please pick up line 3.

491
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,400
Okay.

492
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,860
Well, thank you.

493
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,940
Hello, this is Dan Weisberg.

494
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,480
Can I come to your convention and get my head launched?

495
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,800
Uh, yes.

496
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,360
Oh, it's just a funny show.

497
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
Yes, it's a funny show.

498
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,740
Hello, tiny little caller.

499
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,220
Hello.

500
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,320
Wow, I don't believe it.

501
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,540
This is actually a live show.

502
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,440
No, it's just a tape show.

503
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:20,560
It's not.

504
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,400
It's all taped.

505
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,180
Oh, my God.

506
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,520
Oh, my God.

507
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,760
The tape's set at the wrong speed.

508
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,680
Speak up.

509
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:28,680


510
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:28,680


511
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,740
You're kind of crazy.

512
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,720
What do you mean you called in without finding out what you were calling?

513
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,440
Oh, I knew it was the Church of the Subgenius because I'm a member, but, uh...

514
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,020
You were a member?

515
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:41,740
You were a member.

516
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,080


517
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,980
Yeah, what do you remember?

518
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,180
Oh, you've changed the name.

519
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,620
Oh, right.

520
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,160
Okay, go ahead.

521
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,720
Yes, well, it's a new church, and it's a whole new story, and...

522
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,180
You're not the white-haired guy that's on all the time.

523
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,520
And before that, it gets weird, because then there comes the age of giant underwater scorpions.

524
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:54,520


525
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:54,520


526
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:54,520


527
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:54,520


528
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,820
And wiggly, oogly things wiggling through the primeval muck.

529
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,760
Boy, we pass them on with the show.

530
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,680
Because we don't get up on that chart without enough of them.

531
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,020
In fact, any subgenius can chew up any denomination money and pass what he wants onto the show.

532
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,020
And they often do.

533
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,760
Yes, they do.

534
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,140
In places you've never imagined.

535
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,260
And with things that you can't believe.

536
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,240
Well, we know where we usually pass things from, don't we?

537
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,040
Yes, we do.

538
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,640
Sign here.

539
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,320
Yes, from Bob and two others.

540
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,560
I want to go explain something.

541
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,360
I tuned in my radio a few minutes ago.

542
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,200
And sign here.

543
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,560
And I tuned in to KPSA, and there you go.

544
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,300
Sign here, please.

545
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:22,620
We're signing papers.

546
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
Okay, here I go.

547
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,280
And...

548
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:24,500
What's the sign?

549
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,000
Do you want the church?

550
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,160
Okay, that's right.

551
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,020
We have to sign things.

552
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,700
We've got somebody to sign.

553
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,840
I want to say, we've got somebody here that takes at least two groups of people.

554
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,400
I'll be all right.

555
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,800
I exist because the world's in my...

556
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,240
In my telephone, yes.

557
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,420
Well, actually, the church only exists because we have the paperwork on it right here.

558
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,260
Do you want the church, sir?

559
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,740
Sign here, please.

560
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,280
Thank you.

561
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,980
My mouth works, therefore I am.

562
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,200
Well, I think I'm going to go out and stoke up the old wood fire.

563
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,440
I'll be back in just a few minutes with some...

564
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,840
I'll be back in just a few minutes with some tips on your future's on guardianship.

565
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,860
...puttin' on some bogus live stuff and go out on the roof, boy.

566
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,380
Yeah, that's what I'm saying, huh?

567
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,000
Kilns fired in edible 24-calorie silver.

568
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,180
Never before in human history...

569
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,040
Mm-mm, wish I was there now.

570
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,180
Never, never before in human history has the Pope, McKinley, Harding, Coolidge, Dobbs,

571
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,980
Mint, not a U.S. government body, commissioned such a rarity.

572
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,080
Delicious and crackling with a cooked skin of prepared edible material.

573
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,660
I think about it.

574
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,580
I think about it.

575
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,280
I think I'll have one right now.

576
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,420
Oh, I'll bet you.

577
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:24,420


578
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:24,420


579
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:24,420


580
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:24,620
I'll bet you have.

581
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,320
...and they grow into the same kind of animal as I do.

582
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,160
He says he knows you, Doctor.

583
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,700
Well, let's tune in on the monitor over here and see exactly who that is that's calling.

584
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,060
Can you see me?

585
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,280
Yes, yes, we see you and it's disgusting.

586
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,680
And I'm bringing the mirror close to my nose.

587
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,720
Oh, it's that Doctor.

588
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,000
Do you know who you're listening to?

589
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,480
Yes.

590
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,020
Which is the new voice?

591
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,820
People like your mother and father...

592
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,580
The new voice is the last voice that I heard.

593
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,380
...have human babies.

594
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,780
That does make sense.

595
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,960
There's the new voice again.

596
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,740
Must be one of those sub-dini hierarchical figures.

597
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,400
Mother and father, I'm going to call you.

598
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,400


599
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,400


600
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,720
He knows all the passwords and the secret jokes, so let's send him a new cartoon by

601
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,400
Stang and...

602
00:35:59,400 --> 00:35:59,800
Which one?

603
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,640
Which one?

604
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,900
It's either...

605
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,500
I think it's...

606
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,740
I'm going to take a wild guess.

607
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,540
It's Pope Meyer.

608
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,300
That's pretty wild.

609
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,020
That's pretty wild.

610
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,680
It is wild.

611
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,260
South, south.

612
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,860
Go south.

613
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,900
Go south, go south.

614
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,240
It's Terry Thornley.

615
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:12,960
No, not...

616
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,300
Yes, yes.

617
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:13,800
Farther south.

618
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,760
Farther south.

619
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,100
Farther south.

620
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,520
Farther south and out of the country.

621
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,920
Oh, it's Robert Desco?

622
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,500
Yes.

623
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,400
For the info.

624
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,840
You know, the same old people.

625
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,400
Go to the London Globe.

626
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:24,520
London Grill.

627
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,080
We'll be doing our show from there from now.

628
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,700
You will?

629
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,220
Yeah, we're going to have to do it from there.

630
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,140
Yeah, on Friday night.

631
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,420
You know it's going to be from there?

632
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,480
Yeah, it's going to be from the London Grill in Santa Cruz on Friday night.

633
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,440
It's going to be a remote.

634
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,700
And you'll really like it.

635
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,460
This is my show.

636
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,000
If I go all the way down there and you guys aren't there, I'll laugh just as much as

637
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,180
you did.

638
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,560
I guarantee you find the London Grill in Santa Cruz.

639
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,880
We will be broadcasting from there on Friday night.

640
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,400
Then don't you do anything but bow your head and kiss your fanny that you even know about

641
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:51,640
it.

642
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,400
You've got the little white stuff you put on your nose so it doesn't chip here.

643
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,720
Are you people pro-capital punishment?

644
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,180
That's the white stuff you put in your nose.

645
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,780
I want the white stuff you put on your nose.

646
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,340
We are capital punishment, dear friends.

647
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:15,420
And yeah, there was a nice little classic old stretch of very old show, the old KPFA

648
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:21,980
show from the subgeniuses of Berkeley.

649
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,340
And that was a passion.

650
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,180
And it was packed when it was.

651
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:31,820
G. Gordon Gordon and Glass Madness guesting with the great Gary Gbrok friend, Puzzling

652
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,620
Evidence, and Dr. Howell.

653
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,800
That show's been howling away for many a year now.

654
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:45,240
It's gone through a lot of changes and there's infinite amounts of old, old tape of old,

655
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,860
old, old men we can always whip out on you.

656
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,420
Hey.

657
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,640
Hey.

658
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,720
Hey.

659
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,220
Hey.

660
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,240
Hey.

661
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,560
Hey.

662
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:54,980
There you go.

663
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,780
Hey.

664
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:55,900
Hey.

665
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:55,900


666
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:55,900


667
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:55,900


668
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:55,900


669
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:55,900


670
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:55,900


671
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:55,980
Hey.

672
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,200
So you come out and you draw and you say, bam, bam.

673
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:01,740
Stop.

674
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,980
And a guy doesn't stop, then you move up to the head and you put one right there and

675
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,660
that's usually fine.

676
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,340
Get that spear away from me.

677
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,800
Get it away.

678
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,500
It exploded, it hit people that had not been hit in months.

679
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,260
Some began to dance in the spirit.

680
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,960
Others threw up their hands in exclamations of praise.

681
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,680
others began to dance up and down the aisles

682
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,260
others fell like they'd been hit by a proverbial chainsaw

683
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:39,140
and others tuned into the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack

684
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,540
and uh

685
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,080

686
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,100

691
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:21,980
yes and so in the the interest of equal time we're going to let the uh disgusting liberals be trashed

692
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,660
as well as the

693
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:22,660

00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,620
hope those funny crunched ass become stars

710
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,080
but don't talk about revolution

711
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,620
that's going a little bit too far

712
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,820
so love me love me love me

713
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,260
i'm a liberal

714
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:58,560
i'm a liberal

715
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,880
i'm a liberal

716
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:14,640
i cheered when clinton was frozen

717
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,760
my faith in the system reborn

718
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,620
i'll do anything to save our schools

719
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,120
if my taxes ain't too much more

720
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,240
and i love blacks and gays and black girls

721
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,780
Latinos

722
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,440
As long as they go

723
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,460
They'll score

724
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,400
So love me, love me, love me

725
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,860
I'm a liberal

726
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,820
Rush Limbaugh and the LAPD

727
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,280
Should all hang their heads in shame

728
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,260
I can't understand where we're at

729
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,480
Arsenio should set them straight

730
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,540
But if Neighborhood Watch doesn't know you

731
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,760
I hope the cops take down your name

732
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,700
So love me, love me, love me

733
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,180
I'm a liberal

734
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,040
You know, I'm the whitest person that ever did the funky chicken

735
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,080
Yeah, I read the New Republic

736
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,780
Rolling Stone and Mother Jones too

737
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,920
If I vote it's a Democrat

738
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,860
With a sensible economy view

739
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,380
But when it comes to terrorist terror

740
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,960
There's no one more red, white, and blue

741
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,000
So love me, love me, love me

742
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,420
I'm a liberal

743
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,460
Rush Limbaugh and the LAPD

744
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,080
Should all hang their heads in shame

745
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,100
I can't understand where we're at

746
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,100


747
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,200
I can't understand where we're at

748
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:14,580
I'm a liberal

749
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,160
Rush Limbaugh and the LAPD

750
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:15,860
Should all hang their heads in shame

751
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,380
I'm a liberal

752
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:27,120
You know, I'm the whitest person that ever did the funky chicken

753
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,680
Love me, love me, love me

754
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,260
Love me, love me, love me

755
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,660
I'm a liberal

756
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,780
Liberal

757
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,860
I'm a liberal

758
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,100
Liberal

759
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,500
Liberal

760
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,340
I am politically correct

761
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,480
Hypocritical, you bet

762
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,100
I am political

763
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,100


764
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,700
I am pro-gay

765
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,400
But I wouldn't want my own kids to turn out that way

766
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,240
I am pro-abortion

767
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,880
And for gun control

768
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,420
I'm for balancing the budget

769
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,540
And for financing overseas wars

770
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,620
I am pro-small business

771
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,520
And for capital punishment

772
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,740
And I think we're more controlled

773
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,380
By the federal government

774
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,080
Now I'm for plenty of changes

775
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,340
Even though I don't know what they are

776
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,340
I'm for helping out Detroit

777
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,400
But I drive a foreign car

778
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,280
I do believe in God

779
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,500
But I promote humanism

780
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,180
I don't believe in war

781
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,420
But I'm for wiping out communism

782
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,100
I'm for helping out the people

783
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,140
Now I believe everything

784
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,320
That I hear on the news

785
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,400
And I can't figure out

786
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,560
Why the Arabs hate the Jews

787
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,420
I'm an American

788
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,120
American hypocrite

789
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,320
Hey I'm really proud of that

790
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,860
It don't bother me a bit

791
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,540
I can't believe the US government

792
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,900
Would ever lie to me

793
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,260
I'm an American hypocrite

794
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,040
Can't you see?

795
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,320
An American hypocrite

796
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,260
Can't you see?

797
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,200
Now my TV sets on day and night

798
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,100
I'm an American hypocrite

799
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:27,100


800
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,240
Turning the shows on violent crime.

801
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,820
And I can't understand why my kids got a gun.

802
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,240
And I'm drugs most of the time.

803
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,440
I'm an American.

804
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,860
An American hypocrite.

805
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,660
And I'm really proud of that.

806
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,320
It don't bother me.

807
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,900
Not one bit.

808
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,620
Because I'm an American.

809
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,680
Oh, yes, dear friends.

810
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,600
John Bartles, the amazing John Bartles there.

811
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,220
And before that, Jello Biafra and Mojo Nixon.

812
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,220
And I should give some addresses now, I think, friends.

813
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,340
I need you to get your pencils ready.

814
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,460
One of them is a correction from a couple of weeks ago.

815
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,800
We've been playing a lot of material by Rudy Schwartz Project,

816
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,600
also known as JelloBartles.

817
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,060
Joe Newman.

818
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,720
And I gave his address over the air a couple of shows back,

819
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,560
and apparently I did it wrong.

820
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,960
I left a number out of his street address.

821
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:39,000
So any of you who wrote for information on Joe Newman's tapes,

822
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:46,040
here is the correct address for Rudy Schwartz Project and Joe Newman.

823
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,300
That's Joe Newman.

824
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:58,600
And at the post office box 4542.

825
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,800
Box 4542 in Austin, Texas.

826
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:08,940
78765.

827
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,460
And while we're at it, I guess we ought to be giving our own post office box number.

828
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,740
Yes, the post office box number of the Church of the Subgenius.

829
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,440
That church.

830
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:27,880
One of whose radio shows you are listening to right now for better or for worse.

831
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:34,000
So get that pencil ready and be ready to just send for free information from Bob.

832
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,940
That's right.

833
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,760
Bob.

834
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:44,800
Or Hour of Slack or Subgenius Foundation at, here it is,

835
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:50,960
the post office box 140306.

836
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:57,940
That's box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

837
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:03,260
Oh, we'd love to hear from you and send you catalogs about all the tapes, books,

838
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:12,500
and death, horror, and fun, free pills, drugs, and evilness, music.

839
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:19,040
And let's listen to yet one other old Subgenius show.

840
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,940
Well, actually, this would be a new Subgenius.

841
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,680
Subgenius show coming up in just a couple of minutes.

842
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:33,300
Reverend Susie the Flusie's show, which is broadcast, originates, shall we say, at WREK in Atlanta, Georgia.

843
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:43,540
Stay tuned for Reverend Susie the Flusie, who's unfortunately had to get, well, you'll hear the sad, sad tale.

844
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,420
It's that time of year once again.

845
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,620
Family and friends gather around the Easter tree to celebrate the lovingest day of all.

846
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,180
If you're still looking for the perfect gift this Easter, look no further than Baskets and Things in the Kenwood Plaza.

847
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,740
Jolly old St. Cottontail wouldn't find any better gifts himself than at Baskets and Things.

848
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:20,940
This year, instead of that traditional eggs or bonnets, give a gift of houseplants that'll still be around.

849
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,620
From many Aprils to come.

850
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:26,220
Baskets and Things also has dried floral arrangements that can last forever.

851
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,680
A gift that keeps on giving is wicker furniture or wicker baskets or even a gumball machine.

852
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,700
Remember that the most unique gift ideas for all year are at Baskets and Things.

853
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,120
They're in the Kenwood Plaza just behind Hershedy's.

854
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,820
Give a gift of love from Baskets and Things at the Kenwood Plaza and at Northgate.

855
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,880
Baskets and Things wishes everybody a merry Easter and a happy Memorial Day.

856
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:49,220
The preceding commercial was seasonally updated for broadcast at this time.

857
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,860
We're still working on.

858
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,160
What to do with the 4th of July.

859
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,340
Oh, welcome.

860
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,680
Let's see if we can get some sound up here.

861
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,680
I'm going to be real slack tonight because it's a frazzled night for the flus listeners.

862
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:25,560
It's good Saturday and welcome to Bob's Slack Time Fun House number 13.

863
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:26,940
Lucky 13.

864
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,580
I'm your slack sister and polymorphously perverse prayer partner, Reverend Susie the Fluesy.

865
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:40,260
But I feel the need to make confession unto you, dear friends.

866
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,840
I am stinky with sin.

867
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,280
Oh, purge me.

868
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:51,980
Oh, pop this red, aching boil of guilt and regret that feels like it's got its roots in my brain.

869
00:51:52,600 --> 00:52:01,460
Oh, I, the Reverend Flues, went out last week and got a job.

870
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:10,540
Oh, here I am in the belly of the beast and those digestive fluids are serving to eat away all that tarnish and crud.

871
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,960
It's been building up on my survival skills.

872
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,380
I had become a little complacent.

873
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,420
The sad fact is I needed the money.

874
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,720
The big problem was in the past few years I've been used to having free will.

875
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,380
Oh, that's a concept.

876
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,720
They don't take much trucking in the corporate life.

877
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,080
Any kind of will.

878
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,320
Oh, sapped will.

879
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,640
Oh, they love that.

880
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,560
Oh, but free will?

881
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,660
Or even will-a-dive?

882
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,380
Jobs, who did an excellent show tonight.

883
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,840
Oh, they couldn't take that.

884
00:52:47,860 --> 00:53:03,360
So, dear friends, by the virtue of my ministry and the auspices of here at WREK Atlanta, I need to make confession.

885
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,800
Oh, yeah, I got a job.

886
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:08,620
Oh, yeah.

887
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,240
And even though it's not exactly a...

888
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:17,180
...belch-level position, I just feel so filthy.

889
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:26,960
Oh, I'm just passing in normal everyday life, so you can imagine the amount of passing I've got to do to fit into a neo-corporate anti-existence.

890
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:32,440
Oh, there's one way to do it, and it's like treating the whole thing as if I'm on a mission.

891
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:36,580
A mission to bring you the slack that you so desperately need.

892
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,040
And if that involves getting down on my knees in the muddy...

893
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:40,520
Stinky!

894
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,400
...and getting trenches to find out what the lack of slack is like, so be it!

895
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,760
This is war!

896
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:51,100
I'm wallowing in the tar pits alongside my Yeti sisters and brothers.

897
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,000
I'm suffering, sweating, bleeding in the workplace with you.

898
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:00,040
But here's a little worker's compensation coming your way right now.

899
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:08,240
I want you to feel that slack flowing out of the speakers and into your cerebral cortex...

900
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,660
...massaging you with heat.

901
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:14,540
Healing stinging waves of bob-given slack.

902
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,540
It's coating you like Bactine with aloe vera gel.

903
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,960
Dear friend, if you're so genius, you know what it is to be a spy.

904
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:35,880
You know what it is to have your life in the line every time you say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing and get found out that you're not one of them.

905
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,200
Ah.

906
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,280
So come on.

907
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:51,700
Let's slide into our trench coats, pull our slouch hats down low over our ray-bands, and slip into spy versus spy mode.

908
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,280
Let's go to it.

909
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:03,200
And if you're caught or captured, this secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.

so glad you can all be here

924
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,540
And when life gets old

925
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,620
so hard

926
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,340
you make it worthwhile

927
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,180
Screaming, shouting, whistling

928
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,540
and a wild hit

929
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,740
and bang style

930
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,600
This is dedicated to

931
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,820
our fans across the world

932
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:32,760
You're the best, most loyalist

933
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,860
and that's for sure

934
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:37,420
When life gets old

935
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,400
so frustrating

936
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,960
you make it all worthwhile

937
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,820
Gonna have some fun tonight

938
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,800
It's great to be alive

939
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,380
It's gonna be okay

940
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,440
It's gonna be alright

941
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,540
It's gonna be happy

942
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,220
You're the only one

943
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,580
to understand

944
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,520
It's gonna be okay

945
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,600
It's gonna be alright

946
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:04,840
It's gonna be okay

947
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:04,840


948
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,760
It's gonna be okay

949
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,900
You're the only one to understand

950
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,340
You're the only one to understand

951
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,860
You got the feelings

952
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,100
about this year

953
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,140
about this year

954
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,280
All is very well

955
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,140
CJ is here

956
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:22,800
CJ is here

957
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,440
92 smells more fun

958
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:27,800
92 smells more fun

959
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,500
Let's get it to you

960
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,020
It's the year of the monkey

961
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,360
Gonna be real funky

962
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,800
Gonna be real funky

963
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,540
Gonna be real funky

964
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,880
It's gonna be okay

965
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,220
It's gonna be all right

966
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,160
It's fun and при procedures

967
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:43,920
It's gonna be all right

968
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:43,940
C'mon come on

969
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,200
Let's go

970
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:46,900
Take it easy

971
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,980
It's gonna be okay

972
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,340
It's gonna be all right

973
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,080
It's gonna be all right

974
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,120
You're the only one to understand

975
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,060
C'mon come on

976
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,060
Are you?

977
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,480
It's going to be all right

978
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,800
It's going to be all right

979
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,440
It's going to be all right

980
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,320
It's going to be okay

981
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,680
It's going to be all right

982
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,220
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright

983
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:34,280
You're the only ones who understand

984
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:40,620
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be alright

985
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:46,780
It's gonna be and you're the only ones who understand

986
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,500
Who understand

987
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,500
It's gonna be alright

988
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,760
It's gonna be alright

989
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,620
It's gonna be alright

990
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,620
It's gonna be alright

991
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:16,900
I asked you a pro capital punishment or amateur capital punishment.

992
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,960
Amateur capital punishment or kill me.

993
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:23,260
Do you think capitals ought to be punished, Dr. Gabrog for him?

994
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,100
Not much, but I guess it's a...

995
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,680
Well, you can always get your parents to call in.

996
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,060
Miniature puterine reproductions authenticated by the world court at The Hague

997
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:33,300
and sent to you in moisture-resistant styrofoam chests

998
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:37,540
of the front door letter slots of the subgenius 36 most beloved characters.

999
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,240
Don't blow into the microphone, young man,

1000
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,320
if you wish to receive a beautiful Hummel figurine

1001
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,140
which revolves on its ceramic base and plays the immortal Lara theme from Dr. Zhivago.

1002
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,340
Yes, a special blue rivet advisory panel will ensure that the Foundation's Council

1003
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:52,240
certificated and inscribed insignia is approved by Dobbs,

1004
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:52,940
the master of heralds.

1005
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,240
Before the...

1006
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:53,940
Before the application deadline.

1007
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:54,760
No way.

1008
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:57,180
...to the potential guests on this show...

1009
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,960
Well, we are the potential guests, so wait a minute.

1010
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,820
What we've got to do is concentrate on those potential guests,

1011
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,520
and you can stay with us for right now.

1012
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,820
Now, Doctor, I think we should return to the basic finances of the church

1013
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:08,520
and just who owns the church and what we can do with what's left of the church.

1014
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:08,840
Right.

1015
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,120
Well, Ivan Stang no longer owns the church.

1016
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,600
Bob still has the foundation, but we've got papers on that.

1017
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,420
All right.

1018
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,040
Hold on here.

1019
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:15,360
Hold on.

1020
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:15,720
Wait a minute.

1021
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:19,100
What we also can talk about, of course, is what we can do with the church

1022
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,240
now that what's left is still here and breathing.

1023
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,940
Well, we can give it away.

1024
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,940
We can give it away, or we can just let someone take the church for a spin.

1025
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:30,140
See, what I think is people don't realize that the church takes two rooms to keep and grow in your house.

1026
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:30,840
At least two.

1027
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,300
And the maintenance involved takes up most of the week anyway.

1028
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:35,200
And it does not run on unleaded.

1029
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:35,620
I'm sorry.

1030
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:36,720
So...

1031
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,920
...made a big noise about going to the church.

1032
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,140
I'm calling in to say you want the church.

1033
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,280
If you don't have at least two good-sized rooms in your house...

1034
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,800
Yes, at least two good-sized rooms and a lot of money.

1035
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:44,480
And a lot of...

1036
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,480
And neighbors that don't mind Wotan showing up in the middle of the night.

1037
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,300
Right, and you need stamps and gummage.

1038
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,700
Get the idea?

1039
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,780
Or kill!

1040
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,160
Kill me!

1041
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,020
Or kill me!

1042
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,200
Now!

1043
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:03,280
And the guy, it got to the point where the guy he was bothering pulled out a .32 and let him have it.

1044
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:10,980
And at which point, the bullet hit him square in the chest and went through his lung and came out his back.

1045
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:16,600
But instead of falling on the ground, he walked back in the bar and ordered a drink.

1046
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:17,900
Get the idea?

1047
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,180
Or kill me!

1048
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,380
Now!

1049
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:21,440
Now!

1050
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,020
Now!

1051
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,200
Let's have a body count!

1052
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,780
Let's have a body count!

1053
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,160
None dead!

1054
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,320
It's a miracle, friends!

1055
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,200
It's a miracle!

1056
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:31,520
Bob!

1057
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:32,720
Praise Bob!

1058
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,100
Praise Bob!

1059
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,360
Praise Bob!

1060
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,960
Praise Bob!

1061
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,360
Praise Bob!

1062
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,600
Stamps and gummage.

1063
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,780
Yes, lots of stamps and gummage.

1064
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,280
I forgot about that.

1065
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,060
Would you sign here, please?

1066
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,260
Okay, sign here.

1067
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,820
I don't have any stamps and gummage.

1068
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,160
Wait a minute.

1069
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:52,940
I'm going to do there.

1070
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,780
Thank you very much.

1071
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,760
The world is over now.

1072
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,480
You can return to your bed.

1073
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,140
Wow!

1074
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,100
We're trying.

1075
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,140
Well...

1076
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,960
We're not trying hard enough.

1077
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:04,860
Well, it's certainly very trying from where I...

1078
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:05,720
Send us more money.

1079
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,000
How much would you like?

1080
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,660
Uh, 50,000, would you say that would do it?

1081
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,700
Uh, checks in the mail.

1082
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,840
All right, thank you.

1083
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:13,560
You're welcome.

1084
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:13,820
Thank you.

1085
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:14,260
You can expect your...

1086
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:14,800
Next caller, please.

1087
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:15,100
Let's go.

1088
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,920
We'll put on the automatic Bob Nelson.

1089
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,880
We'll put the automatic Bob Nelson on.

1090
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,700
Yes, okay.

1091
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,940
Where's my thesaurus?

1092
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:21,800
Where's my thesaurus?

1093
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,080
Ricky, Lucy.

1094
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:23,840
Here, Bob, here's your hat.

1095
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:24,860
Put this part on.

1096
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,040
Here we go.

1097
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,360
Now, get...

1098
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,760
Drive this station down Shattuck Avenue.
