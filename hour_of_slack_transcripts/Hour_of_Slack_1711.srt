virgo5141516 Specific Inclusive Truth Goal is B次

74
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:53,840
is from 1983 can you believe it and it was only invented in like 1980 right uh but it is

75
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:02,560
it's archived somewhere it was some guy talking about buck naked in dallas and church of the

76
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:11,140
subgenius 1983 um and and and the problem one thing a big thing i have one reason that why

77
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:19,280
a lot of subgeniuses aren't really wealthy right now is because bob did say he gave the advice

78
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:27,520
buy apple stock now at just the right time he had actually you know disseminated that that advice

79
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,000
but he still didn't know how to use the stuff and and so he had actually just written it

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,660
in a back alley on a sidewalk buy apple stock now he wrote that on a sidewalk in chalk and really

81
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,000
saw it so that's why right you know who did see it uh but it rained later that evening too

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,140
one subgenius did see it he walked by probably right after it was written um he was uh on the

83
00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:02,120
run from a biker gang who wanted him to make speed for him and he was afraid to do that and he's now

84
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:10,080
a well he became a doctor later uh actually a trauma room surgeon uh dr tillis

85
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,120
phylogenetic

86
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:18,940
you may you may know dr tillis anyway um he's now a lawyer he got injured on a job

87
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,340
so they have to pay him workman's comp which is about ten thousand dollars a week

88
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:31,840
anyway he bought apple uh way back then and he also owns a farm dr drummond he's a

89
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,040
he's a farmer and a doctor and a lawyer

90
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,540
with a beautiful life is very much beautiful

91
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,080
like a melodrama

92
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:47,800
that way in terms of farms my life is like a like a you know 1890s melodrama with the uh with the

93
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,080
bad guy with the mustache like snidely whiplash the whole deal the gal being tied to the railroad

94
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,640
tracks because my mom and dad had a farm and and they had to sell it oh my god when i was in my

95
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,480
when i was like in my 30s i was so sad it was the most beautiful place it was like 300 acres it was

96
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,960
this huge farm in new york yeah i know it was huge uh

97
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:18,420
and uh and they sold that they sold it and all the land uh because my dad got ripped off by uh

98
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,760
these people at his at the company his brother used to own it was a whole big sad story but

99
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,900
anyway uh yeah he was supposed to get a pension and this guy had robbed the pension fund so he

100
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,000
you know started having a million dollar pension he had to sell the farm literally in order to

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,120
retire and so and so my goal in all of this hollywood career see is to be a farmer and a

102
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,620
farmer it's important to me that i'm a farmer and i'm going to be a farmer and i'm going to be a

103
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:41,620


104
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:41,620


105
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,220
meen so my goal is to uh to uh to make enough residuals so that i buy the farm back i pay off

106
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,640
all my debts and buy the farm back so that's what i'm working on boy you know we have every time

107
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,320
that's a noble a noble goal every time we talk bleep oh i find out we have more in common because

108
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:10,240
uh my i didn't my parents didn't have this uh ranch when i was growing up i'm a city kid they they bought this they got lucky right after i left home

109
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:22,140
But my grandfather built, he was an architect by trade, and he came into a windfall, and

110
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:28,680
he ended up building a house on the island of St. Martin before it was ruined by rock

111
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,960
stars and hurricanes.

112
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:39,720
And he built a place that he called Ape's Place because he had monkey and ape-themed

113
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,460
sculptures everywhere.

114
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,940
And it was pretty, you know, modernistic Frank Lloyd Wright kind of thing, overlooking a

115
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,720
big lagoon.

116
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,560
Lagoon, yeah.

117
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,580
And he died when I was in high school.

118
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,380
Fred is the big lagoon.

119
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,160
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,480
He died when I was in high school, and that's how my mom got to buy this land, actually.

121
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:09,640
But his wife eventually moved into town.

122
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,900
And then to Miami and sold the place to the artist Jasper Johns, that jack-off artist who

123
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,220
spills paint all over a big canvas and puts a million-dollar price tag on it.

124
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,580
And suckers go for it.

125
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,860
So my goal is to buy my grandfather's house in St. Martin back from Jasper Johns.

126
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,260
It's probably not going to happen.

127
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,740
And luckily, I have this other ancestral place that's just as good.

128
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,080
Nice.

129
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,440
Nice.

130
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,280
I mean, we got dinosaur tracks here, for God's sake.

131
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,880
So, you know, I mean, God, that's just...

132
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,680
And Philo's farm has a graveyard.

133
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,140
He's got human skeletons out there from the Civil War.

134
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,160
Yeah, I've got a Civil War graveyard on my property.

135
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,500
Wow, that's really cool.

136
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,060
He could dig up skeletons if he wanted to.

137
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,240
Well, I don't think he's allowed to.

138
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,060
Well, no, but I mean, he could.

139
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,040
No, I could, but I don't want to.

140
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:08,740
Yeah.

141
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:08,980
Yeah.

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,980
Or cursed.

146
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,580
I could do a lot of things.

147
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,320
Yeah, I could.

148
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,140

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,100
I have to name an album.

180
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,140
I'm going to put new albums out on...

181
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,660
But, you know, that's so ironic.

182
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,820
You've talked to me about that two or three times today, and I remember you have a whole

183
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,120
website of band and album names.

184
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,740
Just hundreds of band names.

185
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,080
You can buy a band name from Philo for a dollar, folks.

186
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,660
Honest.

187
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,440
Listen to this.

188
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,260
Here's what...

189
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,780
Here's the new innovative thing.

190
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,700
I've had the band...

191
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,940
these albums out there in the in my website for free for years i'm gonna try something innovative

192
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:23,340
i'm gonna actually make cds out of them and sell them well that's what i did and we sell

193
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,100
i'm gonna get rich oh man i sell at least one subgenius cd a month

194
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,560
well maybe not quite that maybe not quite that much we used to sell a lot more needless to say

195
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:43,340
back when people bought cds but now they're like lp records you know only collectors do that old

196
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,360
people yeah and they're really cheap they can have them one to ten of them cost a dollar ten each

197
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,980
right oh well you're gonna you're gonna have somebody else manufacture them yeah because

198
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:02,940
see i just burn them no it's a burn on demand around here listen to this it's a website that

199
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,360
you upload your your

200
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,460
your

201
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:04,540
your

202
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,120
album cover you upload your songs and then they put the they put it into a jacket

203
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,440
and put it shrink wrap it and give it a upc code and all that stuff yeah the rudy

204
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,240
schwartz project has recommended that i try that he does that yeah this is the same and

205
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,560
they they'll do any they'll do from you can just get one of them if you want and the cost is you

206
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,540
get you can get one to ten for like a dollar ten each that's nothing so you know i'm not

207
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:48,700
i'm not wise for it just i grew up and it looks like it's too great and it's just that that's

208
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,060
great and then things get done you know amazingly you buy the cds and you get

209
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,440
uh raise money or you are like so they are you know it's it's the ones that have more

210
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:57,320
money in it or me more gets free and people terry clark is at 50 a lot of times he's really

211
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,540
generous you know and that and

212
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:57,680
and you know that�iano also doesn't stay up on theejay and filmуб or any of that

213
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,240
he's let it earlier you read with him and then you actually set this where customers

214
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,840
tend to buy their nuclear programs by doing something like that or something that you do

215
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,520
why does he have to work off that it is a non-profit yeah so they're sending them releases

216
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,240
They didn't last a week.

217
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,860
But most of my old, you know, if it's a name brand,

218
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,720
just like Memorex or whatever, those things you've held up.

219
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,240
My cassette tapes, same thing.

220
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,900
If they're most of the name brands, they sound just like they used to,

221
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,020
except for Scotch and I think BASF.

222
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,060
Both of those used bad binders that didn't hold up over the centuries.

223
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,960
And if it's Scotch or BASF, you can just dump it.

224
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,660
Dump it, I say.

225
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,660
Well, I'm going to have all my old albums will be reissued

226
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,380
with new album covers and original art.

227
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,900
But I'm in the process of also making some new compilations,

228
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,560
so I'm coming up with album names.

229
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,280
So tell me what you think of these.

230
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:58,840
Okay.

231
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,860
Music to frot by.

232
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:08,060
I saw the cover for that one on the Mature Gentleman's Club this morning.

233
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,960
That's right.

234
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,640
Philo's Xmas Party.

235
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,200
Bob's Favorite Son.

236
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,380
And son is spelled S-U-N.

237
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,120
Okay.

238
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,820
Then here's another one.

239
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,780
It's just called Stink Face.

240
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,380
I've got to go with Stink Face.

241
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,980
I was thinking Bob's Favorite Son was pretty good,

242
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,020
but it's kind of long.

243
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,020
Well, I'm not finished yet.

244
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,140
I've got four more here.

245
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:35,560
Oh.

246
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,200
The next one is Nose Runs, Feet Smell.

247
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,720
Then we have Grooming Utensil Blues.

248
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,980
And the very best of Dr. Drummond.

249
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,440
And then I have Dr. Drummond's Examination Room.

250
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,920
Oh, I like that one.

251
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,300
And Church in a Barn.

252
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,800
That's pretty good, too.

253
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,020
Well, that's physically accurate, too.

254
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,680
They're little, not that people don't understand,

255
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,300
but there really is a barn with a church in it in Kentucky.

256
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,420
Philo's place.

257
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,280
Yep.

258
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,360
Yeah.

259
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,340
So they'll be looking for those new albums coming out shortly.

260
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,060
Well, he only has maracas, but he plays them every day.

261
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,640
Yes.

262
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,780
He only has maracas, and they're here to stay.

263
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,320
Well, they come from all over just to hear him play.

264
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,060
Shake a jigger jig maracas.

265
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,660
He'll shake your blues away.

266
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,660
Shake them!

267
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,140
Shake them!

268
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,060

00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,200


271
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:54,700


272
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,100


273
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:56,680


274
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:57,680


275
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:57,680


276
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,280
Shake them!

277
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,460
Shake them!

278
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:58,720
Shake them!

279
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,960
Shake them!

280
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,820
Shake them!

281
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,140
起 College of nuke!

282
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,740
A figure of the lite in the sweetaclub.

283
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,900
Shake my boxing sheep head first, cause to the christmas deck.

284
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,760
If you can't stop 뭐

285
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,160
Shall I fill that team?

286
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,160


287
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,400
quest for Mr.

288
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,400


289
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,460
you'll see where I am on my huddles.

290
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:27,040
And you will see my waálht.

291
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,040


292
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:28,460
Go!

293
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,860
Just to hear him play.

294
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,460
Shake it, shake it, shake Maracas.

295
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,140
He'll shake your blues away.

296
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:47,340
He only has Maracas by the great Reverend Morgan Gutentag.

297
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,140
Ah, yes.

298
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:56,420
And now we return to the Philo and Bleepo Hour of Slack special.

299
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,480
In progress.

300
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,220
My little Olympus digital recorder says that we've been yakking for an hour and a half,

301
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,100
which is not good.

302
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,900
That means I have to edit this crap.

303
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,460
And also...

304
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:13,720
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,260
I gotta say, this has been the most...

306
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:25,900
I think so far you've actually achieved the most, like, sort of Johnny Carson PBS NPR

307
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,020
success.

308
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,260
Hour of Slack ever.

309
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,460
Well, I have a general Ed Sullivan approach to doing a show.

310
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:44,740
You know, normally we have, you know, a bunch of music first and collages and then the blabber.

311
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,660
And it used to be in the old days it would be a little blabber and a little collage and

312
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,640
a little music and a little blabber and a little collage.

313
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,500
But I don't have time for that anymore.

314
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,120
Literally.

315
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,300
Yeah.

316
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,000
You don't have time for that.

317
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,180
Oh, but I got one thing for you.

318
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,560
Okay.

319
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,120
It's going to probably take about five minutes of your show.

320
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,720
Well, it's two shows now, so it's okay.

321
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,400
Okay.

322
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,520
All right.

323
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,980
Well, the last show that we mentioned this guy on, we played a little tape that I made

324
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,540
recently in Boston with me and my friend Jerry.

325
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,080
Right.

326
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:20,000
I just want to be clear that that was Jerry Goodwin, a.k.a. the former Detroit and then

327
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,120
Boston radio personality who became known as the Duke of Madness.

328
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:25,960
Right.

329
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,600
Named after a very obscure at the time.

330
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,800
Fire sign theater radio bit.

331
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,660
There you go.

332
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,800
It was like it was like Snoop Dogg calling himself Snoop Dogg because of George Clinton's

333
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,420
atomic dog.

334
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,980
It always comes back.

335
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,500
Oh, by the way, one of the one of the.

336
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,000
But but but but but the bit I just I'm just going to intro a bit.

337
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,260
I'll give you a bit intro.

338
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:46,820
Damn it.

339
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,160
Okay.

340
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:47,820
Okay.

341
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,280
This is an old bit by Bleepo Abernathy, a.k.a.

342
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,840
Bill Cates is his earth name.

343
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,700
And.

344
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:02,220
Jerry Goodwin, the Duke of Madness from WBCN in Boston in the early 1980s.

345
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:02,680
Go.

346
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,540
And now.

347
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,440
Highway Madness.

348
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,520
Peter Jenkins is a perfectly ordinary traveling salesman traveling a perfectly ordinary American

349
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,420
highway when he decides to turn on the radio.

350
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,580
Well, how about a budget burger?

351
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,160
A budget burger with fries.

352
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,560
Sounds delicious, budget.

353
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,280
So come on over to the pledges.

354
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,480
Because Pledges is the place to go.

355
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,860
Pledges, a self-sustaining restaurant system.

356
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,440
Oh, God, those ads on radio are getting crazier every day.

357
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,920
I am getting hungry.

358
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,280
Let's see restaurants this exit.

359
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,020
Oh, my God.

360
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,660
What do you know?

361
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,860
It's it's a Pledges.

362
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,660
I swore to myself I'd never go into one of those places.

363
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,960
It looks like the only place around.

364
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,440
You what hunger will do to a man.

365
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
Look, aTV host and Oak Grove.

366
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,540
See that Homeless Bulldog out there?

367
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:10,540


368
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,660
Look at all these people, they look exactly the same.

369
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,400
Like some, some hideous crossbreeding between an overfed child and some kind of enormous pig.

370
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,460
Oh, here comes one now.

371
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,500
Hello. Welcome to Pudges. Come on in. Sit down.

372
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,540
Well, thank you. I just came in to...

373
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,360
Have a seat. Now, since today is Happy Day,

374
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,960
we feature as our special a big bowl of Pudge chili

375
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,020
with Pudge fries and choice of beverage.

376
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,520
Melissa, thank you very much. I just came in to get a little...

377
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,180
What's the matter? Don't you like Pudges?

378
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,560
Uh, sure. I love Pudges.

379
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,960
Doesn't everybody?

380
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,740
That's what I like to hear.

381
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,880
And say, since you're such a faithful customer of all of us here at Pudges,

382
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,200
I'd like to take this unique opportunity to offer you your very own job.

383
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,460
Permanent employment right here at Pudges.

384
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,200
How does that grab you?

385
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,720
Great. Actually, I just came in to grab a bite to eat a little...

386
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,840
Oh, there's always plenty to eat at Pudges.

387
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,560
Just maintain group growth status production quotient

388
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,300
on a viable categorical basis for the designated period of time in your substrata,

389
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,320
and you can have all the delicious Pudge burgers

390
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,160
semi-shakes and real taste pies that you can muster.

391
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,600
Well, uh, yeah, uh...

392
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,920
Yeah, and if you're obsolete, you're instant meat.

393
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,160
Ha ha ha ha!

394
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,360
Gosh, Pudge, how could anyone resist an offer like that?

395
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,240
Come on, Petey, don't you like Pudges?

396
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,520
Yeah, yeah, but listen, can I just go out to the parking lot?

397
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,940
Look, I need to change my shoes.

398
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,260
Uh-uh. Once you come to Pudges, there's no reason to wait.

399
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,780
So let's first take a look at the big Pudge kitchen.

400
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,180
Now, over here we have the Pudge home.

401
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,620
Pudgeaholic!

402
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,600
With a Pudge Memorial BBQ.

403
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,420
And as you can see, the human sacrificial offer to Pudge...

404
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,700
Because Pudges is the place to go!

405
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,720
Pudges, a self-sustaining restaurant system.

406
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,560
There.

407
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,120
Perfect. Scissor space.

408
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,100
Yep, exactly. There you go.

409
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,720
And I'm sorry, so I interrupted you.

410
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,060
What was it you were trying to say, Stang? Please.

411
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,000
Uh...

412
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:22,320
I was saying that the works of Bleepo over the years, and it's been a lot of years.

413
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:31,280
Bleepo was one of the, I'd say, second phase subgeniuses in the early 80s, maybe around 1982.

414
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,740
The very first phase was 1980.

415
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,700
And there's only about ten of those.

416
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,920
But then there was the second phase.

417
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,880
Right.

418
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,420
The third phase, I guess you get up to Papa Joe Mama, uh, Howell...

419
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,840
Most of the second phasers...

420
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,620
Yeah, most of us...

421
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,820
Dr. Howell and Menzler were in the second phase, early 80s.

422
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,420
Right. And I think we all saw it in Weirdo magazine.

423
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,120
Right.

424
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,560
Yeah, thank God for Robert Crumb. I can't believe he liked our stuff. He hates everything.

425
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,940
And it was Jay Lynch who wrote the article, right? Was that Jay Lynch?

426
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,020
Yeah, Jay Lynch. Jay Lynch was running...

427
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,840
Jay Kinney.

428
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,120
Jay Kinney wrote the article.

429
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,860
Yeah, wrote a...

430
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,520
Yeah.

431
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,720
He had a big article in Whole Earth News or something about us.

432
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,200
Yeah.

433
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,940
And those very early...

434
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:34,220
Another person who helped us very early in the game was a guy named Lou Stathis, who was the editor of Heavy Metal for a while.

435
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,400
Oh, right.

436
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,140
And he said wonderful things about the pamphlet, and then he died.

437
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,200
Yeah.

438
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,360
Of cancer or something.

439
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah.

440
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,080
One of the many...

441
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,540
Yeah.

442
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,640
You know, and our editor, Tim McGinnis, that got us into McGraw-Hill and publishing.

443
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,560
He died of cancer at age 33, I think.

444
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,960
Oh, man.

445
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,040
Yeah, it's nightmarish. I hate... You know, I used to hate the conspiracy, but I honestly...

446
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,840
Now I hate diseases more, because they're even more mindless than the conspiracy.

447
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,540
Yeah.

448
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,200
And they're killing everybody.

449
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,220
Yeah.

450
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,820
And not even old people. I mean young people.

451
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,720
It's okay. When old people die, well, duh.

452
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:18,960
But...

453
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,900
Right.

454
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,360
You know, it's terrible when somebody younger than me dies, and that's all it's been.

455
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,300
Yeah, I know.

456
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:39,840
Now, on the plus side, there's these ancient mummies, like Dr. G. Gordon Gordon and Reverend Zaphod, who are about 80 now.

457
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:40,980
And...

458
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,720
So...

459
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,300
They're...

460
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,120
Oh, man.

461
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,680
They're still kicking around.

462
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,440
Yeah, exactly.

463
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,760
So...

464
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,920
Well, some people have those lucky genes and some don't.

465
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,880
Eh, phooey.

466
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:08,880
Well, I credit, you know, just to plug the church again, because this is a broadcast, I credit the church with kickstarting some of...

467
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,820
At least a few of the...

468
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,180
Two immortal genes in me, you know?

469
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:23,460
So, even if my physical body does die, there's gonna be these little molecules that were activated by Bob that will never ever die.

470
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:31,740
Right. There'll always be somebody with the song, Frop Without Slack is like Slack without Frop, stuck in their head.

471
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:31,980
Right.

472
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:39,800
There will always be bleep-o earworms of those little weird acapella...

473
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,160
Acapella multi-track songs that you did.

474
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,140
Ah, yes.

475
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,420
They are so catchy.

476
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,160
Ah, thank you. Thank you.

477
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,700
And those do bubble up a lot still to this day.

478
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,300
My...

479
00:26:53,300 --> 00:27:03,760
On and off the road to Bob, we are marching forward blind.

480
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,440
He has gouged out both our eyes.

481
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,780
Ah, yes.

482
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,140
And he's laughing close behind.

483
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:26,900
He will sell us back our eyes when we join his noble clan.

484
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:38,480
For just $19.95 and a taste of our blood-cland.

485
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:53,020
On and off the road with Bob, he has handed us the wheel.

486
00:27:53,540 --> 00:28:04,760
And he cuddles up with Bob as he counts himself a field.

487
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,460
Our eyes are on the road to Bob.

488
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,460


489
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,460


490
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,460


491
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,460


492
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,460


493
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,460


494
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,460


495
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,460


496
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:22,360
But Bob forgot to say that the steering wheel went bust.

497
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,640
The road carries us away.

498
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:38,440
On and off the road for Bob, we will march forward blind.

499
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,440


500
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,200
We forgot why we came here.

501
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,060
We have quit all of our jobs.

502
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,640
Like a headlight frightened deer.

503
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,420
He has lit the sacred pipe.

504
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,380
And he's smiling at us now.

505
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,420
On and off the road, he's Bob.

506
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,340
He's our bull dada.

507
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,040
We are his cow.

508
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,460
That hurt, Bob.

509
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,680
Bob, where are you?

510
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,600
Stop it, Bob.

511
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,180
Please.

512
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,780
My latest has only been about 20 years in production.

513
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,820
It's called, uh...

514
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,400
I will run...

515
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,160
No, I could.

516
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,560
I'm sorry.

517
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,740
It's called, I could run you all over with my car.

518
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,720
And it's a bossa nova.

519
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,700
Wow.

520
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,160
Can I sing just like the first bit?

521
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,240
Sure.

522
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,600
Sure, go ahead.

523
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,760
So it would be...

524
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:01,460
I could run you all over with my car.

525
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,580
I could push on the gas and travel very far.

526
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,700
But I can't do that.

527
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,260
Cause I came to that.

528
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,240
Conclusion that everything is just the same as it was.

529
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,600
Oh, I can't do that.

530
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,340
Cause I came to that.

531
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,780
Yeah.

532
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,760
Conclusion that everything is just the same as it was.

533
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,780
So I figured this all out with my wonderful friend, Michael Mortilla.

534
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,860
And I performed it finally for the first time.

535
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,140
First time I ever played it with musicians.

536
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,660
And yeah, it was really fun.

537
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,840
And I'll have a full orchestrated version of it soon.

538
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,980
How do you do that?

539
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,380
That singing thing.

540
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,860
I just, I've never really been able to like do that.

541
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,020
Training as a small child.

542
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,520
Yeah.

543
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,000
Really?

544
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:07,860
My parents.

545
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,540
Yeah.

546
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,760
And my parents, you know, would play all the Broadway shows.

547
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,080
Well, I grew up with Broadway shows, but I can't sing.

548
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,220
Well, they, plus they pushed us into the classes and it was in our, my father's mother was a mimic.

549
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:31,840
Who was known in the Lower East Side as the woman who would imitate the butcher and the, and the, and the, you know, the butcher.

550
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,600
You know, milk man and whatever.

551
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,220
And she could, she could mimic all the people in the neighborhood.

552
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:46,620
And, and she's immortalized partly in her sister was a writer named Anna Yaskaricka who wrote the book that became the movie Hester Street.

553
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,200
What?

554
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,320
Good God.

555
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,280
That's, and that's, that partly involves my family in that neighborhood.

556
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,240
My mother's mother's family.

557
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,520
And then, so, so it's in my blood is what I'm saying.

558
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,380
Well, you know, I met some Cates when I moved out here.

559
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:05,860
Yeah.

560
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,800
They're probably not.

561
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,420
Were they cats in the old country?

562
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,500
That's just sort of a thing they did when they came over from.

563
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:27,420
They, when you taste their, their name all the way back to the 18, early 1800s, they were Kate spelled like your, you spell Kate's when, when now they spell it with a C.

564
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,760
Oh, really?

565
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,420
Huh?

566
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:29,800
Yeah.

567
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,440
Like Phoebe.

568
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:37,600
But they own, they were the family that owned my property for, you know, way back into the 1800s.

569
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,200
How interesting with, with a C or a K at the time.

570
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,980
They, the last time they were a K was like three great grandfathers ago.

571
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,260
Oh, okay.

572
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,760
It's like you guys are related.

573
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,820
Well, the skeletons anyway.

574
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:53,960
Yeah.

575
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,020
Maybe some of the skeletons.

576
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,720
Yeah.

577
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:56,820

Onan Canabite, I think set it up.

00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,560
Yeah.

606
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,060
I went to the doodah parade here with John and boy, did we have a good time?

607
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,860
He is a blast.

608
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,760

00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,800
John Hagenbrenner.

00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,680
He's so much fun.

611
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,140
Yeah.

612
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,460
Did you go to, um, did you try out Dobbs town?

613
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,940
The new mastodon instance of, for, uh, I joined it.

614
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,320
It looked like I was the only person on and except you.

615
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,200
Well, there's like 600 people on it now.

616
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,260
Yeah.

617
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,540
Onan asked me to use my bulk mail service, a constant contact to send out a bulk mail.

618
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,240
I sent out a bulk mail to everybody.

619
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,460
They're not all members.

620
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,420
It's just anybody who signed up for this little book mail list.

621
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:44,900
Uh, and about 5,000 people and, uh, I sent it out and 600 people joined that Dobbs town

622
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,260
thing.

623
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,780
Most of them are probably gimme Bob's not members, but it should be interesting.

624
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,240
Huh?

625
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,180
What could doodle, huh?

626

So we're going to have to kick them out then.

627
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,540
We're going to have to moderate it.

628
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:10,080
It didn't have to be moderated yet so far, but now let's take a break and listen to this

671
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:40,340
people making fun of shit now they well and the and the different time

672
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:47,640
man fireside was inspired by the goon show well exactly yeah and i'm sure the goon show

673
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:55,280
dudes were inspired by somebody before them yep yeah flanders and swan i did once ask

674
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,280
david osman of the fireside theater uh the blunt question how come you guys never got

675
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:09,720
doing a lot of tv like monty python and he said well we were hippies and we were really happy

676
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,640
doing exactly the same thing and i'm sure the goons show dudes were inspired by somebody before them

677
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:18,060
we felt so lucky to be doing these radio theater albums that people actually bought that uh

678
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:26,140
we weren't any more ambitious than that uh they started doing short films and that's partly

679
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:35,400
because bergman as a sort of a day job was manufacturing the showcon editing table system

680
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,100
which was the cheapest uh high-end editing uh

681
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:45,620
uh film editing machines you could get for a while they were they were not the highest the

682
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:54,380
most expensive but they were i worked on them uh right right uh yeah i forgot that he did that yeah

683
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,640
he did do that for a while yeah so they they you know he he was the guy with the

684
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:08,820
hands-on film experience i think and it was old school films you know they're they're the only

685
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,080
group that i ever i've never seen a film that's been so good and i've never seen a film that's

686
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:20,460
ever heard of that lip-synced a film to a spoken word album that is correct yes everything you know

687
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:27,340
is wrong yeah they they would they would play back sections of the album and wearing appropriate

688
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:36,640
costumes and appropriate sets would reenact what the album had yep yep and it's actually

689
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,960
pretty entertaining oh it's great it's wonderful yeah

690
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,800
it was shot by the i forget the the cinematographer's name but it's the same

691
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:52,780
guy who shot like et shot what he he was like steven spielberg's cinematographer he shot et

692
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:58,780
and stuff wow huh i forget the cat's name uh i think he's an israeli gentleman well that was

693
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:07,100
back when he was you know smoking dope and working with weird hippie art comedy groups

694
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,080
yeah i think actually uh i think columbia

695
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:16,320
records did pay for that i believe that was that was a promo film for for the album was the idea

731
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:48,340
i received your message and i'm glad to have this opportunity to reply as you noted it is often the

732
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:57,080
case among our religious competitors that they will project their hopes and fears upon an

733
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:06,260
external metaphysical world as if by making them outside themselves they are more real instead of

734
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,740
more realist

735
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,520

olivia

750
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,380
our members have been there and back. They've told us the tales, what they've seen and done

751
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:53,300
and smelled. We can know it for a fact. In subgenius hell, you get the chance to fight

752
00:48:53,300 --> 00:49:00,860
all of your enemies and win. They might put up a good front and give you a run for the

753
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:07,900
money, but in the end, you do defeat them every time. The battle might be a contest

754
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:17,740
of wills over the chessboard or giant spaceships beaming down hot laser death on rocky landscapes

755
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:26,940
of your hometown. That's up to you. Now subgenius heaven is where things are more peaceable.

756
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,480
You get all your comic books back.

757
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:30,840
Subgenius Heaven.

758
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:37,040
All those things you've lost, all your dead pets, they come back to you. All those people

759
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,960
you wanted to meet, there they are. You can talk to them. They'll talk back. Some people

760
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:52,600
might spend their time in a friendly discussion with Isaac Newton. Others might run down the

761
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:57,980
last triceratops. It's a blunderbuss. That's up to you.

762
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,860
Subgenius Heaven and subgenius hell, they start to sound familiar. They start to sound

763
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:11,020
like, well, maybe that's just the subgenius projecting our hopes and fears on an external

764
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:17,800
world to make it more real. More real than this one. Because subgenius hell, that pretty

765
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:27,100
much sounds like here on this planet, Mars, except we don't always live. But we do fight

766
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:27,960
all the time. We do fight all the time. We do fight all the time. We do fight all the

767
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,220
time. We fight with ourselves all the time and each other all the time. And that's when

768
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:38,020
we fight with the pinks all the time. The conspiracy fights with us. It's just fighting.

769
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:44,440
Fighting, fighting. That sounds like subgenius hell, except for the winning part. And subgenius

770
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:50,900
heaven, well, there's this theological question that comes up with, suppose I want to talk

771
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,800
to Isaac Newton and you want to talk to Isaac Newton at the same time, but we don't want

772
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,620
to talk to each other.

773
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:57,940
Maybe it's the subgenius heaven. Maybe it's the subgenius heaven. Maybe it's the subgenius

774
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,080
hell.

775
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:04,220
So it's like we're all just in this bubble where our dreams are projected on the surface

776
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:11,380
as we sit in the middle of it and we can see everything we want to see but other people

777
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:16,260
are seeing different things that are incompatible with what we see. And only one can be true

778
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:21,620
at most. Maybe we're just projecting what we'd like to see and it's none of it real.

779
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,940
Subgenius heaven, none of that is real. Subgenius hell, winning isn't real. It's just that we're

780
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:27,940


781
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:32,180
Maybe it's just us projecting what we'd like to see in the world.

782
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,080
Well, Reverend Funny Name, if you go down that path, you might think,

783
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,260
well, is the conspiracy a projection?

784
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:46,320
Is it something we imagine to blame for the failures that are just inherent in the causal universe?

785
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,060
And slack, is that just a word for things I like?

786
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:59,200
And Bob, is even Bob a projection of this guy that's a little luckier than we are,

787
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:04,300
definitely not smarter, but luckier, more talented, more handsome.

788
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,600
He ages differently.

789
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,180
He definitely smells differently.

790
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:17,300
Maybe we just project some things we like and fear and put a pipe in it and call it Bob.

791
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,300
Well, that's what you're...

792
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,040
That's what you're...

793
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:21,040


794
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:25,980
That's what your inquirer brought up to me, Reverend Funny Name, and I thought I'd address it.

795
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,960
I thought about it, and instead I made this report,

796
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:41,240
because I'm not going to be the one that projects my understanding of the Church as a subgenius on you,

797
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,900
nor you on me.

798
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,580
You've asked me some good questions.

799
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:49,500
I've had a good thought about it, and I think you know the answer.

800
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:50,960
And by the...

801
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,480
By the answer, I mean your answer.

802
00:52:53,280 --> 00:53:03,960
Because you have done that one binary action that is necessary for finding your answer

803
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:09,760
to the Church as a subgenius role, and that is you have sent in your free love offering

804
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,640
to the subgenius foundation and entered the book of life.

805
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,100
After that, you're kind of on your own.

806
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,200
You've got the pamphlets.

807
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,760
You've got the recordings.

808
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,440
You've been listening to the...

809
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:26,000
Broadcast now for quite some time, as evidenced by your previous letters to Reverend Funny Name,

810
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:32,580
but I just think that you need to turn this one over to your higher subgenius self.

811
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:42,060
Every human that becomes a subgenius eventually learns that that subgenius becomes someone else.

812
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,480
Now, I'm on my way.

813
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,480
There are other subgeniuses who've already become their third or fourth self.

814
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:53,620
They have their third or fourth face opened up, that blast from the ground.

815
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,080
You know what I'm talking about.

816
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:03,220
So I hope this answers your question by way of many more questions, and that you'll keep in touch.

817
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:08,060
It was a pleasure to see you at X-Day, and I look forward to seeing you again.

818
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:17,720
This has been Reverend Dr. Onan Kanabite talking to you from the plateaus of risen Lemuria on Mars.

819
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:21,720
Thank you.

820
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,180
Yeah, and if anybody listening is a famous Hollywood producer or director,

821
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,380
I'm getting really, really good at acting in front of the camera or behind the microphone.

822
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,040
That's right.

823
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,280
And you can reach me at my website, soundpup.com.

824
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,880
There, I just shilled for my work.

825
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:37,740
Right on.

826
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,680
Right, that's what you've got to do.

827
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:39,960
Sorry.

828
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,300
Yeah, there it is.

829
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:41,760
It's done now.

830
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,360
If you ever want, you can check out quiveringbrain.com.

831
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,880
It's a frigid, frozen website.

832
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,600
It's a website that's never been changed since about 1998.

833
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,060
Oh, beautiful.

834
00:54:52,360 --> 00:55:02,200
And Dr. Drummond, isn't it true that when you started it, you decided to break all the rules of website design deliberately?

835
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,840
Yes, it violates all the rules of good website design.

836
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,020
Yeah, and yet it works.

837
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:08,960
It still works.

838
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:15,260
It's an excellent example of what happens when you try to violate the rules on purpose.

839
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:16,360
Right.

840
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,460
And my frozen...

841
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:24,700
Website is subgenius.com, and the only thing that ever changes on that anymore is the hour of slack.

842
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:37,880
But it is an archive of 30 years of subgenius work from 1980 to 2010 or so, when I got bored with...

843
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,940
I don't know if it's really frozen.

844
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,180
I don't know if that site is...

845
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:44,700
I think that site is more like well-refrigerated gelatin.

846
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,520
Well, it's...

847
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,860
Because I noticed...

848
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:55,080
Little bits of the pudding, like, will change a little bit, but then the rest of it will stay congealed just as it was.

849
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:55,540
Yeah.

850
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:55,960
Yeah.

851
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,160
Am I right?

852
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,060
It's a museum, basically.

853
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,780
It's crystallized in time.

854
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,920
We've realized that there's too many subgenius...

855
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,440
I can't keep up with it anymore.

856
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:14,140
I can't save all the art and categorize it and make little galleries of everybody who posts every funny Bob picture on Facebook.

857
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,940
There's thousands of them every day.

858
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,660
Nobody can keep up with them anymore.

859
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,380
It's just a...

860
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,460
I had to just cut loose and go, I can't control this.

861
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,280
It's just a flood.

862
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,560
Just let it happen.

863
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,640
Sit back and enjoy.

864
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,800
It's like old Chevrolets.

865
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:28,520
Yeah.

866
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,780
Just watch them drive by.

867
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,980
You can't save all of them.

868
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,240
Man, I wish I had one.

869
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:36,300
Yeah.

870
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,660
I had several of them.

871
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:38,920
I had some.

872
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:44,360
Well, my parents had a Chevy for a long time.

873
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,860
From PR News in Washington.

874
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,800
I'm building a floating bridge.

875
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,040
Staff Sergeant Jiren explained floating bridges.

876
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,420
What are the...

877
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:57,500
And then the tractor trailers with supplies on them.

878
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,240
The temporary bridge is only for emergency personnel and PR News.

879
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,660
But Chuck says those details are non-PR News.

880
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,800
The Trump categorically rejects yesterday.

881
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,220
Pump says, quote,

882
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,860
And I wish security is tragic.

883
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,420
Iran's state-run news agency reports that at least...

884
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,800
This is PR News.

885
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,500
In the incident yesterday.

886
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,700
With British Prime Minister Theresa May floating from London.

887
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,880
Britain says EU.

888
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,060
The Trump was drugging and molesting his lawyers in 2004.

889
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,060
The broad judge in the case has PR News in Washington.

890
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:34,860
Anyway, okay.

891
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,300
Thank you guys for...

892
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:36,840
All right.

893
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:37,760
No, no.

894
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,440
Thank you.

895
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,320
Thank you for having us.

896
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,020
It was fun.

897
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,240
Hey, how many of y'all can go...

898
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,500
Yeah.

899
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:42,820
Yeah.

900
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,380
Yeah.

901
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:43,720
Yeah.

902
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,020
Yeah.

903
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:44,200
Yeah.

904
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,340
Yeah.

905
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:45,780
Yeah.

906
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,100
Yeah.

907
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:46,100


908
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:46,100


909
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:46,400
Yeah.

910
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:46,400


911
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:46,580
Yeah.

912
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:46,640


913
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:46,820
Yeah.

914
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:46,820


915
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:46,820


916
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:46,820


917
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:46,960
Yeah.

918
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:47,220


919
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:47,960
Yeah.

920
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:48,400
Yeah.

921
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:48,520
Yeah.

922
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:48,640
Yeah.

923
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:48,680
Yeah.

924
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:48,700
Yeah.

925
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:48,880
Yeah.

926
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:48,900
Yeah.

927
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:48,920
Yeah.

928
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,320
Wow.

929
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,740
Adios, amigos.

930
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,620
There it is.

931
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,180
Okay.

932
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,440
Hey, so good.

933
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,380
I hope that sounds okay.

934
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,480
So far, so good.

935
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:58,900
Cool, man.

936
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,400
All right.

937
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,500
I will talk to you again soon.

938
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,020
I'll send you guys the unedited copy at some point, somehow.

939
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,680
All right.

940
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,600
No sweat.

941
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:08,540
No sweat.

942
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,360
The edited, because the edited will be different, so.

943
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:13,440
Doesn't matter.

944
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,300
Cool.

945
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,340
Okay, man.

946
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,400
See you guys.

947
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,200
Bye.

948
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,360
Bye.

949
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,100
Now I've got to figure out how to turn this thing off.

950
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,700
Is that going?

951
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,020
Oh, you can't turn it off.

952
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,340
No, not that again.

953
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,200
It's like all the shows.

954
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,700
You can't turn them off.

955
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,880
And I just quit FaceTime, and I'm still hearing you.

956
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,120
I actually quit it on the computer, and it's still on.

957
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:40,640
Okay, wait.

958
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,440
I can't even find FaceTime.

959
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,040
I guess it quit.

960
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:50,780
Hello?

961
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:51,880
They're gone!

962
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,440
Two hours and one minute of recording time.

963
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,520
Well, that's interesting.

964
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,900
It's almost 10 o'clock.

965
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,800
That means it's almost 11 in Cleveland.

966
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:12,120
I could call WCSB and get on the Dr. Sinister show.

967
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,020
That might be a bit much.

968
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:31,040
This was our Slack number 1711, and you can learn everything at subgenius.com.

969
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,500
Or, prisoners can write to Subgenius.

970
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,660
Post Office Box 807.

971
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,780
Glenn Rose.

972
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,040
Texas.

973
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,800
76043.

974
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:47,720
Price Bob.
