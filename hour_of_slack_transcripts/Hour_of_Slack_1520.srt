1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Ah, it's all coming back to me now.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,860
And now if I do this...

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,620
Fast! No time for the stairs. Out through the wall!

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,680
No time to find the entrance. I'll just drive straight to it through the solid rock.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,020
No time for opening windows.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,580
Clark Kent may need a plane, but Superman doesn't.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,760
Here's Bob One for A1 Slacks.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,580
Hi, I'm Bob One for A1 Slacks, and I'd like to take a moment of your time.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,500
Thank you.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,100
And I'd like to tell you about the nice folks down at A1 Slacks.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,480
They handle a needle just the way your mother used to,

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,600
and the results are racers, capers, tapers, and bummers, such as you've never worn before.

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,560
The Action Man's Go-Go Now Generation Happening Slacks

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,800
for the Go-Go Now Generation Action Man on campus and off.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,440
And remember, you can get a good education and win valuable prizes, too.

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,240
Thank you, Bob.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:47,840
You're welcome.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,280
And now, back to our movie.

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,820
Wherever there is mystery, intrigue, romance,

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,480
in all the strange and strange,

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,920
dangerous places of the world,

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,520
there you will find...

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,820
Bob?

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,060
It's chaotic.

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,080
It's chaotic.

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,060
It's chaotic.

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,840
Yes, yes, finally, we can do it.

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,220
We'll actually have friends.

29
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,260
My microphone broke, and Bob made me come into the station.

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,740
He made me keep working, and so we're doing it.

31
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:36,900
God damn it.

32
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,860
From the very station itself.

33
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,880
As the...

34
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,740
If I push this button, now, theoretically,

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,260
this should bring this noise up and...

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,760
Yowl Slack.

37
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,120
Yowl Slack.

38
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,580
Bob?

39
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,860
Yowl Slack.

40
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:05,860


41
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,660
Yowl Slack.

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:06,800


43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:06,800


44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:06,800


45
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:06,800


46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:06,800


47
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:06,800


48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:06,800


49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,900
Wee.

50
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,580
Wee.

51
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,520
I'm here to fuck it up.

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,120
Yes.

63
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,360
Yes.

64
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,480
Are you stopping from Instagram?

65
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,200
Oh, yes, to friends.

66
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,460
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1,520.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,540
Big numbers.

68
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,060
That is a huge number.

69
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,960
And that strange piece of music we just heard was by Reverend Berne Bridges,

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,460
who I think is in Berlin, Germany, but I'm not totally sure.

71
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,060
A strange little ditty called Society Makes Me Want to Throw Up.

72
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,520
Before that, Flubber by Artemia Salina from the olden days.

73
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,780
Something called 30 Second Drum Bass Loop by yours truly.

74
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,420
And the titles were by the El Queso.

75
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,120
All stars with the Firesign Theater helping.

76
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,120
And our music in the background tonight is...

77
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,740
Well, it was sent to me by the name of Aeneas.

78
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:46,480
And it's called Aeneas Subgenius, and it's 56 minutes of techno of some kind,

79
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,120
with the occasional blurt of subgenius talking in the background

80
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,080
that I should probably talk over because there might be some sort of bad words in it.

81
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,820
So I'll just keep talking.

82
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,640
I'll keep talking right now.

83
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,480
And I'll tell you that for a little while, I'm going to read from one of our many out-of-print books.

84
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:11,380
The Church of the Subgenius has officially produced five, four real books.

85
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:18,480
That is, four of them were published by Simon & Schuster, and they were all in bookstores.

86
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,560
The last one, the Bobliografon, the Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack,

87
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,640
was published in 2006 by a pretty small publisher,

88
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:36,820
which almost instantly went out of business right after publishing that and reprinting Revelation X.

89
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,920
And now they're impossible to find, except on eBay, where I believe this book here...

90
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,380
Yes.

91
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,200
The new copies are selling for $300 in Sunfell.

92
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,440
Get out of town.

93
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,400
No, I'm not kidding.

94
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,400
It's a rare book now.

95
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,280
Goodness gracious.

96
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,300
I've got 30 of them in a box secretly in my basement.

97
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,840
And I've got a box of 30 of the Subgenius role-playing game cards from Steve Jackson Games.

98
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:14,320
I'm saving those for when the artists who helped us do these projects lose their only copy.

99
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,520
So they're not for sale.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,800
And I know that each and every one of our artists will lose their copy.

101
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,580
Um...

102
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,340
This music is dwerpy.

103
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,280
I don't know how else to call it.

104
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,980
It's dwerpy.

105
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,760
Dwerpy?

106
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,240
Mm-hmm.

107
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,240
Well, I was going to read something about dwerpy people in here.

108
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,680
Really?

109
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,220
Yeah.

110
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,920
Um...

111
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,520
Most of the norm worms are as blameless as children.

112
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,840
The lifelong conservative dweeb nerds that we can understand.

113
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,980
The ones that...

114
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,680
Drive us nuts are the sellouts and the posebuckers.

115
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,520
Those who throughout the work week are the most impotent of drones.

116
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,480
Taking the most pay to do the least memorable work.

117
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,600
But then become weird on the weekend.

118
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,160
Once they're out of the office, they're magical beings.

119
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,860
Witches.

120
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,940
Klingons.

121
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,300
Cowboys.

122
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,860
They're artists.

123
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,780
Rock stars.

124
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,780
And biker outlaws.

125
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,920
During the two days when they're not being paid slaves.

126
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,300
Oh, they might have started out as termites.

127
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,260
But they end up part of the woodwork.

128
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:40,600
Every week, they endure five days of kissing the butts of dominant normals.

129
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,500
And then compress it into two days of putting down the real weirdos.

130
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,560
The ones who are weird full time and can't fake it.

131
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,000
These hip wimps snub the plain garden vermin.

132
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,880
And they're just the ones who are the ones who are the most popular.

133
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:54,880


134
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,220
And they're the ones who are the most popular.

135
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,460
And they're the ones who are the most popular.

136
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,600
And they can have more trendy clothes.

137
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,260
And hang out posing.

138
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,040
And more trendy sushi bars.

139
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,400
And be more politically correct with more trendy friends who are all trendy artists.

140
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,440
The kind that tattoo their faces.

141
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,380
And hang gold chains from their pierced privates.

142
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,620
So they can give more money to Greenpeace and brag about it.

143
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,300
And feel absolved for the money they're getting from daddy.

144
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,640
Who collects rent from 400 squalid little tenements on the west side.

145
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
Or saturates the...

146
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:28,860
Countrysides with pesticides to grow more vast fields of organic spinach.

147
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,800
Pink doesn't just mean conservative.

148
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,240
Pinkness also permeates the reality challenged bleeding heart liberals.

149
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,300
The self-hating gays.

150
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,920
Environmentalists.

151
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,940
Pop psychologists.

152
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,320
Feminists.

153
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,540
Animal rights activists.

154
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,000
Afrocentrists.

155
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,140
Earth firsters.

156
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,840
All the Hollywood channels.

157
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,460
The big bachelors and amateur communists.

158
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,420
The McClain's and Fonda's.

159
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,540
All those whining dupes of some big daddy or big mama.

160
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:08,080
Too much false slack is what allows these trust fund rebels to exist.

161
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,740
The hip wimps always seem to know what's best for everybody else.

162
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,620
But stupid do-gooders can be worse than smart evil doers.

163
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,160
Especially if you happen to be evil.

164
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,440
For example.

165
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,000
Anti-smoking.

166
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,960
Bull from hand-wringing ninny.

167
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,620
Sully's world slacked far more than does secondhand smoke.

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,220
We tend to fear the world being destroyed by monsters or madmen.

169
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,520
But the smug do-gooder may well be the death of us all after all.

170
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,700
And the worst of it is, it'll be for our own good.

171
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,420
As G. Gordon Gordon said.

172
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,000
We hock up lungers and spit in your name.

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,800
Poser weirdo.

174
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,580
You're everything your top 40 rock artists rail against.

175
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,480
You are your own bitterest enemy.

176
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,620
What's hard to do.

177
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,300
No wonder you spend more on shrinks than we do on frop.

178
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,640
You are among the truly lost.

179
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,760
Those who will never find anything.

180
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,780
Because there's no you left.

181
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,540
We, your so-called lowest of the low, laugh at you.

182
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,240
Sure, you laugh at us.

183
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,980
But you haven't had a sincere laugh at us.

184
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,680
We've had a sincere laugh since high school.

185
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,500
Whoa.

186
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,060
Whew.

187
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,620
Other people's business seems to be the natural enclosure for many noses.

188
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:41,060
Thus, we find companies using pee tests to determine a worker's suitability for a job that has nothing at all to do with urination.

189
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:49,600
While at the same time, our legitimate pee jobs are outsourced to urinators in foreign countries.

190
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,620
Ha ha ha.

191
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,500
And Uncle Mike, the world's greatest

192
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:57,500


193
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,080
lazy

194
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,340
And if he hasn't done it, never should

195
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,960
flies.

196
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,980
ığ

197
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,320
Gunpoint if necessary.

198
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,520
Being a real dumbass sure seems to make things a lot easier, though.

199
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,900
Well, well, well.

200
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,740
A little reading there from the subgenius cyclopedia of slack, the Bobliographon.

201
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,760
New revelations from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

202
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,040
2006 from Thunder's Mouth Press.

203
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,200
Edited by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

204
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,280
I even did the layout.

205
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,220
Can you believe it?

206
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,080
I believe it.

207
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,460
And we're going to go to puzzling evidence in a little while.

208
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,540
In like now.

209
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:11,720
But Princess Wee, you should remind me when we're talking to Dave to rant about hipsters.

210
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,780
Okay.

211
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,200
I'll write that down so I don't forget.

212
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,040
I'm good for that.

213
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Because I have even more nasty, mean things to say about hipsters.

214
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,260
I've already written it.

215
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,920
Okay.

216
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,920
All right, friends.

217
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:35,980
We're going to take a little break here from this and go to that, which would be about 15 minutes from the Puzzling Evidence Show.

218
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,880
From KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Hal and Dr. Philo Drummond as guests of Puzzling Evidence as heard here.

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,380
Thank you.

220
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,840
There must have been a purpose to all this.

221
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,240
No, sorry.

222
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,520
What was the purpose again?

223
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,420
It's a...

224
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,400
It's a warm-blooded mammal that swims in the ocean.

225
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,680
This island purpose.

226
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,360
Yeah.

227
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:55,740
Mm-hmm.

228
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,460
The purpose.

229
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,060
Exactly.

230
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,800
The perfect example.

231
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:08,840
So, also in the news, they seem to have discovered a new radioactive hamsterness near the former nuclear site of Chernobyl.

232
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,420
Whoa.

233
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,880
Told you.

234
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,100
Sounds like good eating.

235
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,880
Well, you can do it.

236
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,240
You know, don't let me keep you back.

237
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:18,900
Go ahead.

238
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,420
You prepare.

239
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,980
They still eat vegetables from around Chernobyl, you know.

240
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,940
You betcha.

241
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,440
Yes, they've grown and flourished in the mutant...

242
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,180
I highly recommend the book Dead Hand.

243
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,180
I think...

244
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,820
About that very thing.

245
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,580
The plants have grown pretty good there.

246
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:48,640
Not only about Chernobyl and the miracle that is Chernobyl, but it's about the Russian machine that was set up with the three humus in it on deep underground so that if the war blew up Russia, if we got there first, the Dead Hand machine would bring its little...

247
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:48,720
Well, it's a little...

248
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,300
Scissors switch down and that we would be retaliatory out of existence.

249
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,040
All right.

250
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,640
And a couple of times things...

251
00:14:59,260 --> 00:14:59,960
It's a fail-safe system.

252
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,780
Yeah, exactly.

253
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,060
And a couple of times the only fail-safe was confirmed by the humus.

254
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,660
Because they read that missiles were coming toward them and a human stepped into the system and said, somehow I don't think so.

255
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,300
Yeah.

256
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,900
Saved us once again.

257
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,620
The only reason we're all here, the only reason we're all here is luck.

258
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:17,900
Yeah.

259
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,740
Just total luck.

260
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,480
Read Command and Control by a lot of losses.

261
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,980
Luck and a lot of people having sex with each other.

262
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,600
Well, that...

263
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,200
Command and Control.

264
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,760
Yeah, those two...

265
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah, I meant to bring that up.

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,360
The other one first is a lot of people having sex with each other.

267
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,180
Hey, wait, I have another...

268
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,700
And then nobody dropped...

269
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:36,540
Actually, many people dropped nuclear bombs, but because they were so well designed in this country that they don't go off.

270
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,440
Yeah, I know.

271
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,100
I'm afraid in Russia they did kind of go off.

272
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,440
They did go off over now and then in places.

273
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,180
In Russia.

274
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,200
Only there.

275
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,380
None of our system ever did.

276
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,320
One of mine went off in my backyard once.

277
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,620
But it was just because I was being careful.

278
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,020
I wasn't watching what I was doing.

279
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,320
It was also brought around by the first Jewish admiral in the U.S. Navy.

280
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:03,260
And if you didn't like having a Jew in the yearbook that the ship may know, the Lucky Bag is the yearbook of the Naval Academy.

281
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,940
They put his page on...

282
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,160
Call us back.

283
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:14,120
They put him on a perforated page so that you could tear his horrible religious information out of your Lucky Bag.

284
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,600
But that man went on to become why we never had any nuclear accidents in this country.

285
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:18,900
Ever.

286
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,640
Who was that?

287
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,140
Why?

288
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,420
His name was John Why?

289
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:22,920
Now his name escapes me.

290
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,640
I knew you were going to add that.

291
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,940
That's not Hyman Rickover.

292
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,360
Thank you.

293
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,080
Hyman Rickover.

294
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:26,720
Yeah.

295
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,620
Yeah.

296
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,100
Because the Naval Academy at that time...

297
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,220
Hyman?

298
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,160
It was Hyman.

299
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,940
Probably the 60s was a southern school.

300
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,560
So, you know, there were no black midshipmen for a long time.

301
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,500
There were very few Jewish midshipmen for a long time.

302
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,860
But these people stepped forward.

303
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,280
I love that perforated page thing.

304
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,840
That's amazing.

305
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,120
Oh, man.

306
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:53,120
But I already did the story about how Lieutenant Carter joined the nuclear forces.

307
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,240
What's the Carter on Mars movie?

308
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,920
John Carter.

309
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,860
John Carter.

310
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,460
Are they going to do any more of those?

311
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,520
No, I don't think so.

312
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,320
It didn't make that much money, so they don't want to do it.

313
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,940
I thought it was actually pretty well done.

314
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,820
I did too.

315
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,440
I liked the interview.

316
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,820
It was fun to watch.

317
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,160
Yeah.

318
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,780
And I think something about...

319
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,280
I don't know what it is because that actor, I thought he was sort of on the upward...

320
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,820
They were giving him a push too.

321
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,380
Yes.

322
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:24,320
You know, how they do that back in professional wrestling when they want somebody to be the

323
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:31,240
new champion, they give him a push, you know, and they give him a bunch of jobbers to beat

324
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,440
up on his way to the rise.

325
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,080
Yeah.

326
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,860
Yeah, in any business.

327
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,000
Except this business.

328
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,560
This business of radio.

329
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:41,940
Yeah.

330
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,420
This business we're in, this business of radio.

331
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,280
This thing we have.

332
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,880
And we're only 40 seconds away from something that lots of people really like.

333
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,920
That's true.

334
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,860
Something for everyone.

335
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,040
That's what this show has.

336
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,560
That's what KPFA has.

337
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,500
That's what America has.

338
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,940
That's what Earth has.

339
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,880
That's what the universe has.

340
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,420
That's what...

341
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,620
Can I stop there?

342
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,020
I think so.

343
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,320
It's 420, little caller.

344
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,300
Here's this guy again.

345
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,880
Yeah.

346
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,220
He's trying hard to talk to Dr. Howell.

347
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,260


348
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,260


349
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,260


350
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,260


351
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,260


352
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,260


353
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,260


354
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,260


355
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,260


356
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,260


357
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,260


358
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,360
My personal savior, the one who sweetened my day.

359
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,640
Hey, the caller that's calling and just jabbering, I need to know what do you want me to call

360
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,000
you, because when I'm writing up the show description...

361
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,620
To be frank, I'm...

362
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,920
What's your name?

363
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,640
I'm quite sure I crossed the line there, but I don't want to step on any toes or anything.

364
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,500
You don't have to step on toes, but I just want you to tell me what you want me to refer

365
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,120
to you as.

366
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,020
Dr. Howell.

367
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,040
Well, I met you in Bombay in 75, yes.

368
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,240
I was driving around in my Rolls Royce back in those days.

369
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,240
Okay, right.

370
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,260
That makes perfect sense to me, but what am I going to call you?

371
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,420
And when I get ready to write up the show description and there's a big section of you

372
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,960
and people want to know who you are, what do I call you?

373
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,880
You're probably being like two young little eager schoolboys.

374
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,520
We actually were back in those days.

375
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,540
Two young little eager schoolboys.

376
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,460
My mom and my mother used to cook us some nice rice dishes.

377
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,860
Are you listening to me, sir?

378
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,020
We never eat rice.

379
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,420
You're not eating rice.

380
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:16,420


381
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:16,500
Dr. Oh, it's just Jabber Babber.

382
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,260
Dr. He's just Jabber Babber.

383
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,260
He's doing his own show.

384
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,460
And what we've got to do here is...

385
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,700
Dr. We're going to have to give him a name.

386
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,840
Bombay Talking.

387
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,720
Bombay Talking?

388
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,880
He was that woman who always calls in the back.

389
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,460
Dr. Talking?

390
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,640
The woman that always calls?

391
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,520
The lady, you know, you're talking to.

392
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,260
Dr. Sarah.

393
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,000
That's Sarah.

394
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,400
She hasn't called and asked a question in a long time.

395
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:40,740
Spoken to Bob.

396
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,660
Dr. It's an incredible, intense microwave radiation.

397
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,020
You're talking about the supernova.

398
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,020


399
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,020


400
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,080
created these mutant mosquitoes that are distracting me.

401
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,700
Are you saying that the callers are just like mutant mosquitoes buzzing around our heads?

402
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,380
I'm going to go and eat now.

403
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,740
I'm going to call back later.

404
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,760
Okay, tell me what we're going to call you.

405
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,280
What's your name when you call back?

406
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,320
And what are you going to eat?

407
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,560
And what are you going to eat?

408
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,480
Tell us what you ate and what your name is.

409
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,480
His name is...

410
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,620
That guy calls in every week and he jabbers and babbers and says this unbelievable stuff.

411
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,100
And then I never get his name.

412
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,160
He never leaves his name.

413
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,600
Well, they like to be coy, these callers.

414
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,560
So now I can't tell his fans who he is.

415
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,800
He's got thousands of fans on this show.

416
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,740
And they want to know who he is.

417
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,260
And he won't ever tell me.

418
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,560
This is a bit...

419
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,180
That's nice.

420
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,580
Yes, little Tridzee Barnstable.

421
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,120
Are you down there in the caller pool and found out that we drained the water?

422
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,220
His particular contact information.

423
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,980
That's an insistence.

424
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,460
See, I had to describe the scenario for you before it made sense, right?

425
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,060
It didn't...

426
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,000
It was just an analogous...

427
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,680
I mean, a gelatinous...

428
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,860
A heaving gelatinous mass.

429
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,280
A protoplasmic blob.

430
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,460
An amorphous mass of protoplasm.

431
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,340
A horrible oozing heap belching up from the abyss of time's balance.

432
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,120
The blubbery blobber snob monster.

433
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,140
That's awful.

434
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:19,220
The loathsome, pulsating, expanding bubble bug.

435
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,620
Why can't they be a nice show?

436
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,920
The wretched blob.

437
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,280
Just cover you like a warm blob.

438
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,580
Ectoplasmic extrusion.

439
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,000
A loathsome, flapping, slapping, semi-liquid mass of...

440
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,460
When I told the cop I was high from smelling herbs and spiders...

441
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,120
He just looked at me funny.

442
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,260
Those seven herbs and spices make the colonel's chicken extra finger-lickin'.

443
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,660
Now you know why colonel's chicken was so good all those years.

444
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,860
The trick of picking a chicken is picking what chicken to pick.

445
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,520
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

446
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,980
I've got to pull myself together.

447
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Here's a fiddle.

448
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,700
Take this fiddle and diddle it.

449
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,780
Well, every fiddle...

450
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,360
It wasn't supposed to do that.

451
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,460
It wasn't supposed to do that.

452
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,100
It wasn't supposed to do that.

453
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,060
It takes a giant to hold down prices.

454
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,340
This is the part where the paint goes down to the styrofoam.

455
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:26,920
Giant.

456
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,720
The giant prices were...

457
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,680
At giant value.

458
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,420
Killed by the...

459
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,160
Yes.

460
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:32,980
Giant styrofoam.

461
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,760
By the giant comet that came and deflated all our store...

462
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,440
But then we were saved by the giant rocket.

463
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,280
The rocket crew that went to deflect the comet.

464
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:41,880
Yes.

465
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,420
In DeflectCon 6.

466
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,660
That's why the enormous asteroid...

467
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,880
The Hal just called it...

468
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,680
6-7-4-1-2.

469
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,280
SelectCon 6.

470
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,520
Otherwise known as the planet Gazobus,

471
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:06,460
never struck the Earth amid ships as prophesied by the now forgotten great hardyfarian called in 1272 A.D.

472
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,200
Are they like the Davidsons that you guys were talking about?

473
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,200
The Neanderthals, the humans, and the John Davidsons.

474
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,860
Oh, well, no.

475
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,100
It wasn't John Davidsons.

476
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,360
It was the Denisovians.

477
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,340
The Davidsons.

478
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:16,540
Yeah.

479
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,300
They were an extinct group of hominids.

480
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,520
Yeah, that's right.

481
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,220
John Davidsons.

482
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,480
Each one of them was named Dennis, and that's why they were called that.

483
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,120
The Denisovians.

484
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,100
The mysterious group.

485
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:35,160
Neither the Neanderthals or a Cro-Magnon, but the declined to state on the census form.

486
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,400
Oh, on the paperwork.

487
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,060
Yeah, right.

488
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,920
So one doesn't really understand.

489
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,900
But it's one of the mysteries of science.

490
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,040
So, you know, it's funny how these young kids nowadays,

491
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,000
they're finding out that they put a bob head on something,

492
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,700
and all of a sudden they get some attention.

493
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,820
Boy, if I could just...

494
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,280
I'd show them.

495
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,980
You notice that these young children, that they find a bob head and they put it on something,

496
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,420
and they notice they're getting attention.

497
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,620
They don't know why.

498
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,040
They just know that this face, this pipe, these dots...

499
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,600
Where did they get that sticker to begin with?

500
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,240
Yeah.

501
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,780
Yeah.

502
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,100
It's a power to provide...

503
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:15,000
Who's enabling this crime against culture, against civilization and decency?

504
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Well, I would have to admit that the Church of the Subgenius has been an enabler of certain,

505
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,040
shall we say, less than desirable...

506
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,320
Are you referring to Stang's War on God?

507
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,760
Is that still going on?

508
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,540
Well, not necessarily God, but let's put gods in there.

509
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:36,760
Yeah, but...

510
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
War on gods.

511
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,060
War on gods.

512
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,320
War on gods.

513
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:39,560
War on gods.

514
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:39,560


515
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:39,560


516
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:39,560


517
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:39,560


518
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:39,560


519
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,520
It was announced several cycles ago.

520
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,740
It's not really going all that well.

521
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,240
But...

522
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,600
It's better to have a war on people.

523
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,040
Everybody does that.

524
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,460
That's because it's popular.

525
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,660
I mean, people go where it's popular, right?

526
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:05,180
I wish I had a big giant finger on my finger.

527
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,520
It used to be you could buy one.

528
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,820
When I was a kid, we could get a giant finger for your finger for just a nickel.

529
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:24,280
I remember that, but it was surely after your youth, more like in your young manhood, that these big fake fingers appeared.

530
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,100
Well, remember the big wax fingers you could buy when you were a kid?

531
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,220
Do you remember the toy called Six Finger?

532
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:31,900
Sure.

533
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,660
I thought that might be what you were referring to.

534
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,900
An extra finger.

535
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,800
Six Finger, Six Finger, man alive.

536
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,480
How did I ever get along with five?

537
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,100
Those wax fingers, I was always amazed at how teeny they were.

538
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,760
Weren't they a nickel?

539
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,040
I'm thinking of the wax Coke bottles.

540
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,380
Six Finger costs a lot more than some Coke bottle, man.

541
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,100
And the tiny Coke bottles are made out of wax, and there was maybe a droplet of something in there.

542
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,880
Maybe you could remind me what else was so good about Six Finger.

543
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,480
You opened it up and it had a special compartment where you could store things inside your finger.

544
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,400
It had a special compartment.

545
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,660
You could put your joint.

546
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,760
You could put your weed in.

547
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,420
Wow, my ballpoint pen is in my huge swollen fake looking finger.

548
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,180
Plus, some Six Fingers could shoot.

549
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,880
It had a little dart you'd put in there.

550
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,300
Spryling.

551
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,260
Now we're getting into James Bond territory.

552
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:27,980
And, of course, you had some Six Fingers that could scratch and itch.

553
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,660
It appears that you have hurt your finger, Mr. Bond.

554
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,720
I hope the condition is not painful.

555
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,780
You could use your Six Finger to pick your...

556
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,560
...nose at school.

557
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:45,340
You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's noses.

558
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,800
But your Six Finger can.

559
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,360
Ew, I don't want to touch it now.

560
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,060
Your Six Finger can pick your friend's noses.

561
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,920
It's all contaminated plastic.

562
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,160
How many of those units did they sell?

563
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,640
What an absurd toy.

564
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,920
With everything else you can get, who needs a big fake...

565
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,900
Let me see if the internet has recorded the volume of units of selling it.

566
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,740
Well, does it have...

567
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,540
Yeah, because they say everything.

568
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:07,780
...have you...

569
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,120
Everything's there.

570
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,400
Have you looked up Six Finger on it?

571
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,560
I'm going to look up number of Six Fingers sold.

572
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,440
Total number of Six Fingers sold.

573
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,760
He's the man.

574
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,220
The man with the finger touch.

575
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,520
Oop, I accidentally typed sucks finger.

576
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,900
Oh, come on.

577
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,160
Well, there, look at all these lucabritious images you've called up.

578
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,500
Boiling up from the benthic bottom of the internet.

579
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,440
And then there are...

580
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:37,840
Six Finger.

581
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,920
Fingerlings, the six-inch fish.

582
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,940
Fingerlings, the motion picture.

583
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,860
Ah, yes.

584
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,780
I'll never forget the sadness, the pathos, the tragedy.

585
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,000
On Her Majesty's Secret Service,

586
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,060
Mrs. James Bond was assassinated by Bluffold.

587
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,260
That vile villain.

588
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,220
That was so sad.

589
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,360
I quit watching James Bond after that.

590
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,420
Yeah, it was Diana Riggs.

591
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,240
She got killed at the end of the movie.

592
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,520
No one saw that coming except people who'd read the book.

593
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,100
Yeah.

594
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,440
Back when they had some connection, however remote, to the original book.

595
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,140
Oh, yeah.

596
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,140
But that's just the way it is in the future.

597
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,760
Which movie was that?

598
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,040
The Diana Riggs dies?

599
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,640
It's the On Her Majesty's Secret Service.

600
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,200
Right, right, right.

601
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,600
The least popular of all the James Bond movies.

602
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,840
The only one with George.

603
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,700
Right, that's right.

604
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:37,700


605
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:37,700


606
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,360
who actually did knew a bad job,

607
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,960
but everybody just hated the movie.

608
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,700
Yeah, true.

609
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:41,700


610
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,340
And also, I mean, that's like saying,

611
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,760
you know, it's like the guy who

612
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,300
stood in for

613
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,980
Ringo Starr

614
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,120
on the Australian tour.

615
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,960
I mean, imagine the pressure that comes

616
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,140
Somebody wants the real thing

617
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,320
and you're the fake thing.

618
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,560
That's, you know...

619
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,960
He did a good job, too.

620
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,400
But nobody would give him any slack.

621
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,440
Look, man.

622
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:17,580
From PR News in Washington, I'm best known for intimate, spontaneous film style known as cinema verite.

623
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,200
U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon tested positive for the deadly virus.

624
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,840
This is PR News in Washington.

625
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,700
Thank you, Lee Murr, for PR News in Washington.

626
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,340
Wow, Princess Wee, you can hear that.

627
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,620
Yeah, I can hear that. There's quite a bit of bleed over.

628
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,060
I don't suppose there's any reason to put on background music because they'll just fight with each other.

629
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,420
Yes.

630
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,360
We're in an unusual situation here.

631
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,680
Oh, here I'll explain it to Lonesome Cowboy Dave at the same time.

632
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,200
This doesn't have to do with malfeasance in orifice.

633
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,780
This has to do with something much grander.

634
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:10,840
It has to do with tool-fashioning monkeys and monkey factories.

635
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:18,980
And what's to make us the top rung of genetic evolution that we think, because monkeys have tools?

636
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,880
Well, we weren't asking you.

637
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,380
We were about to explain to you.

638
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,980
Well, that's better.

639
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,180
I have.

640
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,660
I have a question.

641
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,840
Listen closely over your phone.

642
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,240
Can you hear background music?

643
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,160
No.

644
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,420
Aha.

645
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,380
It's too subtle.

646
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,040
I can definitely hear it in our headphones.

647
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,460
Oh, yes, I can hear it.

648
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,440
I should explain to our listeners and to Dave.

649
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,280
There's a band in the next room in this radio station.

650
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,700
They're setting up.

651
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,160
I guess they're going to play live on the following.

652
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,720
Show or shows.

653
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,420
Right.

654
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,000
That's lovely.

655
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,220
We used to do that.

656
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,100
And I'm glad people are doing that.

657
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,620
Oh, yeah.

658
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,220
Gays.

659
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,680
Gays.

660
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,760
Every five years, it seems like there's a resurrection.

661
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,940
You're doing life.

662
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:14,980
Yeah.

663
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,300
Well, you guys used to do it every.

664
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,560
I mean, every ESO show.

665
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,080
Swamp radio was.

666
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,880
Have you had your guitar in the station?

667
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:29,340
We even had you in the station, not just your guitar, even your body, such as it is.

668
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,140
Yes.

669
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,060
It's a.

670
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,340
It's a place.

671
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,220
Sometimes the place is packed with idle tarry.

672
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,300
I mean, he's.

673
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,960
Sometimes.

674
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,140
Miscreant.

675
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,520
Anyway, I've had people occasionally refer to the hour of slack as a podcast.

676
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,980
And we also do that.

677
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:56,020
But primarily, this is an actual radio show done in an actual radio station, not a podcast

678
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,800
where you pay a company thousands of dollars to put your party.

679
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,460
What does it do?

680
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,320
Iron Rabas?

681
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,320


682
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,740
But it's

683
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,420
not torture financially.

684
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,400
It's not a good thing.

685
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:21,820
Well, you know, the really cool thing about.

686
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,920
Hz is that each time you disagrees with something for the one one's own advantage, the audio

687
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,920
is in the K cookbook instead of in the Bang

688
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,060
lockbox.

689
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,700
in the background.

690
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Let's see what that does.

691
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,160
Now, I can hear that.

692
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,220
If you just play a little.

693
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,620
Yes, I can hear that in the background.

694
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:38,920
Whoa.

695
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,640
I think I better be careful

696
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,680
when I play in the background.

697
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,860
Yeah, really.

698
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
There's somewhere in that.

699
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,440
Whenever I hear my voice mixed in.

700
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,120
Then you really worry.

701
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,360
Yeah, you have to be ready.

702
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,420
Is the delay dump on?

703
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,260
Uh-oh, what am I going to say next?

704
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,180
Well, that's what sounds like

705
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,360
some kind of hyperbole,

706
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,980
a delay dump if you're slowing down somehow.

707
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,980
Yes, the delay dump is.

708
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,020
So in case some...

709
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,560
There we go.

710
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,480
Now do you hear real music?

711
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,460
I don't want to use a bad word,

712
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,800
but are these the guys

713
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,540
who used to call themselves

714
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,820
the Dwarf Mounties?

715
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,960
Like the Canadian Royal Police?

716
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,520
No.

717
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,820
Okay.

718
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,360
I don't think so.

719
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,300
Sounds like somebody's

720
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,220
gargling with mercury.

721
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,520
You know, Princess,

722
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,500
we're not going to know

723
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,240
what this sounds like

724
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,700
until we get home and play it back.

725
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,660
That is true.

726
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,520
Because we're picking up

727
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,880
that band's bass and drums

728
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,060
through our stomachs

729
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,760
and not our ears.

730
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,300
That's true.

731
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,640
I sure feel the vibrations

732
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,740
quite loudly.

733
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,720
Well, the rest of the listeners...

734
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,140
The rest of the listeners just...

735
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,600
They know more than we do.

736
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,880
That's all I can say.

737
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,640
Well, I don't think

738
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:58,940
they...

739
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,300
There's this ambience

740
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,260
of some sort of

741
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:02,620
lugubrious,

742
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,280
tummy, tummy, tummy sounds

743
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,600
like a little gargling baby

744
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,420
in the background

745
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,880
with maybe a huge foreskin

746
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,720
and like a forehead

747
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,540
the size of one of those

748
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,200
mollusk heads

749
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,000
they used to call them.

750
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,240
All macrocephalic.

751
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,880
I don't know that I would have

752
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,080
described it exactly

753
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,040
in those times,

754
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,840
but yeah, sure.

755
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,340
Well, you were the one

756
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,180
who brought up the monkeys

757
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,060
and said you were going

758
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,900
to explain to me

759
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,160
why we think we're so superior

760
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,940
as subgenites,

761
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,680
even regular,

762
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,160
normal,

763
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,280
pinks and so forth

764
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,020
that we actually...

765
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,400
Well, that brings me back

766
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,640
to the question of hipsters.

767
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,200
There was a lad on...

768
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,820
Well, or an old man

769
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,400
or somebody

770
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,960
on the Scrub Genius

771
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,040
members-only forum

772
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,240
on the internet

773
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,340
who posed the question,

774
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,480
what exactly is a hipster anyway?

775
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,900
And I jumped in

776
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,680
and answered it very quickly

777
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,860
off the top of my head.

778
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,820
I said, basically,

779
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,300
that's what dumb normals

780
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,020
call smarter normals.

781
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,760
But the other subgeniuses

782
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,180
were really upset about that

783
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,720
because they did not...

784
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,420
Not identify.

785
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,220
The other subgenius...

786
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,820
Quite a few other subgeniuses

787
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,980
got in to say,

788
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,740
well, a hipster is a person

789
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,940
who does this or does that.

790
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,560
It's a poser.

791
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,060
You know, they...

792
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,460
And the more they described it...

793
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,300
You're like Kerouac now, though.

794
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,300
You're just like Kerouac.

795
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,340
You're like...

796
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,820
Bad beatniks, man.

797
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,640
They're not really as cool as...

798
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,320
No, that wasn't the Kerouac voice.

799
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,460
The Kerouac voice was...

800
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:35,960
Well...

801
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,060
The hippies are nothing but

802
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,020
a bunch of abnormal people

803
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,800
who think somehow

804
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,680
they're as good as beatniks.

805
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,160
That's close, right?

806
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,800
Well, there were many definitions

807
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,720
of hipster,

808
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,740
and they were all really,

809
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,580
really negative names,

810
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:56,020
which I eventually read them all,

811
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,780
and I thought,

812
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,940
well, that's funny.

813
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,320
All these people

814
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,420
have just described most of us.

815
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,200
I mean, let's face it, man.

816
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,760
Hipsters are the only people

817
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,660
who even use the word hipster.

818
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,080
If you're calling somebody else a hipster...

819
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,440
Well, what...

820
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,300
Let me put it this way.

821
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

822
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,460
if you're wearing a tattoo,

823
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,960
don't call somebody else a hipster to me.

824
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,500
You know what I'm saying?

825
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,840
You know what you're saying?

826
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,220
No, I'm saying...

827
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:29,380
No, I'm saying...

828
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,180
No, you're saying...

829
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,860
I look down on the hipsters

830
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,700
because I'm more hip than a hipster.

831
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,600
It was basically what they were all saying.

832
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,240
Hey, hipsters are so unhip

833
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,000
compared to myself,

834
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,480
my honorable self.

835
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,400
I'm far different.

836
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,700
I'm not trendy like these hipsters.

837
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,060
I'm much cooler than a hipster.

838
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,120
Yeah, right.

839
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,920
At least they don't have

840
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,820
congenital syphilis of the brain.

841
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,480
I was going to sing it right then.

842
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,700
No, no, you sang it last...

843
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,580
You sang it last week, Dave.

844
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,800
Did I ever sing it a week ago?

845
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,160
You sang it last week.

846
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,340
Oh, yeah.

847
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,380
And you forgot the words.

848
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,220
You forgot the words repeatedly,

849
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,020
just like you always do.

850
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,640
All the world leaders

851
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,140
got one thing in common.

852
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,440
All the world leaders

853
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,380
one thing the same.

854
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,460
All the world leaders got...

855
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,500
All the leaders got...

856
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,800
Leaders got...

857
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,940
Leaders got congenital syphilis of the brain.

858
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,120
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

859
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,440
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

860
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,720
And you hear,

861
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,000
you hear a little...

862
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,860
Yeah, I already said that, too, didn't I?

863
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,140
Yeah.

864
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,320
Yes, it's quite a catchy little ditty.

865
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,040
Oh, it was another song.

866
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,600
And then I started talking about that song.

867
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,400
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

868
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
Dave, you're just too...

869
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,660
You're too creative for your own good, man.

870
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,120
Your creativity is just smashing

871
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,180
your other creativity.

872
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,720
It gets in the way of your creativity.

873
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,680
You're so creative.

874
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,600
Well, it's two things in a vacuum,

875
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,280
so they're bound to come barred.

876
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,560
That's about it.

877
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,040
Let's test to please law, you know?

878
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,700
The brain of the subgenius...

879
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,620
Two brain atoms colliding inside of a deep void.

880
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:08,180
Those collisions we call the thoughts of the subgenius.

881
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,820
If only you could read any thoughts.

882
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,580
If anyone could really have any thoughts,

883
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,280
as well as...

884
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,860
Instead of these constant meanderings

885
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,780
of, like, backward notions

886
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,520
and really, really stupid things you don't care about.

887
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,440
Well, that's just...

888
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,140
I thought swag would take care of that for me.

889
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,620
The nature of...

890
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,180
The nature of human thought is

891
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,680
you're kind of thinking of one thing,

892
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,420
but you're also thinking of 40 other things

893
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,700
kind of simultaneously

894
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,020
that may or may not connect

895
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,780
with the main thing you're thinking about.

896
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,680
And if you get real drunk,

897
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,080
you probably shouldn't try to tell everybody

898
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,760
your complicated thoughts.

899
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,300
Because they'll go all over which way.

900
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,880
And then when the subgeniuses go,

901
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
hey, you say I'm drunk,

902
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,560
that's when you shouldn't get butthurt.

903
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,580
That's when you should go,

904
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,440
you're right.

905
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,020
I guess I am.

906
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,220
I must have been.

907
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,480
I guess I'm not as big a...

908
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,320
I guess I'm not as big a hipster

909
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,140
as I thought I was.

910
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,060
Oh, yeah.

911
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,020
Oh, gosh.

912
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,760
Oh, golly me.

913
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,540
Oh, golly gee.

914
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,580
Well, you said...

915
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,000
I think that movements are all, like,

916
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,940
created by the media

917
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,140
to try and entertain people

918
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,660
and make them think of, like,

919
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,700
what you said before.

920
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,400
They're better than somebody else

921
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,500
because of some sort of person

922
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,680
who can acrimoniously...

923
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,260
to describe another person's behavior

924
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,880
or looks and stuff like that.

925
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,340
You can kill the chair.

926
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,420
Well, anybody can make fun of anybody else,

927
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,860
but how many people can really

928
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,640
make fun of themselves right?

929
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,440
That's the real...

930
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,900
That's what separates

931
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,480
the monkeys from the chimps,

932
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,080
you might say.

933
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,960
Well, nothing separates any of us

934
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,980
except for our physiques.

935
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,820
Well, the tail is one thing

936
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,640
that separates them.

937
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,660
The monkey from a chimp.

938
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,220
The pail.

939
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,040
I remember the tails of the pail.

940
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,720
You weren't allowed to play the barone

941
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,960
in Dublin in certain days.

942
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,560
I forget if it was 22 or whatever.

943
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,980
No, you're talking about

944
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,880
a different kind of pail, right?

945
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,440
Six-fisted tails of Connie.

946
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,700
I was listening to some of those today.

947
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,940
Dave, do you think you could make it

948
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,640
to the X-Day event this summer,

949
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,160
first week of July?

950
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,920
If we...

951
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,880
If we pay for your gas

952
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,900
and give you some grass?

953
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,120
I'm trying to arrange the vacation time.

954
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,940
I may be able to arrange the vacation time.

955
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,320
Because then you could be...

956
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,520
At least the minor appearance

957
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,140
because of everything I've missed

958
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,160
for so many years.

959
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,040
Well, they didn't miss you.

960
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,620
Like one really exciting day.

961
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,900
Well, you know,

962
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,240
because there's a band

963
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,520
that only exists once a year

964
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,600
at X-Day,

965
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,340
and it's a different band each year,

966
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:57,620
slightly.

967
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,200
It almost always has

968
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,220
Reverend Angry Larry

969
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,620
and Priestess Pisces

970
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,260
and Suds.

971
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,740
And sometimes it has Philo.

972
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,200
We'll have Philo this time.

973
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,840
And so he'll be the loudest.

974
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,900
And he'll be the only one to listen to.

975
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,440
And he'll let you know that.

976
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,920
But yeah,

977
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,960
and it's always called

978
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,680
Six-Fisted Tails of Connie

979
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,800
or More-Fisted Tails of Connie

980
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,980
or some variation on...

981
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,440
The big question is,

982
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,000
is it tails or tails?

983
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,860
Tails with an I

984
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,920
or tails with an E?

985
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,400
Suds writes it down

986
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,540
as tails with an E,

987
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,020
like stories of Connie.

988
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,400
And I always write it down

989
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,100
as fisted tails

990
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,580
and causing me to envision

991
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,240
Connie with a long tail,

992
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,640
monkey tail with a fist

993
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,900
at the end of it.

994
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,940
That you can spit Bob

995
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,080
upside the head with.

996
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,440
Right.

997
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,720
You know, if he frocks

998
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,580
before breakfast.

999
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,360
And so that's a...

1000
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,640
There's one church schism

1001
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,060
right there.

1002
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,380
Actually,

1003
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,360
Suds and I have both been

1004
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,300
trying to hammer out

1005
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,060
two or three new

1006
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,640
Bob song collections.

1007
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,800
It's been years

1008
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,780
since we collected

1009
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,120
the hymns that I play

1010
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,900
on this show

1011
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,040
every month or two

1012
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,140
when a new one comes in.

1013
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,180
They've really stacked up

1014
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,940
for a long time.

1015
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,600
I've been playing

1016
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,520
some of the old ones

1017
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,520
bit by bit

1018
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,760
as my way of deciding

1019
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,300
whether I like them or not still.

1020
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,740
There are a few

1021
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,920
I decided not to play.

1022
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,500
Those won't be on the albums.

1023
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,120
But then there's others

1024
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:26,620
that I've...

1025
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,740
I played too many times

1026
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,660
that I didn't know

1027
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,400
because I didn't remember.

1028
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,180
Like Dave singing

1029
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,160
his same song

1030
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,060
two weeks in a row.

1031
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,160
We're all getting old.

1032
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,420
For all I know,

1033
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,900
we said every word

1034
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,840
we said tonight

1035
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,800
last week.

1036
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,900
How would we know?

1037
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,220
Yeah.

1038
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,940
That's quite a common phenomenon.

1039
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,160
Did you happen to remember

1040
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,080
what we were talking about

1041
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,600
before that?

1042
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:48,680
Yeah.

1043
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,480
We were talking about

1044
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,380
this great movie

1045
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,920
called Kung Fury.

1046
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,140
Friends,

1047
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,480
this movie,

1048
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,900
you can't see this movie

1049
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,560
Kung Fury.

1050
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,840
in theaters yet.

1051
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,700
It was a...

1052
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,100
It was a crowdfunded

1053
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,980
short film.

1054
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,160
It's 30 minutes long

1055
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,120
and it's been finished.

1056
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,940
And if you get on your YouTube

1057
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,220
and type in

1058
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,740
Kung Fury,

1059
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,960
there may be an incomplete

1060
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,960
early version,

1061
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,040
but the finished

1062
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,780
30-minute version...

1063
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,080
I know that you all love

1064
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,480
that movie Iron Sky,

1065
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,160
and this is a lot like

1066
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,900
Iron Sky,

1067
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,260
but try to

1068
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,140
envision this

1069
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,940
three times as crazy.

1070
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,500
He's not exaggerating either.

1071
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:33,960
No.

1072
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,700
It has Nazis.

1073
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,160
It has dinosaurs.

1074
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,300
It has robots.

1075
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,140
It has Kung Fu Nazis.

1076
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,300
And honestly,

1077
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:40,860
it's...

1078
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,780
It has Kung Fu Nazis?

1079
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,480
Yeah.

1080
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,800
Kung Fury is the name of it.

1081
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,400
Kung Fury.

1082
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,020
It's done in the style

1083
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,000
of 1980s movies

1084
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,120
and TV shows.

1085
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,860
Very, very heavily

1086
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,000
80s oriented.

1087
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,600
And it's...

1088
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,260
Hitler is the villain.

1089
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,380
He does some Kung Fu,

1090
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,240
but he's not as good

1091
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:01,920
as the hero,

1092
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:02,660
Kung Fury.

1093
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,320
But by the end

1094
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,160
of this movie,

1095
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,320
Kung Fury has been...

1096
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,560
He's joined up...

1097
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,940
I'm going to go ahead

1098
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:10,700
and give a spoiler.

1099
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:11,960
Oh, do you?

1100
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,360
He's fighting the...

1101
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,680
He has to go back in time

1102
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,380
to stop Hitler.

1103
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,000
We all do that

1104
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,980
at one point or another.

1105
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,320
This guy goes back in time

1106
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,380
to fight Hitler

1107
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,360
and Hitler kills him,

1108
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,820
but then his friends come along.

1109
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,580
And his friends...

1110
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,420
The friends that he's gathered

1111
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,280
include two barbarian Vikings

1112
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,700
with names like Barbariana

1113
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,660
and their friend Thor,

1114
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,020
the God of Thunder,

1115
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,580
who really is a god.

1116
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,560
He's about 100 feet tall

1117
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,640
and has a giant magic hammer

1118
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,100
and looks kind of...

1119
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,120
He doesn't look like

1120
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,040
the Marvel Thor.

1121
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,640
He looks more like Odin,

1122
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,700
his father.

1123
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,480
Only he has two eyes.

1124
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,940
And...

1125
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,580
Sometimes mispronounced

1126
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,180
will can.

1127
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,780
Oh, and a Tyrannosaurus

1128
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,380
becomes his friend.

1129
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,060
He rather...

1130
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,140
Kung Fury rides a Tyrannosaurus.

1131
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,140
And the Tyrannosaurus

1132
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:07,980
is the friend

1133
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,880
of his...

1134
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,580
Of Kung Fury's cop partner,

1135
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,520
Triceratop,

1136
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,220
who is a police officer

1137
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,500
with a triceratops head.

1138
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,380
Yes.

1139
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,960
The head of a ceratopsian.

1140
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,340
That is very...

1141
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:24,520
See?

1142
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,360
That is very 80s-C right there.

1143
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,020
That is very...

1144
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,740
It's too much.

1145
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,420
It's bulldada as heck.

1146
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,080
It's bold surrealism.

1147
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:34,820
Absolutely.

1148
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,700
It's too crazy for Hollywood,

1149
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,740
for any single Hollywood executive

1150
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,620
to ever put an okay on.

1151
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,820
And it's that much better

1152
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,620
than anything you'll be seeing

1153
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,260
in theaters all summer long.

1154
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,480
Kung Fury, friends.

1155
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,440
And thanks to the subgeniuses

1156
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,520
who helped crowdsource

1157
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:54,500
this show.

1158
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,340
Thank you.

1159
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,020
Thank you.

1160
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,020


1161
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,020


1162
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,020


1163
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,020


1164
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,420
There's a Reverend Brandy online

1165
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,380
who brought this to our attention.

1166
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,700
That was the person who was...

1167
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,880
Well, I think Reverend Brandy said,

1168
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,880
I funded that,

1169
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,120
but I think they meant

1170
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,500
they funded part of it.

1171
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,120
Well, not the original urinator,

1172
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,320
the first one.

1173
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:12,660
The urinator.

1174
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,120
I'll be back.

1175
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:16,920
Again.

1176
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,000
Urinator two.

1177
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,000
I have to come back soon.

1178
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,220
Sooner than that.

1179
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,240
Oh, well.

1180
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,580
Well, I don't want to go there.

1181
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,840
You do remember the subgenius anthem,

1182
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,480
don't you?

1183
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,580
Huh? What?

1184
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,560
You understand the subgenius anthem.

1185
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,380
That also happened in a past

1186
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,620
that doesn't exist anymore.

1187
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,740
Well, I did,

1188
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,900
but it's still on the thread.

1189
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,160
You're talking about the song

1190
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,580
called Subgenius Anthem

1191
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,160
by Lonesome Cowboy Dave, right?

1192
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,880
See, see, swineyard.

1193
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,760
Well, people can hear that song

1194
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,860
if they look at subgenius.com

1195
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,180
and look for the downloadable songs.

1196
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,280
Or if they have eardrums.

1197
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:52,620
Yeah.

1198
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,960
Yeah, if both.

1199
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,200
Well, you actually have to have both.

1200
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,380
You can now download

1201
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,300
all of our more recent albums

1202
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,660
from the last 10 years.

1203
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,540
We're working on releasing

1204
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,600
to the internet

1205
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,620
the previous 20 years

1206
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,880
of cassette albums.

1207
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,640
Some called egregious.

1208
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,140
Yeah, the subgenius anthem

1209
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,460
by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1210
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,460
You know, we've never gotten

1211
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,800
the perfect version of it,

1212
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,200
but there's a pretty good version

1213
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,160
on Songs of X Day.

1214
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,480
And one of those box songs.

1215
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,280
Like a well-thought-out salad.

1216
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,980
No, actually, it was recorded

1217
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,900
at the Beachland,

1218
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,900
but I think it was recorded by Regis,

1219
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,280
so it doesn't sound as bad

1220
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,480
as the ones that were recorded

1221
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,360
just by me.

1222
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,280
Oh, man, that cat was the worst

1223
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,600
Canadian actor in the world.

1224
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,200
Regis?

1225
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,580
No, this is a different Regis.

1226
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,280
A different Regis.

1227
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,220
I thought it did, you know,

1228
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,220
the cartoon, you know,

1229
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:52,220
cartoons of Hamill and so forth.

1230
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,680
And then he got in trouble,

1231
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,880
somehow, I guess, in Texas

1232
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,180
because you're supposed to do that

1233
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:56,620
or something.

1234
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,260
Well, they were going to have

1235
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:58,980
another one of those

1236
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,480
Mohammed cartoon festivals

1237
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,880
in Phoenix this weekend.

1238
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,540
Did anybody get killed?

1239
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,920
Freedom of the press

1240
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,560
and they have, like,

1241
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,160
poo-poo on them.

1242
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:06,900
No, they must not have

1243
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,080
because I looked at the news

1244
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:08,720
and they would have been

1245
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,940
gloating on that.

1246
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,120
They were hoping, you know,

1247
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,020
whenever you have a

1248
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,280
Draw Mohammed contest,

1249
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,580
you're hoping there's going

1250
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,380
to be bloodshed.

1251
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,720
That's the whole reason

1252
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,420
to have one.

1253
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:20,760
Of course, that's the whole reason

1254
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,100
to have it.

1255
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,260
But you can say it's

1256
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,020
for the First Amendment

1257
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:23,660
if you have one.

1258
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,320
You can have a pair of teeth.

1259
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,080
Right.

1260
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,380
Or if you don't have

1261
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,260
a good deviator

1262
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:28,880
or a septum,

1263
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,800
sometimes you don't

1264
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,880
think of how they get.

1265
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,280
And if you don't like

1266
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:32,960
the bloodshed,

1267
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,740
that means that you're

1268
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,080
following Sharia law.

1269
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:35,740
Mm-hmm.

1270
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,140
If you don't like

1271
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,060
the bloodshed

1272
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,800
that comes with

1273
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,440
the Draw Mohammed

1274
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,720
cartoon contest,

1275
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:42,640
then you're Sharia.

1276
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,540
You better not go to Oklahoma

1277
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,340
because they've got a law

1278
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,240
against Sharia law

1279
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:46,700
in Oklahoma.

1280
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,440
That's right.

1281
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,320
And Kansas, Texas.

1282
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,120
Because they're afraid.

1283
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,760
They are definitely afraid

1284
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,440
that Muslims,

1285
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,280
academics are going to come

1286
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,400
and take over Oklahoma,

1287
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,400
the most beautiful land

1288
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,360
in the world,

1289
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,160
the most valuable.

1290
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,840
How can the ISIS people

1291
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,700
resist conquering Oklahoma

1292
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,380
and such beautiful cities?

1293
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,560
Shining Tulsa,

1294
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,540
renowned Oklahoma City,

1295
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,620
Norman, home of the normals.

1296
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,680
You know, I mean,

1297
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,100
it's like a heavenly,

1298
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,180
heavenly place,

1299
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,980
a has that in the law.

1300
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,060
Now, you know,

1301
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,720
there's 솔직히 no Mitte,

1302
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,680
or ebony is,

1303
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:33,680


1304
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,320
And I mean,

1305
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,100
there are in dose,

1306
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:37,120
sadly,

1307
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,140


1308
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,140


1309
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,260
to put a lot of ie

1310
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,440
into their health care,

1311
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,400
but for you,

1312
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:48,200
after Rihanna's death

1313
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:48,460
to Henry Frank,

1314
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:48,460


1315
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:48,460


1316
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:48,460


1317
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,560
sh 싶idity that.?

1318
00:49:53,360 --> 00:50:00,500
well um the armpits of america the savage mind of the country's interior as puzzling evidence

1319
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:07,360
called it is where we come from man that's where the truest subgeniuses are bred if you're the

1320
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:16,140
only goth in glenrose texas if you're the only punk in mccrory arkansas and i know both of those

1321
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:24,820
people you are the subgenius that's where that's where it is forged in the crucible of redneckery

1322
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:30,580
the redneck subgenius is the truest subject doctors for bob from little rock arkansas

1323
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:37,860
they almost single-handedly destroyed the church they were so so smart alecky but they

1324
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:45,180
that's the real subgeniuses now most of them have sold out and gone pink now you know they wouldn't

1325
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:45,940
play in a bob

1326
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:46,120
you know they wouldn't play in a bob

1327
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:46,120


1328
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:53,720
i think one of them would uh gordon x would probably love to do a doctor subgenius band

1329
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:58,340
again but most of the other ones but they look at that's what that was kids stuff you know childish

1330
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:07,760
stuff they're big now mr television yeah they're big oh they're on tv now huh television even the

1331
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,120
i mean the guy with the expanding breast syndrome like you like to sit down and interview and all

1332
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:19,420
the sudden he gets a big huge pair of d-cups he's just like what's going on i tell you i don't know

1333
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:24,120
what's going on i honestly cannot tell if what we're hearing in the background princess we

1334
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:31,100
is the band setting up in the other room or the cd in the background it's a chaotic miasma

1335
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,920
there are gargoyles in the basement there are gargoyles in your mind

1336
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,980
there's footery of foot and things of other kinds

1337
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,980

00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:49,360
that's not you i mean those liquid evacuations are you doing that i'm not doing that i'm yes

1339
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:55,940
anius or anias subgenius that's hard to say without making it sound dirty

1340
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:03,680
what was that great movie where the science fiction writer told his his class to give you

1341
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:11,320
add anus to the end of the name like you would be princess we anus and i would be ivan anus

gentlemen broncos

1344
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:24,260
oh that's another good movie i would fit this one good guys

1345
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:32,820
of those shows where we i really had no idea whether it was good bad indifferent

1346
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:38,080
i can't i don't even know where the people here i've got the headphones turned up all the way

1347
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,100
it's gonna be tough that will burn out again

1348
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:42,100


1349
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:42,100


1350
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,760
deaf and Dr. Sinister.

1351
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,020
That happens a lot.

1352
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,640
He comes in and puts headphones on.

1353
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,420
He yanks them off real fast.

1354
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,980
So he doesn't end up like me.

1355
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,240
Yep.

1356
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,420
Parachomonias and full of overtures.

1357
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,300
Huh?

1358
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,200
Well, you know, in my case, it's...

1359
00:52:59,200 --> 00:52:59,220
Oh, yeah.

1360
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,500
Malthusian. What does that mean?

1361
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,340
Old.

1362
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,500
It's Malthusian, right?

1363
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,860
No, I didn't say that.

1364
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,260
Old man.

1365
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,960
Is that what Malthusian is in this?

1366
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,840
Or is that a form of...

1367
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,500
What is that?

1368
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,480
I forgot.

1369
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,880
I'll let you look that one up

1370
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,940
on your Wikipedia on your smartphone

1371
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,920
real quick. That's what Filer would do.

1372
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,820
Well, when you used to

1373
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,060
fall into a slumber in the arms of

1374
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:30,060
Morpheus, that used to mean you were

1375
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,860
taking a nap.

1376
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,720
Now it just means, you know, you're drinking too much

1377
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,020
rotten juices and you're over, you know,

1378
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,940
overage or overweight, whichever

1379
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,000
one comes first.

1380
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,260
And that's why, you know,

1381
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,020
I think...

1382
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,320
You're blowing up the trains right now.

1383
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,140
Not here, anyway. But somewhere in Antarctica.

1384
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,400
I know what's going on, man.

1385
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,360
Because, you know,

1386
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,600
I know what's going on

1387
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,500
out there.

1388
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,780
We know an old shut-in.

1389
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,540
She's a relative of Princess Wee's.

1390
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,940
She has

1391
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,780
no other friend besides

1392
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,100
Princess Wee

1393
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,720
because she's a hateful, old

1394
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,860
Christian nut.

1395
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,240
And none of her

1396
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,800
other relatives will...

1397
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,760
can listen to her rambling.

1398
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:17,300
Princess Wee is so full of the power of good

1399
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,000
that she listens.

1400
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,000
And I got to overhear this lady explain to Princess Wee.

1401
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,540
I'm not ever going to get on one of them trains

1402
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:27,480
because there's people that throws rocks

1403
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,480
right through the windshields of the trains

1404
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,520
and kills everybody.

1405
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,640
And I won't get on an airplane because

1406
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,780
there's boys that sit on the ground

1407
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,920
and point green lasers into the eyes

1408
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,400
of the jet plane pilots

1409
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,020
and it makes all the planes crash.

1410
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,420
So I'm no idiot.

1411
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,560
I'm not going to get on no plane or no train.

1412
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,920
The sad thing is

1413
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,580
this lady is never going...

1414
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,700
She wasn't going to get on a plane or a train anyway.

1415
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,860
She's never going to leave that horrible little

1416
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,600
town she lives in.

1417
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,800
She's never...

1418
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,360
She doesn't even know how to drive.

1419
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,900
She doesn't know how to work.

1420
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,120
She knows how to pray.

1421
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,920
And she's not going to get on that plane

1422
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,880
and she's not going to get on that train

1423
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,340
but she's going to pray.

1424
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,060
And that's going to fix everything.

1425
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,340
Sooner or later.

1426
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,940
Well, that's why it's positive.

1427
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,740
Are you upset, Princess Wee,

1428
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,180
because this might get back to her?

1429
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,140
Oh, no, I actually wasn't.

1430
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,420
I was going to tell you all about Malthusianism.

1431
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:22,540
Oh.

1432
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,100
Yes, it's a school of ideas

1433
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,660
derived from the political-economic

1434
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,320
thought of the Reverend

1435
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,640
Thomas Robert Malthus

1436
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,420
as laid out in his 1798

1437
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,500
writings, an essay on

1438
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,700
the principle of population.

1439
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,220
It has to do with unchecked population

1440
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,180
growth, its exponential,

1441
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,820
while the growth of the food supply

1442
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:45,200
was expected to be arithmetical.

1443
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,380
And so you see,

1444
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,220
Malthus believed that there would be

1445
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,200
two types of checks that could then

1446
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,520
reduce the population,

1447
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,560
returning it to a more sustainable level.

1448
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,620
Isn't that interesting?

1449
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,780
I've turned off

1450
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,380
all the background music.

1451
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,260
Oh, so now we have

1452
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,340
the pure bleed.

1453
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:07,420
The pure bleed from the next-door studio.

1454
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,080
Yes.

1455
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,080
You see, luckily, I don't think

1456
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,400
any of the consumers out there,

1457
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,000
even the vast wasteland, can smell it.

1458
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,940
It's just not in their

1459
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:16,820
pure nostril.

1460
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,820
Well, in that case, when

1461
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,320
the next show comes on, we can go

1462
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,640
in that room and scream as loud as we can

1463
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,060
for an hour, right?

1464
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:26,940
Then it won't make any difference.

1465
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,280
Anyway, it doesn't make any difference

1466
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,980
because this is the end of our

1467
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,420
Slack number 1,520.

1468
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,020
Oh, it's too bad.

1469
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:36,780
I just thought.

1470
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,220
I was trying to monitor the show

1471
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,920
in the other room as loud as you could.

1472
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:41,700
I can't seem to get anyone out.

1473
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:41,700


1474
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,460
I'm trying to keep them out in their space.

1475
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,160
Right.

1476
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,880
In October, around Halloween,

1477
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,000
will be the 30th anniversary

1478
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,520
of the Hour of Slack.

1479
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,240
We first started broadcasting

1480
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,280
at a station in Dallas

1481
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,580
that's not really there anymore

1482
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,880
in October

1483
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,860
of 1985.

1484
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,520
Before most of you were born,

1485
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,580
before most of you were

1486
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,640
even a glint, before your daddies

1487
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,780
were a glint in their granddaddy's eyes

1488
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,400
because...

1489
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,880
Because I was your granddaddy.

1490
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,500
How about that?

1491
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:13,720
Yeah.

1492
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:26,960
Well, anyway, so if you need to know more about the Church of the Subgenius and our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs, the high avatar of Slack and sales, you can go to subgenius.com.

1493
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,820
Or you can write to us for free information, but you won't get very much.

1494
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,000
Not for free.

1495
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:35,340
Right.

1496
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,220
P.O. Box.

1497
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:47,140
And now I'm going to fade Dave out and me out and everyone out.

1498
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,280
Fade Dave?

1499
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:56,260
Like in a previous formula, like in a guy's trap, like these three of our basis hitlers from the future.

1500
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:04,780
We can definitely hear that band in the background.

1501
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,640
Can you hear it majorly?

1502
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:07,960
Well, anyway.

1503
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:08,800
Yeah.

1504
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:18,600
Friends, here's another long lost tune by Reverend Max Slack of merry old England, I believe.

1505
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,180
And, uh, yes.

1506
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,560
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

1507
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,700
I would have met you off the train.

1508
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,620
I didn't come on the train.

1509
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,720
Off the bus then.

1510
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,460
I didn't come on the bus either.

1511
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,080
So how did you get here then?

1512
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,180
Basically, there was this little dot, right?

1513
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,260
And the dot went bang.

1514
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,200
And the bang expanded.

1515
00:58:35,640 --> 00:59:03,140
So I was getting retREAMED.

1516
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,140
lemons

1517
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:05,160
orange

1518
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:05,160


1519
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:05,240
that's not a fowl in here, the detail on that animation is not the same anymore.

1520
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:05,600
That's it.

1521
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,600
It's the end of the world

1522
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,960
It's okay

1523
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,320
It's the end of the world

1524
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,100
Celebrate

1525
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,240
It's the end of the world

1526
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,240
We can all escape into outer space

1527
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,480
And start again

1528
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,700
It's the end of the world

1529
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,180
It's okay

1530
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:48,520
It's the end of the world

1531
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,380
Celebrate

1532
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:53,360
It's the end of the world

1533
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,400
We can all escape into outer space

1534
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,680
And start again

1535
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,220
It's the end of the world

1536
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,540
It's okay

1537
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:26,940
It's the end of the world

1538
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,740
Celebrate

1539
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:31,840
It's the end of the world

1540
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,220
We can all escape into outer space

1541
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,020
And start again

1542
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:41,340
It's the end of the world

1543
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:42,720
It's okay

1544
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,100
It's the end of the world

1545
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,980
Celebrate

1546
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:51,040
It's the end of the world

1547
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,980
We can all escape into outer space

1548
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,300
And start again

1549
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,780
It's the end of the world

1550
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,180
It's okay

1551
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:24,540
It's the end of the world

1552
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,380
Celebrate

1553
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:29,340
It's the end of the world

1554
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:30,780
It's okay

1555
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,220
Celebrate

1556
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,980
It's the end of the world

1557
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,960
It's the end of the world

1558
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,520
It's the end of the world

1559
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,900
We can all escape into outer space and start again

1560
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,000
Anyway.

1561
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:08,500
Friends, here's another long-lost tune by Reverend Max Slack of merry old England, I believe.

1562
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,140
And, uh, yes.

1563
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:35,380
Well, that was just a completely ruinous attempt.

1564
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:38,260
And now, is it dead air, or what's happening?

1565
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,680
Yeah, um, no.

1566
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,040
It's just dead air.

1567
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,680
No, it's not dead because of that band in the other room.

1568
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,140
Oh, well, uh, but it is WCSB 89.3.

1569
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,000
Right.

1570
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:52,740
In Cleveland.

1571
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:56,680
I know that.

1572
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,220
I know that.

1573
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,820
That is a thing that I know.

1574
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,000
Well, that's what they all say.

1575
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,020
Yes, well.

1576
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:08,580
Well, my question is, where is track seven on this CD?

1577
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,360
That's the strangest thing I ever saw.

1578
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,840
I'm gonna stop this whole thing.

1579
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,200
I'm gonna pop this little booger out.

1580
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,840
This is, again, the visible show.

1581
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:22,700
That is hour of Slack number 15 to 1520 background.

1582
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,900
And it says it only has...

1583
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:26,880
S...

1584
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,180
Six tracks on it.

1585
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,060
And a six track would be...

1586
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:32,900
Let's just see if it is...

1587
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,040
From PR News in Washington, best known...

1588
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,720
Yeah, we already played that.

1589
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,140
Well, that's just the strangest...

1590
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:44,200
...more intimate, spontaneous film style known as cinema verite.

1591
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,200
Yeah, there we go.

1592
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:49,760
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon tested positive for the deadly virus.

1593
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,400
This is PR News in Washington.

1594
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,420
And then that's it.

1595
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,980
They're supposed to be...

1596
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:58,520
You see, like...

1597
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:00,220
Oh.

1598
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:04,160
This whole song that follows there.

1599
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,200
Well, that's okay.

1600
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,200
I can cut that into the internet version.

1601
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,540
You sure can.

1602
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:11,080
Cleveland audiences here at WCSB Cleveland,

1603
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:15,620
you got to hear another one of those screw-ups on the hour of Slack

1604
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,840
that by the time the internet listeners,

1605
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,260
which outnumber you by the billions...

1606
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,200
It'll sound just slick as snot on a door handle.

1607
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:26,960
How about that?

1608
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:28,320
Praise Bob.

1609
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,060
Praise Bob.

1610
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,500
Well, I'm moving out of the way.

1611
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,800
I don't have anything to play.

1612
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:34,600
Well, yeah, I do.

1613
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,520
I'll just turn this guy's background music up.

1614
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,240
Bye.

1615
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:40,600
Bye.

1616
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:41,660
Bye.

1617
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:44,860
Bye.

1618
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:48,660
Bye.

1619
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,360
Bye.

1620
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:49,600
Bye.

1621
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:49,600


1622
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:49,600


1623
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:49,600


1624
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:49,600


1625
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:49,600


1626
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:49,600


1627
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:50,220
Bye.

1628
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:50,220


1629
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:50,220


1630
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:50,220


1631
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:50,220


1632
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:57,920
Bye.

1633
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:57,920


1634
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:57,920


1635
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:57,920


1636
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:57,920


1637
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:57,920


1638
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:57,920


1639
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:57,920


1640
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:57,920


1641
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:57,920


1642
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:01,080
Bye.

1643
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:01,620
Bye.

1644
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,520
Bye.

1645
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:02,760


1646
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:03,180
Bye.

1647
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:03,540
