Hold on to your hats.
We're about to go to Radio Synesthesia with your host, Dr. Sinister.
Ooh, he's scary.
Yes, boys and ghouls.
Tonight's freaky feature.
We present Dr. Sinister and his terrible music.
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
And his insane psychotic collars.
And his sarcastic asides.
You'll shiver and freak out and have acid flashbacks when you listen to the crazy music he'll be playing.
And the crazy collars he'll be getting.
And you can listen to it and you can see it and you can smell it and you can taste it.
Hello, you're on the air.
I am.
I'm so happy to...
I'm sorry.
Welcome to the program.
Welcome to myself.
And yes, it's a wonderful evening for spatting and chatting and barbecue and grilling.
I don't think I'm quite rich enough to wear spats, but...
Well, you never can tell.
You don't want to get snot on them, though, because immediately you're going to get a


















little bit of a spat.
I think you're doing a 1920s rich boy thing and stuff.
And then they notice that you're just probably away from your therapy class for a moment.
You need to be rescued.
No, I do quite the opposite.
I turn my pockets inside out to show that I got nothing.
That was all the rage in 2015, according to Back to the Future.
And it was all the rage back in the 30s.
They called them Hoover flags.
Hoover flags.
Yeah, I mean, some people call that the elephant routine, though, too, you know?
Yeah.
Of course, what do they know about anything?
They're all a bunch of pretty bulls and freeloading snakes and so forth.
Snakes.
Why did it have to be snakes?
Culebras.
Culebras.
Culebras.
Culebras.
Culebras.
Culebras.


Culebras.

You said, you've lost 100 pounds.








Gary said he's waiting for you to come none of us are strong, but you know,
here's this beep beep.
Oh, oh boy, thank God you're here.
Ree deda and a bunch of 훁sus.
아이� dear people.
Gee, that's what I believed back when I had, you know, foreskins in three years.
Oh, man, you had a foreskin for three years?
I've had one for the, well, for the past 25 years, I've had a durable reset put in by the Archduke or the Archdiocese.
Somebody thought he was very important, and I gave him the last of my remaining, my earthly goods.
And it seems to work. I don't know what it does, but it hasn't harmed me too much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, you know, if it don't, if it doesn't hurt you, then, you know, what's the harm?
Well, it could maybe hurt you later, I think, or something. I don't know. Maybe. I don't think there's any harm to it.
I think people should get the inflatable scrotums.
And foreskins, they need on demand. I don't think people should be just...
You know, I oppose, I oppose inflatable, the inflatable scrotum. I oppose that.
The inflatable scrotum goes with a detachable penis.
Detachable penis.
The penis is taxable in various degrees.
Yeah, see, the thing is, it's like, I don't, I don't like the idea of my sack blowing up any bigger than it is already.
Yeah, that would be a hard time for...
And it's not very big to begin with, but let me tell you, that'd be pretty painful.
Yep.
I don't know if you could die from the pain, but you certainly could, you know, make a lot of noise in a parking lot trying to get out of a car.
Sometimes, you know, you hear the little whip, whip, whip, whip, you know, in the police.
At the same time, it's a hell of a strange, a Mayland's melody of odd, unusual sounds and voices.
I've recorded quite a few of them, but...
You know, I can see men trying to...
Artificially enlarge the size of their sack, you know, for status reasons.
I mean, Phil Collins sang about that once.
It's all been a sack of lies.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd have to agree.
I don't know exactly what I'm agreeing with, but I'd certainly have to give that a kudos, a thumbs up, and a huzzah, huzzah, and a cheers.
Hey, careful where you're putting those thumbs up.
Yeah, I will.
I'll make sure.
I don't want to hurt anybody.
The local squirrels.
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.
That's Alabaster Cloddy.
That's right.
The man himself.
We got another caller on here, too.
Hello, you're on the air.
Yeah, well, I need to ask Dave for my foreskin back.
Hey, Dave, I want my foreskin back.
What are you going to do for me?
Yeah, I lost it several years ago.
You know what I think is going to...
I think I tracked you through the foreskin donation program.
I tell you what's even better than that, all right?
And I think this is the wave of the future.
I think we're going to start using stem cells to regrow foreskins.
I think this is where we're going.
Yeah.
We're going to use stem cells to start regrowing foreskins.
Yeah, well, you know, we need to grow foreskins in the whole of the law.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't believe that...
Supposedly, there's some kind of a religious observance around the ritual of Jesus' circumcision,
but I don't believe for a second that he was ever circumcised.
I think he was born circumcised.
I think he was born circumcised because, really, you can't cut anything off a perfect man.
And it would have just grown back on the third day anyway.
Yeah.
And it would have just grown back.
Back on the third day.
Because, you know, you had that kind of power.
This is the last one, though.
What's the last one, Joe?
He was born with the golden foreskin.
That warmer look.
The man with the golden foreskin.
Wasn't that a James Bond movie?
That was a great...
That was a 50s film more.
I remember that.
Oh, I don't actually remember it, but I remember it.
Yeah, the nice thing about a golden foreskin, you know, if it's made of gold instead of,
like, silver, it doesn't tarnish.
Hey, doctor, what's your real name, man?
My real name?
I just want to know...
I didn't know that.
It's Rumpelstiltskin.
Can you tell us this?
My real name is Rumpelstiltskin.
And he has long, golden locks, too.
Do you really think he's going to tell you?
Yeah, this is a public airwaves.
It is one's name or its nostril.
Oh, for dinner.
No, that's not mine.
From PR News in Washington, I'm outrageous.
President Obama has announced the administration has finished the
torture.
The administration says Obama did torture prisoners.
We did some things.
President Obama said...
We did a whole lot of things.
The CIA has been fighting PR News.
President Obama is calling children unworkable.
A spokesman for the New York City Medical Examiner says the death was caused by untaxed
cigarettes.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is dragging PR News with New Jersey Hotel Elevator in
Washington.
See, but that leads into the whole colostomy question.
I don't know how that follows, but I suppose I'll go along with it if somebody nudges me
in the right direction.
I don't see...
Nah, that doesn't make any sense to me.
What, the Gumby colostomies?
A Gumby colostomy doesn't result in any kind of erstwhile movement in the air or the environment
or anything else other than the close proximity of the afflicted individual.
That is, if they're truly afflicted, they're not just walking around with a colostomy bag
baking at Walmart.
You know, like, trying to impress their friends.
You know, colostomy bags are available only by prescription because, because, you know,
there's a real danger with the recreational colostomy bag market out there.
Oh, yeah.
The trucker colostomy bag.
There needs to be plenty of legislation.
Yeah, isn't there a series of movies, The Human Colostomy Bag?
You were there.
And there were probably a thousand people there, but I thought there were 7,000 people
there because there was so much excitement.
And for once in my life, I found a place where I could be accepted for being me.
And that people loved you unconditionally, no matter who you were, no matter what you
looked like.
And everybody was going towards a common goal.
Everybody was excited for everybody else.
And all of a sudden, I felt like I was a big loving.
I just, I all of a sudden found a place that I felt like maybe I could grow into.
And of course, you know, that wasn't, you know, the beginning either.
It was, it's a long stretch.
It's a journey.
It's something you do every day that helps you get closer to your dream.
Well, Bill, I'm an admirer of Bob.
Does it worry you, Bob?
You can't let it just say.
I think they could take it a step beyond that.
To the bizarre, the grotesque, to intentionally mean-spirited injury of other innocent people.
It was, it had Bob's fingerprints all over it.
And he and I both would agree that Bob's not a nice person.
I saw him shoot Bob.
Ooh, friends.
Well, Dr. Sinister, when you started the show, you sounded kind of down.
And people were talking about.
You don't have to worry about me doing that.
I wouldn't want to draw Bob's attention to you.
Yeah, really, Bob's attention is the last thing I need.
Thank you very much.
No, I'm doing all right.
I'm doing all right.
Jesus isn't going to help you after all the mean things you've said about him and his fan club.
Right.
Well, the devil tunes in to all your prayers, too.
You understand?
I thought that people wanted Bob's attention.
It would bring them success in sex and business.
See, that's Bob's scam.
All right.
Right.
He is the greatest salesman who ever lived.
All right.
And he is selling himself to all of the Bobbies who don't.
You know, Bob said, give me slack or kill me.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
Two things.
Two things that come from that.
Naturally.
All right.
First of all, we know that Bob is the living avatar.
He is the living avatar of slack.
He is literally saturated with slack.
You cannot give slack to Bob.
He already has as much slack as anyone can have.
Am I right or am I right?
All right.
And if you kill Bob.
If Bob is ovulating.
So we have to kill Bob.
A different kind of temperance going.
So we have to kill Bob, but you know, he comes back.
He just keeps coming back for more.
Yeah.
Jesus only died and came back from the dead once.
But Bob, we lost count of that a long time ago.
Well, I guess a lot of people.
Yeah.
It actually got kind of boring.
Yeah.
Watching Bob die actually got to the point where it was a little bit boring.
Yeah.
I really just, I've lost my appetite for killing Bob and I've immolated him myself a couple
of times.
He does smell good.
He's burning.
He's at last.
By the way, guys, did you tell me that Bob's followers are called Bobbies?
Well, a Bobby is not necessarily.
I mean, there are followers of Bob and there are Bobbies.
Okay.
Does this mean that, uh, that, that the, uh, uh, subvenient church has infiltrated the
British police force?
As a matter of fact, yes.
Like the Bobbies and stuff.
Yeah.
That's the constables.
Instead of automatic weapons.
No, it's the English police force or people who joined the church of the subgenius.
They think they get it, but, uh, all they really do is just repeat the same tired old
slogans over and over again.
And yeah,
that's why we, that's why everybody calls them Bobbies.
Well, you know why we repeat the same tired old slogans over and over again?
I'll tell you why we can bore so many people simultaneously and then they can talk about
it.
We're good to take facts and stuff.
We're waiting for you, Reverend Stang.
We're waiting for you to write some new slogans for us to repeat.
That's why we're repeating the same old slogans.
Oh, wait a minute.
Hold on.
Let me go get my notes.
All right.
There, there are some good ones.
He's got the claw.
Okay.
Here's, here's one for you.
Uh, Bob loves the sin, but hates the center.
I can get behind that.
Your rights end where Bob's fist begins.
Actually, both of those were channeled through tighter Gumfries, but this is Dr.
Legame.
This is a very recent one from Dr.
Katan Legame.
And I'm going to have to paraphrase.
It slack is like screwing.
The more you put in, the more you pull out.
He's totally lost his marbles.
Oh, here's what, here's what I quote from Bob himself.
No more penis candling for me.
Is that like ear candling?
Is this in reference to these soul attack delusions or to the fact that there have been recent penis transplants that have worked?
Well, and I guess one of these penis transplant people is even fathering a child.
No, a baby is coming out of his, uh, issuance.
There's one more.
You'll like this one.
Uh, Dr.
Sinister.
Um, just as strongly as you believe I'm going to hell.
I believe you're not.
That's a Reverend that I've been staying quote.
Okay.











Yeah.
So yeah, I don't believe they're going to hell just because I, just because they think I'm going to hell.
I don't think they're going to hell.
Well, who needs hell when you have earth?
All right.
Hold on.
We're having phone line problems again.
He can say that although they think he's going to hell, he doesn't necessarily have to think they're going to hell because he doesn't necessarily believe in such a place.
Well, who needs hell?
When we have earth, which is about to be destroyed on July 5th, 1998 at 7 00 AM, which could be, which could be five minutes from now for all we know.
Three minutes from now.
Who needs hell when we have earth?
Whose name I don't remember right now.
Did an album called, how could hell be any worse?
How could who?
Herod?
I've, I can think of ways.
Wasn't Herod the king in Israel when Santa Claus?
Was born?
Or I don't know if it was the photopian police or somebody, but they were telling me that, um, hair, it was Herod.
They called him the great cheese man.
My, um, he was a, he was king or governor or something.
Not like Jeb Bush, but.
Well, there was the, the, the department store in London.
Like this, you see back in, back in, back in the old days.
Yeah.
And we're going back towards this now, but, uh, you know, before there was feudalism, we had, uh, another form of, you know, feudalism.
We had a lot of corporatism like we have right now.
And, and the Roman province of Judea was actually a subsidiary of that, uh, that department store in London.
Goldstein and Marx?
No, that's, that's Emmanuel Goldstein, the evil good guy in, uh, back to the future.
There's no good guy like an evil good guy.
That's right.
The do-gooder could be the death of us.
Yeah.
They've already tried numerous times.
I think we ought to get out the boxing gloves this time.
Just say, okay, do-gooders, try and do some good right now.
Punch it out, knock it out like a famous boxer would punch someone's head.
You know, people actually, uh, boxers, uh, actually suffer more injuries when they're wearing gloves than, uh, than in bare knuckle boxing.
Well, that's why the British lost the war back in 1900 when they were trying to give them opium.
The boxer rebellion in China?
Yeah.
They didn't want to get opium.
They'd rather just, you know, hang around.
I don't know how it happened, but I guess it was like, um, a lot of things we do nowadays.
We learn a lot from the British.
Yep.
The red folks are coming.
Yep.
They're coming all over everybody else.
It's out of disrespect.
I hear the drums beating slowly.
You hear them in the distance.
They're coming to ravage my town.
The Brits.
Redco.
Redco.
Right.
Well, it just sounds to me like you're taking leave of your senses.
Because that's what happens.
I check out of my senses every single time I get on the air.
Honestly, I feel like a bad person even for telling the stories that I've told.
What if that minister friend of mine is listening now and...
There you go.
You know, what if he thinks I was belittling his experience?
I certainly wasn't.
I'd go upstairs and lock and load and come out looking for you.
That's the way all those Christian Bible ministries,
misdrony heads are.
He never struck me as the violent type.
He never struck me as the violent type.
I tell you what.
You know, I feel...
I tell you what.
I'm going to say right now.
I'm going to say right now.
You know what I'm more afraid of?
I am more afraid of hurting my friends' feelings
than having them get angry and shoot me in the head.
I'm more afraid of their feelings being hurt than them killing me.
Well, that's what killed Buddha.
Well, I'll remember that next time you hurt my feelings, man.
And you will have the right to lord that over me for the rest of our days,
should that come to pass.
No, I'll prove that you were wrong.
I'll prove that it was a dumb idea when you see that gun pointing at your face.
Dang, are you really going to...
I triple dog dare.
I dare you to stick a gun in my face, Reverend Stang.
I triple dog dare you to do that.
Well, yeah.
Well, but what if I do, man?
Stick a gun in your face and then go.
Well, so now are you more afraid of hurting my feelings?
Yeah, man, tell him.
I don't know what would happen.
I don't know what would happen.
You'd probably get like Popeye after eating spinach.
And you'd start beating up an old blue-toed Stang
with a pointed gun in his face.
That's the way I see it.
I wouldn't really shoot Dr. Sinister because then I wouldn't...
He wouldn't be alive to be humiliated further by being proved wrong.
So you have to like...
Because you're a Texan and you're a cowboy and you can shoot people.
I have to convince him, basically,
that he would much rather hurt my feelings than be shot by somebody.
Yeah.
Well, if I get shot in the head, I'd be too dead to care.
Right, yeah.
But since I'm not dead, I have to worry about how the people I care about feel.
Yeah, but then if you wore a nipple ring,
you'd be in quite some much trouble because the state law is against it now.
I hadn't thought about the nipple ring.
That's the nipple ring loophole you're referring to, Dave.
Yeah.
Well, if it's going to base your whole idea of happiness on your nipple ring,
then I just think that's a shallow way to go through life.
Hey, you got to live for something, right?
I mean, aren't we all hopelessly like tepid and shallow
and all those other words describing water?
What?
No.
We're not.
Well, maybe.
Just me, I guess.
Yeah, just saying.
You're a hydroelectric dam, I suppose.
This is my contribution to the theory
that science fiction is stranger than truth.
You know about the suppressed transmission, of course?
Sono i tempi moderni.
No? Ah, well.
It's the modern age.
How?
How?
Couldn't it be?
It's the modern age.
It's the modern age.
It's the modern age.
It's the modern age.
yes
Modern Time
It's the modern time!

It's the modern age!
Hey, let's go! Hey, let's go!
Let's go!
That thing if you want or if you want to leave it going.
That was Rural War Room, their album The Modern Age.
We would like to thank Dr. Sinister for letting us use his radio synesthesia show of December 6th on WCSB Cleveland.
And so we will. Thanks.
And thanks also to Dr. Sinister and WCSB.
For letting us also use the show of December 20th for our own purposes while we were out of town.
Praise Sin.
Hello, you're on the radio.
I'm on a radio?
You are on the radio.
I was on a squatting potty with my armpits in the air.
Well, you know, you can do both at the same time. It's possible.
Yeah, I enjoy doing both at the same time.
It's like rubbing your belly and scratching your head at the same time.
You know, I prefer to scratch my belly and rub my head.
I guess I'm just one of those people.
It's kind of like that whole divide about, you know, which way do you roll the toilet paper over or under.
I'm one of those guys who just prefers to rub his head and scratch his belly at the same time.
There's no paradigm argument.
It happens every semi-annually.
Semi-annually.
Semi-annually.
It could be.
You're saying anally wrong.
I'm wrong?
Nothing could be more wrong than saying it's wrong.
It's not wrong.
That's not wrong.
Does it?
Yeah, the question is, is it semi-annually or semi-annually?
There you go.
Yeah.
These are different things.
Two vastly, vastly, vastly different things.
I don't know different from what.
I mean, everything is the same to me.
I'm an illusionist.
What's the word?
What's that word?
Someone sees everything as the same.
Some have a human gland.
You mean the ground up glands of a pig perhaps or another animal?
I have a humorous.
I have a humorous too and I snap.
I have two of them actually.
Oh, well, I have two as well.
They're also known as a funny animal.
I have a funny bone, but it's not too funny if you smack it.
The funny bone is actually a nerve.
I know, but you know, humorous bone.
I've heard it said, and I've never been tased before, but I've heard it said that when you get tased, it's like your entire body had its funny bone hit.
That's what I've heard.
And you also urinate fabricatiously, quite, you undulate like a little, like a pig, which is probably, you know, the basis for a vast number of conspiracy theories.
What?
Well, I don't know.
I don't need excuses to urinate on myself.
Or be conspiratorial.
You didn't rhyme.
It's one of those things I'll do just because I can.
I'm really looking forward to getting old.
I'm looking forward to getting to the point where I can just piss on myself and nobody will think ill of it.
That's because nobody will be around you.
See, that's the great thing about getting old.
You know, because, you know, the sack gets real long and there's a divot on the front.
So when the little thing shrivels up and you get fat, so you end up pissing on your own sack.
But it's almost like a little water slide.
So it goes right out and ejects instead of dribbling down your knees like when you're young.
Wow.
And then, you know, to really impress the old lady because nothing turns her off.
Like, you know, showing her, you know, flapping it back and forth.
But you're doing the, you know, the big bend bell with the nuts.
It's great.
That's fascinating.
You know what?
There's one more person who wants to join our conversation here.
And again, that number is 216.
I got to get going anyways.
I got screaming little brats.
You guys have a great night.
It's been a pleasure.
And annually, not annually.
Stop pronouncing it wrong.
Have a great night.
Thank you.
I love you guys.
Bye.
No, no.
Hello, you are on the air.
It's been a long time.
What?
Huh?
Oh.
It's Daniel.
You're on the air.
Hey, I can rub my belly and slap Dave's head at the same time.
That's a valuable skill.
I can slap your mammy ten times and disagree with everything about you that you just said.
I can rub your belly and slap my mammy ten times at the same time.
I can rub the Buddha's belly, slap your mammy, and sing 20 songs before you get up in the morning.
I can belly.
I can build a wall between you and Canada and make you pay for it.
I can trump that one by saying I can build a wall between universes and stop the interdimensional creatures from bugging my thighs.
See, I'm going to come right out and say that I am not capable of building a wall at all.
I just, I lack the practical skills.
Have you tried Minecraft?
I have not tried Minecraft.
In Minecraft.
Yeah.
Isn't that just like...
It's like basically digital Legos.
Kind of, yeah.
Yeah, it is, but it's faster.
That's what kids seem to want this year, are Legos and fascist doctors.
Are you going to spew back when you're questioned by the...
Wait, you said they're fascist?
You said they're fascist Legos?
No, I said...
No, I didn't say that they're...
I was talking to Stan.
That's what the kids want for Christmas is Legos, blocks, and fascists.
I'll show you something.
At least the trains will run on time.
The little teeny tiny...
Look like little bridge trains.
That's what just got him some Soviet blocks.
No, that's just...
Sorry, it's all I got tonight.
It's not even your show.
You're doing...
You're already serving above and beyond the call of duty, Keith.
You got to do what you got to do.
Well, I haven't come in and done a show in a month and a half.
Well, you have a legitimate reason.
Well, I've been running around the building.
I've been locked out for the last month.
See, Stan, you have a legitimate reason for having not done a show in the last month.
I have no legitimate reason for having done a show in the last month and a half.
Well, that's not true.
You did wonderful shows.
The ones that I called in on, those were fabulous.
Or at least I've been called that.
That's just your narcissism talking.
Oh, darn it.
Oh.
What does a Greek mythological character have to do with this?
From PR News in Washington, I'm under investigation.
The Jongrong Company makes clouds of electroplated combustible dust.
Scorched and shredded, not far from PR News.
Residents of Toledo, Ohio, are being harmful.
Palestinian Health Ministry says showers and baths are fine,
but residents cannot blast fires in sparsely populated Central America.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says this is PR News from Washington.
That's quite a voluminous lack of information right there.
Sorry.
I drove by our local big creationist museum today and it wasn't open on a Sunday.
You'd think on Sunday the creationist museum.
It would be open, but nay.
Well, yeah, you've got to go to churches and hear that story there.
So we went to the dinosaur park instead.
But, you know, they're not going to save any souls if they're not going to open their frog museum on Sundays
when everybody's most gullible for it.
Ah, but Trevor and Stan, you can just build a meditation mission anyway.
Of course not.
That's not what they have in mind.
They have in mind slavery.
The slavery of an entire human race.
Well, nobody's perfect.
Yeah, I just can't forgive them.
Just as the Lord would.
Remember, we all have our mistakes.
Like, what would Bob do or what would Doug do?
Bob is perfectly imperfect.
He does, every time he makes a mistake, which is continuously, he makes more money by accident.
Yeah, he fails upward no matter what you do.
Yeah.
Yeah.









I mean, come on, Dave.
You've killed Bob before, haven't you?
In my mind, so many times.
I've been part of the 82 murder, yeah.
I mean, how many times have you killed Bob?
I've made for the bullets.
I didn't kill him.
He comes back every time.
Not just, like...
He quit coming to our shows because he got fired of being shot.
But every time he gets shot, like, he's able to actually get money out of that.
Yeah, he wouldn't have gotten shot if he hadn't wanted to on some level.
He is kind of kinky that way.
What I can't understand is how he de-registers.
The impression of his having even been there and being shot.
There's never any EMS calls or police calls.
Nothing to back up the fact that he actually, you know, is kind of like Jesus in that way.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Dave, stop right there.
Look, he is nothing like Jesus.
Jesus only died and came back.
He only died and came back once.
That's...
There you go.
All right, Bob Dobbs has died and come back more times than anybody can count.
Well, not only that, but Bob was actually born.
Unlike Jesus, he was sort of, um...
Well...
Impish.
Whatever.
Whatever they...
Wherever they came from.
Look...
Everyone agrees it wasn't a normal birth.
And a lot of people think there wasn't any birth whatsoever.
Look, I've run into...
I've run into Bob all the time.
I never thought of Bob as a bird.
I thought he was like a...
Yeah, he always gets...
He always makes out on the insurance every time you run into him, right?
Oh, it's even worse than that.
You're insurance company has to pay him a bunch of money every time you run into Bob.
No, I'll tell you what.
No, I...
I encounter him...
On the streets all the time, okay?
I don't mean literally run into him.
But one time I went into this coffee shop.
And Bob was there.
And...
And...
You know you can't put out Bob's pipe, right?
You just...
You can't.
We don't know...
We don't know that it has ever gone out.
You could use...
You could use water.
You could use halon.
You could use whatever.
You're not going to be able to put out Bob's pipe.
It's like the ever-smoking pipe of Elminster the Sage in Forgotten Realms.
It's that kind of pipe.
It's never going to go out.
All right?
Yeah.
And we all know that it's permanently attached...
We all know that it's permanently attached to his mouth.
And I go into a coffee shop.
And...
And...
And there is Bob Dobbs right there.
With his pipe still burning.
And the management is telling him,
No, you can't smoke in here.
And he refuses to listen.
And so eventually they throw him out.
They throw him out.
And I...
I saw this happen once.
I swear to Jehovah One.
I actually saw this happen once.
They threw him out the front door right as a bus was coming along.
They literally threw him under the bus right as the bus was coming along.
We went out there.
We went out there after the bus went away.
And the only thing left over was the pipe.
It was still burning.
But you know what?
When we tried to pick it up, it just started fading away.
And a couple days later,
I saw Bob again.
Just walking down the street like any other man.
You can't...
You can kill Bob as many times as you want.
It all works out well for him in the end.
And he still had that...
That pipe in his mouth.
Man, miracles of miracles.
I just...
I don't know what this has to do with his...
...
...
...
...
...





...
...

It makes you want to kill him all the more.
Well, this is the duty of every subgenius, is to kill Bob.
If you see Bob, you have to kill him.
And this is why, all right?
He said...
That's what he said.
He said, give me slack or kill me.
But he's already perfectly saturated with slack.
You cannot possibly give him any more slack than he already has.
Therefore, you have to kill him.
Wow.
It's all right.
He'll be okay.
He'll come back.
He sounds like a Jesuit.
or something. You've got an answer
for everything.
I think deep
thoughts about these things, yes.
Maybe you should
start a new money-making show
called Ask Dr. Sinister.
Well, you
know what? Ask Dr. Sinister.
216-
5 is the number to call if you want to ask
Dr. Sinister any question that
comes to your mind. I will do my best to get you
an answer.
First, we have a new caller.
Hello?
It was one of those guys.
It was one of those callers.
One of those callers who just calls up
to tell me I suck and then hangs up.
But he keeps listening week after week
anyway.
It's kind of repetitive, though.
I mean, you're always saying you suck.
Yeah.
What if not everybody jumps to agree with you?
Just maybe
a small majority, but
I don't.
Just enough for Liebensraum,
comrade.
Don't you think?
You're welcome. Liebensraum.
So,
nobody, Mark, had a question. Go ahead, Mark.
Okay, how many
ways has Bob been killed?
Nobody
can count that. Nobody can
count that high.
The ones that we have on videotape
were involved
handguns.
But we know that that
is not...
not a complete documentation of the record
of the times that Bob has been killed.
Well, Obama probably
set up those handgun shootings of Bob
just to have an excuse to take everyone's
handguns away, starting in
1984.
Look how long. He still hasn't taken
the handguns away, which proves how incompetent
he must be.
Yeah.
Right.
But the handguns are just...
That's just one way that Bob has been killed.
We know that Bob...
Bob has been killed.
...that he's immune to.
What?
He's walked off cliffs.
He's stumbled into
volcanoes.
He's been thrown in front of the bus
out of coffee shops. You name it.
He's been dosed with Zyklon B.
I mean, like, you can...
You can kill Bob
any way that you can kill a normal human being.
But he'll keep
coming back.
He keeps
coming back for more.
Look at that damn tie.
That's my favorite right there.
You know, I have your
assassinations with cheating and so forth.
I mean, you just grab that old Bob tie
and just pull his...
His face turns all purple.
He's gasping for air, you know,
because he's got the pipe in his mouth, so...
Never mind.
The funniest ways
are when he kills himself
with doing things like tying his tie
but strangling.
You know, cleaning his gun,
shooting himself in the foot,
getting an infection behind, that kind of thing.
Yeah, I mean, it always
works out for him.
This is one of the fundamental characteristics.
Lighting his pipe
using a thermonuclear weapon.
Oh, I remember those days.
Yes, exactly.
These are...
This is one of the fundamental characteristics of Bob Dobbs
is that whatever
kind of harm you try to inflict on him,
he will survive.
And not only will he survive,
all right, he might die.
You might see his body be destroyed,
but you'll see him again another day.
And he'll come back stronger.
This is just how he is.
You know, that whole saying about
whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger?
With Bob, the opposite is true.
Whatever kills him makes him stronger.
What do you think Bob Dobbs
would have thought of the Democratic debate
when...
I think he would have...
He's trying to censor Bernie.
I think he would have found it
to be a great big yawn fest.
Because it's just a conspiracy acting
as it does.
I have another question.
Could he die if he wanted to?
Does die.
It's just coming back.
That's what he can't put a plug on.
Okay.
Could he die and stay dead
if he wanted to?
There have been cases where he died once
but came back twice.
Resulting in more than one Bob
in one time continuum
which is a problem.
And usually one of them...
Well, one of them has to live
and one has to die again.
But when you try to kill that other Bob,
when you try to kill that other Bob,
he keeps surviving too.
This is the problem.
All right?
There's a huge...
There's a huge...
There was a situation where it got out of control
and there were literally
so many Bobs
that they overran.
They overran the whole planet
and they had to reboot the entire system.
Right. I mean, we have this problem
of Bob continuity errors.
Pretty serious ones.
Yeah.
You talk about a glitch in the matrix.
This is like the whole matrix
had been erased and replaced
with a shoddy substitute.
Random chaos.
That's what it decides to be called.
You mean like...
It's looking more and more like that.
It's like a Minecraft game every day.
It just gets a little blockier
and a little bit more pixely.
Hmm.
I don't understand the retrograde thing there,
but I'm telling you for sure
it's a new action.
Like, think of it this way, all right?
Once upon a time,
there were the Cleveland Browns
and then they moved to Baltimore
and started wearing purple
and then they won the Super Bowl.
All right?
And then the new Browns came back.
Like, they tried to kill the Browns,
but they came back.
They came back from the dead,
but it was just an inferior imitation.
Does that really happen?
I don't know enough about football games
to know whether you're just exaggerating
or telling the truth.
I'm probably exaggerating,
but I didn't say anything factually incorrect.
Well, I think every now and then
humor and exaggeration
should be allowed on our radio shows.
You know, not all the time.
Yeah.
This statement is a lie.
This statement is a lie.
This statement is a lie.
I saw him shoot Bob.
It shows what you get with a liberal agenda.
You pump people full of drugs
and pipe dreams of what happens.
They come gunning for people like Bob.
But those folks don't realize something.
You can't kill the truth.
Bob is not gonna be stopped by any bullet.
He'll be back,
and man, you better watch out
because he's headed straight for Washington.
And that's all I've got to say.
Excuse me.
I have to go pray.
Yeah, right.
His new album entitled Bob on Bob is released
and debuts with a bullet
at number two on the charts.
Was never heard, no seen again
Officially presumed is dead
But the words he left behind
Still echo through my mind
I'm the only man who'll ever get to
And come back alive
He's the only man who'll ever get to
And come back alive
So...
This is no joke now.
Not building up to a joke.
It was hot.
And I knew it was going to stay hot.
Terribly hot.
Exactly hot.
Exactly hot.
Exactly as I had predicted.
This is beautiful, ain't it?
Yeah, but it's hot.
Oh, we'll have a swell time here.
Yeah, hot time.
Just like the movies.
Yeah, just like the movies.
Soon me and Natasha will be right under them palm trees.
Soon you and Natasha will be knocking down them palm trees.
He's gone!
He's gone!
Find him!
Find him!
Find him!
Find him!
He's gone!
He's gone!
He's gone!
He's gone!
He's gone!
He's gone!
He's gone!
Come back.
Where's he gone?





Oh, my God.
Well, Mr. Clark.
Well, I've got to run.
If you don't want to be stood up if he doesn't get up,
you're not going to do it.
Well, no.
I'm going to do it.


You're going to be all right.
Stubborn.
Stubborn.

Stubborn.
Don't go.
or something
and um
the scene is
an American
and a Britisher
and they've been
discussing all afternoon
a little juice
and all the vodka
and um
the Britisher says
I know you've hunted
in many many
sections of the world
and I know
that you've killed
any numerous
amount of animals
of all types
birds
reptiles
things of that nature
but you have
never hunted
Bob
in that he's
the great white hunter
and I think
as far as I'm concerned
greatest white hunter
of all times
yeah I'm looking
forward to meeting him
he better be
pretty damn good
I'll clue you
cause I've spent
a hundred thousand dollars
coming over this
god forsaken territory
true I've made
some foolish investments
I've married
three or four times
one was a teenager
I was really drunk
down in the beach
I was a big D one night
married a child
married a child
god she was heaven
oh heaven to heaven
I'm looking forward
to this guy
I hope to god
you say he's as good as he is
believe me he is
in fact he's coming up right now
striking blue eyes
and carrying a 22 short rod
what the hell's he expect
to kill with that
I've only known him
to be always a crack shot
strange I must say
going out after elephant today
he'll have to be good
all right won't he
yeah yeah yeah
I'm not sure





we have a friend
that we don't talk about

sorta I'm the brando type
oh what a friend
that we don't like to talk about

but you should see what our friend can do

degradating rot of hell
and hit you right smack with it
and then he says

even though you've been back two or three weeks now. Isn't that nice? Here's one. Says,
Dear Bob, please don't pick any more winners. I'm going broke. And you bull thrower, how are
you going to crawl out of this? That's a nice one. I like the short one. At least you get them over
with in a hurry. Dear Bob, I had heard so much about you I was prepared to like you immediately.
I tuned in your show and you talked me out of it. Here's another one from Springfield. Could you
please give me the exact address in Washington, D.C. of the Bureau of Indian Affairs? I've always
wanted to have an affair with an Indian. This from Springfield also. Dear Bob, this morning you
advertised boys' suits for youngsters aged three to seven. You said they were trimmed with piping.
Piping in a boy's suit? Wouldn't you think they'd be housebroken at that age? Hang in there, Robert.
Yours truly. This letter from New Britain says, Dear Bob, I was standing in the kitchen in front
of my radio this morning pulling my two-way stretch over my hips when you said, Are you a
little on the fat side? What I want to know is,
can you see out here? If so, I must dress somewhere else. Well, how's the thing? I'm
going to say, Praise Bob. That's what I'm going to say. Praise Bob. That's all you need to say.
If you have faith. Praise Bob. Or a face. No, kill Bob. If you have that face with the pipe.
No, that too. Kill Bob. But that doesn't sound as good until after you've said,
Praise Bob, so much that you've gotten sick of it. Then saying, Kill Bob, is very satisfying.
And actually killing him, I've heard, is fine. That's what I thought was the luxurious part of
the whole mantra right there.
Was the fact that you start praising and you end up killing.
And always the way it happens. Yep.
It's basically like one of the sacraments of the church.
Yep. It's the Frankenstein story over and over and over again.
Did we create the monster or did the monster create us?
That's the question of the ages. And it goes back much further than we actually think of the industrial revolution.
And it goes back much further than we actually think of the industrial revolution.
Or did we create monsters out of ourselves?
Or did we create monsters out of ourselves?
Yes. You have to ask the God monster about that, son.
And he's going to lie, by definition.
It's like asking your twin sisters on the N-Day in the passageways there.
What would your sisters say?
Right, exactly. Like asking your twin sisters out on a date. It's redundant.
Yeah.
And illegal.
Well, some of them think it's twice as nice.
Well, I'm sure it is. But that's why it's illegal.


Because if it wasn't, everybody would be doing it.
And then, well, you know, it'd be a trumped-up world.
Well, it already is. So why even try?
Why even try, indeed. You know, I ask myself the same question week after week.
Well, mercifully, this hour of...
Now, let's have the forest ranger dance right here in the old barn right now.
Let's have the show right here. Get out those scripts. Let's...
Just have the show right here right now.
Well, mercifully, this...
I've got a mustache. I've got a fake mustache. I can play the old man.
Yeah, and you can wear a colic and stuff and be like Donald Trumpler or something like that.
You know, do all kinds of things with historical facts and make them...
All right, well, anyway, mercifully, this program is coming to an end here.
Oh, thank God. Oh, Jesus Lord, praise the Lord.
All righty.
I knew that... I had faith that there was something good in the future, and this is it.
Yep.
The end of the show.
The end of the show.

I knew I saw something.
The end is near.
I saw something in the window.
So thanks for calling in, folks.
Hope we'll hear from you again next time.
Thank you, Peter.
This has been Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland. Stay tuned.
Thank you, Dr. Synesther, for use of show and for babysitting hours.
And thanks, Uber Ales, to Reverend Susie the Flusie of WREK Atlanta and Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.
Susie did the amazing job.
The amazing Kill Bob collage we heard up in there.
The song I Wanna Be Bob was by Little Theodore, and the song Give Thanks to Bob was by Reverend Tony Bauer.
This has been Hour of Slack number 1552.
For more information, see subgenius.com.
And praise Bob.
When I told you to go away from that door, you knew it wasn't Bob's voice, but you checked up on him just to make sure.
If Huh's Baby I diamond comforts you,
