1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,780
Around Dard City and in the Territory on West, there's just one way to handle the killers and the spoilers, and that's with a U.S. Marshal and the spell of...

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,240
The Subgenius Power of Squash!

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm scheduled for January.

4
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,440
No one's claiming responsibility.

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,180
No one is expanding.

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,200
No one was attacked in the middle of a procession.

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,800
No one's been arrested.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,520
No one found it suspicious.

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,580
No one is stepping down.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,560
No one needs to focus more.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,620
No one suspects Islamist militants.

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,200
No one is washing ashore on Florida's Atlantic coast.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,460
No one's blaming the weather.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,700
No one is scheduled for January.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,500
On Wall Street 213-672-327-6315-16.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
The turtles are blaming PR.

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,240
More news.

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:05,520


19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:05,520


20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:05,520


21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:05,520


22
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:05,520


23
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:05,520


24
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,760
bye bye

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,880
Awesome!

26
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,320
Thank you.

27
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,940
Thank you.

28
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,560
That lively instrumental was made by the Rudy Schwartz Project

29
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,640
on the album entitled Take Me in Your Arms and Sing to Me Like Dick Powell.

30
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,640
And thanks to Mr. Fernandinendi Lemur

31
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:04,860
for the song.

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,460
For the first two minutes before that.

33
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,380
But this is Hour of Slack number 1760

34
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:17,860
and much of it was recorded on July 4th of the so-called 2019

35
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,460
on location of the cult compound

36
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:28,200
where the technically 24th annual Ex Day Drill was held.

37
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,800
Dr. Howell, Dr. Philo Drummond, and yours truly,

38
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,480
Reverend Ivan Stang, presiding.

39
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,140
Along with Reverend Lord Angry Larry.

40
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,080
I've got a question, Dr. Howell.

41
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,660
May I share one question?

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,900
Yeah, sure.

43
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,300
I'm Reverend What the Fog, and you were mentioning the chick...

44
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,200
Oh, Reverend What the Fog. Okay.

45
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,880
Yes, thank you for pronouncing it correctly.

46
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,820
You were mentioning the chick pamphlets.

47
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,460
Chick tracks.

48
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,540
The chick tracks.

49
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,660
Were you familiar with the Luciferians?

50
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,560
Oh, yeah.

51
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,540
They're wonderful parodies.

52
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,260
They have disappeared from the web.

53
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,860
I have a...

54
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,600
I have a copy of only one of theirs.

55
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,100
Yeah.

56
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,300
Does someone know of some source where they can be found still?

57
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,100
I don't know, but the thing is the Luciferians were at two...

58
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,480
The first two Ex Day Drills in 98.

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,660
They were here in 98.

60
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,940
They were like policing the place.

61
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,860
Wow.

62
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,720
They were definitely on the Holocaustal team.

63
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,700
And there was nobody...

64
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,480
They were literally hog-tying evangelicals

65
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,420
during the Battle of Armageddon

66
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,760
because they were both military.

67
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,340
They were military guys.

68
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,780
As is right and good.

69
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,560
Like, they were serious...

70
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,780
What would you call them?

71
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,420
Devil worshippers.

72
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,340
The SWAT team of the military.

73
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,360
They were like some kind of elite...

74
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,940
The Rangers.

75
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,600
Elite secret guys.

76
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,860
And they were Luciferians.

77
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,200
And they had a hell of a rant.

78
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,220
It was a white guy and a black guy.

79
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,200
And they both...

80
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,120
They both ranted like a sumbitch.

81
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,920
And I have too have wondered...

82
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
What happened to them?

83
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,880
Did they ascend to hell?

84
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,500
Or, you know...

85
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,820
Ascend is the wrong word.

86
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,540
Or get sent to Iraq.

87
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,180
Well, there are all kinds of lame parodies

88
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,100
that are available, but none so spot on

89
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,740
as those anti-chick tracks.

90
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,700
Well, I'm sorry you like theirs

91
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,440
better than those created by some of us.

92
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,240
Do you remember that one?

93
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,500
That recording by R.T. Calhoun

94
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,160
about the Luciferian conspiracy?

95
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,600
Do you remember that one?

96
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,300
R.T.

97
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,800
R.T. Calhoun.

98
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:33,900


99
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:33,900


100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,720
He talked real slow.

101
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,460
And I'm going to bring to you

102
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,600
the story of the Luciferian conspiracy.

103
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,280
And it was about...

104
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Had a whole lot to do with homosexuality.

105
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,560
Remember that one?

106
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,200
As always.

107
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,080
And that...

108
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,680
Are you talking about a radio preacher?

109
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,240
Yeah.

110
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,780
No, it was a tape that we got from...

111
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,060
When we were getting all those crazy tapes.

112
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,920
He's the guy who had the fake apocalypse

113
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,300
several years ago.

114
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,860
Oh, okay. Right, right.

115
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,720
His name was R.T. Calhoun.

116
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,820
R.T. Farty.

117
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,760
I wonder if I have a copy of that.

118
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,860
According to the

119
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,760
Jack Chick ethos,

120
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,160
you have to evangelize.

121
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,200
You have to share, as they say,

122
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,640
the good news that Jesus,

123
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,000
who created hell, has created a loophole

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,500
so you might get out of it.

125
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,480
But

126
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,420
they have actually a tract,

127
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,280
and you may have seen it, where a woman

128
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,580
leads a perfect Christian life

129
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,200
and she dies and

130
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,000
they say, well, now you've been a good Christian.

131
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,960
Welcome to heaven.

132
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,380
You're a good and faithful servant.

133
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,740
You mean I'll have a giant mansion in heaven?

134
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,900
Well, it won't exactly be a mansion.

135
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,880
It's here on the outskirts.

136
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,420
And she comes, but this has no windows.

137
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,460
This is like a garage.

138
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,360
I'm supposed to be in here forever in heaven?

139
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,620
I'm glad to be in heaven.

140
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,620
Well, you see, you didn't witness to our Lord and Savior.

141
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,100
So you didn't bring more people in.

142
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,760
So this is your heavenly mansion for all time.

143
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,220
This garage in heaven's suburbs across the tracks.

144
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,300
Not in a good area.

145
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,660
Right next to the liquor store.

146
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,020
Yeah.

147
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,800
Because that guy was good too, but, well, you know.

148
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,300
The liquor isn't anything to shout about.

149
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,520
It's not the fiery stuff they sell in hell.

150
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,220
If heaven is guilt, no sex and no show,

151
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,720
then I'm not sure if I really want to go.

152
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,160
Oh.

153
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,460
The wages of sin

154
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,580
The price that you pay

155
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,280
Is worrying and fretting

156
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,440
Every second of the day

157
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,740
The church and the state

158
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,100
You've got in country kind

159
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,380
One gets your body

160
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,800
The other gets your mind

161
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,540
Mary, Mary Magdalene

162
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,260
How about a date?

163
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,480
You've been wasting your time

164
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,780
Staying up so late

165
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,860
Your boyfriend's dead

166
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,620
The word is you're a whore

167
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,760
Just about then

168
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,140
I heard a knock on the door

169
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,400
And I realized then

170
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,660
That the wages of sin

171
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,720
Was a bad reputation

172
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,320
And too many friends

173
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,660
The wages of sin

174
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,200
The wages of sin

175
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,820
The wages of sin

176
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,420
The wages of sin

177
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,440
Thank you.

178
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,120
Thank you.

179
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,600
Thank you.

180
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,440
Thank you.

181
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,320
Thank you.

182
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,320


183
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,240
Thank you.

184
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,280
Thank you.

185
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,500
Thank you.

186
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,120
Thank you.

187
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,660
Thank you.

188
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:48,660


189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,740
Thank you.

190
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:51,860
Thank you.

191
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:51,860


192
00:11:51,860 --> 00:12:00,180
That was Reverend Lord Angry Larry's newish band, The Slutrods, from the album Surf and Clue.

193
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,060
A ditty,

194
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,440
called Dad's Rail Job.

195
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,040
Before that, an excerpt from Wages of Sin by The Rainmakers.

196
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:18,700
Reverend Angry Larry is the guitar virtuoso behind the legendary Detroit surf punk doctor band,

197
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,120
The Amino Acids, and many other bands.

198
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:28,740
And he's a hot rod mechanic, and he's such a bull goose nerd,

199
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,860
that he's a horror host on

200
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:39,100
Detroit TV, and runs the famous Reardsville Records used albums, bulldada, and kitsch store

201
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,140
in Mount Clemens, Michigan, just north of Detroit,

202
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:53,520
which is the only retail outlet in the entire world that sells authorized subgenius membership packs.

203
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,440
He's also a motion picture special effects and makeup artist.

204
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,600
As such,

205
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,240
Quite an experienced artist.

206
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,320
And he's a man of his word.

207
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,580
He's got a lifetime to live in fear, isn't it?

208
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,300
That's what he needs to be a slave.

209
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:14,700
Anyway, Reverend Angry Larry is surely one of America's leading experts on the greatest of the worst movies ever made.

210
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,240
I always said this about Ed Wood.

211
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,260
People can say what they want about him, I thought Ed Wood did great movies.

212
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,820
Well, we're still quoting him.

213
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,320
Exactly.

214
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,060
Everybody thinks he was the worst director and everything else.

215
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,760
No, he wasn't.

216
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,100
I was looking at it like, if that guy wanted to make a movie, he found a way to make a movie.

217
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,960
He got the money together, and that guy made movies.

218
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,040
I used to do that.

219
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,400
There's lots of other movies out there that are crap.

220
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,920
Like Manos, Hands of Fate.

221
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,560
Which, of course, means hands, hands of fate.

222
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,200
Right.

223
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,460
Well, you showed your own worsened version of Manos a couple of years ago.

224
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:51,780
Yep.

225
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,540
Did you know they want to make a new Manos?

226
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,300
I heard that.

227
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,920
But it's going to be a comedy.

228
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,220
The little girl that's in that movie actually is Manos.

229
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,440
The guy who plays Manos, that was his daughter.

230
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,500
She cried when they watched the movie because only three people voiced all of it.

231
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,420
Because they didn't have money to have sound.

232
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,060
Right.

233
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,660
So an adult actually did the voice of the little girl.

234
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,280
Oh.

235
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,000
And so she wants to make it.

236
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,720
And the dude who played Manos is still alive.

237
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,080
And yeah, they want to make a movie.

238
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,480
They want to make Manos 2.

239
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,660
Well, they're going to hire Larry Blamire to direct.

240
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,420
Yeah.

241
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:27,420


242
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,380
Hey.

243
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,040
Huh.

244
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,460
Hey.

245
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,340
You know, you can't set out to make a bad film.

246
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,560
You have to make the best film you can.

247
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,040
And it's probably going to turn out bad.

248
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,500
I've seen a movie that they tried to make bad and it was bad.

249
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,220
They're always bad.

250
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,060
Not in a good, bad way.

251
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,900
It was like you're trying way too hard.

252
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,200
No.

253
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:48,580
Yeah.

254
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,100
Yeah.

255
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,920
That doesn't work.

256
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,200
Watch Plan 9 from Outer Space.

257
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,860
That's a good, bad movie.

258
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,900
Teenagers from Outer Space.

259
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:56,800
It's true.

260
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,460
Which is the amino acid film.

261
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,680
Really?

262
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,100
That is the go-to film that the aminos.

263
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,400
They have the skeleton ray.

264
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,160
Yes.

265
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,660
Yeah.

266
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,600
And the giant crawfish.

267
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,200
Yeah.

268
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,720
The disintegrator ray.

269
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,360
The focusing disintegrator ray, which the aminos took.

270
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,560
Oh, right.

271
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,180
Of course.

272
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,180
Which was a, what was the company?

273
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,120
I want to say Dinky, but it wasn't.

274
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,680
Cuomo.

275
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,500
No.

276
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,320
They made cap guns and stuff like that.

277
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,420
Well, you don't want an unfocused disintegrator ray.

278
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,600
It'll disintegrate even the disintegrator.

279
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:28,980
Yeah.

280
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,740
What do you know?

281
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,640
And then they've got the-

282
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,220
It disintegrated.

283
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,460
Giant mountain-sized transparent crawdad.

284
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:34,920
Disintegrated.

285
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:35,960
Disintegrated.

286
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,480
Yeah.

287
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,360
Daffy Duck.

288
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,760
In Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a half century when he, I'll shoot you with my disintegrator

289
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,240
ray, and he did this and it disintegrated.

290
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,840
He goes, what do you know?

291
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,160
It disintegrated.

292
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,600
Yeah.

293
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,160
All right.

294
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,940
Well, that has Planet X in it.

295
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,720
Yes.

296
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,340
Yes, it does.

297
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:53,700
Yeah.

298
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,220
It's the only source of shaving cream, Adam.

299
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:57,660
Yeah.

300
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,660
And it's easy to get there.

301
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,020
You just follow the planets.

302
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,260
A through, you know.

303
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:02,540
Yeah.

304
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,720
As Porky Pig points out.

305
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:16,080
Interesting thing that years ago, Tweety Bird was actually just supposed to be a baby.

306
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,100
An embryo.

307
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,480
I always assumed Tweety was a chick.

308
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,300
Was supposed to be, yeah.

309
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,500
He was supposed to be a baby.

310
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,120
Uh-huh.

311
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,400
And he was originally pink and the sensors didn't like it.

312
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:25,560
Right.

313
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,800
They made them change him to yellow.

314
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,740
But they also said he, you've, oh, what was it?

315
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,540
Was it, someone had to wear pants.

316
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,720
Well.

317
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,460
Well, Porky.

318
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,680
No, but Porky Pig never wore pants.

319
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,060
No.

320
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,400
It always bothered me.

321
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:41,760
All right.

322
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,560
You think that, but it's not true because I've got all the early Porky Pig cartoons

323
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,960
and several of them, he appears to have no pants.

324
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,280
Then he puts his hand in his pocket.

325
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,620
He pulls out a wallet.

326
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,540
That's one of those odd things that certain pigs can do.

327
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,880
Hollywood pigs can do that.

328
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,220
Right.

329
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:03,240
Well, there'd be a dog like Pluto who acts like a dog and then a dog like Goofy who is

330
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,520
anthropomorphic.

331
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,580
Who owns Pluto.

332
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,940
Pluto doesn't get to talk, but he can hold up a sign.

333
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,640
Right.

334
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,220
And where do they come from with his thoughts and feelings.

335
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:12,720
Yeah.

336
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,200
But he got a planet named after him or a dwarf planet named after him.

337
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,040
So there you go.

338
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,780
Yeah.

339
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,340
There's some.

340
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,260
Yeah.

341
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,320
I think that's a little bit of logic in some of those.

342
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,560
Donald Duck didn't have pants, but Porky had pants.

343
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,620
Porky.

344
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,560
Not all the time though.

345
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,480
Well, he could reach in.

346
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,260
I tell you.

347
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,680
Yeah.

348
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:31,720
Yeah.

349
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,120
Maybe he was wearing pig colored pants.

350
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,860
Pig colored tights or something.

351
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,060
Oh, that makes me feel better.

352
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,760
Does it?

353
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,200
Yeah.

354
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,980
I see people walk around all the time when I'm at work.

355
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,720
People wearing like yoga pants that are the same color as skin.

356
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,800
And I go, that's bad.

357
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,840
Don't do that.

358
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,240
Because that's not good.

359
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,240


360
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,240


361
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,240


362
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,240


363
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,240


364
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,240


365
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,240


366
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,240


367
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,940
Because it looks like you're walking around naked.

368
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,680
I've been seeing that.

369
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,260
Yeah.

370
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,480
I've had been shocked from a distance.

371
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,760
It's like that woman's got no shirt on.

372
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,120
Oh.

373
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,460
It's just the same color as the rest of her.

374
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,400
She's wearing yoga pants for shirts.

375
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,360
Yeah.

376
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,600
It catches my eye.

377
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,180
Yeah.

378
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,880
That's for sure.

379
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,360
A gift to the male gaze of contemporary fashion.

380
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:13,660
Okay.

381
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,820
Here's a weird thing Porky Pig said.

382
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,240
Where's that feedback coming from?

383
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:18,780
Porky Pig.

384
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,280
What about him?

385
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,040
Porky.

386
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,220
Porky Pig.

387
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,220


388
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,220


389
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,220


390
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,220


391
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,220


392
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,220


393
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,220


394
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,220


395
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,220


396
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:30,360
Well, in one of those cartoons, Daffy or somebody says, your sister wears army

397
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:30,640
boots.

398
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,500
And Porky says, my sister doesn't wear army boots.

399
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,740
My sister works in a butcher shop and smokes ham.

400
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,140
And says it that way.

401
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,600
Really with an accent on the smokes ham.

402
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,100
I'm like, what the hell?

403
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,440
How are they telling these children?

404
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,220
Porky's sister.

405
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,260
Works in a butcher shop.

406
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,260
And smokes ham.

407
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:58,740
Right.

408
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,360
We got it.

409
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,340
I know what that can mean.

410
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:08,040
I'm going to go get my ham smoked up there at Sister Bessie's.

411
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,500
Go see Aunt May and get my ham smoked.

412
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,720
You know what I mean?

413
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,380
Yeah.

414
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:14,520
Yeah.

415
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:16,980
Yeah.

416
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,800
Just kidding.

417
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:21,880
No.

418
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:21,880


419
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:21,880


420
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:21,880


421
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,320
You're talking about the pig here, right?

422
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,740
We're talking aboutảng

423
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:50,040
mentioned in答orot station.

424
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,820
I wanted to

425
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,860
ask you gentlemen if you are familiar with

426
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,000
the most atrociously

427
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,580
bad film I have ever seen

428
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,320
called The Goat Man.

429
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,920
It's a documentary. The Goat Man.

430
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,800
Is that the men who stare at

431
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,940
goats? No, but I think

432
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,720
Susie sent me a book

433
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,040
about the Goat Man.

434
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,460
I've read about the guy.

435
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,800
I didn't know they had a movie. The Wagon Train Led by

436
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,860
Goats? The Pet Goat read by

437
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,660
George Bush on 9-11.

438
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,820
Somehow this proved he was a man

439
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,700
of God because he was driving all these

440
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
goats. He was a shepherd. Plus he

441
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,800
had everything he owned on

442
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,280
his shopping cart.

443
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,860
Or in those days they didn't have shopping

444
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,160
carts. It was a big wagon.

445
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,860
His covered shopping cart. He was a junk

446
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,300
collector with goats.

447
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,820
And he traveled all around the country

448
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,700
and he had

449
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,720
slack. He was an avatar

450
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,960
an early avatar of slack.

451
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,660
In the documentary they track

452
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,680
down the Goat Man who is now living in a

453
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,740
nursing home and he was surrounded by

454
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,640
women from his former congregation who

455
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,580
wouldn't leave him alone.

456
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,960
Oh, you remember the time?

457
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,100
And he was just sitting there obviously just waiting for the next hour of meds.

458
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Missing his goats.

459
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,500
Yeah. And then at the end they had

460
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,520
closing music by a guy in

461
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,660
brand spanking new cowboy costume

462
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,880
leaning against a fake wooden fence

463
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,180
and playing guitar.

464
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,620
Every time he would change the chords he'd

465
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,360
release his left hand and play open

466
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,620
strings to change to the next chord

467
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,760
while singing about, oh, the Goat Man.

468
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,940
This is something to search for.

469
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,200
I definitely have to find that.

470
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,840
It's called the Goat Man?

471
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,520
As I recall, I saw it

472
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,740
the only copy I saw was in a privately

473
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,720
owned video shop

474
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,360
that was run by a guy who

475
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,340
went into the video management business

476
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,280
because he needed a job coming out of prison.

477
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,140
It was the best store in

478
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,960
Minneapolis.

479
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,700
Well, there you go.

480
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,900
There you go.

481
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,000
That's all I can look for.

482
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,000
Goat help us.

483
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,180
Go-to job.

484
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,940
I just watched a film

485
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,420
called

486
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,620
Death,

487
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:19,900
Death Bed.

488
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,220
The bed that eats people.

489
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,040
Was it about Procrustes?

490
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,060
It was so bad.

491
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,760
And I showed it at the store.

492
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,140
I had to buy it.

493
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:32,520
Yeah.

494
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,500
Or remember the famous horror story

495
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,340
A Terribly Strange Bed

496
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,620
by Wilkie Collins?

497
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,060
That story about

498
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,000
the death bed?

499
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,880
The bed that eats people.

500
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,720
Well, the top of it comes down

501
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,680
on you and suffocates you in the middle of the night.

502
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,340
The bed that dare not speak its name.

503
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:53,760
Yeah.

504
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,340
Don't sleep in the bed.

505
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,380
Have you noticed that it started squealing

506
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,940
after Philo left?

507
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,300
Yeah.

508
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,940
Like he sabotaged something.

509
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,260
Like he left some kind of a booby trap.

510
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,820
Yeah, probably.

511
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,280
Yeah.

512
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,760
Set up his.

513
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,140
Maybe Philo.

514
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,400
The Mangler is another good one.

515
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,720
In a bad way.

516
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,460
No, bad one in a good way.

517
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,180
In a great way.

518
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,320
Now, if everybody here didn't know,

519
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,800
which is possible since no one ever looks

520
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,220
at the,

521
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,420
the schedule or brochure

522
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:21,740
instructions.

523
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,400
There are bad movies all night.

524
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,160
Every night.

525
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,900
At the Grindhouse.

526
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,680
The Grindhouse right down the hill there.

527
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,380
See that white tent?

528
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,960
You have to actually ambulate

529
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,000
down a hill to get to it.

530
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,260
Hey Susie,

531
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,520
what are we looking at?

532
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,840
No, you can sit down again

533
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,560
and it's very peaceful.

534
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,400
The bushes are seething with ticks.

535
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,380
You can't hear us from down there

536
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,160
for one thing.

537
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,620
Well, there you go, Susie.

538
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,500
I think you know.

539
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,560
No, it's no.

540
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,880
Yeah, turn around and it's

541
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,840
it's right in front of you.

542
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,580
There you go.

543
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,280
See, perfect.

544
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,780
See, nobody was noticing.

545
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,180
But me, you're talking about movies

546
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,460
and I thought it was a big heart.

547
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,820
I thought that some it was a big black

548
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,100
heart, but heart, big black velvet heart

549
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,600
right there.

550
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,520
Yeah, yeah.

551
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,620
Now I've seen that same site look like a

552
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,880
Osama bin Laden wanted poster.

553
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,340
She's found some pebbles worthy of your

554
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,400
scientific review.

555
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,160
What is?

556
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,280
They look like states of the Union that

557
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,920
don't exist.

558
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,720
There's pebbles of a vina.

559
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,800
Uh, they do look like like states of the

560
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Union that don't exist.

561
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,100
The you know what?

562
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,960
What is that one called?

563
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,840
That's that's institutions.

564
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,780
I know that.

565
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,760
Well, you know, Susie and Plas Marcus is

566
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,960
right underneath it, isn't it?

567
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,060
Yeah, it looks like the map of America

568
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,340
after X day.

569
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:46,680
Yeah.

570
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,400
Yeah.

571
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,440
Yeah.

572
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:48,560
Yeah.

573
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:48,580


574
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:48,580


575
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:48,580


576
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:48,600
Yeah.

577
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


578
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


579
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


580
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


581
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


582
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


583
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


584
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


585
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


586
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


587
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


588
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


589
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


590
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


591
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


592
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


593
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


594
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,520
Marijuana is a lot of fun doing that map.

595
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,820
And we basically post a man world.

596
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,280
Yeah.

597
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:55,860
Yeah.

598
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,460
Like Stalin and FDR.

599
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,060
Yeah.

600
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,960
Showing off pebbles on the radio.

601
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,040
Oh yeah.

602
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,000
No, this is a very visual radio show.

603
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,240
Yep.

604
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,940
I've noticed every all of us have perfect

605
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,920
radio faces.

606
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,040
Well, that's why it's right.

607
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,880
Radio and television.

608
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,660
I don't want to have to shave, you know,

609
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,380
just every Sunday or take a shower.

610
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,280
Every week.

611
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,120
That would be terrible.

612
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,320
It was Susie's looking for more rocks of the union

613
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,600
of the Dobbs Union.

614
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,500
I didn't know you'd have to shave.

615
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,640
You're kind of rocking that.

616
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,860
Forgive me, Michael Savage.

617
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,920
Look with that goatee.

618
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,540
That's the only way.

619
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,720
Hmm.

620
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,820
Well, I know nothing.

621
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,320
How popular he got on TV.

622
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,960
With hate talk radio or TV.

623
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,520
I know nothing of this savage.

624
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,500
He's a.

625
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,560
I read his columns all the time.

626
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,260
You know, if I need to know how to, you know,

627
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,380
do anal upside down or something.

628
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,320
No, no, no.

629
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,160
You're talking about Dan Savage.

630
00:25:59,340 --> 00:25:59,620
Dan.

631
00:25:59,620 --> 00:25:59,820
Yeah.

632
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,300
You're talking about Michael.

633
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,260
Say Michael Weiner.

634
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,060
Oh, Mike, the wiener.

635
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,180
Oh, you are in a blessed state of ignorance.

636
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,960
I see.

637
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,940
I don't watch TV or hear the radio, so I don't know how to pronounce anything.

638
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,440
I don't know how anybody looks.

639
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,280
I know things.

640
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,480
I thought he was talking about.

641
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,200
But yeah, Dan Savage, too.

642
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,120
And I was like, wait, I think you're thinking of the wrong.

643
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,220
Dan.

644
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,160
The wrong savage.

645
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,800
Yeah.

646
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:23,960
Yeah.

647
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,820
And then there's Stoney Savage.

648
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,800
But that's.

649
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,100
Yeah, there's Fred Savage.

650
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,260
Yeah.

651
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,580
Who played in Wonder Years.

652
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,260
The child actor.

653
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,720
Clark Savage Jr.

654
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,300
That was Doc Savage's dad.

655
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,620
Randy Macho Man Savage.

656
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,520
No, Clark Savage Jr.

657
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,660
Was was Doc Savage, wasn't he?

658
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,580
Oh, Junior.

659
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:44,960
Yes.

660
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,900
Clark Sr.

661
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,400
Was Doc Savage's dad.

662
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:47,640
Right.

663
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,020
Yeah.

664
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,780
And then Dork Savage was the son that they didn't talk about.

665
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,660
Dork Savage.

666
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,060
Yeah.

667
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,560
Yeah.

668
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,780
He didn't turn out the way they planned.

669
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,440
And all of that discipline just backfired.

670
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,680
He became a slacker.

671
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,920
He was a hippie in those days.

672
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,500
You know, he didn't want to do any of the preparation.

673
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,340
Yeah.

674
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:15,820
Doc couldn't handle the idea of having what he considered an effeminate, undisciplined son.

675
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,360
And so.

676
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:17,380


677
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:17,380


678
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,060
He just stopped speaking of the boy.

679
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,800
Who was actually his son by his cousin, Patricia Savage.

680
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,640
Pat.

681
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,600
Yeah.

682
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:26,920
Pat.

683
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,740
She was a nice little number.

684
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,440
The girl of bronze.

685
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,160
Yeah.

686
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,540
The woman of bronze.

687
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,540
And they called her.

688
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,060
Yeah.

689
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,460
I know too much about Doc Savage's skeletons.

690
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,800
Did you read the book Doc Savage, His Apocalyptic Life?

691
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,440
You must have.

692
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:40,800
Yeah.

693
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,120
Yeah.

694
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,420
Oh, are you kidding?

695
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:42,760
Yeah.

696
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,000
I was looking for my own.

697
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,020
See if I had any ancestors in there.

698
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,380
He had every one.

699
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,380
Anybody related to Doc Savage.

700
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,200
From Daniel Boone to.

701
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,620
Travis McGee.

702
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,340
Captain Hornblower.

703
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,180
Fever McGee.

704
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,760
Tarzan.

705
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,380
Yeah.

706
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,220
Tarzan was.

707
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,980
Well, and then I read that.

708
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,020
The Scarlet Pimpernel.

709
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,920
Philip Jose Dick book.

710
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,520
Where.

711
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,800
Philip Jose Farmer.

712
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:02,980
Where.

713
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,280
Yeah.

714
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,380
Philip Jose Farmer.

715
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,780
That was a good one.

716
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,660
Philip Jose Dick.

717
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,180
Yeah.

718
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,740
And I have a box at home that says Dick's.

719
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,140
Philip and Phil.

720
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,380
Anyway.

721
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,100
The.

722
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,040
Yeah.

723
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,940
There's a.

724
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:26,520
The Wold Newton meteorite fell while the coach containing their ancestors was passing and irradiated their germ placenta.

725
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:35,520
Well, at the end of that, that Farmer book, Doc Savage and Tarzan are literally crossing penises.

726
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,420
Oh, that's.

727
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,660
On a rock bridge.

728
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,920
That's a different book.

729
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,660
Over a bottomless pit.

730
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,400
Different book.

731
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,460
And they end up.

732
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:42,740
That's a book.

733
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,980
Tearing their genitals.

734
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,300
Yeah.

735
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,820
They tear each other's.

736
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah.

737
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,100
That's a different book.

738
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,200
Packers off.

739
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,140
Different book.

740
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,060
A Feast Unknown.

741
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,180
A Feast Unknown is the title.

742
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:51,640
Yeah.

743
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:51,660
Yeah.

744
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,120
That is an amazing, really amazing book.

745
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,820
It is.

746
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,160
It is.

747
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,420
It's.

748
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,820
However, it's not the biography that we were talking about a moment ago.

749
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,060
No.

750
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,400
No.

751
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:01,720
It's.

752
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,220
It's another.

753
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,820
But it's also Philip.

754
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,880
Philip.

755
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,320
Philip.

756
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,740
Jose Farmer.

757
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,080
Right.

758
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:13,720
By the way, I've mailed him pamphlets and stark fists throughout his life.

759
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:13,960
Good.

760
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:13,960


761
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:13,960


762
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:13,960


763
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:13,960


764
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:13,960


765
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:13,960


766
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:13,960


767
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:13,960


768
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:13,960


769
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:13,960


770
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:13,960


771
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:13,960


772
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,280
To his P.O. Box in Peoria.

773
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,160
Mm-hmm.

774
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,200
And?

775
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,040
And never got any response at all.

776
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,280
Same with Stephen King.

777
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,600
Nancy Collins or somebody.

778
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,680
One of our writer friends had given me these addresses and said, oh, you ought to send

779
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,420
this stuff to them.

780
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:32,980
They'll love it.

781
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,880
And of course, you know, I didn't expect anything back.

782
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,020
But I've never seen any evidence either way that it made any.

783
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,420
At least it didn't kill him.

784
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:43,960
Well, I mean, I think it's a good thing.

785
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:43,960


786
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:43,960


787
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:43,960


788
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:43,960


789
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:43,960


790
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:43,960


791
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:43,960


792
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:43,960


793
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,500
And we sent stuff to Phil Dick.

794
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,300
He died that week.

795
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,060
Same with L. Ron Hubbard.

796
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,680
Oh.

797
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,920
And Bill Hicks, I'm afraid.

798
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,720
Mm-hmm.

799
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,580
And when we realized that was happening, we sent one to Jesse Helms and.

800
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,220
I mean, yeah, a bunch of different politicians.

801
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,440
But it didn't work.

802
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,700
Didn't work then.

803
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,440
Mm.

804
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,040
And maybe it was just coincidence.

805
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,660
But honest to God, those are all.

806
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,080
It's sold their souls already.

807
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,600
Three true stories.

808
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:08,600


809
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,960
A subgenius named Reverend Betsy K.

810
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:13,960


811
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:13,960


812
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:13,960


813
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:13,960


814
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:13,960


815
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:21,880
Curtis, who's probably not around anymore, had been at the party where Hubbard made that

816
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,600
famous announcement that if you want to make money, you start a religion.

817
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,140
And she remained friends with him.

818
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,120
She wasn't a Scientologist.

819
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,940
She was just an old sci-fi fan, one of his old friends.

820
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,140
Right.

821
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:43,520
And she's had his, a post office box in Miami that if you sent to this, it would

822
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:43,760
go.

823
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,480
Yeah.

824
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,340
Directly to him on the yacht.

825
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,540
And, but when we did that, he croaked.

826
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,720
He probably took one look at the, what the hell do you think you're doing questionnaire.

827
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,680
And passed from this life.

828
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,720
And croaked right there.

829
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,840
Reverend Stank.

830
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,400
Thank you.

831
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:58,600
Yeah.

832
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,380
We, we helped the world that way.

833
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,160
It's too bad about Bill Hicks and Phil Dick.

834
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,400
Yeah.

835
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:04,900
Bill Hicks.

836
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,620
Is John Waters.

837
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,260
Is John Waters a subgenius?

838
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,480
We've never heard from him.

839
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:09,840
No?

840
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,280
Okay.

841
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,660
No.

842
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,180
I.

843
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:17,900
One time Douglas Adams was in Dallas for book signing and I handed him a copy of book

844
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,420
of the subgenius and said, are you at all familiar with this?

845
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,500
He said, no, but you know, it looks like fun.

846
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,380
And a couple of years later he had a planet Bob in one of his later books.

847
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:28,960
Yeah.

848
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,660
There you go.

849
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,260
Well, it's listed in the real Frank Zappa book too.

850
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:32,920
Oh yeah.

851
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,620
Oh, Frank Zappa was very specific about that.

852
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:35,700
Yeah.

853
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,940
He said if I, if I was to join any religion, it would be a guy with a pipe.

854
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,400
It says that right in his, in his thing.

855
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,720
Well, he liked the fact that Bob was a smoker.

856
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,360
Right.

857
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,440
And.

858
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,920
Tim Leary.

859
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,960
Slack idea.

860
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,300
Yeah.

861
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,700
He liked that.

862
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,120
Yeah.

863
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,400
So, and he specifically said some guys in Dallas.

864
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,380
So that was good.

865
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:54,660
Oh yeah.

866
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,020
No, no.

867
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,580
It, it.

868
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,760
He didn't say there's this asshole in Canada.

869
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,340
Right.

870
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:58,560
Right.

871
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,680
Thank heavens for that.

872
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,560
No, that really pissed that asshole in Canada off too.

873
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,020
Is he still active?

874
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,080
Hmm?

875
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,420
Is the pink Canuck still active?

876
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,560
I have no idea.

877
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,000
I honestly don't know.

878
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,800
And no interest.

879
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,680
He had no longer gets free helicopter rides.

880
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:22,360
He was doing a podcast with some new agers and he had a blog that you couldn't get into

881
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,460
unless you were a member.

882
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,360
And I just did.

883
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,960
How tedious.

884
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,600
That was it.

885
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,160
How stale.

886
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,440
His wife's still selling RNA drops that will make you live forever.

887
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,460
You'll, you'll.

888
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:34,840
Yes.

889
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,080
Cure cancer and make you fly.

890
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,540
Philo says, yeah.

891
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,720
He says he's still on Facebook.

892
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,140
He what?

893
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,600
He's still on Facebook.

894
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,640
Mr. Dean.

895
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,180
Oh.

896
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,180
Still there on Facebook.

897
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:46,460


898
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,300
I had a friend the other time but I don't know if I'm a friend of his.

899
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,820
Wanted to friend him?

900
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,660
Well, that would be a mistake.

901
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,600
I won't friend anybody who calls themselves Bob Dobbs.

902
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:55,820
Me either.

903
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,440
One of them might be the, you know, what if?

904
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,280
It could happen.

905
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,240
You know, all types of people who call themselves Bob Dobbs want to be my Facebook friend.

906
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,400
I have to turn each one of them down.

907
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:07,940
Oh yeah.

908
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:07,940


909
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,520
I will not countenance.

910
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,520


911
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,520


912
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,520


913
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,520


914
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,660
That's just so lame.

915
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,440
I can't do it.

916
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,320
Somebody else.

917
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:13,720
I mean.

918
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,200
I've even run into people using Ivan's gang to show they were really inside.

919
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:18,820
Uh huh.

920
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,460
That's a great way to put it.

921
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,440
What could be inner than that?

922
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,220
On the other hand, Charlie Muck, that was a good one.

923
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,040
When I saw somebody calling himself Charlie Muck, I was going, now that's inside the inside.

924
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,300
Yep.

925
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,140
That's pretty good.

926
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,900
So, there.

927
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,220
Phooey.

928
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,660
There we go.

929
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,020
That's a good one.

930
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,020


931
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,160
Phooey.

932
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,640
Phooey.

933
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,820
Phooey.

934
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,620
Phooey.

935
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,280
Phooey.

936
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,780
Phooey.

937
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,360
Phooey.

938
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:57,740
Phooey.

939
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,060
Phooey.

940
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,640
I'm happy to love a female dear

941
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,800
Little day

942
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,040
Back to being nice

943
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,380
Back to the

944
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,380
We're all in headphones, you idiot.

945
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,140
He said he watched the movie the other day

946
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,060
and it referred to Charlie Muck.

947
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,020
Really?

948
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,540
That was my movie, Let's Visit the World of the Future.

949
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:45,260
Most prophetic, low-budget, apocalyptic, dystopian movie ever made.

950
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:45,980
Which you can buy.

951
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,700
Because it all came true.

952
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,080
It's right over there on the swag table.

953
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,080
You can buy it.

954
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,640
Fight C. Todd will sell you a DVD of that movie.

955
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,840
There's probably only one copy.

956
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,540
It may be.

957
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,700
There's only one copy.

958
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,800
You can get it.

959
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,060
They showed it at a theater in Cleveland just recently.

960
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,420
I show a rise at my store once in a while.

961
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,820
Yeah, but World of the Future.

962
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,000
Two weeks.

963
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,000


964
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,000


965
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,520
What result?

966
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,940
I actually showed that to people in my store, though.

967
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,840
You know, like in, you know.

968
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,580
And what was their reaction?

969
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,960
Can I leave now?

970
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:18,980
Yeah, can I leave now?

971
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,940
When is this going to be over?

972
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,480
How is it?

973
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,320
Why did you lock the door?

974
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,680
Well, this is just the first 15 minutes.

975
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,060
Yeah.

976
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,500
What?

977
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,920
Sit down and have some popcorn.

978
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,980
Why is that clown touching a naked girl?

979
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,280
You're not going anywhere.

980
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,000
Are you around, like, James Bond?

981
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,160
So, yeah.

982
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:35,600
Yeah.

983
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:35,820
There.

984
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,040
There you go.

985
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,560
See?

986
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,220
But it's true.

987
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,840
Now, bozos run the world.

988
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,320
Evil clowns run America.

989
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,200
Oh, yeah.

990
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,460
And it's all holograms.

991
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,600
You can't believe anything.

992
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,440
Nostra Stangis.

993
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,940
You figured it out.

994
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,740
I never believed that.

995
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,680
I love the fact that it was like, oh, we thought about having grass, but, well, that just takes

996
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,500
too long to cut, so we just cemented over the whole planet.

997
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,740
Well, that time is coming.

998
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,880
There's no question.

999
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,720
There's no question.

1000
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,060
If humans even make it that long.

1001
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,160
I doubt it.

1002
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,100
I don't want to.

1003
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,460
I don't.

1004
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,160
Speaking of funny names.

1005
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,260
We should be over with in about, what?

1006
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,720
Less than 24 hours.

1007
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:16,920
Yeah.

1008
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,040
Less than 24 hours.

1009
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,520
We'll know.

1010
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,900
May I ask you, Evan Stang, to explain a funny name that I didn't get?

1011
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,260
Probably everybody knows it.

1012
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,480
From the Funny Names Club of America?

1013
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,400
You had set up a bank of prank callers to phone in radio shows of the religious sort

1014
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,800
at one point.

1015
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,240
Shocking.

1016
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,000
Back in the 90s.

1017
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,560
The 90s.

1018
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:36,960
I did?

1019
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,640
Yeah.

1020
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:42,920
It was one of the early hours of Slack when it was on the radio.

1021
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,280
Operators standing by.

1022
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,940
They were performing prank calls live, and they made a reference to Aunt Melba, and he

1023
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,480
saw through somebody.

1024
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,340
One of the preachers on the radio saw through and hung up when they mentioned Aunt Melba.

1025
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,260
Who is Aunt Melba?

1026
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,140
What does that refer to?

1027
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,720
Does that make any sense at all?

1028
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:00,940
Yeah.

1029
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,120
Those prank calls weren't initiated by me.

1030
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,980
It was a group called the Crystal Mountain.

1031
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:05,980


1032
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,460
The Crystal Methodists.

1033
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:06,840
That's right.

1034
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,620
The Crystal Methodists.

1035
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,320
The Crystal Methodists did that.

1036
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,000
They were real experts at that.

1037
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,600
And they, yeah, they, one of them was excellent at sounding like an old lady.

1038
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:15,960
Yeah.

1039
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,580
But they were live on your show.

1040
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,560
She was Aunt Melba.

1041
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,360
You know, this is Melba.

1042
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,320
She was the toast of radio.

1043
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,900
And I just wanted to talk about Jesus.

1044
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,360
You know, well, okay, Melba.

1045
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,060
But Melba didn't get weirder and weirder.

1046
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,420
And they finally caught on that Melba was probably some guy.

1047
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,360
Oh.

1048
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,760
Yeah.

1049
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,420
Thank you.

1050
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,080
The Crystal Methodists.

1051
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,580
They were great.

1052
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,880
See, now, if you still have any of those left over, he might put that in there when you've mentioned it.

1053
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,800
That sounds like a takeoff on Aunt Bertha, actually.

1054
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,360
Yeah.

1055
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,600
Cue cut to Crystal Methodists.

1056
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:49,880
You're tired.

1057
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,260
Melba in Dallas, Texas.

1058
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,380
She's been holding on patiently.

1059
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,400
Thanks a lot, Melba.

1060
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,300
Oh, my.

1061
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:55,980
Hiya.

1062
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,240
That was a long wait.

1063
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:57,800
I'm sorry.

1064
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,720
We had to go to a top-of-the-hour news break, and that's why it took so long.

1065
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,340
Well, I thought that that last night was a good day.

1066
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:05,340


1067
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,160
But mine should be on there forever.

1068
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,580
I couldn't believe it.

1069
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,640
I want to talk about the Dallas Stars.

1070
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,120
I think they're going to come back strong.

1071
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,100
This is just a temporary setback with them.

1072
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:23,620
And as far as that gentleman that called in about the violence on that,

1073
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,560
that boys will be boys with Hawkeyes.

1074
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,960
The name of the game is contact and aggression, I think.

1075
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,600
And it always has been.

1076
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:44,560
And I personally enjoy, you know, a real strong body check, teeth, hair, and eyes on the ice.

1077
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,300
Yeah.

1078
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,160
Yeah.

1079
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,720
I love it.

1080
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,360
Cue.

1081
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,000
Cue.

1082
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,520
Well, we understand what...

1083
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:52,900
Cut and gut.

1084
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,580
Cue.

1085
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,060
Yeah.

1086
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,340
Well, who was that?

1087
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,980
That didn't sound like Melba.

1088
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,440
Melba has a very manly voice.

1089
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,280
Nah, but...

1090
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:12,440
That was from the CD called Melba Comes Alive by Brother Russell,

1091
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,900
also known as Crystal Methodist in the 1980s.

1092
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,480
And it is available on bandcamp.com,

1093
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,680
along with many other prank call and music mashup recordings

1094
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,160
by the Crystal Methodist and Brother Russell.

1095
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,640
A piece of eccentric Texas history,

1096
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,860
of which...

1097
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,100
I hope I am a part.

1098
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,580
But now, back to X-Day 22.

1099
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,920
Or...

1100
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,020
Whatever.

1101
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,860
You heard it here first.

1102
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,460
What?

1103
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,560
We didn't hear it.

1104
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,740
We don't hear anything from the peanut gallery.

1105
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,240
Mr. Peanut has something to say.

1106
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,560
6.4 magnitude quake in South California.

1107
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,660
6.4 magnitude quake in South California.

1108
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,200
Today?

1109
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,840
Today.

1110
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,220
Hold your tips.

1111
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
No wonder we couldn't get email.

1112
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,360
No.

1113
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,200
We're going to find a Bob man.

1114
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,900
Hmm.

1115
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,720
Or whoever.

1116
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,600
Southern California, you said.

1117
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,280
Southern California.

1118
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,460
Well, who the fuck knows.

1119
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,200
Southern California.

1120
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,640
LA's about to slide into the ocean.

1121
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,260
Yeah.

1122
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,320
Or it'll be a separate island.

1123
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,700
California will sink.

1124
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:17,960
There'll be a prison.

1125
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,100
Atlantis will rise.

1126
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,660
Eventually, the ocean will have so much plastic cushioning in it,

1127
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,840
when California sinks, it'll be minimal damage.

1128
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,260
It'll just float.

1129
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,880
Bounce back out.

1130
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,080
Everything will float.

1131
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,300
It'll just float right on it.

1132
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,860
Yeah.

1133
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,180
That's bullshit.

1134
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,780
It will float right on it.

1135
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,360
That is bullshit, yes.

1136
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,680
Oh, I caused that.

1137
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1138
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,240
The microphone's doing the feedback over there.

1139
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,820
Maybe it's my teeth.

1140
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,960
Here and there, man.

1141
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,600
Your teeth?

1142
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,680
Yeah.

1143
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,280
They're metal.

1144
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,980
That's where the voices come from.

1145
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,240
Yeah.

1146
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,700
Put your tux near there.

1147
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,200
You gotta pull them out.

1148
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,620
Then you won't hear the voices no more.

1149
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,600
That's what I did.

1150
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:55,860
Bob.

1151
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,780
From PR News in Washington, I'm a Kurdish turkey.

1152
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,580
The space shuttle Discovery astronauts have now conducted a crucial attack on a space

1153
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:04,580


1154
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:04,580


1155
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:04,580


1156
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:04,580


1157
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:04,580


1158
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:04,580


1159
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:04,580


1160
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:04,580


1161
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:04,580


1162
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:04,840
shuttle.

1163
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,140
The space shuttle has been deployed to a suburban Philadelphia high school.

1164
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:11,440
NASA says at least 17 astronauts are still out of control there, while noting more work

1165
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,340
remains to be done.

1166
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,740
NASA says two of the astronauts show no signs of retreating.

1167
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,440
Washington has put pressure on the two turds.

1168
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,820
The astronauts illegally attached a bus to their weapons.

1169
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,660
NASA says will increase the price of a round trip ticket by 25 cubic dollars.

1170
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,560
On Wall Street 4, 350, 30, 20.

1171
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,900
NASA says this is PR News.

1172
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,300
Ta-da.

1173
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,560
We're back.

1174
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,240
Yeah, we'll have clowns later, I think.

1175
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,440
Pretty sure the clowns will be here.

1176
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,180
Don't give the clowns drugs, friends.

1177
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,820
I saw the bicycle come in on the top of the car.

1178
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,120
I was like, somebody brought their kid.

1179
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,180
And I'm like, oh no, no, that's a clown's bicycle.

1180
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,700
Oh no, oh no, the clowns are already here.

1181
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,420
Don't give the clowns drugs, whatever you do.

1182
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,300
And don't go over there in the clown town.

1183
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,300
Oh, that was supposed to, oh, you know, that's what it is.

1184
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,520
That speaker was down there.

1185
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,540
I put it up here to hold it.

1186
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,280
I pulled the tarp last night.

1187
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,320
And then I didn't put it back on the ground.

1188
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,080
Oh, look, Philo, you're off the hook.

1189
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,500
This is of great interest to our listeners, of course.

1190
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,720
I did have it deliberately, carefully put down there for the last two days.

1191
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:23,300
Then this morning, I stupidly left it up here.

1192
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,360
Well, aren't we glad we've got all that cleared up?

1193
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:34,100
By the way, Reverend DeFalk, from your emails, I had been assuming that you were about 24 years old.

1194
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:34,780
He is.

1195
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,180
He is.

1196
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,540
Look at him.

1197
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,020
He's a strapping, healthy young fellow.

1198
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,320
He's a good-looking 24-year-old.

1199
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,180
If William S. Burroughs was the youngest member of the church, well, an age is all relative.

1200
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,700
Okay.

1201
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,240
See?

1202
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,900
There's your answer.

1203
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,200
Oh, and you also thought he had nice tits.

1204
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:50,720
See?

1205
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,240
Right?

1206
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,020
Because he shows.

1207
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,240
I thought you were a 24-year-old girl.

1208
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,040
No.

1209
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,100
Oh, that didn't come up, as it were, so to speak.

1210
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,100
That's because I've only started entering adulthood in my own sphere.

1211
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:03,400
Yeah, see?

1212
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,080
He's a good-looking 24-year-old.

1213
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,080


1214
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,300
He's a lot younger than what you think.

1215
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,460
He's a lot younger than what you think.

1216
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,240
Oh, right.

1217
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,160
I was an infantile brat most of the time.

1218
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,260
Wow, you really are quite a yeti.

1219
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:11,700
Yeah.

1220
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,420
A 24-year-old girl.

1221
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,100
Well, yeah.

1222
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,320
A girl with a beard, an amazing beard.

1223
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,240
Yeah, a big, stylish beard.

1224
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,920
And like quite possibly the coolest eyebrows that I've ever seen in person.

1225
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,420
What are you talking about?

1226
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,060
Where'd this come from?

1227
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,460
Overslept a bit.

1228
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,680
A growing out of your face.

1229
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,420
Well, there you go.

1230
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,320
Reverend Rip Van Winkle.

1231
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,080
There isn't a Reverend Rip Van Winkle.

1232
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,080


1233
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,080


1234
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,080


1235
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,080


1236
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,780
I wouldn't think, but there you go, radio listeners.

1237
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,200
Not that I know of.

1238
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,420
I try to look at all the little postcards they send me.

1239
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:42,600
Yeah.

1240
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:44,800
Quickly.

1241
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,560
With facial identification recognition software.

1242
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,580
Yeah.

1243
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,300
They put something in my wine.

1244
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,220
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

1245
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:53,240
Yeah.

1246
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,780
Did they put alcohol in your wine, sir?

1247
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,480
That's bad.

1248
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,180
They put pineapple juice in your pineapple juice.

1249
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:57,440
You know what?

1250
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:03,340
You should probably contact that box company and let them know, listen, this wine in a

1251
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,060
plastic bag is not for you.

1252
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,820
This is a bag in a box.

1253
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,300
It's got some alcohol or something in it.

1254
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,280
Wine is a mucker.

1255
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,760
Strong drink is raging.

1256
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,900
That happens.

1257
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,820
Did you make that bird noise or was that authentic?

1258
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,800
That's an actual tweet.

1259
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
That's Philo.

1260
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,060
That's the president tweeting.

1261
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,640
It is Philo.

1262
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,700
Stop drinking that alcohol.

1263
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,320
Yeah, there's a little birdie up there.

1264
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:33,660
Yeah.

1265
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,160
There's a bird.

1266
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,500
That's all panic now.

1267
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,300
A bird is in here.

1268
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,180
This is Tarzan's radio station.

1269
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,580
It's in the rainforest.

1270
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,760
The dreaded-

1271
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,140
Canopy.

1272
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:41,980
Grackle.

1273
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,160
The brain forest.

1274
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,680
The squawking-

1275
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,100
Hey, look who's here.

1276
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,180
Princesses.

1277
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,720
This would be my chance to get off of this, get out from under these tight headphones.

1278
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,640
Right.

1279
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,160
They are tight, aren't they?

1280
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:58,540
Boy, it'd be great if it's all dames for a while.

1281
00:44:59,140 --> 00:44:59,620
Yeah.

1282
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,780
I could just ride a cart.

1283
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,060
I could just ride a cart.

1284
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:04,060


1285
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:04,060


1286
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:04,060


1287
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:04,060


1288
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:04,060


1289
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,820
I'm going to turn this off and then turn it back on again.

1290
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,180
Well, I'll just take that.

1291
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,540
For me.

1292
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:34,040
Well, I'll just take that.

1293
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,300
That's where this place came from.

1294
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,100
A- foto by me.

1295
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,040
Oh my God.

1296
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,080


1297
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,080


1298
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,080


1299
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,080


1300
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,500

One dollar

00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,780
O-N-A

1315
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:45,380
O-N-A

1316
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,780
O-N-A

1317
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,480
Outro Music

1318
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:10,100
That was the official remix by Onan of Dr. Onan Kennebite's song, B.O.B.

1319
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:21,660
I shall never, ever forget the first time I heard that, which was in the early 1980s and accelerated consciousness on a beach.

1320
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:30,900
But now, but now, back to 12-12-20 with Lonesome Cowboy Dave for the part where we forget to say,

1321
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:36,260
for more information, see subgenius.com.

1322
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:44,560
Yeah, if you're by a washer dryer, you end up in your apartment building, don't stand there when it starts going,

1323
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:52,720
because it can not only upset your stomach, it can change your DNA to a fast-forward-dentious belly button driver.

1324
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,620
That explains a whole lot.

1325
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:55,180
Yeah.

1326
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,680
Because someone, let's say someone I used to know, used to sit on top of her.

1327
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:01,560
A dryer.

1328
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,540
Deliberately, while it was vibrating.

1329
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,180
Oh, I see.

1330
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,120
And I think they wanted to get irradiated.

1331
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,140
That would explain it.

1332
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:12,720
Yep.

1333
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,960
And there's nothing like a quick blast from an automatic unit, you know what I mean?

1334
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:23,340
Well, I would never do anything like that with a big, vibrating, curvy edge.

1335
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:26,980
So you don't think it's a very good idea making love with appliances?

1336
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,700
How about when they speak to you in your dreams and give you orders?

1337
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,240
Well, that's when you know you're in love with your dryer.

1338
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,380
Or your whatever that's bumped.

1339
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,020
It could be a motorcycle.

1340
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,280
Or your horse.

1341
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,120
Ladies love horses.

1342
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:49,760
I heard for a while, it was, what's his name, Leonard Cohen's whole raison d'etre was singing songs about appliances.

1343
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,300
Boy, there goes Dave, using those Frenchy terms again.

1344
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,180
Why don't you just go back to France, where he came from?

1345
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,100
Hippie?

1346
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,060
Because in France, they have no...

1347
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:01,560
Underpants.

1348
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,160
Therefore, I don't wear no...

1349
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,840
In pants?

1350
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,520
No pants in France?

1351
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:09,980
In France.

1352
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:10,560
In France.

1353
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,440
You go to France, you'll get ants in your pants.

1354
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,100
Without no pants on, yeah.

1355
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,280
Why do I say that all the time?

1356
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:19,840
You get ants in your pants.

1357
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,160
Ants in your pants.

1358
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:21,900
Ants in your pants.

1359
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,180
Something makes me say pants.

1360
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,900
It's one of those things that just goes in your head, like...

1361
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,720
It's 20 years in northern Ohio makes you say pants.

1362
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,960
That's what it is.

1363
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:31,640
I think you're right.

1364
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,420
I think it is.

1365
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:32,980
It's like...

1366
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,560
That's the Cleveland accent creeping out.

1367
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,180
Where's my pants?

1368
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,180
It's one of those things.

1369
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,480
It's like somewhere between Buffalo and Detroit.

1370
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:47,160
It just goes through your head, like Wee Mama has those things go through her head.

1371
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,040
She says, think and think.

1372
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:49,860
What do you think?

1373
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,780
Dry cleaning for nothing?

1374
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,460
She doesn't know where it came from.

1375
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,580
She just says it.

1376
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,580
It's a thing.

1377
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,700
It's just a thing.

1378
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,240
Sounds like a Cockney Rebel thing.

1379
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,060
Do you believe in Cockney Rebels?

1380
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,200
Or any other religious after fighting?

1381
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,380
I don't know.

1382
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,180
I swore off all that stuff.

1383
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,200
I don't know.

1384
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,420
It's too tempting for me.

1385
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,660
If they're going to chase you around the block with those little devoted candles, boy, you

1386
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,060
better don't worry which bench to hide under.

1387
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,100
That's all I can say.

1388
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,900
Because when the pigeons get there, you're going to be the one they're going to roast

1389
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,880
at the annual festival.

1390
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,680
How does he do this, Princess Rae?

1391
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:24,820
I don't know.

1392
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,600
It's the Dave train.

1393
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,780
How does he do it?

1394
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,980
I don't know.

1395
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,280
He makes such...

1396
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:30,580
What did he do?

1397
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:31,580
Fools.

1398
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,560
What did I do?

1399
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,560
I started singing our rock opera again, and I shouldn't.

1400
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,840
I swore off that.

1401
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,780
Your pants have to be so torn that when you put them on, you have to go through your foot

1402
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,920
three times in the pants.

1403
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,380
You know what I mean?

1404
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,040
Yeah, I know what you mean, because my pants are that way.

1405
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,940
My pants are exactly that way.

1406
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,140
A little slice of buttocks going on your pants.

1407
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,680
I guess I'm missing Cleveland.

1408
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,820
I wish I was back in Cleveland.

1409
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,820
With my pants.

1410
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:03,600
His pants.

1411
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,140
His pants.

1412
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:04,160
Collinwood.

1413
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,140
His pants.

1414
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,040
Yeah, and Collinwood.

1415
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,260
I was in Collinwood for a long time.

1416
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:09,640
Collinwood.

1417
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,120
Yeah.

1418
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,640
Well, at least you don't talk like you're from a Yenzer from western Pennsylvania.

1419
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:16,780
Yens.

1420
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,740
Yens going down town.

1421
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,400
What the hell are you talking about?

1422
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,100
What are Yens...

1423
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,400
What the hell are Yens talking about?

1424
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,340
Going downtown.

1425
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,820
You know when they say Yens, they say Yens instead of y'all.

1426
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,560
They say Yens.

1427
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,780
Instead of saying downtown, they say downtown.

1428
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,060
Downtown.

1429
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:31,220
Downtown.

1430
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:32,600
Right.

1431
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,820
You look at the floor and you see a tall there.

1432
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:36,880
Is it a tall?

1433
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,520
Everybody knows that downtown is pronounced down town.

1434
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,860
Down town, yes.

1435
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,320
I'm going down town.

1436
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,880
In fact, every word has got like four syllables, you know.

1437
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,200
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia.

1438
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:55,100
Well, actually, those syllables are all represented in there.

1439
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,040
But yeah, you can stretch out any old word.

1440
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,540
Yeah, it is fun to do.

1441
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:00,800
With if.

1442
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,020
With if.

1443
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,380
If you're not from Cleveland.

1444
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,460
If you're from Cleveland, it's all pants all the way down.

1445
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,360
In the deep south, it's like, I'm putting on my pants.

1446
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,780
When you do your report, pants all the way down.

1447
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,180
Here in Texas, pants...

1448
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,120
You know, they're going to ask you on the review board.

1449
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:22,340
They're going to say, Mr. Stang, have you noticed that in your last report you submitted to the police chief?

1450
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,240
You said your pants were not completely and totally down.

1451
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,760
They're only partially down.

1452
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,120
Yeah.

1453
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,120
Yeah.

1454
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:30,120


1455
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:30,400
Yeah.

1456
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,060
Yeah.

1457
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,060


1458
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,060


1459
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,060


1460
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,060


1461
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,060


1462
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,060


1463
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,060


1464
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,060


1465
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,060


1466
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,060


1467
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,060


1468
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,080
If asked, one might say.

1469
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,720
If you asked me.

1470
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:36,760
Yeah.

1471
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,080
Mm.

1472
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:37,980
Mm.

1473
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:38,520
Mm.

1474
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:38,880
Yeah.

1475
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:39,500
Pants.

1476
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,040
Pants.

1477
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:40,520
That's spelled...

1478
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:44,220
In Texas, that's spelled P-A-Y-A-N-T-S.

1479
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,100
Pants.

1480
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,300
It's just an extra two letters.

1481
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:46,720
Pants.

1482
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:47,940
Pants.

1483
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,380
As in payoff or payout.

1484
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:50,840
Pants.

1485
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,280
Underpants.

1486
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,120
Yeah.

1487
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,680
Oh, he said underpants.

1488
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,220
And if you're tenacious D, you say underpants.

1489
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,300
Unterpants.

1490
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,500
Unterpants.

1491
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,040
Unterpants.

1492
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:01,460
Yes.

1493
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,260
Unterpants.

1494
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,140
Guy was the same guy who did that thing about Dolly.

1495
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,240
Dolly is everything.

1496
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,840
Wumping and yomping and yomping and yomping.

1497
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,300
Of course, that was 345 years ago back when...

1498
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,320
Remember when Galileo first got murdered?

1499
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,720
Well, I've read about it.

1500
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,920
I think it was Da Vinci today.

1501
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,060
He was born yesterday.

1502
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:19,920
Yeah.

1503
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,120
That was just a little before my time, Dave.

1504
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,860
But tell us about...

1505
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,220
Oh, sure.

1506
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,740
As if you didn't have any time around.

1507
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,660
You couldn't...

1508
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,120
Well...

1509
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,780
Can you love me some time, man?

1510
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,620
I need a little bit more time.

1511
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,240
Sorry.

1512
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,360
Nothing fucks you harder than time, said Sir Davos in Game of Thrones.

1513
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,320
And I'll have to edit that.

1514
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,500
Yes, you will.

1515
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,980
Nothing trumps you harder than time.

1516
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,980
It was worth it.

1517
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,060
I was wondering if someday we could...

1518
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:59,600
There's a way to remix Presidents on the Phone to Take Out where it says,

1519
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,020
Mom and Dad and just have three honks.

1520
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,600
The President on the Phone talks to his honk, honk, honk.

1521
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,060
Oh.

1522
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:08,920
That would be it.

1523
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,880
Oh, because the current President doesn't have a...

1524
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,840
It seems modular, yeah.

1525
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,940
It does seem modular now.

1526
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:21,140
They all look for the bomb and Gilead of their families.

1527
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,940
The secret respite from the nauseating world out there.

1528
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:27,320
Oh, no, no.

1529
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,720
You would change it to...

1530
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,920
Instead of Mom and Dad, you'd say his son and son-in-law or something like that, his son and daughter.

1531
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:36,560
Because...

1532
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,620
You could say his wife's son.

1533
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,900
You could say any number of things, but it's modular if you just have two horn honks.

1534
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,360
The President's on the Phone.

1535
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,900
Yeah, but it doesn't make any sense.

1536
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:48,840
Talks to his honk, honk, honk.

1537
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,700
Oh, you just don't want to re-sing the song.

1538
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:55,900
You just want to lay in some honk honks.

1539
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:56,960
Yeah.

1540
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,480
I don't think that's necessary.

1541
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,580
I think we could play that.

1542
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,760
We could play that song right now.

1543
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,440
Yeah.

1544
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:06,140
Now I have to go back and find whatever decent recording...

1545
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:11,660
I think we have three live recordings of that song, and they're all not perfect.

1546
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,780
We did use one for a video, though.

1547
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,520
And that one was pretty good.

1548
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,220
I could do that.

1549
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,920
The heck, I knew where to find that real fast.

1550
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,600
It was on YouTube.

1551
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,160
It was from the next day on YouTube, yeah.

1552
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,120
Yeah.

1553
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:23,900
Yeah.

1554
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:56,060
the president's on TV

1555
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,080
the president's on TV

1556
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,020
talking about liberty

1557
00:56:59,020 --> 00:56:59,560
talking about liberty

1558
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,220
He's talking liberty

1559
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,200
But you and I ain't free

1560
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,560
Professors at a White House tea

1561
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,400
They're talking opportunity

1562
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,880
He's talking opportunity

1563
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,660
Like that's enough for folks like you and me

1564
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,800
Meanwhile the world is tumbling down

1565
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,460
Down in a pile of shit

1566
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,660
That's for a revolution

1567
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,820
A revolution that's the tension

1568
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:33,060
The presidency of the proud men

1569
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,940
The president's on the phone

1570
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,260
Talking to his mom and dad

1571
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,680
He's saying should I turn on the evidence

1572
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,140
Or be a good old stumble

1573
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:23,240
The president's on the phone

1574
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,500
Having a chat with God

1575
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,640
He says he's gonna do it

1576
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,860
He'll say if I would

1577
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:33,280
Or maybe just the half of a ton

1578
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,880
It's a democratic country

1579
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,480
Where they don't have fun

1580
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,000
And business is not an offshore fund

1581
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,600
And business is growing

1582
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,200
And there's no surprise

1583
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,760
The president loves to do so

1584
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,820
The truth is I'm here

1585
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,200
I said yeah

1586
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,680
No it's not

1587
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:18,680


1588
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:18,680


1589
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:18,680


1590
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:18,680


1591
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:18,680


1592
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,100
The big ol' baby

1593
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:19,100


1594
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:19,100


1595
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:19,100


1596
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:19,100


1597
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:19,100


1598
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,980
Your mind head, entrance in your mind

1599
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:31,880
You're supposed to be a bad fucker.

1600
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,120
My eyesight is awful.

1601
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,700
I'm closer to the TV now.

1602
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:53,000
And, uh, at S&H 495, is that, do y'all take S&H Green Stamp?

1603
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,880
No, that means shipping and handling.

1604
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:01,140
Oh, well, do y'all do not take Green Stamps?

1605
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,460
No, we don't use the Green Stamps.

1606
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,740
Oh, well, that's a pisser.

1607
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,620
You don't have that many people to do anymore, do you?

1608
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,900
Oh, well, I don't know.

1609
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,460
All my friends are dead.

1610
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,760
I'm an elderly woman.

1611
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,200
I'm about 92.

1612
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,380
They don't have any birth records on me.

1613
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,860
I was born in a rural...

1614
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:25,580
rural area.

1615
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,760
But, uh, I'm about 92.

1616
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:30,580
I kind of lose count.

1617
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,580
Um, well, I sure would like that...

1618
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,140
the bracelet, but I only have $13.

1619
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,400
I'm sorry, honey.

1620
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,100
I only have...

1621
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,620
Wait, hold on.

1622
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,060
Hold on.

1623
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:54,340
Yes.

1624
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,860
I think I can do 40.

1625
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,100
I've got $40.

1626
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,620
I told you, fib.

1627
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:01,920
Well, it's...

1628
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,980
It'll be 40...

1629
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,780
It's actually gonna be closer to, uh, $52 before your...

1630
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,660
Goddamn.

1631
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:11,880
Yeah, once you put the shipping and handling on top and the sales tax.

1632
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,880
That's fucked.

1633
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,760
I can't believe that shit.

1634
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,240
Yeah.

1635
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,300
Oh, my God.

1636
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:28,900
I love you.

1637
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,820
I love you too.

1638
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:30,820


1639
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,220
I love you.

1640
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:38,460
I love you too.

1641
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:40,800
I love you.

1642
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,400
I love you.

1643
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:47,340
And now that we're in the section that's not on broadcast radio, I can tell you subgenius.com.

1644
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,340
Yeah, subgenius.com.

1645
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,420
Subgenius.com.

1646
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:54,120
And Dave, and also, if you look at the radio section of subgenius.com,

1647
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:54,860
I'm gonna tell you something.

1648
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:54,860


1649
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:55,300
I'm not lying.

1650
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:03,240
All of the hours of slack from number one through number 1757 are there.

1651
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,980
Or will be there after I quit talking.

1652
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,360
Available to delight your eardrums.

1653
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:09,640
Yeah.

1654
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:15,700
And also, there's a link to donate to Dave.

1655
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,860
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1656
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,940
Well, just between you, me, and the public listening to the internet,

1657
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,580
Dave's pretty perpetually broke.

1658
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:32,780
He used to work as a newspaper reporter, but the newspaper's all closed down.

1659
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,120
And there is a GoFundMe.

1660
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:42,120
And as much as I'd love to tell people to help me personally, Dave needs it more.

1661
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,500
A lot more.

1662
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,580
And so be like Anonymous.

1663
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,540
That great guy, Anonymous, who gave Dave 500 bucks last week

1664
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:52,920
when I told him to donate to the internet.

1665
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,780
I told him, no, give it to Dave.

1666
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,040
I really did.

1667
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:58,840
I know.

1668
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,580
He was going to give it to me, and I said, no, give it to Dave.

1669
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,580
You're a wonderful person.

1670
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,340
No, I'm not.

1671
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,380
I just...

1672
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,340
No, you are a wonderful person.

1673
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,760
I can't do what Dave does.

1674
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,080
We need him.

1675
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,400
I can't talk like that.

1676
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:11,760
I know.

1677
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,040
I could try, but it wouldn't be the same.

1678
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,080
It'd be like trying to play like Jimi Hendrix.

1679
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,840
Sure, for about three seconds, you can do it.

1680
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,100
Okay.

1681
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:21,780
Okay.

1682
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,140
Friends.

1683
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,700
Oh, and what else?

1684
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,240
Oh, Triology Soap.

1685
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:29,680
Have you tried Triology Soap from TriologySoap.com?

1686
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,500

Our good friend, Lord Ferg, makes Triology Soap,

1689
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:44,420
including numerous flavors and scents of Dobbshead soap.

1690
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,060
Yes.

1691
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:45,480
Yes.

1692
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,400
Soap shaped like a Dobbshead,

1693
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,480
embedded in a square bar of translucent other soap.

1694
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:58,100
It's not only good soap, it's high quality glycerin soap.

1695
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:01,060
It's delightfully wonderful to use.

1696
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:01,680
Yeah.
