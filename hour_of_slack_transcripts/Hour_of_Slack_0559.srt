1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Why do I need to demagnetize this?

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,200
I'd like to demagnetize the hell out of you, honey.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,320
Test, test, test, test, test, test, test.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,820
Save me, save me.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,240
Bob saves those who save themselves.

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,660
Well, Bob made it so cold.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,320
Pull out your wallet.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,840
Dr. Gabot.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,980
I'll give you my wallet if you just make it summer in here.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,740
Just pull it out and, oh, well, I'll turn off the...

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,400
Look, look.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,260
Look, there's my wallet right here.

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:31,880
All right, and it's warmer.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,840
Here's my checking account.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,880
How much do you want?

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,460
It was, uh, just...

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,360
They are pulling the wool over our eyes, constantly.

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,680
Bob is saying if we must be lied to and cheated for reasons,

19
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,000
let us do it to ourselves for our own reasons.

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,420
Let us realize where the real deceit lies.

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,560
Let us have a choice in how we're being screwed.

22
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,200
Some ways are fun.

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,000
Like, for instance...

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
There's some genius.

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,000
Our own.

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,100
What?

27
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,540
For many of us, there is no physical escape from their clutches

28
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,640
or any hope of it until the exes come

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,860
and the followers of Yahweh One prevail.

30
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,820
But until that day,

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,560
the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,220
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,940
This allows us to control our own reality,

34
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,240
gives us the clarity of perspective

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,200
to be able to sit back and look at it all,

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,500
and I mean all, and simply say,

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,260
fuck them if they can't take a joke.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,900
Then and only then will slack begin to drop gently

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,100
like a soothing dew into our tortured lives.

40
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,040
After all, it should be every person's choice

41
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,420
to curse God and die if that is what they wish.

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,240
We all have the right to spit in the eye of the collective gods,

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,340
did we not create them?

44
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,320
Where indeed would Yahweh own be

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
without the human race to torment and pester?

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,600
I'll put it to you, the old chiseler would be pretty damn bored with it all

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,140
if there was nothing more entertaining than cherubims and seraphims

48
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,720
and numby-pumby flaming angels

49
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,640
sitting around out there on damp clouds

50
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,280
and arcing and trumpeting all 24 hours a bloody day,

51
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,320
and you can bank on that.

52
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,120
Uh, what did you say, Bob?

53
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,580
I said, good Lord.

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,220
I pay another man to do my taxes

55
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,100
on account of that's another deduction I can take.

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,540
The postman brought my W-2 this morning.

57
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,920
And this year they're gonna take about one-third of all I make.

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,240
I'm just as patriotic as the next guy.

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
And you know, I love that red, white, and blue.

60
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,660
And I'm gonna help pay this rising cost of freedom.

61
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,100
But there's no way I'm gonna change my point of view.

62
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,540
Cause every time the bureaucrats run out of money

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,700
Congress sucks into the working man.

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,120
I don't think it's one bit funny

65
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,380
When it takes so much of my money

66
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,160
To do things with it, I don't understand

67
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,700
I don't understand

68
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,880
I don't know why they think they have to squeeze us

69
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,140
But I'll tell you just exactly where I stand

70
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,440
I believe if 10% is good enough for Jesus

71
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,720
It ought to be enough for Uncle Sam

72
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,620
guitar solo

73
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,380
guitar solo

74
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,640
guitar solo

75
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,580
guitar solo

76
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:26,580


77
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:26,580


78
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:26,580


79
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:26,580


80
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,000
guitar solo

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,600
guitar solo

82
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,420
guitar solo

83
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,900
guitar solo

84
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,800
Now them folks we keep sending off to Congress

85
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,020
All they know to do is spend and spend

86
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,560
And it's hard these days to run a family

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,680
Much less a country

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,540
With more money going out than coming in

89
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,000
And the debt, well it just keeps on getting bigger

90
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,920
And we all gonna have to pay

91
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,980
So don't you laugh

92
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,440
guitar solo

93
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,320
guitar solo

94
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,520
One day you're gonna look down at your paycheck

95
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,480
And figure out

96
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,620
They done started taking half

97
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,120
Cause every time the bureaucrats run out of money

98
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,240
Congress sucks into the working man

99
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,620
I don't think it's one bit funny

100
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,880
When it takes so much of my money

101
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,660
To do things with it, I don't understand

102
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,220
I don't understand

103
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,340
I don't know why they think they have to squeeze us

104
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,560
But I'll tell you just exactly where I stand

105
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,940
I believe if 10% is good enough for Jesus

106
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,160
It ought to be enough for Uncle Sam

107
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,460
I believe if 10% is good enough for Jesus

108
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,180
It ought to be enough for Uncle Sam

109
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,400
What a wonderful, glad homecoming

110
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,420
Gonna take place on the golden shore

111
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,620
And when I lay my burdens down

112
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,640
Dear friends

113
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,360
When I lay my burdens down

114
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,360
This is your old prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang

115
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,220
Trying to do a show and a website at the same time

116
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,580
Honest, honest

117
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,060
But let's draw

118
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,260
Let's leave the

119
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,140
The old time gospel stuff behind there for just a sec

120
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,360
By the way, Jesus caught that song

121
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,680
You can imagine

122
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
You know, the Lord Jesus Christ works for the Subgenius Foundation

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
Now he's back again

124
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,860
I think we've mentioned that in previous shows

125
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,860
We'll be hearing from him later on in the show

126
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,980
About why he hates Christmas

127
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,180
And I don't hate Christmas, friends, myself

128
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,000
I enjoy Christmas

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,140
I like the presents

130
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,380
I worship Santa

131
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,840
Santa Claus

132
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,660
And, you know, I mean, gosh

133
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,220
It's our friend Jesus' birthday and everything

134
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,340
But he ain't real happy about it

135
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,560
Now let me see what kind of background music I can put on here while I yak

136
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,060
Pleasure with the Dirt Devil

137
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,320
Let's see how that

138
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,200
That's promising enough

139
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah

140
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,460
Uh-huh

141
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,000
The Hour of Slack, friends

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,260
Is now officially in broadcast

143
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,500
Yes, we're sounding like real FM DJs now, aren't we?

144
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,300
With a solid, heavy backbeat and, uh

145
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,660
Uh, and, and

146
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,960
Get this, dear friends

147
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,800
I can't get control over this background

148
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,420
Well, that song's got words in it

149
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,820
Well, that's good, but we need some, uh

150
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,400
Oh, yeah, I think this one just kinda goes

151
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,760
B-b-b-b-b-bob in the background

152
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,880
Uh, friends, this is Hour of Slack number 559

153
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,720
And you know what?

154
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,700
As of this day that I'm recording on

155
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,460
There are 559 days left until X-Day

156
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,100
On July 5th, 1998

157
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,680
Yes, 559 days away

158
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,800
Doesn't sound like much, does it?

159
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,140
And it'll be a lot less by the time you hear this tape

160
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,100
Yeah, Happy New Year

161
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,540
I hope it's a happy one

162
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,720
Because it's gonna be the last

163
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,760
It's gonna be your last full new year

164
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,000
And we, I know we've covered, uh

165
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,800
Christmas and New Year's last show

166
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,840
Uh, and so forth

167
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,720
But, you know, and you're not gonna be hearing this tape

168
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,980
Until after such times

169
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,320
But we've got some, some more good Christmas stuff

170
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,020
Of course, it comes in late

171
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,920
Because we're dealing with subgeniuses

172
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,360
And, you know, the nature of time control

173
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,940
Bob's patented time control

174
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,960
Is such that, you know, we just don't care

175
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,380
So what if it's late for Christmas?

176
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,800
Well, as Jane or Harper Cleaves once said

177
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,020
We vomit on Christmas, dear friends

178
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,540
And, uh, and almost everybody vomits on New Year's, I suppose

179
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,700
Uh, what else did I

180
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,680
Oh, yeah, it's been, uh

181
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,780
Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now

182
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:25,780


183
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,520
Okay, we've got 559 days left

184
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,180
Until all the normal people in the world are killed

185
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,280
And enslaved, or else enslaved

186
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,960
And, uh, we, the subgeniuses

187
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
The chosen of Bob

188
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,780
Will be lifted up in power and glory

189
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,660
To a greater world

190
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,260
A world without the binks

191
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,300
And, if we want, without our fellow subgeniuses

192
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,620
Because they do get on your nerves

193
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,280
And, you know, even the best of them

194
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,300
Uh, yes

195
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,200
And that's why I prefer it better

196
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,500
In the virtual world, dear friends

197
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,280
I'm a friendly kind of person

198
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,300
I have many, many friends

199
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,820
And I've gotten better and better

200
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,700
At keeping every single one of them at arm's length

201
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,180
Because, you know, humans are unpredictable enough

202
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,420
And subgeniuses are a million, godzillion times worse

203
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,460
Uh, whereas if I communicate with them through

204
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,040
Uh, even more, at more of a distance than the telephone

205
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,780
Through the internet

206
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,860
Ah, it's a, it's a, it's a

207
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,860
Two-way monologues, you know

208
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,600
It's, it's not exactly a dialogue

209
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,760
It's, it's the tricky

210
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,340
Human interaction part of it

211
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,160
It's, it's bypassed

212
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,880
And a clean digital on or off

213
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,000
No maybes

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,320
A true clarity is achieved

215
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,840
And, in fact, believe it or not

216
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,460
This is true

217
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,720
When I'm not on mic on this show

218
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,760
I'm gonna be across the room

219
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:55,760


220
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:55,760


221
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,440
Uploading the most incredible artwork you can imagine

222
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,200
The, the Church of the Subgeniuses Electronic Art

223
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,040
World is in a renaissance such that I cannot even believe it

224
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,420
And I, I wish that we were on television

225
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,880
Or heck, if you have web TV

226
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,740
Hey, hey, hey, why even Joe Lunchpail and his grandma

227
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,540
Can look at, uh, at this stuff, uh, projected up to six feet across

228
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,960
Depending if your television screen's that big

229
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,520
Uh, uh, it, there's

230
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,340
There are, are always a hundred artists doing something great for Bob

231
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,020
A couple of times a year when they get a wild hair

232
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,840
But every now and then when the moon is right

233
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,460
And the planets are in anti-alignment

234
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,660
The amateur becoming professional subgenius computer artists go berserk

235
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,380
And, uh, I spend half an hour a day letting the stuff pour through the lines

236
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,540
Into the big bucket inside my computer

237
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,740
And then I, I try to put it out on the World Wide Web

238
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,000
Where it's etched in stone and sort of permanent

239
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,740
And, and it's, I wish we could print it all

240
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,260
On paper we, we are, we're, we've got a, a Starc Fist being mailed out right now

241
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,760
A new one, 16 pager with a lot of great black and white comic book art

242
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,900
And some crappy black and white reproductions of some of this computer art

243
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,360
But man, I'll tell ya

244
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,820
It's better inside

245
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,040
Inside that world

246
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,940
It's cleaner on the other side of that screen

247
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,220
The, the side of the screen that faces me, dear friends

248
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,200
Is as brown as my lungs are

249
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,620
It's covered with this sort of frop resin and tobacco stains

250
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,780
And it's just, it's like everything else on this physical mass plane

251
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,280
It's sweaty, it's stinky, it's got boogers

252
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,400
It's not godly

253
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,260
It is not pristine and precise

254
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,660
Like it is deep inside the box

255
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,560
If only I could just plug myself completely into there

256
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,740
There, you know, there is where we will find Bob

257
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,060
For as not the virtual Bob

258
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,200
As, as, as true to the bank of heaven

259
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,740
As the earthly Bob

260
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,440
We will have the 3D

261
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,100
Artificial intelligence

262
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,220
Dobbs

263
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,040
Oracle, dear friends

264
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,320
We shall have it before X-Day

265
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,800
If I have to make it to X-Day

266
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,100
I will have to do it myself

267
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,280
In between playing Hour of Slack clips

268
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,700
And uploading Hours of Slack

269
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
To the internet

270
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,320
Which actually I don't do

271
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,560
The good Reverend Wanderer there in New Jersey

272
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,520
Listening to us now through WFMU

273
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,240
Which by the way, WFMU will soon be

274
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,260
Have a little home on the internet

275
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,180
Which we are hosting, yes

276
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,740
We will drop, put some WFMU samples in

277
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,280
With our audio spew

278
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,480
So that people all over the world

279
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,680
Can hear, uh, more crazy, crazy stuff

280
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,360
Well I'm gonna go back to my real job

281
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,940
That doesn't pay

282
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,580
Creating three dimensional saucers

283
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,140
That actually fly through interior space zones

284
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,300
Of your mind's eye

285
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,060
And you can just sit here and listen to mere audio tapes

286
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,880
And it's because it's all so real

287
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,820
Real seeming to your senses

288
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,860
That your senses can't tell the difference

289
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,260
When you live in a computer generated world

290
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,480
That you've created on your own

291
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,860
Are you not the god of that world?

292
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,260
These are the implications of virtual reality

293
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,880
And they've gotta make us wonder

294
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,940
How this could possibly fulfill the prophecy

295
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,280
Of the image of the beast

296
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,540
You can see how important it is to have this video

297
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,660
And if you round that gift off to a hundred dollars

298
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,040
I'll throw in my brand new book

299
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,140
In the name of Satan

300
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,900
Get both videos and both books

301
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,200
And get them right now

302
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:17,000
My 26 year old son, um, Philip

303
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,560
I do believe is, is severely demonized

304
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,780
He doesn't exactly dabble in the occult

305
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,800
He sort of swims in it

306
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,120
Yeah, swims in it

307
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,600
Yeah, he, uh, he likes, he listens to a lot of rock group

308
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,380
A lot of heavy, heavy metal

309
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:30,600
Yeah

310
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,500
Marilyn Manson, Skinny Puppies

311
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,360
Oh, no, Mar, Skinny Puppies and Marilyn Manson?

312
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,280
All the rest of it

313
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,460
Ugh

314
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,620
So do my other teenagers

315
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,180
Oh no

316
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,140
And, uh

317
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,040
What are you doing about it?

318
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,560
I, I pray for them

319
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,720
I go in his house and I pray in his house when he's not there

320
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,600
He's a 26 year old Marilyn Manson fan?

321
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,120
Yes

322
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,060
He needs to grow up

323
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,920
I agree

324
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,820
He needs to grow up

325
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,720
I mean, Marilyn Manson is, is basically your post-pubescent rip off of the, the latest

326
00:14:52,900 --> 00:15:00,060
uh, Kiss Alice Cooper genre except that he's got an actual image of Lucifer tattooed on his left arm

327
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,040
Yeah, you can paint in the, uh, in the church

328
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,740
Oh yes, I know that, absolutely

329
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,840
The guy is just as evil as can be and, and is, and is, and is

330
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,100
He's capitalizing on being sexually abused by his grandfather supposedly at an early age

331
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,700
Yeah, yeah

332
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:11,840
Cool

333
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,340
He's about as hateful an anti-God as anybody could be and anybody who'd want to listen to that kind of junk has really got to have a screw loose somewhere spiritually

334
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,700
My prayers are with you, you can get this straightened out, Janet

335
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,340
Well, they're suppo-

336
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,880
Yep, you can get that straightened out, Janet

337
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:30,260
By writing to the church of the, what was that noise?

338
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,060
Did, did you hear that? It was like a

339
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,700
I, I believe this equipment is demon possessed

340
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,040
Demon possessed

341
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,840
Demon come out, demon come out

342
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,240
Of the Ren and Stimpy Show

343
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,940
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON

344
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,420
No, no

345
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,720
Keep listening you idiot

346
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

347
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,860
Else I shall deal you

348
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:05,960
Boy, those were the days, back when we actually had a radio station, I didn't have to sit here in my, in my pathetic little hovel of a office building here

349
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:17,920
Well, actually we do own the whole building, but, uh, I don't know, we spend all the money on equipment instead of a janitorial staff, I guess that's part of the problem

350
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,880
This old church is a, it's a, it's a damn mess, it's what it is

351
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,600
Now here's an odd, I just don't know what exactly to think of this, dear friends

352
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,800
This came from the same people that sent us the Women of Sodom

353
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,620
One of the sickest, sickest, sickest CDs ever

354
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,680
Wonderful thing, and then, and then, it is Tri-Age, I believe is the name of the company

355
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,340
Um, uh, talk about demon worshippers, check this out

356
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:17,960
Whoops, here's an odd one

357
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,220
What child is this old lady

358
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,780
Watch out as you're still laid to rest

359
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,880
questions

360
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:38,660
On Mary's lap is sleeping, whom angels greet with anthems sweet while shepherds watch are keeping. This, this is Christ the King, whom shepherds guard and angels sing.

361
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:58,520
Haste, haste to bring him love, O babe, you son of Mary. I say, oh, sweet child of mine. I say, oh, sweet Lord of mine.

362
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,740
So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh. Come, peasant king, to own him.

363
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,640
The king of kings, the king of kings.

364
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,820
The king of kings, salvation brings. Let loving hearts enthrone him.

365
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:21,440
Raise, raise the song on high. The virgin sings her lullaby.

366
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,560
Joy, joy, for Christ is born, the babe, the son of Mary.

367
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:33,040
I say, oh, sweet child of mine.

368
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,640
I say, oh, sweet child of mine.

369
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,060
I say, oh, sweet child of mine.

370
00:18:45,500 --> 00:19:08,260
I say, oh, sweet child of mine.

371
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:15,140
I say, oh, sweet child of mine.

372
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:23,700
I say, oh, sweet child of mine.

373
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:38,260
And that child would bring unto the world a simple timeless message a peace and love.

374
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,640
Iürnegein, Peter, a paradise which lures man through love.

375
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:38,640


376
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:38,640


377
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:38,640


378
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:38,640


379
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:38,640


380
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,520
You know, it's a message that can still guide us today

381
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,200
when we feel lost and lonely,

382
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,580
when we see our world spinning out of control,

383
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,080
when we just want to throw up our hands and say,

384
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,900
Where do we go? Where do we go?

385
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,800
Where do we go now?

386
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,940
Where do we go? Where do we go?

387
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,720
Where do we go now?

388
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,800
I need a high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high.

389
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,060
What we try to live is a lie.

390
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,680
Hey, the wonderful world of Joey.

391
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,360
That's Bulldada, dear friends.

392
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,440
That is Bulldada.

393
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,580
And actually looking at this little CD sleeve,

394
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,500
I'm starting to see through the secret hints here.

395
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,380
Now that I look closely, yes, this is an album called Wonderful World.

396
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,940
The artist is Wonderful World of Joey.

397
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,140
The title of the album is What Sweet Child of Mine Is This?

398
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,560
And this little sticker here from the triage company says,

399
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,140
Ultra cheesy, excuse me,

400
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,060
Ultra cheesy lounge crazy Christmas music.

401
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,760
Track one is a combination of green sleeves, What Child is This?

402
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,580
and Guns N' Roses, Sweet Child of Mine.

403
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,640
Track two is Joey's own version of the Mancini-Mercer classic,

404
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,120
Days of Wine and Roses.

405
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:29,420
And I noticed here that the triage's email address is triage at wfmu.org.

406
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,620
See? Now the conspiracy comes around.

407
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,700
It's a conspiracy within the convolutions beneath the roof.

408
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,800
The wrinkles of the uber conspiracy, the overall conspiracy,

409
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:48,040
the conspiracy of the essence, the attitude of normalcy, normality, what have you.

410
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,220
What have you.

411
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,860
I have no idea.

412
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:59,340
Anyway, yeah, it's the death of Christmas.

413
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,500
Christmas is over.

414
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,600
Hey, what's that?

415
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,600
What's that?

416
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,160
There, that's better.

417
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,340
Here's Jesus, friends.

418
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,880
This is Jesus.

419
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,200
Hello.

420
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:19,720
This is the Lord Jesus Christ, business manager of the church, of the subgenius, and the son of God.

421
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,180
By the time you hear this, it'll be close to the holiday known as Christmas.

422
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,420
I know a lot of you may be using this time to perpetrate the fraud of my birth.

423
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,760
So I thought I'd take a few moments and give you the top five reasons why I hate Christmas.

424
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,720
Number five.

425
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,200
I never got any presents.

426
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,320
Now, any of you who've been born in this wretched month of giving know exactly what I'm talking about.

427
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:51,580
Oh yeah, sure, they'll set one of your Christmas presents aside and tell you that it's your birthday present, but you know better.

428
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,940
And don't think I didn't get teased.

429
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,000
My cousin John the Baptist, he would always pick on me saying,

430
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,440
oh, you may be the son of God, but I get two presents each year.

431
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,580
Bastard.

432
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,100
Number four.

433
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,660
I was born in a cave.

434
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,760
Actually, the entire plastic cartoon manger scene really bugs me.

435
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:19,520
You know the ones with their, they got the 40 watt bulbs stuck up the butts of the, the plasts so they glow at night?

436
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,200
Well, it really pisses me off.

437
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,780
First of all, I wasn't born in a manger, I was born in a cave.

438
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,740
I was wrapped in a donkey's blanket and not in, not in swaddling clothing and it was cold.

439
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,940
It was real cold.

440
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,900
You ever been in a cave?

441
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,480
In Bethlehem in the middle of winter?

442
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,520
Number three.

443
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,360
The wise men.

444
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:47,280
Yeah, if they were so damn wise, why didn't they bring the gold a couple of days earlier so we could have been in a Motel 6 instead of a freaking cave?

445
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,340
And let me tell you how happy I was to get frankincense and myrrh and some gold.

446
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,460
Oh yeah, that's exactly what every baby's asking for for this Christmas.

447
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,920
You know, a portable space heater may have been a bit more wise, don't you think?

448
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,720
And let me what, let me tell you what happened to those, uh, wise and thoughtful.

449
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:14,000
Well, we burnt the incense to get rid of the smell of animal dung and my dad went down to the Golden Cab bar and grilled and drunk meat until he passed out.

450
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,040
And I don't blame him.

451
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,280
You try explaining to a bunch of Levites how your girlfriend was knocked up by the Lord.

452
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,460
Which leads me to number two.

453
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,760
The Virgin Mary.

454
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,320
Now, this is another complete misconception.

455
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,360
I still cringe when I hear that word, the Virgin Mary.

456
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,540
They called poor mom the Virgin Mary all her life.

457
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,260
Even after she had my three brothers and my sister.

458
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,560
Oh, look girls, there goes the Virgin Mary.

459
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,500
Imagine the humiliation.

460
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,240
Ah, man. Number one.

461
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,180
The number one reason why I, Jesus Christ, hate Christmas.

462
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,220
Santa Claus.

463
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,880
Now, don't get me wrong, I don't actually hate Santa.

464
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,160
It's just that he gets all the attention.

465
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,800
I mean, whose day is it supposed to be anyway?

466
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,340
You know, nobody wants to sit on Jesus' lap at Christmas.

467
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,740
You know, a lot of people think it makes me angry that there are other people claiming to be me.

468
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,500
And this isn't true at all.

469
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,860
First, it fulfills prophecy.

470
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,520
Second, it gives me some breathing room.

471
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,260
And third, it's great PR.

472
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,120
Santa has all these people dressed up like clowns at every mall in the country.

473
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,140
You know, why not me? There should be Jesus' helpers.

474
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,800
But, you know, I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon.

475
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,520
And I say, just because Santa Claus is a clown, doesn't mean he's a good person.

476
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,400
It's just that people like Santa Claus, so don't leave me out of it.

477
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,660
I'm all for Christmas.

478
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,800
I'm a capitalist.

479
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,360
And I like getting stuff as much as everybody else.

480
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,420
But let's just say we worship me the rest of the year.

481
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,020
And on December 25th, give me a rest.

482
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,360
Peace, love, and slack, this is the Lord Jesus Christ.

483
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,080
Merry Xmas.

484
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,720
Yeah, wake up to reality, it's just as I feared.

485
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,700
Watched you by dismay, things run out and say you're here

486
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,060
Noises all around and I can hear all the cries

487
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,520
I get up out of bed so I can face all the lies

488
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,520
As I look around I see that nothing seems right

489
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,840
I'm looking forward to the time that I say goodnight

490
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:06,100
Lay me down in Greenland

491
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,240
Greenland is my land

492
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,620
Is your land

493
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,340
You like it

494
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Greenland is your land

495
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,160
It's your land

496
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,880
You'll see

497
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,020
Yes, dear friends, and what you're listening to here is

498
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,920
The Flying Ryan Brothers, this reverend kid

499
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,540
You mean Ryan

500
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,920
And his brothers

501
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,980
Put out this, this, this CD, yes

502
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,460
And for information upon the Flying Ryan Brothers

503
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,920

Heavy, man

Heavy, heavy, heavy stuff

Guaranteed to take you on the ultimate ride

514
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,500
Yeah, yeah

515
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,180
Now's the time, turn off the light

516
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,680
And pull down the shade

517
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,480
Yeah

518
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,180
Yeah

519
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:55,900
Yeah

520
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,140
For yesterday

521
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:05,880
Now, yeah

522
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,420
Good old thing

523
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


524
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


525
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


526
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


527
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


528
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420

00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420

00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


531
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


532
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


533
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


534
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


535
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


536
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


537
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


538
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


539
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,420


540
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,220
Way

541
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,380
Yeah

542
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,420
Congratulations on your decision to become a nonsmoker

543
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,040
Oh, that's what I mean

544
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,040


545
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,960
You're definitely one of the most important decisions you'll ever make

546
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,220
And one of the best

547
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:25,440
Yeah

548
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,180
Right

549
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:25,780
Way to go

550
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,020
The Nicoderm CQ Patch User's Guide,

551
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,320
Carton Labeling,

552
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,900
and this audio tape are designed to help make it as easy as possible to break bad.

553
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,160
Keep in mind that this program won't work.

554
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,480
What's to lose?

555
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,820
A little time?

556
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,840
Hurt your ego a little bit, baby?

557
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,780
You probably got time you're wasting on Mickey Mouse stuff now,

558
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,180
so that's no big deal.

559
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,060
So why not?

560
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,580
So why not?

561
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,580
Why not make a new beginning in your life and see what'll happen?

562
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,360
I don't know.

563
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,480
No, you don't know.

564
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,680
And you will never know.

565
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,300
You have signed the application.

566
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,440
You do have the kit.

567
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,540
None of those things are important.

568
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,520
Very Merry Christmas!

569
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,600
Huh? Who goes there?

570
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,580
Santa Claus!

571
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,040
Ah, there ain't no Santa Claus.

572
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,120
Oh, yes, there is, and we got a present for you.

573
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,840
You have? Where?

574
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,460
Okay, all you little squirty honey teenage girls,

575
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,700
you're listening to The Hour of Flack

576
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,340
with Reverend...

577
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,180
Reverend Ivan Stang.

578
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,260
I don't care if you like it or not,

579
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,660
your name is Honey.

580
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,460
There is a point in your life when you've got to just stop talking about it.

581
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,540
And you've got to stop worrying about what your friends and neighbors and relatives

582
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,420
and uncles and aunts and sisters and brothers and everybody else is gonna say about it.

583
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,940
Because nobody else is gonna pay your bills for you.

584
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,740
Why not?

585
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,800
You don't know.

586
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,900
And you will never know.

587
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,380
And who knows? Just maybe.

588
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,320
Just maybe.

589
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:54,340


590
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:54,340


591
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:54,340


592
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,900
You could have one of the biggest.

593
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,080
I don't know, but even more important, you don't know.

594
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,500
You will never know.

595
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,400
You will never know.

596
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,420
Just maybe, you're in for a new and exciting experience.

597
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,340
You have signed the application.

598
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:24,340

00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:24,340

606
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:07,780
this stuff is you can't fool these people yeah yeah i'm tired of this script let's go to this

607
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,640
it's not easy to stop smoking but you've taken the most difficult step by making the decision to quit

608
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,400
and yet you're increasingly wondering if

609
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:22,500
the

610
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,480
only thing that just might actually save you is that magical something from above

611
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,880
reaching down into your individual little pit and pulling you out sure and life really is some

612
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,000
artfully directed conspiracy against you and you know that someone knows what's really going on

613
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,880
someone's got the keys to the ultimate truths of the universe and that's why you're going from

614
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,900
one school of hocus pocus to the next yeah somebody's just got to know and it's probably

615
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,440
the government and they're keeping it from you sure they've been

616
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,620
in touch with the aliens and ufos and all psychic phenomenon for years and they won't share it with

617
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:05,480
because they know that you'll leave your slot and head off to some new planet or worse demand that

618
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:13,440
your dreams of happiness actually happen and now but right now we don't want to talk about folk

619
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:21,420
music we want to talk about you more specifically we want to talk about your guilt and your absolution

620
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,700
well we here in the church of the subgenius have invented a little ritual we like to call the

621
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:35,600
subgenius spanking ritual in the real world you are forced to feel guilt for doing things that

622
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:42,300
ordinarily will give you slack and then they have institutions like christianity to punish you for

623
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:48,940
feeling your guilt you come to them for penance they punish you by making you say prayers and

624
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,420
you know doing good works and stuff like that whatever

625
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:59,320
but instead in the church of the subgenius we don't believe you should feel guilt for getting

626
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:06,620
slack so instead we just allow you to absolve that guilt by getting a kind of punishment that

627
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:14,500
will give you slack the subgenius spanking ritual i want you right now listeners to think of that

628
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,880
which gives you slack and that which makes you feel inadvertent guilt and instead of going to

629
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,100
church on sunday to

630
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:30,560
confess your sins i want you right now to place your bare buttocks up against the radio place them

631
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,100
right in there up against the radio get ready for the subgenius spanking ritual are you feeling the

632
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:45,600
guilt demons leaving your body i feel so guilty i feel so guilty i'm seeing i'm seeing i am seeing

633
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,940
feel those guilt demons fleeing

634
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,400
fleeing flowing out of your body

635
00:34:52,420 --> 00:35:00,480
you're a backside and into the radio and into the air and dispersing throughout the cosmos to give other people slack

636
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,380
all right i bought a brand new car so i can drive around and look cool and pick up women

637
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,700
well there's nothing wrong with picking up women but you shouldn't be giving a conspiracy your hard

who are these people who kill and kill and kill again

645
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,260
oh

646
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,680
oh

647
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,360
oh

648
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:52,420


649
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,940
stop

650
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,220
we'll someday find them

651
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,720
there's no way out

652
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:16,800
this feels like the best God combined

653
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,400
only sex preoccupies us more than money

654
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,160
these days.

655
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,760
She's dead.

656
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,880
Wrapped in plastic.

657
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,360
A shocking tale of murder,

658
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,880
mutilation, and cannibalism.

659
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,720
Wrapped in plastic.

660
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,860
I felt it was one hell of a tweak.

661
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,320
One hell of a tweak.

662
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,940
One hell of a tweak.

663
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,000
So who are these serial killers?

664
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,340
They are more like us

665
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,380
than we like them.

666
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,060
I'd like to admit

667
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,060
that I had these obsessive

668
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,580
desires and

669
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,960
thoughts wanting to

670
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,940
control them.

671
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,380
I just enjoy killing them.

672
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,500
I'm scared to death

673
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,440
of failing

674
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,620
in male-female relationships.

675
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,560
What makes their sick minds tick?

676
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,920
Believe me, they're the most

677
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,840
despicable human beings on our planet.

678
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,520
I don't believe anybody should forgive them.

679
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,180
Certainly not, you condone it.

680
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,620
But we must study them.

681
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,540
It was overwhelming.

682
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,600
He was a killing machine out of control.

683
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,860
I'm gonna kill you as many as I can.

684
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,360
I'm gonna pile you up to the sky.

685
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,880
These are flip-floppy ties.

686
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,500
The serial killer is packaged

687
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,780
and sold in magazines, books,

688
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,380
even training cards.

689
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,760
How do you like them apples, dummy?

690
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,620
Yeah!

691
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,800
I got too many girls after a hitchhike

692
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,560
and it didn't be under.

693
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,740
He tries to kill 300 people.

694
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,900
It excites him.

695
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,340
Some people go crazy.

696
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,480
I felt it.

697
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,520
It was one hell of a tweak.

698
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,880
I mean, to just flip out

699
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,960
and not be where I was.

700
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,700
A surge of energy.

701
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,440
It was one hell of a tweak.

702
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,480
It was just like something

703
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,620
they've snapped.

704
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,280
A severe childhood

705
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,040
disturbances associated

706
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,820
with violence.

707
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,360
It was one hell of a tweak.

708
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,540
Oh, boy.

709
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,900
One hell of a tweak.

710
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,640
What's noise to some people

711
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,780
is one hell of a tweak

712
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,460
to old Reverend Stag.

713
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,960
And his messed up right channel.

714
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,600
But, yes, that was

715
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,920
Bill T. Miller, friend.

716
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,320
Out of band experience.

717
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,320
OBE.

718
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,300
You can get information

719
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,440
on that CD

720
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,500
from 161...

721
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,440
This is a phone number.

722
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:42,820
1617.

723
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,120
OBE.

724
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,000
1617.

725
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,960
No, it's 1617 Lick OBE.

726
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,140
1617 Lick OBE, L-I-C-K OBE.

727
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Also box 221.

728
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,340
Boston...

729
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,220
Ma...

730
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,780
Box 221, Boston, Massachusetts.

731
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,540
02123.

732
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:08,940
02123.

733
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,000
And...

734
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,640
Willpower.

735
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,440
Willpower.

736
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,320
We'll talk more about them later on.

737
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,180
Yes, the will...

738
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,380
Let me start by giving you

739
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,240
some serious and important information.

740
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:18,740
No kidding.

741
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,940
Nicoderm CQ is a cure for...

742
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,680
carefully designed, easy-to-use patch containing nicotine,

743
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,160
which it releases into your body through your skin at a controlled rate.

744
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,460
Even though it seems to be a simple product, it's serious medicine.

745
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,240
And like any medicine...

746
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,860
Go to survival techniques and learn how to kill.

747
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,040
Of course, you don't want to kill a sub-genius believer, but...

748
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,640
God's judgment is going to come and fall again

749
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,380
upon a godless, Christ-rejecting, blasphemous society.

750
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,000
Well, if this sounds paranoid, you're right.

751
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,500
But I think I have good reason to be paranoid.

752
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,660
It's a strange world out there.

753
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:08,680
Kind of, this is what life is like at a bottom-line level.

754
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,560
You know, and I'm not going to make you cut through a lot of other stuff to get through it.

755
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,340
Here's what it is.

756
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,700
There's no gimmick about that. It's straightforward.

757
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,280
It's strong, and it's elemental.

758
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,100
Yeah, heavy stuff.

759
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,340
Oh, witchcraft.

760
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,580
Voodoo.

761
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,420
Devil worship.

762
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:26,860
Sure.

763
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,260
The only real hope you have is that the UFOs come and take you away,

764
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,760
wipe out your debts, free you from the job, and whisk you off to a new life.

765
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,000
A life full of changes, happy changes, every day.

766
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,580
And you want it now.

767
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,900
Who cares about a heaven you have to die to get to?

768
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,960
Better go and live with the aliens and let them take care of you.

769
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,340
Hey, I'm over here.

770
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,940
Yeah, what about the savior in his Armageddon?

771
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,380
Well, aren't you just a little too smart to believe in such a convenient, tidy way

772
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,220
to clean up the problem of far too many warm bodies?

773
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,140
Besides, the halves have already bought up the 144,000 available slots.

774
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,540
And where does that leave you?

775
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,200
You.

776
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:17,540
You.

777
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,920
Why, if the aliens don't save you,

778
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,800
you'll be left with melting polar ice, the greenhouse effect, and the oceans rise,

779
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,060
earthquakes popping off, floods and droughts side by side,

780
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,800
unstoppable viruses and urban warfare on the grandest scale.

781
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:41,320
And everywhere you'll look, once great systems will break down and come after you.

782
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,360
Boy, that sounds familiar.

783
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,880
You'll sweat it out alone, with few, if any, friends.

784
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,620
Friends by your side.

785
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,980
No, I'll tell you, let's not sweat it out alone.

786
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,700
Let's share.

787
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,360
That was from Thought Alchemy.

788
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,560
Here's the address for Thought Alchemy again.

789
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,200
This tab has been slowly but surely working my way down this bizarre tape, Thought Alchemy,

790
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,740
with Von Graffen.

791
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,000
And here's where you can write Von Graffen for a copy of his horrible tape.

792
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,720
I mean, I believe that it...

793
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,120
Somehow, there...

794
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:20,840
He raps.

795
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,740
He raps it all up, but we haven't gotten to that point yet.

796
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:29,260
Von Graffen, Box 2136, Chico, California.

797
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:38,540
That's Box 2136, Chico, California, 95927.

798
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:46,620
And that's Thought Alchemy for 21st Century Man,

799
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,420
with Von Graffen.

800
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,360
Von Graffen.

801
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,220
Let's see what else is on this old MediaBros tape here.

802
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,460
A wild, gnawing, animal hunger will grow in you.

803
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:07,460
His number is six hundred, three score, and six.

804
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,980
Jehovah-1 is a space deity from the corporate sin galaxy,

805
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,660
which exists somewhere in the distant corners of the universe as we know it.

806
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,380
Oath is his test tube.

807
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:19,840
Oath.

808
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:20,920
Oath.

809
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


810
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


811
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


812
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


813
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


814
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


815
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


816
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


817
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


818
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


819
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


820
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


821
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


822
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


823
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


824
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,240
Oath.

825
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


826
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


827
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


828
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


829
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


830
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


831
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


832
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


833
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


834
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


835
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


836
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


837
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


838
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


839
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


840
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


841
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


842
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


843
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


844
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


845
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


846
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


847
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


848
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


849
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,240


850
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,160
Materialization of an experiment that Jehovah-1 started roughly seven million years ago

851
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,900
as the result of a bar bet.

852
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,520
You have signed the application.

853
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,580
Welcome aboard.

854
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,020
So what is the real deal in this world?

855
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,460
Once upon a time.

856
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,080
A long time ago.

857
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,920
A beautiful bright sky.

858
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:50,920


859
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,240
A star as fine as any goddess.

860
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:01,740
She had long held the dominant position in the sky and had been admired by all for her beauty.

861
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,040
But lately she's felt not well.

862
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,460
Indeed, it seemed as though her life was ebbing away.

863
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:20,380
Failing and failing, she clung to any companion star she could find, only to discover that

864
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:20,900
they had changed.

865
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:20,900


866
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,400
On the way, Grecian prevalent büym hemos registrado está acero afelado

who listened in silence.

868
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,440
I absolutely feel the definite grip.

869
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:33,740
And when weakening, once upon a time, a long time ago.

870
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:33,740


871
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:33,740

926
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,540
You know, a lot of people go,

927
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,680
how do you do this hour of slack thing, man?

928
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,060
And it's computers is basically what it is.

929
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,880
Not only is the show written pretty much by computer,

930
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,500
of course, you know, there's some human interface there,

931
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,560
but it's also actually, believe it or not,

932
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,760
recorded and acted by computer simulation

933
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,180
of human voices, dear friends.

934
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,820
And we use this Beast 9000 computer here.

935
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,700
Excuse me, Will.

936
00:51:54,360 --> 00:52:00,000
You can see with the, this booger has a 40,000K RAM

937
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,420
and a 50,000K U.

938
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,820
And essentially, we just type in the script

939
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,340
and fine-tune the machine.

940
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:13,480
Until we get the desired lifelike effect of human speech.

941
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:18,040
And we can program in the voices of any subgenius ranter.

942
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,940
We've got about 25 people in the files with a,

943
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,060
well, we've been doing this for so long

944
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,640
that we've built up quite a library

945
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,020
of human-like vocal utterances.

946
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,800
And I will show you all, oh shoot,

947
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:34,040
we're gonna have to tune this guy out here.

948
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:34,940
Hold on just a second.

949
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,400
And I'll show you how we do a sample hour of slack.

950
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,640
So, without having to fly in people

951
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,660
from all over the country.

952
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,640
Let's see, we got the,

953
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:52,780
first we type in the message here on the computer.

954
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,520
Like so, just for an example here.

955
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:59,980
And then, we have to, hold on, I'm gonna hurt your ears

956
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,920
as I move you to the back of the computer

957
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,480
where you can hear the pre-processed sound.

958
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,660
This is what it sounds like before we actually add

959
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,040
the human vocalizations.

960
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,660
No, not the human vocalizations.

961
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,560
This is the sole database and we are converting it

962
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,480
onto online data, convert to sub-entry mode.

963
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:21,160
Then the database is transferred to the district memory

964
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,860
by a tender older plus computer.

965
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,240
And retrieve the line array

966
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,700
as we apply this older plus hardware.

967
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,160
These computers are the ones that can actually think.

968
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,860
Though some experts still prefer to use the word mimic

969
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,860
to human brain.

970
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,460
There, there we go.

971
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:38,940
See?

972
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,060
See?

973
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,120
See?

974
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,200
That part is easy.

975
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,380
That's the easy part.

976
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:52,700
What we do next then is select this little portion here and call that one Doug.

977
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,480
That will be the puzzling evidence voice.

978
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,920
And this section here will be the howl voice.

979
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:07,260
And now see, we have these voices, digital samplings of these people's voices in a huge database of syllables.

980
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:20,340
The tricky part is to, let's see, we add here the human emphasis simulator with a pleasant and informative vocal tone.

981
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,160
And that will take care of them.

982
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:23,720
See?

983
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:35,660
Now we add sound effects with fractalization and set the extemporaneous spinoff mode on at 75% speed.

984
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,240
Use the...

985
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:40,400
Use the general knowledge access file for...

986
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,200
Now this, that is where we get the metaphorical bounce back, we call it.

987
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:49,260
So the voices appear to actually be interacting with the sound effects before they say it.

988
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,420
And so let's...

989
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,440
Here, turn it on, listen to this.

990
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,280
You heard what it sounded like at first, now here's the final version.

991
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:01,560
This is the show database and we're converting it onto online data.

992
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,600
Convote to sub-entry mode.

993
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,100
Then the database is transferred to the district memory

994
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,320
by a general purpose computer.

995
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,180
And retrieved along a radar sweep line by special purpose hardware.

996
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:21,160
These computers are the ones that can actually think, though some experts still prefer to use the word mimic, the human brain.

997
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,080
I want a football and a tool chest in the summer.

998
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,900
That means this bird is in your brain.

999
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,180
Or, contrary-wise, that large brain is now inside a bird.

1000
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,080
Some birds are little more than nature's own.

1001
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,500
Nature's flying brains.

1002
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,060
Boing me.

1003
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,280
Boingin' away.

1004
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:49,460
Virtually nothing else exists in these organisms except a large brain and a pair of wings to steer it about through its environment.

1005
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,500
How fun.

1006
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,880
Natural selection has reduced this creature to its present-day grotesque appearance.

1007
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:01,960
But a perfect example of adaptability and evolutionary speciation

1008
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,560
in the marvelous Darwinian tapestry

1009
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,240
we call Life Possible.

1010
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,740
Sure, you can buy the Stigmata.

1011
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,660
You know what you can do with that Stigmata?

1012
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,820
Do you know what you can do with a big enough hole in the palm of your hand?

1013
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:44,980
Well, I'm not allowed to talk about it on radio, friends, but if you'll step into the hall of answers, you'll find out.

1014
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,720
What would I like to know?

1015
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,320
Oh, you're looking for the hall of questions.

1016
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,520
Oh, I forgot I asked you a question.

1017
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,600
We don't know what's in the hall of questions.

1018
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,440
It is a question.

1019
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,400
That's what we don't know.

1020
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,260
But what we do know is in the hall of science.

1021
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,080
Doug, there's collars floating up to the side of the show all around.

1022
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,840
Now, push them away there with the boat hook.

1023
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,760
Yeah, push the boat hook.

1024
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,140
There's a collar on your side of the boat.

1025
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,020
Push them away.

1026
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,700
Get rid of that legal contract, the broke friend.

1027
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,180
Hold on a minute, Doug.

1028
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:18,800
We've got it right here.

1029
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,420
How many times have we had to listen to that speech?

1030
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,000
Well, we've got it. We've got it. It's here.

1031
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:22,400
All right.

1032
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,600
Right here. Look, here's the church.

1033
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,520
Two rooms full of stupid church.

1034
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:25,840
Right.

1035
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,780
Well, we've got the revival. We can give it away there as a door prize.

1036
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,320
Oh, little church.

1037
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,560
This is the little two-room floating church on the ocean.

1038
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,940
Tiny and little, dancing along to some cool music.

1039
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:37,900
Bio-gradable.

1040
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,380
I'm gonna call it a church tonight.

1041
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,520
You haven't even heard of Flimby yet, have you?

1042
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:45,320
They all could be California ghouls.

1043
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,640
I wish they all could be California ghouls.

1044
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,740
Look, we scared away the collars.

1045
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,140
No, he's still there. There's still a collar.

1046
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,200
No, all the other collars.

1047
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,800
He's just trying to sing.

1048
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,680
He's drowning off the side of the show there.

1049
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,220
Just push him off the side of the show into the deep water.

1050
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,300
Is this an outboard show or inboard?

1051
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:01,580
Outboard show.

1052
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,640
Well, let's let Dennis float away and Marina Del Rey,

1053
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,180
and we'll talk about what we're gonna do with this church.

1054
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:11,760
And when Dr. Duell leaves, how much of the church he's gonna take back with him for security.

1055
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,900
And this is very important because Green Hill is one of the most secure areas for church business.

1056
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,980
Although it can rot the church almost quicker than anywhere on earth.

1057
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,180
That's true. You have to constantly keep cleaning it.

1058
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:24,180
Yeah, you have to pack silica gel around your church down there

1059
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,720
and just melt it into a big soggy religious mess right in front of you on the beach.

1060
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:28,480
It's difficult.

1061
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,700
All over this air.

1062
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,560
Boy, a few more of those and we get off the air, huh?

1063
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,420
And that's where you send your answers to this quiz.

1064
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:39,780
And the pinks shall be separated from their checkbooks that, yea, verily, they have fallen upon them

1065
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,740
and mated on them on the greens of the country.

1066
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,580
And given forth hideous monsters.

1067
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:45,960
Government lies.

1068
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,960
Bob told me my key down here would be easier on you, but...

1069
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,360
Oh, Bob. Oh, Bob. Oh, Bob.

1070
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,460
Hey, Dobbs. I didn't... Mr. Dobbs, sir.

1071
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,420
Hey, Mr. Dobbs.

1072
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:01,460
I didn't ask for this here... this here chain-gang work in Malaysia, Mr. Dobbs.

1073
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,880
How long do I have to suffer?

1074
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,540
Oh, Mr. Dobbs, I didn't want to be here.

1075
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,160
Well, you're not then.

1076
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,040

00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,480
Well, that's good to hear, caller.

1083
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,940
It's a beautiful day in my neighborhood.

1084
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,820
You're right, it is.

1085
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,260
Hello, caller.

00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:19,420


1087
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,940
Do you think they'd want to listen to you at this hour?

1088
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:22,680
Oh!

1089
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,660
Against their very destiny.

1090
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,520
Hot and steamy early morning hour.

1091
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,440
A hundred and twenty minutes...

1092
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:34,440
This puzzling evidence is in your brain now, going up the little canals, up to what used to be filled with blood are now filled with fat doids.

1093
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:35,400
Monoclonal...

1094
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,800
Continues to grow, to grow.

1095
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,960
Show extender filling each of your veins, your arteries, your mind, your idea areas.

1096
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:41,480
And of course, floppy adopter...

1097
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,660
Filling the cassettes stuffed way back in the...

1098
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,240
We're looking at...

1099
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,540
Dusty corridors of the cortex.

1100
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,080
A thousand copyrights, all mine, of course, except for the small places that are other people's.

1101
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:53,200
Oh, and the copyrights on Cheek, Orge, Gordon, and, uh, uh, Reverend on the Stang.

1102
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,820
Puzzling evidence in, uh, Glassman...

1103
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,160
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

1104
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,040
Uh, Flying Ryan Brothers, uh, thought out for me, uh, ten...

1105
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:04,760
A hundred, four, five hundred and fifty-nine shows, five hundred and fifty-nine days left to go.

1106
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,980
Very strange, as you can see.

1107
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:13,880
Uh, uh, Ed Strange, copyright Ed Strange, uh, uh, Nicky Death Chick, that was Nicky Death Chick doing the, uh, spanking ceremony there on Ed Strange's show.

1108
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,900
