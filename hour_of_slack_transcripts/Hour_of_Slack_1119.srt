1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
And suddenly it all came back to me.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,580
We love clean lakes.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,520
Animal waste helps keep lakes clean.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,500
We can help by getting animal waste into water.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,380
Farmers can help by keeping livestock in lakes

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,660
and by getting manure into the wetlands and rivers.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,320
Pet owners can help by not feeding them

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,320
and by picking up and disposing of pet waste in lakes or sewers.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,220
Wednesday night!

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,120
Wednesday night!

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,800
See the Texas Gas Coupe Sedan Showdown!

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,740
D-Gasser!

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,520
B-Gasser!

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,260
A-Gasser!

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,420
The Texas Gas Coupe Sedan Showdown!

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,720
The Self-Genius Power of Swag!

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,740
Me, I'm doing all the work.

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,840
And what are you guys doing?

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,240
Come on, come on, you hopheads.

20
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,600
My jitters are gone.

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,740
My friends say I'm like a new person.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,900
Three, one, two, zero!

23
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,560
As roaring rockets blast off to distant planets and far-flung stars,

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,360
we take you to the conquest of space with...

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,740
The Self-Genius Power of Swag!

26
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,820
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go!

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,380
The Self-Genius Power of Swag!

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,940
So, stand by!

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,740
Now, here's how to get your own official colored plastic.

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,960
Send 25 cents and your name and address.

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
Now, make sure you write that down, spaceman.

32
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,300
25 cents and your name and address.

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,620
Send them to 346-REPEAT-436.

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,020
Like a real space cadet.

35
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,980
Well, what are we waiting for?

36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


37
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,900
Let's go!

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,040
So, stand by!

40
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,940
The Self-Genius Power of Swag!

41
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,160
Stronger than you.

42
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,660
I don't believe it.

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,260
What do you mean?

44
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,660
Better than you.

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,140
You're up to something.

46
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,040
And now, match.

47
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,000
The Self-Genius Power of Swag!

48
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,160
You look and act so much like men, no one can detect them.

49
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,820
I understand.

50
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,840
Then I shall lead them with their superior intelligence.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,160
To the mastery of the world.

52
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,840
Why?

53
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,440
What difference does it make to you?

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,060
And now...

55
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,580
Sir, coffee.

56
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,760
Good heavens!

57
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,820
Coffee.

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,860
I can't make myself believe it.

59
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,300
You see, it's made from metal and synthetic brain tissue.

60
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,620
Oh, yes, of course.

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,520
Thank you.

62
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,200
Coffee.

63
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,860
And in a potato field on the outskirts of Wroclaw, Poland.

64
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,020
Hello?

65
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,880
Hello?

66
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,800
Who are you?

67
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,860
Hello, Tom!

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,580
This is Bob.

69
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,300
Hello!

70
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,280
Oh, how are you, Bob?

71
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,800
Fine.

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,260
What's new?

73
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,660
Well, today, any American in any part of the nation can strike against...

74
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,760
The Self-Genius Power of Swag!

75
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:24,920
Meanwhile, tomorrow is tomorrow, and the year 2000 is a long way off.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,280
There's work ahead.

77
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,240
But that's impossible.

78
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,860
That doesn't make any difference.

79
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,520
And the problem is the strength of the帶es.

80
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,520


81
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,560
If they don't drive the будет on the fresh, you'll never get a stand in the side of the

82
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:45,560


83
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:45,620
Yeah, right now.

84
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,020
I'm on it, while I'm ahead.

85
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:48,940
Why?

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,340
Because there's something I want them to understand.

87
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:51,740
I need them to understand.

88
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:51,740


89
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:51,740


90
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:51,740


91
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:51,740


92
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:51,740


93
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,880
We'll make them realize that.

94
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,720
Don't worry about it.

95
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,040
And that's irresistible.

96
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,980
Because, you know, everybody knows the answer to the question.

97
00:03:59,980 --> 00:03:59,980


98
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,520
Thank you.

99
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,480
Thank you.

100
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,020
Hello, you're on Car Talk.

101
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,140
Hi, this is...

102
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,000
This is PR.

103
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,520
Well, why not?

104
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,840
You could call it that.

105
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,780
Is this true?

106
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,320
Uh-huh.

107
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,320
You're absolutely right.

108
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:02,620
No.

109
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,080
Gotcha.

110
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,400
Yeah.

111
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,320
See you later.

112
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:09,860
Bye.

113
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,000
Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't care.

114
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,920
Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't care.

115
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,740
Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't care.

116
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,980
7-0, damn.

117
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,400
Is that still going?

118
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,120
Sure.

119
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,100
Well, look, yeah, I'll do this one and that.

120
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,480
Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't care.

121
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,960
Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't care.

122
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,260
Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't care.

123
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,980
Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't care.

124
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,200
7-0, damn.

125
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,940
I think it's about time you should cut it out.

126
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,900
7-0, damn.

127
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,680
Like the same low price?

128
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,480
Yes.

129
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,560
Like nicotine?

130
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,340
Yes.

131
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,900
Then for you, this is it.

132
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,540
The Soap Genius.

133
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,460
Power of Swatch.

134
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,840
Yes.

135
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,180
Yeah.

136
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,880
Just what the doctor ordered.

137
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,420
Not that bad.

138
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,800
I heard about it.

139
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,380
Oh.

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,520
Checkpoint.

141
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,120
This is the Director of Emotional Security.

142
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,940
Yes, sir.

143
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,800
Before you dispose of me,

144
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,120
could I give you a message for a friend?

145
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,460
That depends.

146
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,340
What is the message?

147
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,460
This.

148
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,700
Hello.

149
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,320
Hello.

150
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,480
This is the Director of Emotional Stability for the third oblong.

151
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,540
Goodbye.

152
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,240
Ah.

153
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,420
Hello.

154
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,640
Hello.

155
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,980
This is the Director of Emotional Stability again.

156
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:41,840
Fine.

157
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,840
That's correct.

158
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,500
Fine.

159
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,040
Got to hang up now.

160
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,680
Very well.

161
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,420
Goodbye.

162
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,060
What?

163
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,960
Here's what I think of stability.

164
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,480
4195 AD.

165
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm floating in a church outside the Earth's atmosphere.

166
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,520
Back at the Johnson Space Center, Micronesian Nationals are on alert.

167
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,620
Acting on behalf of PR News.

168
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:22,600
Two astronauts from the Space Shuttle Endeavour are opening fire in the International Space Station at this hour on a spacewalk to kill South Korean hostages released in Afghanistan.

169
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,960
On Wall Street 5295, Midwest Airlines has concluded that a number of war crimes were committed against the United States.

170
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,540
The United States has also announced that the United States is going to launch a new war against PR News.

171
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,100
War and bombing and looting and hampering.

172
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,860
An independent investigation has concluded that PR's reports are committed against civilians in Texas.

173
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,840
Investigators say Bob was more than offset by furniture and PR News in Washington.

174
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,320
Yeah.

175
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,080
It's really amazing how this light fluffy cream takes a bite out of Bob.

176
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,980
And it's right.

177
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,940
Spread it on.

178
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,660
Spread it off.

179
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,280
Try.

180
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,220
Try it.

181
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,040
.

182
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,160
.

183
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,120
.

184
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,120


185
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,060
.

186
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,060


187
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,180
.

188
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,200
.

189
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,220
.

190
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,240
.

191
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,460
.

192
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:11,520
.

193
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:11,600
.

194
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,440
.

195
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:12,440


196
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:12,460
.

197
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:12,520
.

198
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:12,780
.

199
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,280
.

200
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,460
And remember, only a few pennies at dealers everywhere.

201
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,980
And remember, get some today.

202
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,020
And remember, no other toilet you've ever used equals the truth.

203
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,000
Quiet.

204
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,820
Listen.

205
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,160
How are you, Emily?

206
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,580
My name's Emily.

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,540
Good.

208
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,260
Why?

209
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,200
I called your doc.

210
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,140
I thought maybe you were one of these fellas that makes bobs out of whatever it is.

211
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,860
No, no one do that.

212
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,460
Oh, tell us, doc.

213
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,960
Well, we were pretty sure what had happened one day when the right kind of bob went off.

214
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,620
We worked on it for years.

215
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,740
And we guessed what might happen if a giant bob were set off.

216
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,160
That's how I get it.

217
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,380
A bob being up to do what this one did and whatnot.

218
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,780
Do we have to die?

219
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,580
Yes.

220
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,160
Or not.

221
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,100
But, doc, can't you?

222
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,400
No.

223
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,540
I mean, you're a scientist and...

224
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,320
A scientist, my dear, was just another highly useless man.

225
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,060
Yeah.

226
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,820
But, doc...

227
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,240
What?

228
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,300
We're all gonna go crazy if we don't get out of here.

229
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,360
I know that, son.

230
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,080
What?

231
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,400
What?

232
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:32,800
What?

233
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,580
Why?

234
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,680
No.

235
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,620
But it was awful.

236
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,320
Yes.

237
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,440
It was awful.

238
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,180
No.

239
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
How'd you get in here?

240
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:41,940
Me?

241
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,800
I got lost.

242
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,920
This is the work of a warped mind.

243
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,900
You know, during the last few months, something new has been happening all over the country.

244
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,180
The subgenius power of sweat.

245
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,640
And you get lovely new uniforms free, too.

246
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:04,900
Good.

247
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,120
Ah, good.

248
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Why, ain't it great?

249
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,960
I love these uniforms.

250
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,940
In fact, look at the epaulettes on mine.

251
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,560
There's a picture of Bob, and then there's a little pipe motif that hangs down from the dressing.

252
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,400
It looks like I'm wearing a special insignia.

253
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,900
Yeah, well, you're new.

254
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,280
You're relatively new to the church.

255
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,660
It's special.

256
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,700
Some of us old-timers just aren't that impressed with the little Dobbs heads on the uniforms anymore.

257
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,040
Yeah, but the things they...

258
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,840
Unless they're in 3D and moving.

259
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,520
The things they can do, though, now.

260
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,060
I mean, you're not impressed with some of the newer little perks of having one?

261
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,480
Like, for instance...

262
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
Oh, I don't get the ones that have sex with you.

263
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,380
I'm not that high-ranking.

264
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,540
How about the ones that glow?

265
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,200
Do you like the ones that glow?

266
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,800
Yeah, that's...

267
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,140
Yeah, everybody goes...

268
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,840
Everybody goes through that phase.

269
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,300
The internal glow sex ones?

270
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:53,860
I think...

271
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,660
I haven't done that for at least four or five months now.

272
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,860
I've moved on to the psycho-spiritual one.

273
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,900
Oh, I see.

274
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,300
It makes the...

275
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,320
It feels like there's something rubbing inside your head.

276
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,100
Hmm.

277
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,520
And I don't particularly know what it is.

278
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,140
It feels like sandpaper, though, or something.

279
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:08,700
Hmm.

280
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,760
Have y'all figured out which show this is?

281
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,500
No.

282
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,420
From those...

283
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,860
From the first 15 minutes of titles?

284
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,340
You did how many IDs during that?

285
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:18,840
Seven?

286
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,560
Seven or eight?

287
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,180
Yeah, at least.

288
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,480
At least.

289
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,640
Yeah, this was an all...

290
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,740
I was ready to put on an all-Lee-Murr show.

291
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,160
Everything that was played was put together by the great Fernanda Nandy Lee-Murr,

292
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,440
including the guitar playing.

293
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:42,080
That sensitive little guitar piece there was the mysterious Mr. Lee-Murr

294
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,920
out there in Idaho Springs, Colorado.

295
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,220
See, Lee-Murr is not somebody that we bring to the station.

296
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,180
He's not, like, cutting the...

297
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,500
He does those things right live when we go on the air.

298
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,340
He didn't, like, suddenly start doing that.

299
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,740
Well, some of these...

300
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,140
He does those...

301
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,600
He did those, some of them, hundreds of years ago.

302
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:00,880
Yes.

303
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,920
They're called leavings or droppings.

304
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,060
And that's why there's so many hour of slack intros, because he started long before there

305
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,060
was an hour of slack.

306
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,620
Right.

307
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,360
And so we'd have to produce another, like, a show a day for the next two years to catch

308
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,260
up with all the intros he's done.

309
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,120
And that's just running five intros per show?

310
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,580
That doesn't count.

311
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:20,640
Yeah.

312
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,460
That doesn't count the PR news.

313
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,900
Plus, he has thousands more in the can in the future of the pasture that, you know,

314
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,280
that were already done but had never been done.

315
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,360
Princess Wee was concerned when she saw the lineup for this show,

316
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:40,660
and it was like Hour of Slack intro number 714 through 723.

317
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,580
I say, Dr. Williams, is this your first trip to the subgenius sanitarium?

318
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,680
Well, start dancing then.

319
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,660
Because at this sanitarium we all dance.

320
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,420
The minuet.

321
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,280
The minuet.

322
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,980
The what is it?

323
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,900
The minuet.

324
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,480
Ah.

325
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,780
Would you take my hand, fair lady?

326
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,060
I'm going to go by that stump over there and do the dance of dogs.

327
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,360
You just go and you dance with him and you just go right home.

328
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,660
I don't care.

329
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,540
I'll wait you two back in the canoe.

330
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,420
What the dobs?

331
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,340
Put your masks back on and put your hands down and keep them away from the weapons.

332
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,780
Oh, look, those midgets are singing.

333
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,120
Yes, the midgets are singing because it's your time to go back across the big water.

334
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
You know what it means.

335
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,560
Keep singing, girls.

336
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,880
They look so adorable.

337
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,480
Well, they are.

338
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,780
They are adorable in so many ways.

339
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,220
They just drip charm, don't they?

340
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,140
That's not all they're dripping.

341
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,480
Some of it is highly toxic.

342
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:48,780
What?

343
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,000
What?

344
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,300
What?

345
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,660
What?

346
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:49,660


347
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:49,660


348
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:49,660


349
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:49,660


350
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:49,660


351
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:49,660


352
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:49,660


353
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:49,660


354
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,880
More fun, more delicious excitement.

355
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,380
Listen to these girls sing.

356
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,640
Oh, the Mississippi moon is shining way up in Maine.

357
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,760
All the Eskimos are pining for this refrain.

358
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,260
Beep, beep, beep, deetle, doddle, bo, bo, be do.

359
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,800
Ooh, wah, wah.

360
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,120
Wah.

361
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,660
Beep, beep, beep, deetle, doddle, bo, bo, be do.

362
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:18,980
Yes, friends, out at Dobstown, we castrate the old men and teach them to sing like little girls in frilly ballet outfits.

363
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,540
That's what you're seeing here on screen three.

364
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:30,540
But don't forget, when we complete the process, usually, the men themselves will become very, very much smaller in size.

365
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,420
And, oh, listen, she's very tiny, isn't she?

366
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,820
Very, very tiny.

367
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,600
Beep, beep, deetle, doddle, bo, bo, be do.

368
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,800
Ooh, wah.

369
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,420
Da, do, da, dee, da, dee, do, do, dee, do.

370
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,060
Beep, beep, beep, deetle, doddle, bo, bo, be do.

371
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,780
Yes, friends.

372
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:48,960
Beep, beep, deetle, doddle, bo, bo, be do.

373
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:48,960


374
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:48,960


375
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:48,960


376
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:48,960


377
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,620
Friends, and that's the hour of slack you're listening to.

378
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,340
That's only the beginning.

379
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,360
You have been listening to the hour of slack brought to you by Quilkin's Soap.

380
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,520
And by James Underwear, cream makers of fine underwear creams across the land.

381
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,180
For those of you...

382
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,700
We're still, we're still spilling it all over right now.

383
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,160
Get them damn kids back in here.

384
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,700
You, what's your...

385
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,620
You, no, the one with the divided foreskin.

386
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,680
No, no, you.

387
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,900
I'm not talking to you.

388
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,400
Now, there's an idea.

389
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:29,760
For the church, for our religion, the church of the subgenius, we've never tried to do

390
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,960
genital mutilations as part of the religion.

391
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,180
What do you mean by that?

392
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,960
Well, I mean, you're just talking about divided foreskins.

393
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,820
I have a divided foreskin.

394
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:48,280
And no foreskin may be divided against it for long or it may not continue to survive

395
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,700
as a nation great and small.

396
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,800
How long have we been demanding genital mutilation to be part of the religion?

397
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,280
Could you at least clue him into what's been going on the last seven years?

398
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,160
Nobody touched mine.

399
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,940
I had no idea.

400
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,640
I still...

401
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,980
I had no idea.

402
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,540
I still got all the meat I was born with.

403
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,580
I'm sorry.

404
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,640
Well, actually, that's not true.

405
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:17,940
I have, I have, I am missing a little of the meat I was born with, but not out there on the end.

406
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,200
But you could always think of your meat as expanding and contracting in any general direction

407
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,320
it wants to because...

408
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,200
If I think about it, then it won't do it.

409
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,180
You know what I mean?

410
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,540
You know, self-conscious.

411
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,180
It's like, okay, I'm going to try to make my tongue stiff and then it won't, it just

412
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,760
won't do it.

413
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,240
But then if you're in math class, you're supposed to be paying attention to the formula on the

414
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,460
board.

415
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,920
Then your tongue gets all stiff.

416
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,560
That's when they call on you to come up to the board, of course.

417
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:43,860
Yes.

418
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,160
When they call you to come up to the board, you better not be bored or your formula won't

419
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,420
stick.

420
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,760
It's recital.

421
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,740
It's choppin'.

422
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,240
Is this Chopin?

423
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,200
It's Princess Whig.

424
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,640
I know who's playing.

425
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,060
I'm wondering what this piece is.

426
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,300
Is this the Anachronomy or is this a Divine?

427
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,600
No, what is it?

428
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,520
I'm so embarrassed.

429
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,200
Oh, now, don't quit just because of us, but that's okay.

430
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,860
And don't cry.

431
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,460
For crying out loud...

432
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,340
Rubinov!

433
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,440
Hand his violin!

434
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:16,700
Rubinov!

435
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:16,700


436
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,260
Rubinov!

437
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


438
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


439
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


440
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


441
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


442
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


443
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


444
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


445
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


446
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


447
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


448
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


449
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,260


450
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,100
And his divided foreskin!

451
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,280
Oh, this is that old band, ESO.

452
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,420
What?

453
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,260
That's Michelle George on the violin.

454
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,280
I?

455
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,120
Remember?

456
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,320
Those were the days, boy.

457
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,060
This is very, very, very, very nice.

458
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,820
What is this?

459
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,660
It's some cartoon music, I believe.

460
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,360
Leopold?

461
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,960
Leopold?

462
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,740
Leopold?

463
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:42,960
Shh!

464
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,600
Leopold?

465
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,160
Mama, I think that's it.

466
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,240
Don't cry.

467
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,020
What do we have?

468
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,580
Are we birds?

469
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,740
What are we?

470
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,680
I don't know.

471
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,340
We're birds who have accents.

472
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,180
This is some other midgets, I believe, yeah?

473
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,500
These are all mini folk?

474
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,620
And that wraps up another subgenius revival here in Cleveland, Ohio.

475
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,920
And as you can tell, it's been performed on a miniature scale from ten to seven.

476
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,840
Each one of these tiny lovelies live in your neighborhood and work in various places that

477
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,320
can't be described right now.

478
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,840
Now, there's another idea.

479
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:36,180
Kids, like DIV 2.0, the miniature Disney Devo group, we could have like a kids subgenius

480
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,240
show that was like the little hour of Slack with little kid.

481
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,400
We'll have a little kid, you know, little Dave and little Wee.

482
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,860
Wee-Wee, they'd call it.

483
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,580
Wee-Wee-Wee-Wee.

484
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,060
Yes.

485
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,300
And old dude.

486
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,440
I would be the doo-doo, you see.

487
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,140
I love it.

488
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,760
I love the idea, but I think you should go for real, you know, Lilliputians.

489
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,420
Not for kids.

490
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,540
Well, right.

491
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,600
We could get real kids.

492
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,400
No, no, no, no.

493
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,940
I mean real Lilliputians, people who are too small for their britches, so to speak.

494
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,160
Little, because if, all right, I give up the idea, then you look so depressed about it.

495
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,380
Well, I don't think the government will let us use those experimental people yet.

496
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,180
Well, they're exploiting them in so many different ways, why can't we get our mitts into it?

497
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,220
It would be so pretty.

498
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,400
It would be so beautiful.

499
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,180
Just think of it.

500
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,000
All of them singing together and us in front.

501
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:30,740
There's a movie called Attack of the Puppet People where a mad scientist shrinks people

502
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,720
down and makes them his living dolls because he's lonesome.

503
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,020
Was it like in The Bride of Frankenstein where they were in the little bell jar?

504
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,640
Sort of like that, but Dr. Pretorius did that just out of sheer perversity and perversion.

505
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,160
He probably used them for sex.

506
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,380
That's what I thought.

507
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,080
And made them have sex in front of him while he took pictures.

508
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,700
He had a little king and a little queen and a little bishop.

509
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,800
The king would jump out of his test tube and crawl into the test tube with the queen and the bishop would just go nuts.

510
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,300
Oh my God.

511
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,600
Screaming and yelling. Afraid that someone somewhere might be having fun.

512
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh my God.

513
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:14,340
Remember kids, if you're bashing your bishop tonight, it could cause injury to your eyesight.

514
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,580
And you could also dwarf yourself for the rest of your lives.

515
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,040
So stay out of trouble and have good luck from now on.

516
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,740
What?

517
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:22,880
Get that off me.

518
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,140
Great Caesar's Ghost.

519
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,540
Good night.

520
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,340
I wanted to make sure that...

521
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,700
The Soul Genius.

522
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,680
Power of Swatch.

523
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,520
The greatest entertainers in America.

524
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:40,960
Yes.

525
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,860
No.

526
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,320
Well, that's all.

527
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:44,400
What's that?

528
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,000
What next?

529
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,620
Checkpoint.

530
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,860
Before you dispose of me, could I give you a message for a friend?

531
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,180
That depends.

532
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,080
What is the message?

533
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,220
This.

534
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,440
Hello?

535
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,260
Hello.

536
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,620
This is the Director of Emotional Security.

537
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,640
Bye.

538
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,840
Oh.

539
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:09,820


540
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,880
Oh.

541
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,780
Oh.

542
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:12,980
Oh.

543
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,880
Oh.

544
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:13,880


545
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:13,940
Oh.

546
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,300


547
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,300


548
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,300


549
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,300


550
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,300


551
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,300


552
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,820
Hello?

553
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,760
Hello.

554
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,040
This is the Director of Emotional Stability for the third oblong.

555
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,760
Fine.

556
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,740
That's correct.

557
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,420
Fine.

558
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,000
Got to hang up now.

559
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,760
Goodbye.

560
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,080
Hello?

561
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,080
Hello.

562
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,100
This is the Director of Emotional Stability again.

563
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,540
Here's what I think of stability.

564
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,040
What?

565
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,960
Oh.

566
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,140
Oh.

567
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,280
Oh.

568
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


569
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


570
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


571
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


572
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


573
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


574
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


575
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


576
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


577
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


578
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


579
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,860
Oh.

580
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,360
Oh.

581
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,520
Hope so.

582
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,420
Who?

583
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,620
Who is that?

584
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,440
Oh, my God.

585
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,440


586
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,440


587
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,440


588
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,440


589
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,440


590
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,440


591
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,440


592
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,440


593
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:53,860
Younger brother?

594
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:53,860


595
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:53,860


596
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,300
Two more days, obscure if right?

597
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,760
Lea.

598
00:21:59,760 --> 00:21:59,760


599
00:21:59,760 --> 00:21:59,760


600
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,320
Hi, meanwhile, I am the new cookies and bread collector.

601
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:14,260
Are these the usual yeti spores you bring me, or is there something different about

602
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,220
about it, Teresa. Well, there's no such

603
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,100
thing as a usual yeti

604
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,480
spore, now is there?

605
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,240
They're all unusual because they're all

606
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,520
individuals. Yes.

607
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,920
Just don't tase me, bro.

608
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,400
That's all I ask. Don't tase me, bro.

609
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:28,600
Don't tase me, bro.

610
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,700
Would you tase me,

611
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,860
my brother? Casually

612
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,420
or with alacrity?

613
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,820
Would you like me to tase you here or there?

614
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,140
Figaro far, figaro...

615
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,060
Oh, tase me a little further down.

616
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,880
To the right.

617
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,800
Oh, that's my right?

618
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,700
I'm sorry. Oh, tase me

619
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,980
more, brother. Ah, it feels good, doesn't it?

620
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,280
Oh, tase me, my brother.

621
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,620
Now, soon you'll be ready for electroshock

622
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,620
therapy. You are tasing!

623
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,140
Into your frontal lobes.

624
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,000
Now, I was telling you on the way over here about a subgenius

625
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,720
who loves electroshock

626
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
therapy. He does?

627
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,040
Yes.

628
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,660
He decided that it really

629
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,500
helped him and he went back for more.

630
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,680
And he developed a

631
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,480
third tongue as well as a third...

632
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,320
well, a second tongue.

633
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,040
An internal learning...

634
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,220
an extra tongue sprang up.

635
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,640
Well, he certainly has good taste, I'll say that.

636
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,960
He was growing Photoshop

637
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,700
plug-ins on his tongue.

638
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,300
That's how mutated

639
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,420
he got. And he's getting

640
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,400
worse, isn't he? No, no, it's better

641
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,380
and better. He got really good. He knew he learned

642
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,500
how to use all of them. Oh, he got good at it.

643
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,240
Yeah, he can stick a

644
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
dob's head into any piece of evidence.

645
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,020
And any orifice works

646
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,240
as a space... And you know,

647
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,100
since the Weekly World News closed

648
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,620
down and seized publication,

649
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,220
there's just, there's no

650
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,980
dependable source for news anymore.

651
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,040
No, we want to see a three-headed

652
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,940
baby boy. You want to see one. Right,

653
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,100
exactly. You got to see the line of the

654
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,160
grocery store. It left a void

655
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,180
in my, in yours.

656
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,760
I had wanted to be the

657
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,880
Photoshop artist for Weekly

658
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,440
World News and now my dream will never be

659
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,780
realized. I want to be the

660
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,840
voided three-headed baby boy.

661
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,980
I want to sing.

662
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,260
To the ringworm and the other bacteria.

663
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,180
I wanted to do

664
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,920
more than I was supposed to, I guess.

665
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,800
Hey, don't tase me, bro.

666
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,020
If I only could have been

667
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,980
He's tasing me.

668
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,880
Teacher, he's tasing me.

669
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,960
Make him stop tasing me.

670
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,860
He's mocking his southern accent.

671
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,960
Tase, it sounds like teasing,

672
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,060
you see. Oh, thanks

673
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,080
for explaining that to our subgenius

674
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
audience. Well, I figured they would

675
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,120
need the clue.

676
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,080
Here's a hint.

677
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,200
Filling the air with a pandemonium of vibrant jungle rhythm.

678
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,980
Try to solve this problem yourself.

679
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,060
Oh, here's those natives,

680
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,540
the jungle natives in this

681
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,080
non-PC cartoon.

682
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,960
No, no, now they're back to the little baby

683
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,600
birds who have German accents.

684
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,900
Now, no, no, no, now, now

685
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,000
they're back to the car salesman with no

686
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,560
eyes and those

687
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,260
glowing things around their

688
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,720
foreheads.

689
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,920
There's a really cool tune coming up here.

690
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,080
They do a version of She's Coming Around the Mountain.

691
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,240
That's...

692
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,220
Here it goes.

693
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,680
That's sweet Georgia Brown.

694
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,140
Pretty Bob.

695
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,940
He's a baby.

696
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,940
Georgia Brown.

697
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,960
Georgia Brown.

698
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,080


699
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:36,980
Georgia Brown.

700
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,820
Georgia Brown.

701
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,240
Georgia Playback.

702
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,800
Georgia Main forces.

703
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,840
Sweet Georgia Brown.

704
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,040
That was incredible.

705
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,560
I've never seen a box like that

706
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,160
in my life.

707
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,560
You say it comes from Mahoganyland?

708
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,760
It's from the island of Pingo Pongo.

709
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:24,760
I've never been there myself, but they say there's skull-shaped rocks there and people with large webbed feet.

710
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,200
Right, this is the indigenous music of Skull Island.

711
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,540
This, actually, you won't hear this, you won't see this one on TV anymore.

712
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,300
All good things must come to an end.

713
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,320
Now, is this a man speaking or the pelican guy?

714
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,860
The strains of the native music still lingering in the air.

715
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,320
We say farewell to this isle of enchantment as the sun sinks slowly in the west.

716
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,880
As the sun sinks slowly in the west.

717
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,360
As the sun sinks...

718
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,640
Now, boss?

719
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,260
Yeah, now.

720
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,740
Oh, they got me!

721
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,200
Something has happened in the motorcade route.

722
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,900
I left the motorcar and the car is speeding up and slowing...

723
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,220
The car...

724
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
The car has hit the curb and is going off onto the sidewalk.

725
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,260
The motorcade is going under the triple underpass.

726
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,940
Four people have been struck by the cars and hit the motorcade at the side of the road.

727
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,740
It's like the sun's going down on me.

728
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,680
I would like to remind you of the beef hanging over our heads.

729
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,900
It's a common beef among the people of this land.

730
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,140
They want more than they got, they got less than they want.

731
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,720
They keep singing, but they won't give up.

732
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,500
I don't know why.

733
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,900
Yeah, what is that?

734
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,260
I don't know what it is.

735
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,740
I don't know if I want to know what it is.

736
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,060
Look at the shape.

737
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,460
It's clearly made for putting in someone's third eye.

738
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,320
What is the part of the...

739
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,860
What is the part of the pineal gland?

740
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,160
I don't know.

741
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,740
Or forcing it into their foreheads and making them do things they must not do.

742
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,840
Makes no sense at all.

743
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,240
No, not especially because some of them turn blue.

744
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,480
Actually like a blue grape or a thing.

745
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,660
And then after that there are so many psychic powers you can't control them.

746
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,920
You want to control them, don't you?

747
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,700
Oh, yes.

748
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,180
Yes, I do too.

749
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
I can hardly wait.

750
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,240
I dream of it every night.

751
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,020
I think of the different ways I'm going to come.

752
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:27,200
You have to go through a lot of courses in Dobstown before you can learn whiff reading and astral projection.

753
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:37,000
Where we project the sole of the boot is projected against your ass.

754
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,900
And that is what we astral projection on.

755
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:39,900


756
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,340
Yes.

757
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,400
The sole striking.

758
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,900
Sole ass kicking.

759
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,040
Ass kicking, yes.

760
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:53,860
As Dr. Drummond designed it to be practiced by the Frop Monastery nunks in Monk Town.

761
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,060
Man, I always thought that was the sole of the shoe, like S-O-U-L.

762
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,840
Well, the sole has no shoe as we know it.

763
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,380
No, actually it's technically the sole.

764
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,520
It is not immortal or immortally incarnated.

765
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,120
The seat of the subgenius sole is actually in the sole of the foot.

766
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,400
Right.

767
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,600
It sounds like a pun.

768
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,100
No.

769
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,100
It just happens to be that the sole is in the sole.

770
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,600
Yes.

771
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,420
But that's a coincidence of spelling.

772
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,060
It's not a pun or anything.

773
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,160
Yes, yes.

774
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,680
But the seat of the sole is in the astral realm, is it not, Mr. Nurner?

775
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,220
And this is the...

776
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,820
Ah, taste that slack.

777
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,660
Yummy, yummy slack.

778
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:34,780
I'm having a big mug.

779
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,500
We brought a mug of slack up here.

780
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,500
We're not supposed to have food in the studio and we don't.

781
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,060
But slack...

782
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,460
But slack.

783
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,360
You can bring in...

784
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,540
They want you to have slack in the studio, so we brought a big manly mug of slack to

785
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,220
smack off of.

786
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,380
Mine tastes like varnish.

787
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,860
Don't just slurp that slack, friend.

788
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,660
Slurp the hell out of it.

789
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,620
Especially you.

790
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,780
Slurp the heel out of the sole where your sole resides.

791
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,280
Yes.

792
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,300
I don't think any more erudite or succinct passage.

793
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,600
Have ever been read on this show.

794
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,220
Because what does all that mummikry have to do with Bob, huh?

795
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:15,800
Mummikry?

796
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,940
What is that...

797
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,340
Where does Bob come into that?

798
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:18,880
He don't.

799
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,500
It doesn't matter.

800
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,540
So that's silly stuff.

801
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,260
That's kid stuff.

802
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,040
Crazy stuff.

803
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,380
Yeah.

804
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,200
Yeah.

805
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,840
We're interested in the ways, the teachings of that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs, who taught us

806
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,740
how to pull the wool over our own eyes and relax in the safety of our own delusions.

807
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,280
We're still blind, but at least there are hours.

808
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,280


809
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:48,840
And not those of the conspiracy who would delude you into buying their brand of cigarettes,

810
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,840
their brand of booze.

811
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,640
Friends, all Bob's trying to sell you is his brand of cigarettes, his brand of booze.

812
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,620
And you know why it's better?

813
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,480
Because he's selling it.

814
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,740
That's it.

815
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,380
You know why you're better than the others?

816
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,240
Just because.

817
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,440
Just because.

818
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,120
That's why.

819
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,520
It's not because you're smarter.

820
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,260
We know that.

821
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,860
You just are.

822
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,200
It's not because you're better looking.

823
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,220
That's pretty obvious.

824
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,180
Just because.

825
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,240
If you're just plain better, just because.

826
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,280
That's what this religion is all about.

827
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:26,580
Telling you what you need to know, but more than that, what you want to know.

828
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,320
You don't have to be what you think you are.

829
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,900
As Philo said, you can be what you want.

830
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,920
He didn't say you can be what you want.

831
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,120
What?

832
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,500
He said you can be what you want.

833
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


834
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


835
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


836
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


837
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


838
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


839
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


840
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


841
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


842
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


843
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


844
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


845
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


846
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


847
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


848
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


849
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,500


850
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,180
You won't.

851
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,340
You won't.

852
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,080
What you will not be.

853
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,380
That's what you can be.

854
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,340
If you'll just believe.

855
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,340
If anything, if Jesus said anything is possible to those who will believe.

856
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,380
And that nothing is more true than that statement.

857
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,500
I believe.

858
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,540
Should we check out what you've just said in any way or must we take it on face value?

859
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:08,060
Now, we're not going to force you to lock step with Bob like some little good German Nazi.

860
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,800
No, you don't have to.

861
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,660
Bob's not going to tell you what to think.

862
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,240
He's just going to tell you how to think.

863
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:13,680
That's all.

864
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,420
Oh.

865
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,300
You know.

866
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,800
This makes much more sense now.

867
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,660
I can actually read the last line.

868
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,960
As Bob said, you'll pay to know what you really think.

869
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,340
And see how people do that.

870
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,600
They subscribe to the magazines that are going to tell them what they already want to believe.

871
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,500
They're going to listen to the right-wing media.

872
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:45,340
They're going to listen to the left-wing talk shows that tell them what they want to hear.

873
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,140
Such as that they're better than everybody else just because.

874
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,120
Yes, sirree, Bob.

875
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:58,760
Now, see, Rush Limbaugh will go, my listeners are the upper 5% because we're more logical.

876
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:08,500
And the Air America people will go, oh, no, we're right because we're nice and kind.

877
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:08,660
And the Air America people will go, oh, no, we're right because we're nicer.

878
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,780
But the subgeniuses won't tell you why you're better or why you're right just because.

879
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,520
It's just because you're a subgenius.

880
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,660
That's the only reason.

881
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,720
Because you swallowed what Bob stuck it out and he pointed that finger.

882
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,060
You sucked it, the finger.

883
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,580
And that settles it.

884
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,200
You may have sucked that finger like a hyperventilated breast.

885
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,080
Actually, what Bob said was.

886
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,820
If you do this too often.

887
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:37,520
Don't.

888
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,540
Don't suck the finger.

889
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,160
You go where the finger's pointing.

890
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,520
But most people suck the finger.

891
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,540
They don't go where Bob's pointing.

892
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,280
They go, look, there's Bob's finger.

893
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,200
I guess I better suck on that thing.

894
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:57,680
Bob's going, look, there's free money, free slack, all the happiness, the appreciation of everything you've ever had.

895
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,600
Life itself will be wonderful if you look where I'm pointing.

896
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,180
And they go, Bob's finger is so nearby.

897
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,420
And candy-like.

898
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,480
And shiny and candy-like.

899
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,100
Shiny, sweet, candy-like looking.

900
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:18,540
Let's suck Bob's finger rather than look at that mountain of free everything that he's trying to point out to us.

901
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,580
Friends, are you one of them suckers?

902
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
Are you an eye sucker?

903
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,180
A finger sucker.

904
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,000
A finger sucker?

905
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,140
What if that ain't his finger, friend?

906
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,400
Are you a direction sucker?

907
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,260
What if that's his smelly old toe?

908
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,580
What if that's his sort of growth coming out of the top of his head that's disguised?

909
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,440
With little bits of schmata from socks under his toenails.

910
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:38,460
His mouth.

911
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:38,460


912
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,180
Have you ever noticed that hair coming out from under Bob's toenails when you're sucking on his toenail?

913
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,800
Have you ever noticed that tear in that order?

914
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,220
That's from his socks.

915
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,000
Those cheap socks he wears.

916
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,180
But you don't care because you're a slavish religious nut, aren't you?

917
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,560
So you're a Bobby, right?

918
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,300
I don't have bad dreams now.

919
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,020
You're a Bobby.

920
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,940
You're not a student of Bob's works.

921
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,500
You're not reading and memorizing the pre-scriptures or the book of the subgenius, no.

922
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,580
No, you're just a Bobby.

923
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,760
You want to wear the shirt so people go, oh look, he knows what's cool.

924
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,120
He's got Bob on his shirt so therefore he must be cool.

925
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,100
That's a gimme, Bob.

926
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,920
That's all you are.

927
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,340
I see you.

928
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,620
I'm up here where I can see you people.

929
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,240
I'm in discernment.

930
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,000
Now I know that most of you, you don't even really believe in Bob.

931
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,100
Do you?

932
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,700
Do you?

933
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,560
They don't really believe in Bob because he's too good to be true.

934
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,960
Can't be a Bob.

935
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,560
Nothing could be the same.

936
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:36,820
He's not that wonderful.

937
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,160
Well, in my case...

938
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,880
No pipe smoke could smell so inviting.

939
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,640
No grin could be so confident.

940
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,240
So this must be a clip art.

941
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,640
That's all.

942
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,660
He's just a fake.

943
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,760
He's a drawing.

944
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,660
There's no real Bob.

945
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,420
Look, he doesn't even have a body.

946
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,100
He's just a head.

947
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,100
That ain't a perv.

948
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,920
There's no real Bob.

949
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,480
Well, that's what disturbs me a lot.

950
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,420
They can't believe it because it's too good.

951
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:05,800
The reason I don't believe in Bob is because everything I've seen shows Bob is merely a

952
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,340
disconnected head, which frightens the hell out of me.

953
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,100
No, friend!

954
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,980
The only reason you shouldn't believe in Bob is because he told you not to believe in him.

955
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,880
He's not going to tell me, oh, you don't believe in me and I believe in you.

956
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,540
I don't believe in Bob only because he told me not to.

957
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,460
Oh.

958
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,280
He told me that's why I don't believe in him.

959
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,600
Because he said, don't you believe in me.

960
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,340
I want you to believe in the God that don't want you to believe in it.

961
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,120
What an ensemble.

962
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,840
What a pudding.

963
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,220
What a divine request.

964
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,620
Get off my foot!

965
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,460
Oh, sorry.

966
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,040
He was there.

967
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:42,540
He was there, friends, where you weren't and you can't go because he's Bob.

968
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,540
Who are you?

969
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,280
Are you Bob?

970
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,220
Well, your name might be Bob.

971
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,800
It's the most common name in the English language.

972
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,840
Yeah, Bob spelled backwards is still Bob.

973
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,560
Hey, for every stank I got a new joke for you.

974
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,340
Bob, damn it.

975
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,520
My friend, that's a funny joke and you're a true subgenius.

976
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,020
You're definitely underneath Bob.

977
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:11,660
You're underneath your own genius and also under an IQ of 139 and a half.

978
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:21,840
You've been left in the cold by an angry God with no teeth and a full cycle and set

979
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,500
up in sick.

980
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,040
Damn you.

981
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,600
But Bob's still got all his teeth, friends.

982
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:32,240
You have been left as a marked man or woman, whatever the .

983
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,440
Bob's no toothless God.

984
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,920
Bob is no toothless God.

985
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,860
He's got a fine set of choppers.

986
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,440
He's ready to eat the hell out of the next thing that crosses his plate.

987
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,100
Are you going to be his next burger?

988
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,880
Not me.

989
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,440
I would.

990
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,040
I don't want to be Bob's next burger.

991
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,660
You will be if he wants you.

992
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,740
If he wants you, you will be, young lady.

993
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,100
If Bob wants you to do something, you're going to do it.

994
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,820
I'll be the pickle on the burger.

995
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,420
He won't be the pickle on the burger.

996
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,600
I don't even have to tell you.

997
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:13,360
You'll just do it automatically because what Bob wants, and I mean wants, not won'ts, but

998
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,140
Bob wants just happens to be what's going to happen anyway.

999
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,960
You can't get around that.

1000
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,340
You can't get over it, but you can live under it.

1001
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,420
You can live under Bob.

1002
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,120
You can live under Bob's dominion.

1003
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,080
Just quit thinking for yourself and think for Bob.

1004
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,300
He doesn't think.

1005
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,900
He's the truest subgenius.

1006
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,820
There's not a single real brain cell.

1007
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,020
The pipe's tap roots have devoured all of the original brain cells of Bob.

1008
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,800
Nothing in there but Bob's pipe, tap roots, and his love.

1009
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,540
And he loves you.

1010
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,000
Bob loves you, and the pipe loves you.

1011
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,940
Unless you're a chicken.

1012
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,860
That's true.

1013
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:02,360
The chicken is the one creature that Bob says cannot return your love.

1014
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:09,440
All other creatures will return Bob's love, and he has made love to almost all the animals

1015
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,280
of the world.

1016
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,000
Now, may I ask?

1017
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,700
One of each.

1018
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,780
I mean, not all the animals, especially when you get the insects.

1019
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,040
It's just ridiculous.

1020
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,880
Well, ridiculous is kind of a happy way of describing the results.

1021
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,340
But the whales, of course.

1022
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,940
He's most famous for futtering whales.

1023
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,360
And he doesn't even have a proboscis.

1024
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,340
What do they call those in the river?

1025
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,320
The rectal cartilage.

1026
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,160
He doesn't have one.

1027
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,860
He has just a regular human proboscis there.

1028
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,860
And yet he made love with the cetans.

1029
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,200
Not the shetans or the sheetans, of course, but the cetans.

1030
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,760
So you said, anyway.

1031
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,760
And the cephalopods.

1032
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,320
What a man.

1033
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,140
The arthropods.

1034
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,680
Bob has his wick in many kingdoms of the animal kingdom.

1035
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,700
Arthritic arthropods.

1036
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,560
Many phyla.

1037
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,800
And microcephalopods.

1038
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,900
And phyla has had a few.

1039
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,440
Cephalopods.

1040
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,540
He has tried to keep up with Bob, but you know, trying to keep up with the Dobbses.

1041
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,960
Think of that.

1042
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,400
Can I ask you a question, Stang?

1043
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,320
Why will a chicken not return the love of Dobbs?

1044
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,560
I don't know.

1045
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,140
He has pleasured chickens.

1046
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,720
He has tried.

1047
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,400
But he says that they are the one animal that cannot return your love.

1048
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,320
But he never culminated the act.

1049
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:31,420
And that's one reason why you shouldn't feel too bad about eating chickens and having them raised in horrible frankincense.

1050
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,160
Because they don't want to have sex with us.

1051
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,840
They don't want to.

1052
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,520
Therefore, we should eat them.

1053
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,440
They can't return your love.

1054
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,680
French fries and so forth.

1055
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:38,840
Yeah.

1056
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,180
And also, now this is another thing to think about.

1057
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,560
There was an ad.

1058
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,400
Does this apply to women, too?

1059
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:48,100
You're not forgetting the age of giant birds now, are you, Dave?

1060
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,300
We talked about that last time.

1061
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,240
I am purposely forgetting the age of giant birds because who wants to return to the age of giant birds?

1062
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:54,800
Right.

1063
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,280
So to speak.

1064
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,660
So we still got, we have to eat chickens for another five million years to get payback.

1065
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,240
Right.

1066
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,200
Because they ate our ancestors.

1067
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,440
Right.

1068
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:02,800
That's true.

1069
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,020
It is karma.

1070
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,060
We might have been a superior.

1071
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,800
But nothing that has happened might have happened if only those giant chickens had not eaten certain of our ancestors.

1072
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,640
But just think, they never developed the way they should have.

1073
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,100
They never took the helmsmanship of the earth, so to speak.

1074
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:25,440
Actually, how do we know they didn't evolve a super civilization in their last 100,000 years and leave the planet?

1075
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,880
Like the Yeti did.

1076
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,160
Perhaps this is it.

1077
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,560
The mighty Yeti left the planet, mostly.

1078
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,800
And left these spores, which we're examining right now.

1079
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,420
And some footprints and some home movies.

1080
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,980
Now these spores, you've got different categories and labels here.

1081
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,100
And amateur magazines.

1082
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:41,700
Yeah.

1083
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,200
Well, the magazines are in one place.

1084
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,580
About Bigfoots and stuff.

1085
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,840
So you have them all alphabetically organized and arranged here.

1086
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,240
What is this one right here?

1087
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:58,460
That one is actually about all hoaxes, not just Bigfoot, but hoaxes we've known and loved.

1088
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,140
Crop circles.

1089
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:01,700
Christianity.

1090
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,000
So you're saying this picture isn't real?

1091
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,620
Capitalism.

1092
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,960
All the great hoaxes of modern and ancient world.

1093
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,040
This picture of this lady here with this growing out of her head is not real, then.

1094
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,280
This is part of the hoax of?

1095
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,360
Oh, no.

1096
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,380
That's a real hoax.

1097
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,620
It's not one of Bob's pretend hoaxes.

1098
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,760
I mean, that gets confusing and kind of postmodernist.

1099
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,720
Because you got your type A hoax.

1100
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,020
Just your straight lake monster made with a robot or a submarine.

1101
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,980
Or your Bigfoot track made with Uncle Bob's fake Bigfoot board.

1102
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,500
But then you got your fake hoaxes.

1103
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:52,640
Like when J.R. Bob Dobbs was popularly voted fraud of the century by Time Magazine's online poll in 2000.

1104
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,560
It was actually a hoax hoax.

1105
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,900
Well, it was a misspelling, too.

1106
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,300
Because I have to admit, some subgeniuses voted more than once.

1107
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:14,560
And I think Pope Phil Monty in England kept voting repeatedly until we passed Geraldo Rivera, who was the runner-up most hated fraud of the century.

1108
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,600
Yeah, you could probably get any petition passed to him.

1109
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,860
And nobody really cared about Geraldo.

1110
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:27,640
It was a discordian who was jealous of us, was trying to make sure that J.R. Bob Dobbs didn't get that honor.

1111
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:27,880
Yeah.

1112
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:27,880


1113
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:33,820
And I think it was because of the misspelling, afraid of the sanctuary.

1114
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,120
Oh.

1115
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:41,380
And so they filled in the lines themselves and they created this whole, it's just the way they always create media.

1116
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,980
The creation of consensus. Haven't you ever...

1117
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,320
That's what we're doing right now, baby.

1118
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,580
Right. We're making stuff up and you're going to believe it in the morning, kids.

1119
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,080
You pay to know what you really think. Bob said it.

1120
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,480
Yep.

1121
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,440
I smoked it, that settles it.

1122
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,580
Believe me out of it.

1123
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,880
I fought it.

1124
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,300
I forked my foreskin for him. And so I'm a child of Bob.

1125
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,040
I'm a child in Bob's love.

1126
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,980
You were a child in Bob's love.

1127
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,080
And I hate everyone who is not.

1128
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,300
Now that was just forked up.

1129
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:18,220
I had an employer who was a Christian who would tell me that he was a child of Bob and dwell... or God.

1130
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,720
He didn't say Bob. He said he was a Christian, so he said God.

1131
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,440
Well, he had a DVS.

1132
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,440
He said he lived in God's love and he was indwelling in God's love.

1133
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,880
And then he would turn around and say the most nasty, hateful, racist, bigoted crap.

1134
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:38,100
That same guy asked me if I would be his junior partner and I thought to myself, oh, you're right.

1135
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,200
I said, oh, no, no, I think I'm going to rather be a house husband and raise my kids.

1136
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,140
I thought he wanted to...

1137
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:48,960
And then I proceeded to go to work for J.R. Bob Dobbs, who is not a hypocrite in his hate.

1138
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,360
When he hates, he admits it. In fact, it's hate squared. It's the hate of hate.

1139
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:59,800
He has no malice left in his heart because he used it all up on the hate of hate. Hate squared.

1140
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,280
Well, this hate created in you, are you sure it's not because of the glands that he...

1141
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,240
He doesn't know how to love because his glands don't function.

1142
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,060
Not normally.

1143
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,340
He knows how to hate.

1144
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,400
They do function hyper-normally.

1145
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:14,780
And what he hates most is hate. In fact, he would kill the haters.

1146
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,140
If he only...

1147
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:21,820
It's the old death to all fanatics, you might say, only not meant as a joke.

1148
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,340
Well, why do they hate?

1149
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,580
Why do they want to do that? I don't understand.

1150
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,300
I don't know either because we're the fanatics, right?

1151
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,160
We're the Bob fanatics. Is he going to kill us because we're fanatics for him?

1152
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:34,960
I hope not.

1153
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:42,360
I think he will. As a matter of fact, I think that's just exactly what Mr. J.R. Bob Dobbs had in mind when he started the Church and Stuff Genius.

1154
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:52,700
He was going to round up all the dunderheads and knuckleheads and to get them all in one place and then make fun of them, mock them, and kill them.

1155
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,320
Mimicry.

1156
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,700
And that was going to be X-Day 1998.

1157
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:04,960
And in the last minute, Philo prevented the clenching of the deal and the closing of the butt cheek.

1158
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,160
Well, yeah, when you say that automatically.

1159
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:21,380
The kissing of the clenched cheek, which he did not actually allow the lips of the kisser to come in exact contact, molecular contact,

1160
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:29,520
with the buttocks of the kissee. Did I say kissee when I meant kisser in the beginning?

1161
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,000
The kissee is the buttock itself.

1162
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:36,420
The kisser is the one with the lip and the kissee is the one with the buttock.

1163
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:43,800
And this is where Bob was able to give the illusion, as Philo put it,

1164
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,460
Of a buffer.

1165
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,780
of a kiss placed upon the skin of the buttock.

1166
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,360
But in actuality, it was only the...

1167
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,060
simulacrum of the touching of the lip to the skin.

1168
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:02,860
And he never actually did the final kiss on the fundament of Satan.

1169
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,360
Bob cheated at the last minute and he had his fingers crossed when he did his Masonic pledge, you see.

1170
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:15,500
And that's why Bob was able to infiltrate the conspiracy, learn their secrets, and now he's going to share them with you.

1171
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,520
Of course, we can't share all of Bob's money-making prosperity secrets with everybody.

1172
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,760
That would wreck it for us and for you.

1173
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:28,780
But if you will cleave to Bob and listen to this radio station faithfully,

1174
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,540
and you know how to do what's right at subgenius.com.

1175
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,180
You understand cleavage, don't you?

1176
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,500
Well, that's right. I knew you did!

1177
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,660
I saw you! I knew you!

1178
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:44,680
When I saw you, I thought to myself, now there's a person that knows their cleavage.

1179
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,880
And they're going to cleave unto Bob.

1180
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,500
And they're going to give unto Bob that which is rightfully his.

1181
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:50,500


1182
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,380
And they're going to cleave unto Bob that which is rightfully Bob's due.

1183
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:56,840
Now, what is the random psychopathic tithe for each individual required under conception?

1184
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,460
By the church of the subgenius.

1185
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:06,960
We can't actually give figures on this non-profit public supported radio airwave.

1186
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,060
Can we give a grand illusion perhaps to it?

1187
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,600
We can tell people that if they need more information about the Hour Slack, Church of the Subgenius,

1188
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,840
they can go to subgenius.com on the internet.

1189
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,680
Now, there's no O in subgenius, but there is in .com.

1190
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:27,560
In fact, there are two, depending on how you do, if you write out the dot, D-O-T.

1191
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,400
And the C-O, and more D-O-T, C-O-M.

1192
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,180
Yeah, then there's two dots in .com.

1193
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,080
Two dots and two Os.

1194
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:38,880
But how do we prescribe against their perhaps going mad after reading these?

1195
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:46,440
I always, well, what I usually do is when I'm in the doctor's office, I grab just one sheet off her prescription pad,

1196
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,780
and then you go over to the Friendly Institute.

1197
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,200
You go to the print shop and have all made you want.

1198
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,640
You mean to tell me, wait a minute.

1199
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,200
And you can write your own prescription, kids.

1200
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,700
That's what Bob's all about.

1201
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:00,100
Write your own prescription for your own medicine.

1202
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,560
Be your own pharmacist.

1203
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,520
Be your own doctor.

1204
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:07,580
And if they pee test you, then take the pee.

1205
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,480
And the pain.

1206
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:16,000
Friends, Bob cares about you, and he wants you to do what's right.

1207
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,500
Not just for him, but for yourself.

1208
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:23,440
Because how are you going to help Bob if he has to help you?

1209
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:28,100
See, he don't want you using him as a crutch.

1210
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,620
He wants to use you as a crutch.

1211
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,000
See how this is different from the other religions?

1212
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,740
It's the crutch of the subgenius, you could say.

1213
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,460
Don't let that smelly, smelly membrane get in your way.

1214
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:41,960
Let Bob lean on you.

1215
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,840
Lean. Lean.

1216
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,540
Let him lean on you.

1217
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:46,640
See?

1218
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,300
You're going to get used to it.

1219
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:53,880
When you get to be a living avatar of slack, then you can be the one that leans on the next guy.

1220
00:49:54,620 --> 00:50:05,580
But first you're going to have to, you know, have your immaculation, religion, vision of God and the aliens and the future and so forth.

1221
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,360
Then you can start your own religion.

1222
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:12,620
But first you've got to undergo the tortures of hell and the brain damage.

1223
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,520
And the long sleepless nights.

1224
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,480
Where you pray and pray and pray for your boss to fire.

1225
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:27,060
Ain't it a great day when you finally get fired and you say to yourself, it wasn't because I was lazy.

1226
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,280
I didn't quit.

1227
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,980
They fired me.

1228
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,060
I can't help it.

1229
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:35,580
It's not my fault if I have to go on the dole and let the conspiracy support me.

1230
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,400
I put in a lot of social security.

1231
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,960
I'll let them, I'll coast for a while.

1232
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,660
And see, it says here, farmer.

1233
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,520
It says, stringmeister.

1234
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,460
And it also says, stone and metal smith.

1235
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:48,760
I don't know.

1236
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,460
When did you do, what kind of work were you doing as a stone and metal smith?

1237
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,820
What are you talking about?

1238
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,660
Smiths and stoners?

1239
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,100
What?

1240
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:57,220
Huh?

1241
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,300
I'm just looking through your.

1242
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,780
Look, not everybody names smith.

1243
00:50:59,800 --> 00:50:59,980
Oh, no.

1244
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,780
This is the wrong, this is the wrong form.

1245
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,920
I was looking at your appropriation.

1246
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,680
Many of the smiths are teetotalers.

1247
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,100
Oh, they are?

1248
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,440
Total teetotalers.

1249
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,840
Well, not many.

1250
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,760
Actually, only one that I can think of.

1251
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,200
Anything?

1252
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,300
Anything of any kind?

1253
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,900
They won't touch anything.

1254
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:15,940
Of any air.

1255
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:21,100
The teetotaling smiths are the ones who will not, they won't touch anything.

1256
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,700
They won't, they.

1257
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,680
Well, maybe that would explain why the.

1258
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,380
Their feet have to touch something.

1259
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:27,560
Oh, I see.

1260
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,700
That's the one thing they'll allow to touch, because they don't have any choice.

1261
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,200
Something has to touch the ground, because they can't float.

1262
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,060
But friends, if they could, they would, wouldn't you?

1263
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,820
Because see, you, maybe you're one of those stoner smiths and you don't know it.

1264
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,060
Don't you wish you could just float?

1265
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:52,720
I saw a lady carrying a baby yesterday and I thought, why don't I have a giant carrying me?

1266
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,360
It's just not fair.

1267
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,360
I want to be carried.

1268
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:04,440
By a big, warm, giant woman with big, huge, giantess, soft bosom.

1269
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,240
Amazonia.

1270
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,380
That I could rest on.

1271
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:11,600
And she just stroked my hair while she carried me and say, there, there.

1272
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,120
There, there.

1273
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,060
You poor, poor thing.

1274
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:15,720
You poor, poor thing.

1275
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,140
Everything's going to be all right.

1276
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,360
Isn't that what we all want, friends?

1277
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,240
Everything's going to really be all right.

1278
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,780
Don't that sound like slack to you?

1279
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,920
You, you, you, mommy, that's where I was dressed up in.

1280
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,860
You just lean your head back right here, honey.

1281
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,520
Stockings and.

1282
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,540
It's going to be okay.

1283
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,240
Just don't tase me, brother.

1284
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,140
Don't tase me.

1285
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:41,580
And I'm never.

1286
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,100
Don't be a, don't be one of those trick tasers.

1287
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,240
You know, you know, some girls are like that.

1288
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,420
They trick you and they're always tasing you.

1289
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,080
They get you.

1290
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,320
They flicker.

1291
00:52:54,320 --> 00:53:00,120
They flutter their eyelashes and their bosoms at you and you get attracted to them and then they tase you.

1292
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,080
I'm no trick tase.

1293
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,440
They were just tasing you the whole time.

1294
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,580
I'm no trick tase.

1295
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:08,260
Whatever happened to the freedom of speech in America?

1296
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,880
What happened to freedom to pee?

1297
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,420
In something besides a drug testing cup.

1298
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,860
What about the freedom of the arms?

1299
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:16,340
That's the only time.

1300
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,700
That's the way it's going to get to me.

1301
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,540
Autonomic, excuse me, the nervous system.

1302
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,120
Every time you urinate.

1303
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,340
They're testing you.

1304
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,940
And you become one with the whole universe.

1305
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,620
You'll see.

1306
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,340
Soon enough you'll see.

1307
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,140
And once I've turned away from the.

1308
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,600
Number 273.

1309
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,380
Number 273.

1310
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,120
.

1311
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,560
It isn't true.

1312
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,740
I'm not going to give up.

1313
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,240
I'm not going to give up.

1314
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,020
Oh, it's alright.

1315
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,020
It's really going to be alright.

1316
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,540
There, there.

1317
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,080
Poor, poor thing.

1318
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,800
You poor, poor thing.

1319
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,480
You poor, poor thing.

1320
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:55,620
.

1321
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,460
.

1322
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:01,700
Ow!

1323
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,020
.

1324
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,080
I look at the top of its head.

1325
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,100
What is this?

1326
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:09,980
It's a mess.

1327
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,860
And it smells like a mess.

1328
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,340
Look, you can actually see the brain.

1329
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,040
This is not what I want.

1330
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,100
What about braiding the brain?

1331
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,300
May I?

1332
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,900
Yes, you may.

1333
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:29,760
Friends, these are the kind of fun activities you can look forward to

1334
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,260
when you join the Church of the Subgenius and become a Bob Scout.

1335
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,620
If you're a young person, yes, you can join the Bob Scouts,

1336
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,160
which we just now invented.

1337
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,540
That's the youth outreach, Dobbs Youth, you might say.

1338
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,440
Little brown shirts.

1339
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,020
Their shirts are bought white,

1340
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:51,980
but they turn brown because they wipe their noses on them for years.

1341
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,740
In the Bob Scouts.

1342
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,600
It's traditional.

1343
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,980
We know that wasting is bad.

1344
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,240
And in the Bob Scouts.

1345
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,040
The Bob Scouts aren't like the Cub Scouts.

1346
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,020
You can be a queer.

1347
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,740
And Bob will love that.

1348
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,440
That's no problem.

1349
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,580
You can be an atheist and join the Bob Scouts.

1350
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,400
You could be trans.

1351
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,720
You could be a Christian and join the Bob Scouts.

1352
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,100
We don't have anything against anybody.

1353
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,580
It could be a crikey Bob.

1354
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,000
We don't even want to touch you.

1355
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:26,780
We don't want to be against you or anywhere near you.

1356
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,420
You can be what you want.

1357
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,220
That's right.

1358
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,340
And you can be far, far away from us.

1359
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,240
And we'd be perfect.

1360
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:33,780
We'd be perfectly happy.

1361
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,700
And that's what I mean.

1362
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,340
You can be a peanut shell.

1363
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:48,280
Now, isn't there something we're supposed to add here to this show?

1364
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,720
Yes, there are lots of things we should be adding.

1365
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,600
Go to the book.

1366
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,880
What do we...

1367
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,260
Oh, look.

1368
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:02,100
We could put large, intoxicating erstwhile breasties on the show.

1369
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,160
Oh.

1370
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:03,240
Oh.

1371
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,100
Oh, I know what we're missing.

1372
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,860
The legal ID.

1373
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,500
You're listening to the Hour of Slack.

1374
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,300
Broadcast here from Dobstown.

1375
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,600
In beautiful Dobstown.

1376
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,640
In fabulous Dobstown.

1377
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,660
All right, all you guys, line up.

1378
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,300
That's right.

1379
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,540
Get those hands up in the air.

1380
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,440
Get those feet slapping together.

1381
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,720
He's Bob.

1382
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,940
He really freaking does.

1383
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,980
I swear it.

1384
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:32,500
Yeah.

1385
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:38,000
He's Bob, my dog don't ever change.

1386
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,720
Always will be Bob.

1387
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:47,340
He's Bob, my dog don't ever change.

1388
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,240
He's Bob, always will be Bob.

1389
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,420
He's Bob.

1390
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,420
Bob don't ever change.

1391
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,980
He's Bob, always will be Bob.

1392
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,840
He's Bob, my dog don't ever change.

1393
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:20,540
He's Bob, always will be Bob.

1394
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:25,180
His hair is the one with the highlight that shines on the pompadour.

1395
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,020
That dimples the inside light, it's good he knows what it's for.

1396
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,440
He's Bob.

1397
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,780
Bob don't ever change.

1398
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,420
He's Bob, always will be Bob.

1399
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:46,640
Friends, you can see Bob at some subgenius shows coming up in distant lands, far away.

1400
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:52,580
Baltimore, November 10th, with Suzy the Floozy, just been added to that one.

1401
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:57,120
And your surely Reverend Ivan Stang, Carter LeBlanc, and the Amino Acids,

1402
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,220
who we just had dinner with earlier tonight.

1403
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,960
Some of them.

1404
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,080
You can't eat without Amino Acids.

1405
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:03,540
Amino Acids, actually.

1406
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:08,140
November 18th, the Frop Cup in Amsterdam.

1407
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,680
November 24th, in Detroit, there's a DeVival.

1408
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,980
Amino Acids, Detroit, DeVival, November 24th.

1409
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,040
And December 8th, San Francisco.

1410
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,000
Oh.

1411
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,120
I just heard about that.

1412
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,460
It's just got a new one.

1413
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:23,700
Mongoloid.

1414
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:30,340
Reverend Mongoloid is putting on a DeVival in San Francisco on December 8th, where Dr.

1415
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,060
Howell.

1416
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,880
Will Howell.

1417
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:33,640
The Wind.

1418
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:40,280
But we really should get out of here, though, because this show is now that it's howling

1419
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,560
to its bitter, howly end.

1420
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,240
Can you help me to my feet, little lady?

1421
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:43,980
I am.

1422
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:51,620
So, we'll let the Lemurians take us away.

1423
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:59,940
I'll show you that I, a free man from the earth, am more than a match for your brainless

1424
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,660
red monkey men.

1425
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,720
Flash presses the switch.

1426
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,220
Keep it going.

1427
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:11,160
Emperor Ming, fearing that his monkey men will all be killed, orders his soldiers to

1428
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:11,660
destroy him.

1429
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,980
The Soul Genius.

1430
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,760
Power of Swords.

1431
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:20,800
And he opens his eyes to find himself staring up into the great face of Bob.

1432
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,000
I am the sworn enemy of that fiend.

1433
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:23,760
Just a minute here.

1434
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:24,500
What's going on?

1435
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,820
Looks like somebody's in for a liquor.

1436
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,520
What's it all about?

1440
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,040

1442
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,160
Well, don't you see what I'm trying to tell you, fellas?

1443
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,180
No.

1444
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,460
Well, so long, man.

1445
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:44,100
Here, let me help you.

1446
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,200
