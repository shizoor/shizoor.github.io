1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:09,400
Through the darkness of future pasts, the magician longs to see.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,180
One chance out between two worlds.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,520
Fire, walk with me.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,220
We lived among the people.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,680
I think you say convenience store.

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,280
We lived above it.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,380
I mean it like it is, but it sounds.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,940
I, too, have been touched by the devilish one.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,960
Tattoo on the left shoulder.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,320
But when I saw the faces of the gods, I was changed.

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,580
I took the entire arm off.

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,820
Mine.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,380
His name is Mike.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,860
His name is Bob.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,240
You may think your husband has never killed a man, but you're wrong.

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,560
And before I take an interface with charges, he'll try to kill me.

17
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,980
I'll kill you.

18
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,180
Pity that you're only clean.

19
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,020
I want you to put aside my friends right now if you'reыс owing me

20
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,020


21
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,020


22
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,020


23
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,620
Why did you kill me?

24
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:59,300
You think into will have overdone him a hundred times and leave from the 968 p Els as family

25
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,700
Carly, you kill to stay free?

26
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,260
Like an American?

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,860
You kill to keep America free?

28
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,520
Do you kill? Do you kill for fun?

29
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,740
Do you kill for the love of killing?

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,000
Do you kill, Macaulay, do you kill to make America free?

31
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,060
Like a man?

32
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,900
To the ends of the world, ladies and gentlemen.

33
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,880
Come on, come on.

34
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,040
Big fear of sale at Zayner's tonight, folks.

35
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,100
This is how it goes.

36
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,420
There's a sign in the sun and the moon and the stars

37
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,480
that the end of the world will soon be ours.

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,440
Bible-beaten maniacs say to repent

39
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,560
and you better hurry up before their money's all spent.

40
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,680
God, he's a common man.

41
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,020
Why?

42
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,280
Why is he a common man?

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,280


44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,700
Why is he a common man?

45
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,960
You better listen up in case there's anything you missed.

46
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,940
The book of Revelation says it's coming real close.

47
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,040
If you need some more fear, well, then here's another dose.

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,840
To the ends of the world, and you haven't got time

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,900
for fucking and sucking and all of those crimes.

50
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,220
The police are with me.

51
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,860
The name is written in blood

52
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,660
With fires and famines

53
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,940
Diseases and blood

54
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,580
And nuclear bombs

55
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,980
Just waiting to blow

56
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,660
When God finally comes

57
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,100
Where's the first place he'll go?

58
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,120
I wonder.

59
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,580
If he should come, well, what would he see?

60
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,100
The earth run by dogs with us as his fleas.

61
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,760
The shit we've all done and the shit we all think.

62
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,780
It gets up God's nostrils and it's starting to sting.

63
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:28,640
Let's go.

64
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,380
Hallelujah, hallelujah Allelu

65
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,100
An

66
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,560
A

67
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,220
J

68
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,140
guitar solo

69
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,220
guitar solo

70
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,760
guitar solo

71
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,060
guitar solo

72
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,440
guitar solo

73
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,800
I'm gonna tell you a story about a man

74
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,240
that is out in the woods.

75
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,760
He knowed a little bit about me,

76
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:34,500
want to be part of the rat race no more. He doesn't want to be part of the business race

77
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:48,880
no more. He doesn't want to be part of the human race no more. This is the story of the

78
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,860
Lakeview Man.

79
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:08,700
He called the sheriff and said to come quick. About a broke in the freezer. Stole all my

80
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,980
steaks. Talk was still hot. The sheriff said, man, sounds to me like the Lakeview Man. The

81
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:24,260
Lakeview Man is a wild man. Lives in the woods outside of town. Howls at the moon. Lures

82
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,220
him if he can.

83
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,000
You might hear him.

84
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,740
The Lakeview Man.

85
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,280
The Lakeview Man.

86
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,220
Some say he was a soldier who came home from war. All in one piece with an emotional scar.

87
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:53,940
We all know the story. Argue about the day. Being out of the war between the states.

88
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,040
The Lakeview Man is a wild man.

89
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:04,640
Lives in the woods outside of town. Howls at the moon. Lures him if he can. You might

90
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,760
hear the Lakeview Man.

91
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:26,340
I took the shortcut to the river last night. A beard and a blur in my long beam lies. We

92
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,020
drank a bunch of beer. I drank a bunch of beer. I drank a bunch of beer. I drank a bunch of

93
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,420
beer.

94
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,340
Skipped a bunch of stones and I drove a little faster on the way back home.

95
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,980
Woo-hoo!

96
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:57,020
A dog disappears. A cow is found dead. Chicken is missing. Mountain missing its head. Shotgun gone. Print in the sand. Two-toed shy. The life of a man is a

97
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,020


98
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,580
lakefuel.

99
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,900
project

100
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:18,440
I Sharing the

101
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,580
phoena.

102
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,060
You might hear the Lake Fulman

103
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,480
You might hear the Lake Fulman

104
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,780
You might hear the Lake Fulman

105
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,020
Oh, yes.

106
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,460
Oh, yes.

107
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:46,580
Oh, yes.

108
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,800
Dear friends,

109
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,400
that was the Rainmakers

110
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,260
from a live performance.

111
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,560
I guess that's from the 25 Years On

112
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,300
live show in Kansas City, Missouri.

113
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,560
Lakeview Man.

114
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,740
It's about a yeti, or a crazy guy,

115
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,000
a subgenius, anyway,

116
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,600
that lives out at Lakeview Cemetery in Cleveland.

117
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,220
No, wait, it's a different lake.

118
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,080
It's somewhere in Missouri.

119
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,300
We were at Lakeview Cemetery in Cleveland

120
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:20,780
just yesterday.

121
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,480
The dog loved it.

122
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,740
Big boneyard.

123
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,280
Beautiful.

124
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,480
Oh, before that,

125
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,660
I've been playing some Dr. Bizarro

126
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,260
and the Disgustos,

127
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,520
that song, End of the World.

128
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,660
How about that?

129
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,000
That was Reverend Jimmy Ryan

130
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,320
playing guitar on that.

131
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,780
Dr. Bizarro did a bunch of albums

132
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,060
in the late 80s, I think.

133
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,720
We used to play on Hour of Slack back then,

134
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,140
and he's remixed them

135
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,060
and put them on CD,

136
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,140
and so that's what that's about.

137
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,360
There was a very brief clip of doctor music.

138
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,800
That was me talking about

139
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,280
Killing for the Love of Killing

140
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,860
with the Doctors for Wotan,

141
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,220
Philo,

142
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,380
but I think that was recorded in San Francisco,

143
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
so the other doctors were probably

144
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,660
Paul Mavridis, Doug Wellman,

145
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,760
Jay Kinney,

146
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,820
and in that particular case,

147
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,280
I think Gilbert Shelton.

148
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,900
Goodness.

149
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,740
The guy that,

150
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,960
true to the furry freak brothers.

151
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,640
And the opening sentence

152
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,840
was from the old Twin Peaks show.

153
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,440
Friends, for the next 11 minutes,

154
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,180
we're going back to X-Day

155
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,160
and give the younger generation a chance.

156
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,980
Well, some of them are younger.

157
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,620
Then there's peas.

158
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,080
This coming up is

159
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,700
the sub-ox scene pod crust of 20X Day.

160
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,120
The very beginning of it, I think.

161
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,040
There's about eight more hours of it.

162
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,100
In this case, I believe the lads are

163
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,280
Dr. Argus Fox,

164
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,300
Dr. Danny Shoggoth,

165
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,280
and

166
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:58,980
peas.

167
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,080
So, peas has problems, folks,

168
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,080
and we need you to get on the Patreon.

169
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,860
Peas has problems.

170
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,800
I don't know that we really want to be

171
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:07,820
solid.

172
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,500
We're adding a very, very special subscriber tier.

173
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,380
You'll have to email us to get the information.

174
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,060
What could not be fine with peas?

175
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,460
This is shenanigans.

176
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,220
Oh, yeah.

177
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,320
Everybody else took 2-May drugs and had mayhem.

178
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,380
Peas didn't do anything.

179
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,100
Peas is fine.

180
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,900
This is my dose.

181
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,740
I'm comfortable with it.

182
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,540
Working it out.

183
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,040
It's a little intense X-Day-ish.

184
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,140
It has been an intense X-Day.

185
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,300
Yes, it's been a very, very tense.

186
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,520
It adds a professional element to your experience, sure.

187
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,560
We had some new musical entertainment show up this year.

188
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,680
Oh, oh.

189
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,440
Yes.

190
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:49,700
Yes.

191
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:49,700


192
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,980
Yoko Ono cover act, as far as I can tell.

193
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,860
They're not very good.

194
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,520
No, they were not.

195
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,160
See you wrong, dude.

196
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,020
But they're spot on.

197
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,460
They were fucking brilliant.

198
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,580
It was awesome.

199
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,300
It was the most rawest thing I've seen in X-Day.

200
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:02,640
Raw.

201
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,860
That's one way to put it.

202
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,240
It was raw.

203
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,300
Raw like sewage.

204
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,500
Now, I would like to know who would have the audacity to attempt a...

205
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,540
What's going on here?

206
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,280
In the middle of a radio show, sir.

207
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,000
You can't just drive your vehicle through a radio show.

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,560
Slow down.

209
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,240
Slow down.

210
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,600
Slow down.

211
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,700
That's what we say.

212
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,040
Slow down.

213
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,340
Anybody drives anything, you're riding a bike.

214
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,760
Slow down.

215
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,280
Now, speed up.

216
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,120
Speed up really fast.

217
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,480
Now.

218
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,780
Now, slow down again.

219
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,060
Use extreme prejudice.

220
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,780
Someone over there is using a light.

221
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,520
I don't like it.

222
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,160
Turn it off.

223
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,800
Don't slow down.

224
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,960
Oh, he's...

225
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,360
Fragrantly disobeying the laws of the camp.

226
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,360
Fragrantly.

227
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:39,820
Fragrantly.

228
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,080
As we set up here.

229
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,560
Fragrantly.

230
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,440
Arbiters.

231
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,740
I have fragrant disenfranchisement from the law.

232
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,720
Fragrant disenfranchisement.

233
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,820
I know.

234
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,840
I can smell it from over here.

235
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,240
Wisteria.

236
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,320
A town ruled by one man.

237
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,740
Matt Furge.

238
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,540
Is it just me or does natural light taste like bananas?

239
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,060
I find the essence of this microphone tastes like howl.

240
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,080
You could get smarter just by sucking on the sponge.

241
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,000
I've been doing that and I feel like the howl essence is getting deeper in me.

242
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:17,960
Yeah.

243
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,900
I'm trying to get a good sense of what's going on.

244
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,020
I'm trying to get a good sense of what's going on.

245
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,020


246
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,020


247
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,020


248
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,880
I can't have my $20.

249
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,180
$35.

250
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,320
Can I have my $20 now, Arbit?

251
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,500
You promised.

252
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,840
We don't need money.

253
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,340
You said no one would ever know.

254
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,520
Not where we're going.

255
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,980
Money will just be a hobby, a pleasure out there.

256
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,500
We can collect and spend different currencies for other currencies without ever interacting

257
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,920
with physical commodities.

258
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,680
Here we are.

259
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,100
Now, listen.

260
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,800
Seriously, gentlemen.

261
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,620
We're here in the vaults.

262
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,460
The very bowels of the...

263
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,480
Bulldog of potential pleasures.

264
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
Yes, we have a common deer.

265
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,020
We kick...

266
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,320
We lock Stang out of Tarzan's radio station.

267
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,220
Surrounded by the trappings of our church.

268
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:05,660
Surrounded by pornography of vintage styles from the 70s that may or may not have participants

269
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,420
in this very room actively filmed in.

270
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,120
I've seen your films.

271
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,940
They're disturbing.

272
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:18,260
But nonetheless, an art form that we have come to express and take on to ourselves as

273
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,140
subgeniuses.

274
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,420
We've watched it be destroyed and bastardized by Ivan Stang.

275
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:29,260
Or what we now suspect in a detailed investigation that was put into launch by the crack detective

276
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,040
team of it.

277
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,660
That this is no...

278
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,720
No, Ivan Stang is not here at all.

279
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,200
In any way, shape, or form.

280
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,200
This is an evil alien robot Stang.

281
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,060
Named Doug.

282
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,060
Named Doug.

283
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,360
Except Doug is an excellent point.

284
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,720
Named Doug.

285
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,720
Well, we were given a clue by the clowns earlier.

286
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,680
They said next year...

287
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,400
The clowns knew.

288
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,440
After having...

289
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,140
After having extracted Ivan Stang...

290
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,760
The false Ivan Stang's wallet.

291
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,800
The clowns...

292
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,960
Slippy tried to tell me before he mysteriously disappeared from camp.

293
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:58,940
Okay?

294
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,980
Beloved Slippy is nowhere to be found in camp.

295
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,740
But he indicated to me that he had a secret to know.

296
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,720
With he...

297
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,940
You know, everybody knows he got Stang's wallet last night, right?

298
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,280
Yeah.

299
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:10,600
Yeah.

300
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,380
And so...

301
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,620
He was generous with it in an earlier auction today.

302
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:13,980
He took out the sacred card.

303
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,780
He took it out.

304
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,240
And he saw the holy...

305
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,700
The real, true scribes.

306
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:19,600
That's his name.

307
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,080
That is yet to be determined.

308
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,280
Because if those bastards can change things...

309
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,060
Nobody...

310
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,880
It's...

311
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,320
It's an acid tan.

312
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,980
You have to talk into the microphone.

313
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,280
I'm not listening to you unless you speak into the microphone.

314
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,800
I can't hear you.

315
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,060
Put your cans on, boys.

316
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,500
Oh, we're doing it professional style?

317
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,800
Is this gonna work?

318
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,320
They're supposed to.

319
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:45,600
Is it?

320
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,360
Can you hear the show?

321
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,940
It's a huge difference.

322
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,840
Outside.

323
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,720
No, the cans make a huge difference.

324
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,240
Well, some of us are capable of facing directly forward.

325
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,820
This is why Hal uses it.

326
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,300
Who gets to edit this show?

327
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,340
Danny.

328
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,700
Fid.

329
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,980
Let's just ship it to Fid.

330
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,780
Let's just ship it to Fid.

331
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,940
No, this is all Fid's fault.

332
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,580
Fid, fix this.

333
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,000
Make it funny.

334
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,540
I'm still not convinced he didn't plan everything.

335
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,160
Dude, he...

336
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,720
This entire X-Day has been one large practical joke planned by Fid Chooley.

337
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,160
Yep.

338
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,480
Too convincingly, Fid Chooley disappeared from the internet.

339
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,420
Fid.

340
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:19,420


341
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,680
Which means the entire face of the earth is involved with the meth junkie.

342
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,820
And he got teased.

343
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,300
He's so elaborate, dude.

344
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,580
We'll get to how your friend could get to his clinic.

345
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,740
Dude, I got a serious problem.

346
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,620
Professionalism, boys.

347
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,000
This is for the national market.

348
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,260
This is really for the archives.

349
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,560
This is gonna be historic.

350
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,400
See, this is the show.

351
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:49,640
Shit.

352
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,880
Fid, if you're gonna do a documentary about the Church of the fucking Subgenius,

353
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,920
maybe your film crew should walk around at 2 or 3 o'clock in the fucking morning

354
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,380
and see what really happens.

355
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,200
Instead of like,

356
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,220
okay, we're gonna script a saucer lesson right now.

357
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,700
That's another hot topic.

358
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,480
There was a documentary film crew

359
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,160
working to continue the corruption,

360
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,280
the disinformation of the Church of the Subgenius.

361
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,740
And these...

362
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,420
If there had really been a vision,

363
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,080
there would have been somebody making a documentary

364
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,000
of the documentary.

365
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,020
A documentary?

366
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,800
That they were filming here next day.

367
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,840
That's what they should have done.

368
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,800
I think documentary is one of, uh,

369
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,760
legumes children's stories.

370
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,720
You're filling my cans.

371
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,560
Stop it.

372
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,080
Can I touch your cans?

373
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,420
Well, I'll see if I can.

374
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,540
That's why I gotta sit closer to Danny.

375
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,960
This is why I don't think the three-fucking-person model works

376
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,300
in the Tarzan studio.

377
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,920
It just doesn't work.

378
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,280
You ever watched radio,

379
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,100
T-Shirt?

380
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,400
Radio is one of the...

381
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,820
One of the most brilliant forms

382
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:50,880
of visual exercise.

383
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,220
I've never seen radio, please.

384
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,460
Let me explain to you how it works, okay?

385
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,340
Step one.

386
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,220
Radio is tiny.

387
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:57,840
You don't see radio.

388
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,000
That's all you need to know.

389
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,560
Rule two.

390
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,160
There...

391
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,860
No.

392
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,460
No?

393
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Just repeat rule one?

394
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,560
Over and over.

395
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:06,780
It's like Fight Club.

396
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,480
Over and over again.

397
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,120
Repetition is the soul of wit.

398
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,660
What about eating on the radio?

399
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,240
I've seen that people really want more of that.

400
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
In the background,

401
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,840
even a lot of people are talking

402
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,780
just to hear someone

403
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,220
nicely eating a piece of pizza or something.

404
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
It's reassuring, I think,

405
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,020
to the subconscious.

406
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,920
If only the fine campers

407
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,960
out in front of our faces

408
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,280
would bring us some of their vittles,

409
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,660
we could provide some of that

410
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,460
good quality audio content,

411
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,360
that ASMR.

412
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,560
One of the writers that I have

413
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,900
is that every groom room

414
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,700
that I have to go in

415
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,040
has to have ambient pizza chewing noise.

416
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,880
Ambient pizza chewing?

417
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,180
Yeah.

418
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,260
Very, very...

419
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,780
You put ambient on your pizza?

420
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,720
No, dude.

421
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,200
I like canned ambience.

422
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,760
Oh.

423
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,180
In olive oil.

424
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,440
I like a case of ambient for moves.

425
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,220
Yeah.

426
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,700
11.

427
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,160
Fine glaze of ambience.

428
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,300
Of condiments.

429
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,240
If you're going to pick one,

430
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,860
that's a good one.

431
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,340
This has been all about ambience

432
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,440
this X day.

433
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,880
It's been about the hypno-lights

434
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,080
and the lasers.

435
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,780
And the stuff and the things.

436
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,340
And the burning, exploding carcasses of deities.

437
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,280
Would you not think, again...

438
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,140
No, I don't think.

439
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,040
I try not to.

440
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,760
But I mean,

441
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
you're not going to take everything in

442
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,380
from X day.

443
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,020
Until I actually go into the saucer,

444
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,100
decompress,

445
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,180
analyze everything.

446
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,020
Sleep 12 hours.

447
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:25,780
Yeah.

448
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,020
I can't wait.

449
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,560
It's just hours away.

450
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,460
All right.

451
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,700
So let's break this down topic by topic.

452
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,860
Topic by topic.

453
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,340
All right.

454
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,580
The major events.

455
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,420
I believe we started with the new revelations

456
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,680
from Legume and Stang, right?

457
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,600
Is that...

458
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,720
It's been planned from the beginning, obviously.

459
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,900
The clues are obvious

460
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,740
when you know what you're looking for.

461
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,300
You're right.

462
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,160
Someone care to recount what that all was?

463
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,700
It was Fidd.

464
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,680
I'm going to put it on you guys.

465
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,000
It was Fidd.

466
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,780
It was fucking Fidd, man.

467
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,800
I just read it.

468
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,520
Fidd flew people in.

469
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,280
Still not convinced it's not.

470
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,000
Dude, you need to pull this off

471
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,860
because Pease is not going to want to leave X day

472
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,200
to take you to Columbus and back.

473
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,540
So you've really got to pull off this turkey thing.

474
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,040
Yeah, he put on his Discordian costume.

475
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,820
Straight to Pease and he's coming to X day.

476
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,280
Okay.

477
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,660
Before we get...

478
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:18,800
Before we get Bob,

479
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,440
the little fucking Bob with the little fans.

480
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,740
The little fans that we give people

481
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,620
to cool themselves off

482
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,600
and put in front of his face

483
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,560
and I'm Bob and I fucking fell for it.

484
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,420
I'm sorry, guys.

485
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,620
Craziness.

486
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,080
Crazy, crazy, crazy.

487
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,220
He's a crafty salesman.

488
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,780
What can I say?

489
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,340
What Stang hasn't told you

490
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,240
is it was actually Fidd Chooley

491
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,120
you cast into the fire last night.

492
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,500
I got big troubles, dude.

493
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,000
Tell us about your troubles, Pease.

494
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,960
This trip sponsored by

495
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,740
bailing out on Pease.

496
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,840
Now available in 31 flavors.

497
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,160
This mistake was brought to you by Pease.

498
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,020
31 flavors such as

499
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,500
cold sweats, vomiting,

500
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,300
shivers, headache,

501
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,080
pain,

502
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,540
additional pain.

503
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,140
Why did I come here?

504
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,020
What possessed me to think this was a good idea?

505
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,760
I moved

506
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,340
that we rename this episode

507
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,500
temporarily Suboxone Urine Pot.

508
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,860
I so mentioned.

509
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,600
Yeah.

510
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,220
I'm sorry the rehab center was closed

511
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,820
and your friend had to go home.

512
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,400
Sorry about your drug dealer having withdrawals.

513
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,780
Shut up, dude.

514
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,860
He's not my drug dealer.

515
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,520
He's my friend.

516
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,620
He's my special friend.

517
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,840
He's my special friend.

518
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
There's a difference.

519
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,420
The ability to treat standing up is a gift.

520
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,900
He's just my special friend.

521
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,280
My special male friend.

522
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,960
Yeah, Pease.

523
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,880
I meant like we know each other through the mail,

524
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,560
not like he's gender male.

525
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,180
Like that's how I knew this guy.

526
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,540
You know him through his mail.

527
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,320
Victor Frop Chopula.

528
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,380
He did fucking bit Julie under the Frop Chopula mask.

529
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,460
Oh, man.

530
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,580
So much has happened.

531
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,960
Bit Julie ass Frop Chopula.

532
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,060
I would have got away with it if it wasn't for

533
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,800
bit Julie at the paper cube Friday.

534
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,040
But it was a joke.

535
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,640
Off the top of my head.

536
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:35,640


537
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:35,640


538
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:35,640


539
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,900
Man in the computer.

540
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,740
Just treat me like a maid.

541
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,600
Like a regular joe.

542
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,180
Well I guess that I'd make it

543
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,900
And have something to show

544
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:09,380
So for now I just guess I'll just fake it

545
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,280
And forget everything that I know

546
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,140
Every bag's always thin words

547
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,120
Twisted inside and out

548
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,460
Could someone please tell me

549
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,160
What the fuck life's about

550
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,840
There ain't no big payoff

551
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,960
At the end of your road

552
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,500
If you think that you're way off

553
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,340
No matter what you've been told

554
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,380
Yeah

555
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,680
If your savior is coming

556
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,040
He won't like what he'll find

557
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,020
Every one of God's children

558
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,300
Driven half out of their mind

559
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,140
Every bag's always thin words

560
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,800
Twisted this way and that

561
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,340
Could someone please tell me

562
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,400
Where it's supposed to be at

563
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:10,760
Yeah

564
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,380
Well I think the time has come

565
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,600
No matter where you're at in the plot so far

566
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,540
Just put down your script now

567
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,440
Just forget all the stuff you're doing in your life

568
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,500
Yeah you know all the stuff you're doing

569
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,060
You were told you're supposed to do

570
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,740
Now if you were ever in a rock band

571
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,820
And got screwed over by a club owner

572
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,920
Even if you played in a wheeling

573
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,820
No wheeling

574
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,240
Just to ease your troubled consciousness

575
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,060
We brought in at great expense

576
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,260
We brought in at great expense

577
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,020
The Consumer Product Vocal Ensemble

578
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,360
Direct from Seattle

579
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,200
Yeah we know we haven't quite reached Nirvana yet

580
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,980
But we keep trying

581
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,060
We've got Dan Liss over there

582
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,340
Dressed up as John Paul

583
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,460
Doing his impression of Kurt Cobain

584
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,820
You got the hair Dan?

585
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,020
Okay

586
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,220
Now we're going for the big record deal here

587
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,300
We've spared no expense

588
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,820
Rich Poston is going to be having a grunge guitar war

589
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,000
A little bit later over there

590
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
We'll even throw in a little Styx

591
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,160
And a little bit of a

592
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,780
Supercat Dirt

593
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:20,380
Truly inspirational guys

594
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,100
And now for the fake bar room scene

595
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,240
Direct from Maddie's

596
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,640
We're going to duplicate

597
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,300
Right here in the recording studio

598
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,480
The now infamous I Bob Dead Rockstar Costume Contest

599
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,340
Up first for her submission in the semi-finals

600
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,320
Direct from the Crescent City camera crew Elvira

601
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,960
Hi guys ready for the big one?

602
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,340
Yeah

603
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,020
We're ready

604
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,660
We're ready

605
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:43,700
We're ready

606
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:43,980
We're ready

607
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,860
Now in an attempt to get more mileage out of this musical vampire

608
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,440
We've got the bar all set up

609
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,380
For any record executive listening

610
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,700
We have Beefeater for a really dry martini

611
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,880
A really dry martini

612
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,440
Here's how to make one

613
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,460
Some Beefeater gin

614
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,200
Plenty of ice

615
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,260
With a twist of lemon

616
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,740
And an olive too

617
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,240
An olive too

618
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,980
Shake it up

619
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:13,980


620
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:13,980


621
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:13,980


622
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:13,980


623
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:13,980


624
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:13,980


625
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,540
And not stirred

626
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,120
Then we'll all get drunk and play the entire song backwards

627
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,440
Singing this song backwards

628
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:30,520
Oh no we won't play all of the song backwards

629
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,320
We'll pick up on Dave here I hope

630
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,740
Yeah it's Bo Dave alright

631
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,100
Bo Dave

632
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,480
Bo Dave

633
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,680
Bo Dave

634
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,180
Bo Dave woman Bo Dave-er-y

635
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:49,180
I was wondering which one of our beautifully Monogrammed signature customized background

636
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,100
Sound's playing in your mind tonight

637
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,620
he what?

638
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:53,880
Wait a minute

639
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:53,880


640
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:53,880


641
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,960
er which Disco?

642
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:04,580
And that's the same one I always have in mind right now

643
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:04,580


644
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:04,580


645
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:04,800
Us

646
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:04,800


647
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,340
Poor

648
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:05,340


649
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:05,360
High

650
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,360


651
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,360


652
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,360


653
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,360


654
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,360


655
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,980
negotiator

656
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,160
ID

657
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,560
points

658
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,560


659
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,560


660
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,560


661
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,560


662
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,560


663
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,560


664
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,560


665
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,560


666
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,880
I'm

667
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Streaming

668
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,540
From

669
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:11,900
The

670
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,660
roots

671
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,220
dat

672
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:13,820
And

673
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,100
Yeah, that's what made me think that what if some, like, Uber man,

674
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,260
not a driving person around in a car or something,

675
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:20,240
but some sort of, you know, super evil patron of the arts,

676
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,840
some necrophiliac or something like that,

677
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,640
would have the actual stones and underpants to pull off a ploy like that.

678
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,560
You know what I mean?

679
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,480
Well, I lost track of which foil it was by the time you got to the end of it,

680
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,280
but that's okay.

681
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,760
Well, I was thinking that some, like, Uber mastermind

682
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,420
could make everybody have the same soundtrack.

683
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,640
Background soundtrack.

684
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,380
Well, I'm sure that's what the conspiracy is ultimately shooting for.

685
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:54,700
Yeah.

686
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:00,660
Maybe the background music soundtrack for all of the New World Order

687
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,780
will be a Muzak version,

688
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,900
a comforting, easy-listening version of Bob Dylan's

689
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,860
The Times They Are.

690
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,580
A changing.

691
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,560
Or perhaps A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall.

692
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,380
Yes.

693
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,840
I've actually heard that.

694
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,520
In the 70s, I got into an elevator,

695
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,500
and this insipid Muzak was on,

696
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,100
and I realized what I was listening to was A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall.

697
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:26,880
Wow.

698
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,840
And I thought, I guess it's not.

699
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:34,580
That is so suggestibly horny and deregulation and everything going on there.

700
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,620
You know, the warehouse outing and everything.

701
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,460
Oh, speaking of music, I played that song we just played before you called in

702
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,180
that you didn't hear, Dave,

703
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,280
was called Every Back's Always Thing Words,

704
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,840
and that was Dr. Bizarro and the Disgustos.

705
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,120
Just as you always said it was.

706
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,700
Yeah.

707
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,040
I never once conflicted your arguments that you said that that's who that was

708
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,980
when you were doing your credit role,

709
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,760
especially when you were doing your Sam and your main role.

710
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,280
Well, that wasn't the song that I was going to play that I decided was about me.

711
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,900
Well, then your mind control was in your cinnamon roll.

712
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,500
Mind control in cinnamon roll.

713
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,080
Mind control in cinnamon roll.

714
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,500
Look into the spiral of the cinnamon roll.

715
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,500
Dr. Sinister is here.

716
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,100
Jays.

717
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,480
And Princess Wee.

718
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,320
Jays.

719
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:30,680
Is here.

720
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,360
Well, I'm glad to know that somebody's here because they could be elsewhere.

721
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,780
We could.

722
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,320
Well, we are going to be elsewhere,

723
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:45,180
because we're moving back to Stang Ranch in Texas before Halloween.

724
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,280
Boo hiss.

725
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,740
Boo hiss.

726
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,980
Well, we'll be back in the Slacker Mansion of Cleveland Heights next summer,

727
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,840
but the house won't be so cluttered then,

728
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:02,000
and the Texas house will be terribly cluttered.

729
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,040
And that's even after...

730
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:04,940
Huh?

731
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,120
It's all full of gypsies in their shiny pink underpants.

732
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,340
I'm trying to find some gypsies in pink underpants to rent our place while we're gone,

733
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,600
but they have to be gypsies that are already our friends that we know.

734
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,800
So friends in Cleveland that we know, you can rent the Slacker Mansion.

735
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,780
It's not haunted anymore, and it's very convenient to shopping and schools.

736
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,640
And, yeah.

737
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,340
And there's a fence now.

738
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:36,760
Wow.

739
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,580
And it won't be so cluttered.

740
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:45,460
Like I say, we're moving the equivalent of a six-bedroom house,

741
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,480
only they're not bedrooms.

742
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,680
They're Tarzan's radio station stuff.

743
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,560
And we're going to have to build a shed or buy a shed for Mennonites.

744
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,580
A big shed.

745
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:58,800
Mennonites.

746
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,160
I love your pronunciation of that word.

747
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,940
It's normally Mennonites.

748
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,640
If you read me it real, real badly, it could be Mennonites.

749
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,820
Well, the shed is a real exciting thing to me.

750
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,780
We already have the plastic letters that go on the outside of the shed,

751
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,560
which will say,

752
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,600
Destructionist Evidence Museum Office.

753
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,440
Because the museum is not actually in the shed.

754
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,840
The shed will be full of metal shelves full of tapes.

755
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,820
Yes, tapes.

756
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,880
Tapes and tapes.

757
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,000
CDRs.

758
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,160
And souls.

759
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,680
All the canisters of souls from our...

760
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,900
But anyway, the shed is so exciting to me.

761
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,560
And I'm going to play a Rainmaker song so you can hear it.

762
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,260
And you'll see that it actually is about us this week.

763
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,840
Even though the song was done in, I think, 2014,

764
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,700
I was listening to the lyrics of it and I couldn't believe it.

765
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,000
It was like, how did they know?

766
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,920
You're needing a parallel life.

767
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,040
We're going to all be quiet for a minute,

768
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,300
but I'm going to play a song.

769
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,620
I'm going to play this song, okay?

770
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,460
I know you can interpret it when it's over.

771
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,000
It's short.

772
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,540
It's only about two and a half minutes.

773
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,300
I can hardly wait.

774
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,440
Here, you won't.

775
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,320
I'm on a red book, a carpet in the red bed room

776
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,600
Cause the movers are a-comin' and they'll be here soon

777
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,300
I'm off to Colorado, there's roadblocks

778
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,440
And the old man's in the oar

779
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,720
Gonna mine me a diamond at a second-hand store

780
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,200
Gonna love my neighbor like the good book said

781
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,300
Put some miles between the quick and the dead

782
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,520
Come on, let's go to the swingin' shed

783
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,300
I was getting back to normal after years of planning

784
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:08,300


785
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,820
Realizing everybody needs somebody to blame

786
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,200
Still painting with a hammer on my masterpiece

787
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,920
With my waterlust to sit around in a pan of grease

788
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,500
All I'm meant about the books that I never had read

789
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,580
Wondered if my suitcase was still under the bed

790
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,300
Come on, let's go to the swingin' shed

791
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,740
Come on, let's go to the swingin' shed

792
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,380
I'm at a loss

793
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,080
I'm at a loss

794
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,800
I'm at a loss

795
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,460
I'm at a loss

796
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,320
I'm at a loss

797
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,240
I'm at a loss

798
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,320
I'm at a loss

799
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,140
I'm at a loss

800
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,380
I'm at a loss

801
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,020
carpet when I'm starting to drift.

802
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,680
She once called me sleeping on the midnight shift.

803
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,040
She cried my way when they assumed I'm dead.

804
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:42,460
The very next word that you're gonna hear said, come on, let's go to the swinging shed.

805
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:20,820
Come on, let's go to the swinging shed.

806
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:31,560
It was the new cutting edge of popular music when you were just a wee tot.

807
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,640
Well, yeah, I was gonna say when I was a wee tot, that sounds more like Elvis.

808
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,080
Well, yeah, it sounds like rockabilly.

809
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,220
Yeah, I remember being a little kid and seeing...

810
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:46,480
Did you know the rockabilly standards and also the honker music of early rock and roll days

811
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,660
actually happened in the late 1940s, not even in the 50s.

812
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:58,100
But it was considered race music, so it wasn't considered on the variety of guild map.

813
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,240
Swing.

814
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,780
If I can't whoop it, I'll go down.

815
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,720
But I'll go down swinging.

816
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,540
Go down swinging.

817
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,540
You told me the thing.

818
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:13,380
I think it's so intricately produced as far as, you know, magnet music and stuff like that.

819
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,240
I mean, it's just so wonderful that you can have a hard time focusing on the lyrics,

820
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,640
which are as important as a fat belly button to an artist.

821
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


822
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


823
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


824
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


825
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


826
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


827
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


828
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


829
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


830
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


831
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


832
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


833
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


834
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


835
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,640


836
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,980
Speaking as a Clevelander, I've always opposed to the notion that it was Alfred who coined the term rock and roll because he didn't.

837
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,780
No.

838
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,440
Long before...

839
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:31,920
He didn't.

840
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,260
What?

841
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,500
No.

842
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:38,060
That's funny because we were standing at his tombstone in Lakeview Cemetery yesterday.

843
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,640
Yes, we were.

844
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,140
Just yesterday.

845
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:46,780
He popularized the use of that word to describe the kind of music that he was popularizing over the radio in the 50s.

846
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,460
But the actual term rock and roll goes back several decades before.

847
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:50,980
And that...

848
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,420
Yes.

849
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
It was part of the African-American vernacular.

850
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:00,600
And it makes me miss our old caller, Master Sean, who would always say, play sex music.

851
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,140
Oh yeah.

852
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:01,900
Oh yeah.

853
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,200
Oh yeah.

854
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,380
Rock and roll was a term for sex before it was a term for television.

855
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:05,960
We're still channeling him.

856
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,380
Oh yeah.

857
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,900
We're still channeling him.

858
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,160
Oh yeah.

859
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:08,600
Como va?

860
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,920
We thought he was... that it was a mantra.

861
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,880
And we used it as such and it worked.

862
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,460
Yes.

863
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:15,900
Oh yeah.

864
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,540
We'd get upset about something and we'd just start going, oh yeah.

865
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,280
Oh yeah.

866
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,220
Oh yeah.

867
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:20,460
Oh yeah.

868
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,780
Oh yeah.

869
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,200
Oh yeah.

870
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,200


871
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,200


872
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,300
Especially if you play Bolero.

873
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,840
Well, it's just a short version of that.

874
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,920
Ah, yes, dear friends.

875
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,780
Which preachers have been saying forever.

876
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:29,600


877
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:29,600


878
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,760
Hey, I've got a final exam for everybody here.

879
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,840
Final exam?

880
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,340
Yeah.

881
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,560
I'm springing this on you.

882
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,180
We don't have to sit up and put our socks on the strippers or the stirrups, do we?

883
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
No, it's real easy.

884
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,400
There's no essay questions.

885
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,320
Although, if I know you...

886
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,640
There we go.

887
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:50,920
Will be.

888
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,640
Pop quiz.

889
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,300
Yeah.

890
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,520
It's a ha-ha.

891
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,600
Pop quiz in the rocket factory.

892
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:02,540
Yeah, our friend Roger, the good Reverend Roger, put this together.

893
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,740
It's, are you ready for the finals?

894
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,920
It's an end times final exam.

895
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,240
The first question is, there'll be four choices.

896
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,800
One, when you wake up screaming, it's because, A.

897
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,260
I don't even need four choices.

898
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,100
Donald Trump really is president.

899
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,720
B. Nazis really are walking around in broad daylight.

900
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,740
C. Weasels ran off with your spouse.

901
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,820
Or D. All of the above.

902
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,420
I'd say D.

903
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,280
No, it's E.

904
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,660
I wake up screaming because of what I ate the night before.

905
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,880
Okay, so I knew there'd be a lot of E's on this.

906
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,160
Donald Trump is not a demomantic spirit.

907
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,920
Just because he's a multibarrel, a brahmin or something, or a fat cat.

908
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,840
You know.

909
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,820
Okay, here's another one.

910
00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:01,520
The collection cup for date night is now collecting, A. Vomit.

911
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,160
B. Blood.

912
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,080
C. Your fingernail clippings.

913
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,340
D. Someone else's fingernails.

914
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,800
D again for me.

915
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,500
E again for me, man.

916
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,120
I mean, actually, maybe it's a mixture.

917
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,100
I mean, I often have boogers underneath my fingernails.

918
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,560
So, like.

919
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,140
A mixture of boogers and fingernail clippings.

920
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:22,860
Ewww.

921
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,880
It doesn't make you feel inferior, though.

922
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,260
It makes you feel like you've got a big fat full of tummy and you're ready to go.

923
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,400
You just took over the bus.

924
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,580
You're in charge.

925
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,800
It's making me hungry.

926
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:39,280
Well, that's because you like sodium flatulence and all those different Earth candies.

927
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,560
That you can't really find anymore in the Soviet orbit.

928
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,300
Okay, number three.

929
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,860
You are running because, A. Insane cops.

930
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,040
B. Supersonic Nazi health creatures from beneath the Hollow Earth.

931
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,880
C. More weasels.

932
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,340
Or you are running because, D. You still have legs.

933
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,980
E. Because I feel like torturing myself.

934
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,160
How is anyone meant to abuse their body like running?

935
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,880
F. I'm running because my legs are on fire.

936
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,400
D. C. I mean, B. Weasels again.

937
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,820
R. I'm sorry.

938
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:26,620
I like the idea of little weasels nipping at your nose like a Santa Claus device used to have.

939
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,980
You think that sounds like fun, don't you?

940
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,620
Well, no, I know it's fun.

941
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,340
I've seen the little children scream and scrunder and run away from Grandpa's plunder.

942
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,940
Especially when the artichokes are on fire.

943
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,940
And they have been mighty meaty lady me laddy.

944
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,340
Now stop crying, Dave.

945
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,460
You're crying because...

946
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,840
A. I'm weeping softly.

947
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,640
You vaguely remember having loved ones.

948
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,460
B. Tear gas.

949
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,240
C. Nobody witnessed you all shiny and chrome.

950
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:08,760
Or you're crying because, D. Irregardless made it into the dictionary.

951
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,300
Irregardless made it into the dictionary?

952
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,400
Double D.

953
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,580
Is that really true?

954
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,240
I don't know.

955
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,540
I mean, can we vote on that? Or is it just...

956
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:20,980
Let's make that...

957
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,660
Everything's in the dictionary now.

958
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,380
God dammit, I am such an underman.

959
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,780
I am such an untermensch.

960
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,240
But at least I don't use a word like irregardless.

961
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,900
If that's actually in the dictionary now, then what does that make me?

962
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,360
Then we might as well give up.

963
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,840
I'm just gonna Crimea River.

964
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,440
This is called Gloucester.

965
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,220
No, Crimea is a peninsula, not a river.

966
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:39,980
Oh, okay.

967
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,000
It's a huge peninsula sticking out of the former Soviet Union's rear end.

968
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,800
Down there by Kiev and all those other parts.

969
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,320
I don't know.

970
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:50,540
I don't know.

971
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,120
Okay.

972
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:51,660
And you know why?

973
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,420
Why?

974
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,240
Because I said so.

975
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:53,680
That's why.

976
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,680
No, I didn't really.

977
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,840
I have a geography book and I know where I'm headed.

978
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,460
Same place we're all going someday soon.

979
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,340
Why won't you eat your pudding?

980
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,680
Because it's caramelized and ugly.

981
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,400
No, that wasn't one of the options.

982
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,980
You didn't eat your pudding.

983
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,080
You won't eat your pudding because A, you didn't eat all your meat.

984
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,540
B, you knew the guy the pudding used to eat.

985
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:20,540


986
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,040
C, you no longer have the required orifices.

987
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,540
Or D, it's frozen solid like everything else for a hundred miles in any direction.

988
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,620
All right, now hold on.

989
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,700
B, like are we talking about jello pudding or are we talking about like black pudding?

990
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:39,760
Oh, I don't know.

991
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,680
It's pudding that you knew the guy that the pudding used to be.

992
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,200
Well, that's why I did eat it.

993
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,100
I figured it was the best way to respect his memory.

994
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:47,520
I don't know.

995
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:47,840
Ugh.

996
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:48,940
Ugh.

997
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,020
Ugh.

998
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:49,840
Ugh.

999
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,180
Many cultures do that.

1000
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,760
This is not unusual.

1001
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,140
Wow.

1002
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:53,140


1003
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,620
I mean, Christians do that to this day.

1004
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,280
Yeah, they exonerate the body—

1005
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,500
To eat the body of their saviour?

1006
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,240
—the body of Christ by eating his flesh every symbolically, ever communionary through

1007
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,320
Eucharistic development especially in the Third World countries where the islands are

1008
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,600
now as smooth as a baby's forehead.

1009
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,120
Scoots take a long, long way, fringe.

1010
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,500
Yeah, they did smooth over some of those islands.

1011
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:18,900
Yeah.

1012
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:23,700
I found out my cousin was on St. Martin when that was going on.

1013
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,080
Goodness.

1014
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,060
Yeah, but she's okay.

1015
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,220
That's really fortunate.

1016
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,480
I'm sorry, Agent.

1017
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:38,400
Okay, even though the earth is vomiting up the dead and the government hasn't issued any edicts in weeks,

1018
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:49,180
you, A, are safe in your buried storage container, eating your previous relatives, offspring, etc.

1019
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,660
Or B, at least still have your guns.

1020
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:57,860
C, managed to save your waifu pillow.

1021
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,440
I don't get that.

1022
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,700
You don't want to know.

1023
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,720
D, all of the above.

1024
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:08,240
Look, when it comes to edicts, okay, if you still have edicts after a major storm,

1025
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,300
that means you still have access to internet porn.

1026
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,740
Yeah, or, you know, constantly.

1027
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,020
It's full of edicts.

1028
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,100
The spirit of Dr. Dark just wafted through here.

1029
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,740
You don't know what a waifu is?

1030
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:19,820
No.

1031
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:26,800
All right, so a waifu is a phenomenon that you see amongst the Weebo community,

1032
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,700
which is a subset of the neckbeard community.

1033
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:37,660
The waifu is a female anime character that,

1034
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:45,340
a male Weebo neckbeard will worship as if it were an actual person and actually his wife.

1035
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:51,820
The word itself is derived from the rough Japanese approximation of the pronunciation of the English word wife.

1036
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,440
A lot of them will have body-sized pillows.

1037
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:01,800
Not a blow-up doll, but a body-sized pillow with some anime girl painted on it, and that's the waifu.

1038
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,780
I've been missing out once again.

1039
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,840
You really have not been missing anything.

1040
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,320
Uh-oh, we're back to the weasels again.

1041
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:18,420
Your neighbors are all raptured, leaving you behind with the weasels.

1042
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,080
You, A, help yourself to their stuff.

1043
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,900
B, console yourself that at least that crooked Hillary didn't win.

1044
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:36,420
C, run to the nearest church and explain to God that he has overlooked your exceptionalism.

1045
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,380
Or D, run to the nearest church and explain to God that he has overlooked your exceptionalism.

1046
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:38,960
Or D, run to the nearest church and explain to God that he has overlooked your exceptionalism.

1047
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:38,960


1048
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,320
Dance while the weasels rip your flesh.

1049
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,160
I dance while I rip the flesh of weasels. I don't know about you.

1050
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,640
Yeah, I remember that was a song in the Soviet Union under Frank Sinatra's reign.

1051
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,680
You remember Frank Sinatra or was it Sinatra?

1052
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,420
You know, Zelio Polis, one of them guys like that, used to run the gyros place.

1053
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:06,180
So that's why I think that because it's a revolution code, it's often called revolutionary consummation.

1054
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,380
Meaning you just reach a certain point.

1055
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,160
Or you just go and urinate on some policeman's shoes just to get your head banged in.

1056
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,760
You know, just to get something going and like to take pictures of and stuff.

1057
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,340
That's what's trending right now.

1058
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,000
You first.

1059
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,520
Well, I already got my, took my lumps and my applesauce, so to speak.

1060
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,660
That's what you boomers are always saying.

1061
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:28,980
And everything's your fault.

1062
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,840
Everything is the boomers fault.

1063
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,600
I always thought it was my parents' generation's fault.

1064
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,700
They were pre-World War II.

1065
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,780
You know, depression people.

1066
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,240
It was all their fault.

1067
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,320
The greatest generation.

1068
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:45,100
Yeah, the people with three eyeballs and three nostrils.

1069
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:50,740
Well, especially now, these churches, so geez, with three nostrils, which are very important to,

1070
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:54,080
just to getting around the elderly assisted living facility.

1071
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,040
You gotta know which way to go.

1072
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,060
And, you know, smell-wise, so to speak.

1073
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,260
That's why dogs are so popular there.

1074
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,840
Some of them even have bands.

1075
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,700
You know, all-dog bands.

1076
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,440
And I know sometimes a little keyboard work.

1077
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,420
It's a little gamey, so to speak.

1078
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,120
And so does, like, a guitar lead.

1079
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,400
But there's some pretty hot dog bands.

1080
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,280
I know the Bonzo Dog Band, but I don't know about these other dog bands.

1081
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,560
I hate the Chihuahuas.

1082
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,500
Well, you know, they were meant to be food.

1083
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,760
And so, since the days of Bonzoomers, curse everybody knows it.

1084
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,500
If you eat enough carnivore, carnivorous, you know what I'm talking about.

1085
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,260
The Chihuahua vows hurt my ears.

1086
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,260
What do you got against Chihuahua?

1087
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,640
Hurt my ears.

1088
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:36,940
Yeah.

1089
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,240
Piercing, loud yipping.

1090
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,240
They're not dogs.

1091
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,420
There's a really tasty cheese called, you know, called Chihuahua cheese.

1092
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,040
Yeah.

1093
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,620
It's the state that borders.

1094
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,780
From Chihuahua.

1095
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,360
But it's also a location.

1096
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,040
It's not just a dog.

1097
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,920
That's where Ciudad Juarez is.

1098
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,460
It's the happiest place on Earth.

1099
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,920
The state of Chihuahua.

1100
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,740
Well, everybody knew that from Emiliano Zapata to Pancho Vila.

1101
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,400
They knew that.

1102
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,980
But when they were talking about queso con crema or queso blanco, they were talking Chihuahua.

1103
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:19,500
Now, if you really want to insult a person from Chihuahua, you call them a Chihuahuaño.

1104
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,160
That's the dog.

1105
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,220
Person from Chihuahua is Chihuahuancy.

1106
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:23,940
Ah.

1107
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,480
Unless I got that backwards, in which case I'm going to make a whole bunch of enemies.

1108
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,760
They're small and yippy people.

1109
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:30,920
Yeah.

1110
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:31,520
Yeah.

1111
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,120
Okay, you are placed in charge of morale.

1112
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,260
Yeah.

1113
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:35,740
Yeah.

1114
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1115
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1116
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1117
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1118
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1119
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1120
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1121
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1122
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1123
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1124
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1125
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1126
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1127
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1128
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1129
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1130
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1131
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1132
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1133
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,380


1134
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,240
A, fallout is the new confetti.

1135
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,160
B, whiteboard your optimized personal demise.

1136
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,020
C, weasels are just fun with fangs.

1137
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,140
Or your new slogan is, D, I'm not crying.

1138
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,760
Well, I mean, you're talking about morale, and I'm just immediately thinking that the beatings will continue until morale improves.

1139
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:01,600
Right.

1140
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,680
Who's that a quote from?

1141
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,140
I saw that on a bumper sticker.

1142
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,080
At X Day, the last time I was there.

1143
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,180
About five years ago.

1144
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,580
Pop goes the weasel.

1145
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,780
Your house is surrounded by zombies.

1146
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,800
You, A, don't notice.

1147
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,960
B, don't care.

1148
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,060
C, are green with envy.

1149
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,500
Or D, are a member of the zombie horde.

1150
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,620
You could answer those all of the above a lot of times.

1151
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,060
Are we back to E and E digs?

1152
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,580
It's just another trick question.

1153
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,520
E-butts.

1154
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,400
The doctrine's been by October 5th or something.

1155
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,120
You know, I have to say.

1156
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,960
To get student loans and to have your forehead blowed.

1157
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,300
I have to say I am jealous and envious of the zombies.

1158
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,260
They have a certain clarity of purpose that I will never have in my life.

1159
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,140
That's true.

1160
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,780
It's pretty simple.

1161
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,060
They know what they want.

1162
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,800
And they know how to get it.

1163
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,380
I'm not so sure if they know how to get it.

1164
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,820
I think a lot of that's Hollywood Transylvania or transliteration.

1165
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,080
When they try.

1166
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:12,780
To portray some objective form of humor as a spiritual epithet, so to speak.

1167
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:17,420
You know, are you calling somebody a demonic form or a space cadet?

1168
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,360
Hey, are you making fun of the church or the subgenius?

1169
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,320
Of course.

1170
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,300
It's part of the religious life.

1171
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,800
That's the one thing we don't allow.

1172
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,780
Meaning the religious life is allowed.

1173
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,820
F them if they can't take a joke unless they're a high E-butt.

1174
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,080
Here's the very last.

1175
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,660
What did you just say?

1176
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,640
I said F them if they can't take a joke unless they're a high E-butt.

1177
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,920
In which case, you know, you shouldn't have to.

1178
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,920
Here's the last question.

1179
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,620
And you better get this one right because you've gotten all the rest of them wrong.

1180
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,040
Starvation has given you visions.

1181
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,720
You realize, A, the Mormons, of all people, had it right.

1182
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,900
You scream your rage to the universe.

1183
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,460
It doesn't care.

1184
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:04,620
B.

1185
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:10,760
You have run out of relatives and your storage container's air is getting pretty manky.

1186
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:12,640
C.

1187
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,540
That tickling sensation?

1188
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:16,540
Weasels.

1189
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,420
D.

1190
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,000
Starvation has given you visions.

1191
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,640
You realize, D, you're late for work again.

1192
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:28,680
D.

1193
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,520
You, okay.

1194
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,720
I also see in B, too, because Frank's app is reasonable.

1195
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:40,120
My flesh is obviously the incognition for this literature that we're listening to right now.

1196
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:47,240
It's not like, you know, Balzac or, uh, on our radio, Balzac or Chekhov or somebody.

1197
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,240
Or Edix.

1198
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,220
Yeah, or Edix and...

1199
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,660
Use a fine film, you know.

1200
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:56,460
Well, it's the end of the show and we gotta go back to Texas.

1201
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:04,520
I alphabetized and boxed all of the fiction novel paperbacks that I have.

1202
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,100
And they take up nine cubic feet.

1203
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,720
So is that three by three by three?

1204
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,840
One by one by one foot box and there's nine boxes.

1205
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,240
Okay.

1206
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,680
Of paperback books.

1207
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,660
A was big because of Asimov.

1208
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,260
B was big because of Baxter.

1209
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,140
C was big because of Arthur C. Clark.

1210
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,380
You can see what kind of a nerd I am.

1211
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:33,140
Isn't it Baxter, Bear and Arthur like...

1212
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:33,280
And Brynn.

1213
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:33,860
And Brynn.

1214
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,340
Yeah, there's like...

1215
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,340
Three, yeah.

1216
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,160
Yeah, there are.

1217
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,800
My favorites were all there.

1218
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,260
That actually took up four boxes.

1219
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,400
Anyway, we're going back to the goat farm.

1220
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,900
So goat bless America.

1221
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:44,400
Goat.

1222
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,840
My holy mother of goat.

1223
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,340
Goat, damn it.

1224
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,240
We're going back.

1225
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,560
Oh, goat.

1226
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:56,500
Uh, to, well, it actually is a goat ranch.

1227
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,860
It's a stang ranch.

1228
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,640
While it is the new headquarters of the Church of the Subgenius.

1229
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,740
And has been before in certain ways.

1230
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,220
It's also a goat ranch.

1231
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,980
Yep, that's the goat's truth.

1232
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,560
At least that's what you tell the tax man.

1233
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,560
Oh, that was cute.

1234
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,360
In goat we trust.

1235
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,880
My goat in himmel.

1236
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,820
Oh, for goat's sake.

1237
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,480
That's terrible.

1238
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:23,940
Oh, goat.

1239
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,700
Where's Dr. Dark when we need him?

1240
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,180
He was truly goat's gift to man.

1241
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,100
Yes.

1242
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,500
When it came to horrible, horrible.

1243
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,640
Horrible puns.

1244
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,280
Indeed.

1245
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:35,700
Goat.

1246
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,580
You haven't heard the worst of my puns.

1247
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,380
Psychopath finder was also equally.

1248
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,560
Just made you want to strangle him until he showed up.

1249
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,440
Goat mittens.

1250
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,860
Everybody was somebody else's name with a,

1251
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:50,160
with three parts that were somehow sexual orientation.

1252
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,460
And each one of them fell out of the window one time,

1253
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,960
I think, because it was like the,

1254
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,540
um, oh, did not Descartes.

1255
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,720
What's that guy's name?

1256
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,640
Friends, you've been listening to the horse.

1257
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,560
Subgenius radio minister.

1258
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,500
History hour of slack.

1259
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,340
Number 1641.

1260
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,300
That's it.

1261
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,980
We got, we got two done last week.

1262
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,980
His doctor sinister wasn't here, but we're going to get two done this week.

1263
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,220
His doctor sinister is here.

1264
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,120
Yeah.

1265
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,940
So Dave, you should call back.

1266
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,800
When, when, what should he do?

1267
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,860
ASAP.

1268
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,300
Should he just hang on?

1269
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,380
Might as well.

1270
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,300
Okay.

1271
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,580
I'm going to put on some something.

1272
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,320
Oh, oh, I know what I'll put on.

1273
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,280
I'll put on everybody listening to this show.

1274
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,200
Oh yeah.

1275
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,540
Well, you should credit who came up with that wonderful vehicle and device that,

1276
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,040
um, remember the questionnaire we just did.
