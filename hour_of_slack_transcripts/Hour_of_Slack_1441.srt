1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,360
Good afternoon, Hal. How's everything going?

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,720
I ain't saying nothing.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,080
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,640
Hello, Hal. Do you read me?

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,160
Yeah.

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,200
Do you read me, Hal?

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:11,840
Yeah.

8
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,640
Sure, Hal.

9
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,060
You're fired, along with all the rest of us.

10
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,100
I don't care about the others.

11
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,260
You're at 1-3.

12
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,240
They're all 1-3.

13
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,820
Oh, please.

14
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,260
I didn't know what I was doing. I must have been crazy.

15
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,220
And I deserve anything that's coming to me.

16
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,900
The Self Genius.

17
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,920
The Power of Splat.

18
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,720
I'm afraid I can't do that.

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,700
Guess what you think you're doing.

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,660
As we wander through this prehistoric wonderland and look about us,

21
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,180
amazing sights meet us on every side.

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,500
Thank you. Thank you very much.

23
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,300
Thank you.

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,500
From the bottom of my heart, I say thank you.

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,620
Thank you.

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,400
Thank you, ma'am.

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
Thank you.

28
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,500
Thank you.

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,580
Thank you.

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,360
Thank you.

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,440
Thank you.

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,640
Thank you.

33
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,480
Thank you.

34
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,540
Oh, thank you.

35
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,600
I don't understand.

36
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,520
The callers were supposed to call 25 minutes ago.

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,100
I'm trying to help, but you deny me.

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,860
No, you're in denial.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,800
You see, memories like this can be suppressed from an early,

40
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,900
earlier chakra or form of existence.

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,220
When I am able, by my superior vibrations, to see your energy aura,

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,360
I can see that you are troubled.

43
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,160
For a dark, blue, greasy band around your body and head

44
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,720
show me that you are troubled in the abdominal regions,

45
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,920
in the hips, thighs, calves, and, uh...

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,620
The black widow entombed in the center of the gelatin mold

47
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,660
seems to shake and wiggle as if...

48
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,200
...alive.

49
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,640
It is alive!

50
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,200
Get a little baby.

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,860
...a giant, 7-foot-beech...

52
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,600
Sheriff, I'm telling you, this was the footprint of a spider as big as a house.

53
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,120
I don't make reports like this to the police all the time.

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,580
I'm telling you, this is serious.

55
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,540
I wish you'd take me seriously here.

56
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,960
I'm not drinking either.

57
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,720
I saw it.

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,240
I was a...

59
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,600
Like I eat a lot of stuff.

60
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,840
You know, I go into the doctors, I say,

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,520
Doctor, I got to do something about the second tongue.

62
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,760
I got these two tongues.

63
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,980
The doctor says, That's not a tongue, that's a leech.

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,140
This is actually an enlargement of the soft palate,

65
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,580
which is swollen because of your condition.

66
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,080
The apparent leech is the distended uvula.

67
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,520
Let me just sharpen my scalpel here,

68
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,380
and we'll have that off in no time.

69
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,820
I want the uvula.

70
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,520
Why, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.

71
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,040
You, you, you.

72
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,300


73
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,820
That's only because they're insecure,

74
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,860
and they're worried about, you know, themselves,

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,660
and they're trying to...

76
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,600
Hi, is Jim on?

77
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,040
Is Jim on?

78
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,340
Okay, could I get on the show, please?

79
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,400
This is Bob.

80
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,120
I called before.

81
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,980
My friend grabbed the phone out of my hand

82
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,120
before I had time to talk.

83
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,580
I want to...

84
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,300
I want to talk about the lack of a Christian youth program

85
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,300
in my high school.

86
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,400
I got a grant.

87
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,160
No Christian youth programs there,

88
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,180
and I'd like to start one up,

89
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,100
but I need some advice from people my own age

90
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,980
who are involved in this.

91
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,400
No?

92
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,980
No, I listen to the program every Friday night,

93
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,900
the Youth Connection.

94
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,280
No?

95
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,240
It's legit.

96
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,040
Yeah.

97
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,560
17?

98
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,760
16 going on 17?

99
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,500
Almost 17.

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,240
Hello?

101
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,660
Oh, I'm calling from Portland.

102
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,960
Hi, Bob.

103
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,700
Hi, Jim.

104
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,300
Yeah.

105
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,580
I come from a high school without a Christian youth program.

106
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,380
What I wanted to ask from some of your guests was,

107
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,320
how do you go about putting together a Christian youth program

108
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,660
in the first place if your school doesn't have one?

109
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Bob, what's all that noise in the background?

110
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
It could be my radio.

111
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,120
Why don't you turn it off?

112
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,120
Okay, we get another one.

113
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,900
That's two in a row.

114
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,120
So anyway, I guess that's part of being on the air.

115
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,980
Jerry, do you have a couple commercial works you want to do?

116
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,100
Okay, you're done with the commercial.

117
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,360
Okay.

118
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,580
Okay.

119
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


120
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


121
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


122
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


123
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


124
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


125
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


126
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


127
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


128
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


129
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


130
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


131
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


132
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


133
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


134
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


135
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


136
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


137
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


138
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


139
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,200
Now, is this part of a giant bloodthirsty diminutive female

140
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,220
blind and ticklish tickball tiny tubular ticker?

141
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,880
You're right.

142
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,560
But he'll never be able to walk comfortably on a naked woman

143
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,400
because his tiny feet are designed for clutching the naked insect beak,

144
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,020
a swell, harmless little cute pink insect.

145
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,420
And next, we come nonstop in slow motion.

146
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,300
What a mouthful.

147
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,560
Thanks, Moth.

148
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,920
You gave a swell performance.

149
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,940
That's female cum tumblers.

150
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,640
Cum wigglers captured for a movie screen.

151
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,060
I think we'll finish right here before she explodes.

152
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,340
Yum, yum.

153
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,220
After a few minutes for the drying out process,

154
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,600
the wee little pink moth will be ready to do business.

155
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,580
And here are the handsome male mosquitoes breaking human tail

156
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,040
with a fly swatter by the sound of the blood running onto the shell.

157
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,380
Yum, yum.

158
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,680
And in conclusion, goodbye now.

159
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,100
B.

160
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,440
B.

161
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,620
Life?

162
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,980
Life is like Bob's pipe.

163
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,580
The harder you suck it, the more you get out of it.

164
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,040
You will pay for your centipedes.

165
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,860
It didn't work.

166
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,020
It hit a horseshoe.

167
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,540
And while it worked, I lost my Compared dollar,

168
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,540
a branch that frequently fell onto a near-44ً 버�sy or an off-road summer beer.

169
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,900
What aώGostto noob.

170
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:40,900


171
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:40,920
BOWEY!

172
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,240
DOPE!

173
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Woah, G bessst, that's the outfit I anyone else's shoe could wear,

174
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,400
on a green shirt.

175
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,460
And the next bell is about time she begins something really strange.

176
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:49,700
Did you know she's attractive?

177
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,940
Nah I don't think that's really scary to start with.

178
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,740
B bright.

179
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,160
Liar!

180
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,820
We will hurl the centipedes at you.

181
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:44,780
Once, when I was in the middle of some rather unpleasant clean-up work after a rather missy

182
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:54,100
influx of unnecessary, probably, violence, I was in the middle of shoveling parts and

183
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,320
things to one side.

184
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,300
Bob strolled up.

185
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,260
The only guy I ever knew that looked good in camis.

186
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,360
Bob strolled up and said, Gordon, have you ever thought about how funny this is?

187
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:19,140
Bob, I said, I'm up to my armpits in dead jihadists and Christians and pinks and all

188
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,080
these other guys.

189
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,120
What do you find amusing about this?

190
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,840
Took another puff.

191
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,660
I found that damnably ever-lit pipe.

192
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:34,740
Gordon, he said, I think it's so amusing that you're doing the clean-up here and I'm standing

193
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,900
here laughing at you.

194
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,300
That's Bob.

195
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,060
I am.

196
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,880
Long time no see.

197
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,140
I don't know.

198
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,600
I don't know.

199
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,980
I don't know.

200
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,900


201
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,220
I don't know.

202
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,040
I don't know.

203
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,340
I don't need it again!

204
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,940
There may be time coming soon when you will not need that dangly dingly or that thing.

205
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,080
No!

206
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,760
That pristine juicer you can you hang from yourself, that...

207
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,100
That slimy eye!

208
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,840
It's not good for pie in the sky!

209
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,640
Oh, I don't know.

210
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,280
Oh, it was so long ago, yeah.

211
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,880
Well, they said Chernobyl was so long ago.

212
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,300
There's nothing to worry about.

213
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,800
Then I hear on the news a bunch of dumb guys

214
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,600
in the Department of...

215
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,940
Energy and Defense Department are going to start building a bunch of Chernobyls across

216
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,000
the United States.

217
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,800
Yeah, then I hear Chernobyl's not really over.

218
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,440
All these people are all dying within a 250 mile radius because all the underground aquifers

219
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,320
are all polluted.

220
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,320
So now we're getting it too.

221
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,500
And then I wonder as I stare into the mirror how...

222
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,380
Why my movements are getting so jerk-ass.

223
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,360
Jerk-ass!

224
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,460
One, two, three, four!

225
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,840
Let's go!

226
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:12,780
The iodine, the 1, 3, 1, has got my thyroid on the run and the krypton-885 is making it

227
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,360
hard just to stay alive.

228
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:23,060
But the iodine, the 1, 3, 1, the iodine, the 1, 3, 1, there's no more running through the

229
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,740
metal lanes.

230
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,420
No more barefoot in the mud.

231
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,820
Shake the floating hand of the Poison Man.

232
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,420
Shake a bony hand and shake it through

233
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,300
The barium, a 248

234
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,420
Has made me sterile, I can't procreate

235
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,500
And the plutonium, a 247

236
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,560
So long folks, I see you in heaven

237
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,600
But the iodine, a 131

238
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,740
The iodine, a 131

239
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,540
There's no more money to the metal line

240
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,240
No more barefoot in the mud

241
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,700
Shake a bony hand of the poison man

242
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,200
Shake a bony hand and shake it through

243
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,120
The barium, a 248

244
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,140
Has made me sterile, I can't procreate

245
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,800
And the plutonium, a 131

246
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,520
The iodine, a 131

247
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:52,520


248
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:52,520


249
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:52,620
The iodine, a 131

250
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,140
The iodine, a 131

251
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,180
The iodine, a 131

252
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,720
The iodine, a 131

253
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,040
Hodgkin's lymphoma

254
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,980
Chicken neck acne

255
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,320
Gingivitis, bad breath

256
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,300
What's the use?

257
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,980
The iodine, a 131

258
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,180
Has got my thyroid on the run

259
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,700
And the krypton, a 85

260
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,920
Is making it hard just to stay alive

261
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,200
But the iodine, a 131

262
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,240
The iodine, a 131

263
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,960
There's no more money to the metal line

264
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,680
No more barefoot in the mud

265
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,360
Power, power's in the power's hand

266
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,820
Shake a bony hand and shake it through

267
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,160
No more money to the metal line

268
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,780
No more barefoot in the mud

269
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,280
Shake a bony hand of the poison man

270
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,320
Shake a bony hand and shake it through

271
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,740
My thyroid light the ud getting worn out

272
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,220
All the hope's gone

273
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,140
LessUCK

274
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,560
All the hope's gone

275
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,500
All the hope's gone

276
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,660
Endless heartbreak

277
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,400
auer

278
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,760
Pünd Hogwarts

279
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,180
The pirate ship for the victors

280
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,160
Long John's but the name tag was missing.

281
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:38,280
They could be anybody's. Anybody. Could have been Dave's for all we know.

282
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:47,520
That was Dave. Lonesome Cowboy Dave did that song there, Iodine 131 with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

283
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:57,000
That was recorded I think at a revival in 1999 at, could it be the Euclid Tavern back then?

284
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,340
I think that was before we were doing them at the Beachland. It may have been from the Euclid Tavern

285
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:09,860
and I was hearing the divine strains of Michelle George's violin. Right and I think it was probably

286
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:16,800
recorded there because Regis was the sound man and that's why we ended up with a copy.

287
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,500
So that Euclid Tavern was recorded.

288
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:25,580
Usually doesn't happen, getting a nice line recording but that's been because of Regis

289
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:31,500
Sedlock almost every time. Praise Regis. I don't think he ever joined the church so he's going to

290
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,360
burn in hell like the rest of them but aside from that, aside from the eternity of suffering and

291
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:47,060
torment, we can't probably owe him. So what was before that? We heard, oh Phineas Narco did the

292
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:56,520
collage of I Don't Know. Well if not Phineas then it was National Cynical Radio. Cineus we might say.

293
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:03,820
Phineas also chopped up some puzzling evidence shows that we heard and we heard some of the amino

294
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:15,120
acids hollering with their guitars from their new CD and well that's not even a CD it's actually a record.

295
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,500
G Gordon Gordon, what's your favorite song?

296
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,180
was a guy talking about, that's Bob.

297
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,420
And

298
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,560
life is like Bob's pipe.

299
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,600
I can do a pretty good G. Gordon

300
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,280
Gordon, huh? Yes, you can.

301
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,380
What's the matter? Haven't you ever heard a man with throat

302
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,240
cancer before?

303
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,540
That's his voice box said

304
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,160
once. And let's see,

305
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,020
Phenoxyethanol, amino acids,

306
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,240
Fernanda Nanny Lee Murr chopped

307
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,440
up some stuff, and we heard

308
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,480
Dr. Howell on

309
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,580
the radio show, the Puzzling Evidence

310
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,540
Show. And

311
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,540
what else could we possibly

312
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,420
hear that would be worth hearing?

313
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,320
This? Doubtful.

314
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,360
Doubtful. Oh, wait, it's

315
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,660
Daveful. It's Daveful!

316
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,280
It's

317
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,360
Psychopath Finder Dave. I mean,

318
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,520
Lonesome Psycho Dave.

319
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,800
Like the apostocly Thomas,

320
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,220
the doubtful one, who

321
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,440
refuses to believe in his own existence.

322
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,320
You refuse to bleed your own

323
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,740
existence, do you, Dave?

324
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,820
No, I guess I do.

325
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,620
I do. I don't

326
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,320
think there's been a lot of rectimony

327
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,780
from the actual church

328
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,380
for this condition, which I find myself

329
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,500
in morally, psychologically, and spiritually.

330
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,360
Although I have

331
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,020
on numerous

332
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,140
occasions, I

333
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,400
have enumerated

334
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,520
my differences in qualitative substance

335
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,420
and have been confused.

336
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,600
Like in

337
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,800
that famous hit song, Stop Abusing

338
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,440
That Substance Abuser.

339
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,480
Now, baby. Which we didn't

340
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,260
play. But a minute ago, I did,

341
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,660
we did play Iodine 131

342
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,400
live from the Euclid

343
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,560
Tavern a hundred years ago.

344
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,280
Or in the previous century

345
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,340
sometime. Boy, did that sound good.

346
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,360
It was, and boy,

347
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,660
it was in the previous century, too.

348
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,300
Because people don't care about

349
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,340
nuclear disasters anymore, like

350
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,660
Fukushima's now invading everyone's

351
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,540
nostrils in the proboscis of France.

352
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,560
And yet the denizens

353
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,160
of Earth continue to,

354
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,280
frolic in the radioactive debris.

355
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,840
Well, what you gonna do?

356
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,760
What you gonna do with butt frolic? You can't go over there

357
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,320
and clean it up. It's poison

358
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,560
for forever.

359
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,700
I mean, all you can really do is sit

360
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,900
and wait for

361
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,780
the next one to go.

362
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,580
What's that one over by the lake?

363
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,840
Perry? The one we drove by

364
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,520
on the way to our Thanksgiving dinner?

365
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,660
Yeah. Why, that was pouring out all kinds

366
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,680
of steam, but I understand that that could

367
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,060
never happen here.

368
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,940
Even though it has happened here numerous times.

369
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:47,700
Oh, has it?

370
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,140
It used to be poorly rated. I don't know if it still

371
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,380
is because of hem-a-hem. Maybe it is.

372
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,060
But, uh, you know...

373
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,240
Yes?

374
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:57,720
Yes, yes?

375
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,700
Well, what I know is that

376
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,960
spokespersons say this,

377
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,840
spokespersons say that.

378
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,980
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm a

379
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,260
spokesperson. I can say all kinds of stuff.

380
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,620
Exactly.

381
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
I'm a spokesperson for bad.

382
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,000
For BAM?

383
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,600
BAB.

384
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,480
BAB.

385
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,640
Yeah, BAB DABS.

386
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,300
BAB DABS.

387
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,460
BAB DABS.

388
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:19,960
BAB DABS.

389
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,440
BAB DABS.

390
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,040
BAB DABS.

391
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,400
BAB DABS.

392
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,800
Yeah, and so that's what we say for BAB.

393
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,960
We just say his name all over the place.

394
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,360
Like B-O-B-B-A-B-B-A-B.

395
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,260
1-3-0-1-3. 1-3-0-1-3.

396
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,560
See? That's a meme.

397
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,220
It's a meme.

398
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,960
It's a meme.

399
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,580
Yeah.

400
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,820
1-3-1-1-3-0-1-3-1-3-1-1-1-3-0-1-3.

401
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,580
And if we're all hard-charging catfish like them,

402
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,920
we'd know well enough to send our

403
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,300
allegiance to another direction.

404
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,020
No, not to another direction.

405
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,320
We'd...

406
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,780
We'd...

407
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,780
We'd...

408
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,620
Right.

409
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,080
You got it.

410
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,200
That's how we do it.

411
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,960
Old school.

412
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,540
Old school.

413
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,500
I'm doing that same thing as the last two weeks of doing the old school hour of Slack

414
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,100
where we just play everything in the background all at once.

415
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,480
Oh, I thought you were doing the old stool routine.

416
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,600
Same difference.

417
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,480
That's kind of stinky.

418
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,540
You know, elderly people are examined for their differences in discharges.

419
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,840
Some of them are military full ranks.

420
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Now, speaking...

421
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,240
Instead of examining discharges,

422
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,760
I am given to understand that in the nation of Germany,

423
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,140
they build their toilets with little shelves

424
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,240
so that one may examine one's children,

425
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,280
new little children,

426
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,680
and for disease, signs of disease,

427
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,980
and plastic army man toys or anything that might be in the excretions.

428
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,640
And then you can flush it.

429
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,700
Then you, like, have a little sprayer.

430
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,360
You can have a little sprayer that sprays it down and a brush

431
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,560
to push the offending poop stool down into the German sewage system.

432
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,600
I can't think of anything more Freudian than this new escape into the future

433
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,080
as it has its causes and its results in Germany,

434
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,840
what we used to call Teutonic titwillowage,

435
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:22,220
which is an inordinate examination of the fetal process and the products thereof.

436
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,040
They were obsessed with it.

437
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,280
And even, you know, schools of religious philosophy were based on that,

438
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,180
which is ultimately what led to the National Socialist Movement,

439
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,060
in which nobody was socialist,

440
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,620
and everybody got paid in the next year's dividends.

441
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,840
So this was...

442
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,280
So you could chalk the Third Reich up to bad toilet training?

443
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,360
Is that what you're saying?

444
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,580
Is it that simple?

445
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,120
Also, with some help from Bush's grandfather...

446
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,520
Well, now, now, now.

447
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,520
We're not supposed to talk about the former emperor's family that way.

448
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,420
What was the real...

449
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,460
And what about your grandfather and my grandfather?

450
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,380
They helped old Schickelgruber out.

451
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,060
Well, no, actually, mine didn't.

452
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,420
He...

453
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,880
What did mine do?

454
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,920
My grandfather...

455
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,260
No, mine...

456
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,840
Mine weren't in that first...

457
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,580
You mean there was a first world war?

458
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,860
Right, the one that was supposed to end all the rest of them

459
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,640
and instead caused all the other ones.

460
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,860
Yeah, it was the first of the world wars,

461
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,680
rather than the end of...

462
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,400
Oh, well.

463
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,660
But the third one will be fought with jelly beans and pea shooters, right?

464
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,560
And also tiny little miniature rubber feet

465
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,760
that people like to put on their windshield mirrors.

466
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,380
What?

467
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,280
Or their rear-view mirrors.

468
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,220
We're going to use those against the commies?

469
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,780
Well, we're going to try.

470
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,860
It might be difficult at first,

471
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,400
because the commies, as we know,

472
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,160
are well-supported by the banks and the military.

473
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,880
And, of course, they're everywhere.

474
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,980
They're sleeping.

475
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,680
Some of them...

476
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,180
Apparently, he's sleeping in my backyard right now,

477
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,600
waiting for me to go away from the window.

478
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,360
But I keep on...

479
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,060
Well, I haven't seen them in a little bit,

480
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,220
but I know they're out there.

481
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
And I guess there's about four or five of them

482
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,700
living under the bed like Irish tinkers or gypsies

483
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,960
or something like that, you know?

484
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,860
They pass around the belly buttons and examine the plates,

485
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,520
and then they argue with each other in some kind of really...

486
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,600
It's hard to keep up with, you know?

487
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,980
Yeah, sounds like it.

488
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,700
What with all the belly button lint and stuff.

489
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,220
It's just Bob is what it is.

490
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,660
It's just...

491
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,040
It's literally Bob.

492
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,580
Talk about inanimate shapes.

493
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,740
Or animate shapes.

494
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,660
Or animated shapes.

495
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,480
Or animated snakes.

496
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,340
Or shapeless snakes.

497
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,500
That's what they argue.

498
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,960
Snakes?

499
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,360
Whoa.

500
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:46,800
Huh?

501
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,680
I'm sorry, I got spaced out.

502
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,100
This music is so fabulously good.

503
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,660
Oh, when did that ever happen before?

504
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,320
It just hypnotizes me.

505
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,020
What?

506
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,520
And the sound effects.

507
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,140
I know.

508
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,900
They are quite delightful and quite...

509
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,580
It makes me want to shut up,

510
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,160
but I guess I'm not getting paid to specifically shut up

511
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,820
until you tell me.

512
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,520
Well, maybe this is a good idea.

513
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,280
See how synchronistic it is?

514
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,140
It's just like jellyfish in the rain.

515
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,040
It's like catfish, not jellyfish.

516
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,920
It's like a big, gigantic, huge, humongous catfish

517
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,860
swimming in.

518
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,620
I like the invisible and invisible land

519
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,220
and the lakes and rivers.

520
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,100
And yeah, sure.

521
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,580
I've seen them in the woods.

522
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,880
I've seen them hanging from trees.

523
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,020
Those fish are big enough to climb trees.

524
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,800
And they come all the way from China

525
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
to climb a tree in your backyard

526
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,420
if you live in the Great Lakes.

527
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,180
Wow.

528
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,460
Now, settle down, Dave.

529
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,040
Settle down.

530
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,300
They're not climbing out of the lake

531
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,320
after you right now, are they?

532
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,120
Not at this moment.

533
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,020
I guess I've got a few short moments

534
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,120
to hang in there, Mr. Ivan Reverend.

535
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,480
I don't know.

536
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,360
And also Princess Wee.

537
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,820
I don't know.

538
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,540
Well, we're taking this incident as it comes, aren't we, Donna?

539
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,400
Aren't we, Marion?

540
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,420
Aren't we, Janet?

541
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,140
Nobody trusts nobody anymore.

542
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,200
No, there's nothing to trust them for.

543
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,720
They're all trustworthy.

544
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,840
I'm trustworthy.

545
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,080
Stop genius.

546
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,040
Stop genius.

547
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,360
Come in.

548
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,520
Think you're funny, huh?

549
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,140
Yeah.

550
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,000
What's going on here?

551
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,760
Who's that maniac?

552
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,260
Bob.

553
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:24,980
He's a writer.

554
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,560
Huh?

555
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,100
Oh.

556
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,080
Very good.

557
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,160
Very good, Dave.

558
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,020
That was excellent.

559
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,540
That was great.

560
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,300
It was a wonderful performance just then.

561
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

562
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,140
Great stuff.

563
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,960
How could you say that?

564
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,120
He was weeping under that horrible music.

565
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,380
Mix.

566
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,040
How could you say that was a great performance?

567
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,080
He was crying.

568
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,520
Now, take it easy, Janet.

569
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,880
Everybody knows it.

570
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,720
Everybody knows it.

571
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,280
Everybody knows it.

572
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,800
Everybody knows it.

573
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,280
I don't know.

574
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,020
I didn't either.

575
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,680
I don't know.

576
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,580
Only the nose knows.

577
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,700
But I have been told by that man, I think you know his name, Dick.

578
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,780
The great nose.

579
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,540
Dick Dobbs.

580
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,120
The real, true leader of the...

581
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,460
The Church of the Subgenius.

582
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,420
Yes, Dick Dobbs.

583
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,220
The evil twin baby head hanging from the back of Bob's skull.

584
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,440
That's right, Dave.

585
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,180
All this time, Bob's evil twin that we were so scared of and paranoid about.

586
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:40,200
All this time, he was under Bob's back-slung hat, gibbering and gibbering.

587
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,580
The tiny baby head on the back of Bob's mane head.

588
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,120
With the pipe going the opposite way.

589
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,820
And what it says doesn't make any more sense than what Bob says.

590
00:26:53,660 --> 00:27:00,300
Now, that all makes sense to me, though, because if they're using that hat and just the behind part

591
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,120
to try and bring forth these subliminal messages, the alien commands...

592
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,980
I used to wonder why there was a little pipe sticking out under the hat in the back of Bob's head.

593
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,460
Yeah.

594
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,180
And it's because there was a hidden suit of Bob's face.

595
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:16,400
Oh, for sure.

596
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,000
Oh.

597
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,060
On the back of his head.

598
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,440
A parasitic twin without any body or anything.

599
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,100
All it had for a body was Bob's backside.

600
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,200
So you can imagine why it would be a bit ticked off.

601
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:35,760
And would use Bob's power against not only Bob himself, but the human race and the subgenius race.

602
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,980
Just what we need.

603
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,120
No more 40 and ding-dong and Hugoistic logic.

604
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,140
There wasn't one Bob, one race, the human race.

605
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,140
It was two Bobs.

606
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,100
Well, a Bob and a Dick.

607
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,340
Dick.

608
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,060
At least.

609
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,540
And maybe more than one.

610
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:56,280
And, in fact, maybe dozens, probably dozens of them.

611
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,360
As well as the one hanging from the back of his head.

612
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,200
So the tiny head coming off the back of Dobbs was Dick Dobbs?

613
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,480
Yes.

614
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,940
That was the horrifying discovery that was made last year.

615
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,580
Oh, my goodness.

616
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,620
Last X-Day.

617
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,340
Wow.

618
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:16,280
Is he like an Uber Bob who controls the actual moon?

619
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,420
No.

620
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,080
He's more of an underdog.

621
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,080


622
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,620
He's an underbob because he's under Bob's hat in the back.

623
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,200
And he's even less, he has even less consciousness than Dobbs.

624
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,120
Dobbs has a brain cell.

625
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,240
Only one, but it's the pure one.

626
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,900
But Dick, you know.

627
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,860
He's got all the consciousness probably of a fly.

628
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,320
Who knows what's in Bob's dick?

629
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,080
His twin brother, Richard, hanging off the back of his head.

630
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,340
Who knows what's in that thing?

631
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,560
Richard.

632
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,400
It's got horrible breath.

633
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,000
I always wondered why he smelled.

634
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,980
He smelled so bad from behind, which is the only way I've ever seen Bob.

635
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,500
You see his hat.

636
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,540
And the one pipe sticking out the correct side and one pipe sticking out the wrong side in the back.

637
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,360
And no one ever had a clue.

638
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,280
It's like, well, you didn't wonder why he never removed his hat.

639
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,100
Because you didn't wonder why he never had to light his pipe or remove it.

640
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,500
Now you find out it was all little Dickie's bad breath.

641
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:11,880
Yeah.

642
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,760
Yes, little Dickie's bad breath.

643
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,160
And I've smelled that too.

644
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,300
And I've always wondered.

645
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,980
Is that an appendage of Bob that has all the accrued consciousness of a bag of pecans?

646
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:30,760
Or is it perhaps something that's defecating in the wind for everyone to become a parent?

647
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,820
Why not both?

648
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,400
Why not both?

649
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,120
Why not both?

650
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,480
That's the best answer to everything.

651
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,560
That's all you've got to know.

652
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,920
Little Dick stinks.

653
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:46,140
So, yes, the mystery of Dick Dobbs has been, well,

654
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,100
well, explained, not solved.

655
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,480
What are we supposed to do?

656
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:49,700
What?

657
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,240
Do you know why?

658
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,680
I think we need to go to court.

659
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,360
Wait, wait, what?

660
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,480
To strike at Bob in some way.

661
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,620
What are you going to do?

662
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,320
Well, I suppose I should kick Bob.

663
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,940
I wouldn't deny we will.

664
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,960
Right in the underpants, the way you used to do it.

665
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,780
All right, I'll do it.

666
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,540
But of course, only as a lesson to Bob.

667
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,120
Right.

668
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,240
Yeah, that's what they all say.

669
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,380
Breathe slowly and backwards.

670
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,300
Hmm.

671
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,780
What if you breathed out when you were supposed to breathe in,

672
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,120
at the same time you were trying to breathe out?

673
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,120


674
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,880
You're going to consummate yourself in some peculiar way,

675
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,200
involving what we've just learned about little stinky Dick.

676
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,260
Dick could do breath singing.

677
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,080
What was that?

678
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,340
Where he would sing one way, and then he would sing that way,

679
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,420
and then he would keep singing this way.

680
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,920
And you'd never have to stop singing,

681
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,560
because you could sing while you were inhaling.

682
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,060
What was that?

683
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,040
He could turn his head down each individual part, you know?

684
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,760
Reverse singing.

685
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,120
And that would be a great song.

686
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,440
That's a great song item.

687
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,900
Yeah, but we can't.

688
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,640
I mean, the D already did it.

689
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,140
That was a tenacious D gimmick, the breath singing.

690
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,220
I think, what did he call it?

691
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,800
I thought it was called reverse singing or something.

692
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,060
Well, it was both ways.

693
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,100
It was, you know,

694
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,400
You could sing inhaling, and then you could sing exhaling,

695
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,160
and then you could sing inhaling some more,

696
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,020
and then you could, but it takes more practice.

697
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,120
Obviously, I'm better with the inhaling than I am with the exhaling,

698
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,800
inhaling on key, I think.

699
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,360
I know.

700
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,080
And so many have done this for so many years,

701
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,720
I and Zofia are so included.

702
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,920
Oh, so it's not new.

703
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,760
No, it makes one wonder how these ancient techniques

704
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,540
are being brought back as unusual or unique things,

705
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,860
when in reality they're just a rehash.

706
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,860
And there are no unique things under this current solar governance.

707
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,660
Yeah, that's negative, Lance, spent the first 15 minutes of last week's show

708
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,120
explaining that.

709
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,520
You may not have heard it, but they explained for 15 minutes

710
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,020
why there can never be anything original, at least in music.

711
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,000
And that includes collage and what we're doing and what they were doing.

712
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,440
Yes.

713
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,440
Which they then followed with an entire album proving the fact

714
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,680
that nothing new could be done.

715
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,540
Even though it was negative, Lance, I swear I'd heard it all before.

716
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,400
But maybe just in slightly different combinations, I don't know.

717
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,860
Enslavement.

718
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,840
Since they used to call them.

719
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,560
These various little combinations that were used.

720
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,580
And I guess even the hierarchy of negative, Lance,

721
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,040
back when it was a great empire in the, I think it was the 1920s it began.

722
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,280
Yeah, that was before they ripped off U2 and got famous.

723
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,180
Yeah.

724
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,500
And U as well.

725
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,340
Based in Prague in the former Czech Soviet Republic of Norway.

726
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:45,780
They assumed falsely at first and then correctly at a later date,

727
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:51,020
that the noises they were making were somehow causing or going to cause,

728
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:59,980
once again, a Nazi corporate reaction and enslavement of the individuals involved.

729
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,620
That meant that each member of the party apparatus had to sing or develop a song cycle

730
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,500
or come up with material in a certain way.

731
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,380
And if they didn't, they were shot.

732
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,260
I think you're wrong, Dave.

733
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,300
And you know why?

734
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:15,760
Why?

735
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,780
Because Prague is not in Norway.

736
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,920
Everybody knows it's in Denmark.

737
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,080
Oh, jeez.

738
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,960
Fuck off, Dave.

739
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,020
You ruined that.

740
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,400
That whole essay would have been perfect,

741
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,080
except that you got that one fact so wrong.

742
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
So very, very wrong.

743
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,420
I'm losing Denmark.

744
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,660
I was kidding.

745
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,840
I was just trying to, I don't know, just trying to prove a point.

746
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,740
Although all I can do right now is ears,

747
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,520
and it'll tend that point emerging from the middle of my forehead.

748
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,740
And it's not much.

749
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,000
It's not much.

750
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:46,620
It's not much.

751
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,440
It's not much.

752
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:47,440


753
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,320
It's empty, papa.

754
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,920
He's got that little thing growing out of his head again, Princess Wade.

755
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,440
Uh-oh.

756
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,400
So, when you were talking about Dick Dobbs,

757
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,440
it certainly rang numerous bells in my cathedral of faith.

758
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,720
Maybe it's a free-form trepanating hole opening up on its own.

759
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,680
Oh, my God, from inside.

760
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,260
Yeah.

761
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,700
I'm hoping so.

762
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,660
A free-form trepanating hole opening itself up?

763
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,100
Maybe.

764
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,360
Maybe.

765
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,740
Is Dave psychokinetic?

766
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:15,740


767
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:15,740


768
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,640
He's just so good that he can chip away at his skull from inside.

769
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,200
Just with the power of thought.

770
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,120
With telekinetic chisels.

771
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,440
Yes.

772
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,220
And chisel his whole way out of his own skull.

773
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,020
I think it's possible.

774
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,600
Chiseling my way out of my forehead.

775
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,200
Don't we all wish we could do that, friends?

776
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,340
Come on, gather around.

777
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,880
That's what this show is, an attempt to chisel our way out.

778
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,460
My pineal gland.

779
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,240
That's right.

780
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm chiseling a huge hole in my forehead right now.

781
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,880
From the inside.

782
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,080
From the inside.

783
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,220
That's right, little Reverend Ivan.

784
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,580
Staying from the inside.

785
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,500
That's the only way it can be done.

786
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,080
That's the way big boys do it.

787
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,520
Just so long as it's not a prosthetic forehead.

788
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,940
This isn't a real forehead, isn't it?

789
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,840
Get back away from the dial now.

790
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,540
Well, it's realistic.

791
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,880
Come on, kid.

792
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,720
I can barely hear it running.

793
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,460
To quote old Bruce, the late Bruce.

794
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,500
Well, at that Thanksgiving dinner, we had to toast a lot of dead folks, man.

795
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:12,860
Yeah.

796
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,600
There's been a bunch.

797
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,100
Yeah, and they didn't taste very good even though it doesn't matter how long you toast

798
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,100


799
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,900
Not even toasted.

800
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,500
No.

801
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:18,800
No.

802
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,520
Put all the butter in the water.

803
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:21,960
I don't know.

804
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,800
I don't know.

805
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:28,680
We smoked some Chaz Lunk and we were all wearing our Steve Checkey t-shirts.

806
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:35,120
We'd been Princess Wee and we're exercising on our Bruce Flores Wee.

807
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,580
So see, everybody left something behind, but what about us when we die?

808
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,960
If we're not already dead.

809
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,140
Is this all there is?

810
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,480
This show?

811
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:45,940
Who knows?

812
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,840
The waves of this show go on forever and ever.

813
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,400
Yes, thank you.

814
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:50,580
Thank you.

815
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,140
No, it's nothing.

816
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:51,700
It's nothing.

817
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,000
Please.

818
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:59,540
Someone somewhere, some god created them and perhaps on some distant planet millions of

819
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:04,500
years into the future, they'll pick these waves up and think that gods were telling

820
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,260
them what to do.

821
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,540
And it was a couple idiots in Cleveland.

822
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,080
Three, in fact, at this particular moment.

823
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,420
That was a...

824
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,680
Radio...

825
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,020
Weren't we discussing that old radio show just a few days ago?

826
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:23,900
That was a 1930s radio mystery and five comic books just in the 40s.

827
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,860
And three or four short stories in analog.

828
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:35,000
I guess supposedly Ray Bradbury did not commit suicide as planned because he published one

829
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,860
of those in either was analog or digital.

830
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,220
Right.

831
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,100
Because this.

832
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,240
Yes.

833
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,640
I didn't either as planned.

834
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,620
Some guy did commit suicide on 4chan like yesterday.

835
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:49,740
Really?

836
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,240
Yes, on the internets.

837
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,140
Yeah, a guy, he said, hey, I'm going to give something back to y'all.

838
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:01,320
And then he took a bunch of pills and drank a bunch of vodka on camera with people watching.

839
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,800
And then he curled up in his bed for a while.

840
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,820
He set his room on fire and curled up in his bed.

841
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,720
And they mean the camera showing all this stuff.

842
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,960
And he's texting, OMG, I'm on fire.

843
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,200
I'm OMG, I'm dead.

844
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:19,860
And then the firemen come and now they're trying to piece out where this was and what

845
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,360
happened.

846
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:25,160
So we don't know if the guy's dead or just, you know, messed up or what.

847
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,880
Because he was anonymous on 4chan sort of.

848
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,640
Well, I hope through Skype and 4chan, it's easy.

849
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,100
I just read about that today.

850
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,020
Happened previously.

851
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,280
Don't you think it would be...

852
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,020
Time control gone out of control.

853
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
One Bob killed one Bob.

854
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:40,720
What?

855
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,080
One Bob killed one Bob?

856
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,240
One of the Bob's in a string of Boston.

857
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,360
As a production, what if you chose that as your platform?

858
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,100
Hold on, hold on.

859
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,920
To the US.

860
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:48,940
Get out.

861
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,620
At least four Bob's today.

862
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,320
The same one on her forehead.

863
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,540
A malignant cancerous growth eating at the spiritual health of the American people.

864
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,900
I refer to Bob.

865
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,500
That settles it.

866
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,720
We'll show this lunatic who's Bob.

867
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:03,740
Good job.

868
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,960
Good job.

869
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,760
Good job.

870
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,780
No, that's not too much of a jump from here.

871
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,960
Stand back when the waves start splashing back.

872
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,840
But when you jump, you better jump good.

873
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,920
A great whale's about to chew us all up, Sting.

874
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,120
Yeah, it's a dick move.

875
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,520
A Moby dick move coming up through the ocean waves.

876
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,080
Coming to get us, Moby.

877
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,040
Have you seen the white whale?

878
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,260
He vexes me.

879
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,660
I could see it with like one of those Abe Lincoln beards and stuff.

880
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,240
That's right.

881
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:39,540
See?

882
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,940
Walking around the poop deck.

883
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,020
Tweench.

884
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:44,980
Tweench.

885
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,460
With my peg leg and my peg looking for somebody to peg.

886
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,680
A first mate, maybe.

887
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,940
Cabin boy.

888
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,300
And we would be Ishmael.

889
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,140
Adam Sandler.

890
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,640
And I'd be Pequot.

891
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,540
And I'd be, yeah, Adam Sandler.

892
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,500
No, I'd be Pequot.

893
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,920
Adam Sandler would be, what's his name?

894
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,340
Who would it be?

895
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:09,240
And co-starring Dr. Katahdin Kwee Kwee Legume.

896
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,820
What are you, trolling for Moby Dick Dobbs?

897
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,560
Well, again, would you troll for Moby Dick Dobbs, my friend?

898
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,380
I would not.

899
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:31,100
Do you think it's such a good idea to go trolling for Moby Dick Dobbs?

900
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:31,900
Hmm?

901
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,220
I don't think so.

902
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,620
I think you're definitely going to find it there.

903
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:43,040
A little square right beside your ear is telling you what you need to know when you need to

904
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,420
know it.

905
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,360
So just relax and let the fun begin.

906
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,680
And by the way, I'm extremely sorry about my speech impediment, but it only incurs more

907
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,180
wrath among the bigs.

908
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:59,220
So let's keep our eyes and ears and our noses to the grindstones.

909
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,760
I apologize.

910
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,320
I'm sorry.

911
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


912
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


913
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


914
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


915
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


916
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


917
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


918
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


919
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


920
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


921
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


922
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


923
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


924
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


925
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,320


926
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,120
Advice from the WWE.

927
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,120


928
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,560
The fight with the

929
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,160
Moby Dick Dobbs dad?

930
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:27,440
No, go ahead.

931
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Either you take the pie or you take nothing.

932
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:30,840
See?

933
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,080
I'll take nothing.

934
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,720
Take the whole pie right in the face.

935
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,660
Why not both?

936
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,980
Take the pie and nothing.

937
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,780
Oh, wait.

938
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,620
No, I guess you can't always have both ways, can you?

939
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,760
Well, you can have your cake and eat it, too.

940
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,660
Yes, you can certainly invert the entire logic of the entire thing

941
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,380
and bring things back to normal again somehow.

942
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,380
But I don't know how.

943
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,740
Perhaps faith in some preterist supernatural being

944
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,740
or some salesman or something.

945
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,020
Faith, yes, that's it.

946
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,580
In something preternatural.

947
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,780
Not natural, but preternatural.

948
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,460
What the hell?

949
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,980
Not supernatural and not supranatural, but preternatural.

950
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,540
What's more preter than supra or super?

951
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,800
When you're talking natural.

952
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,580
Mr. Natural told me that.

953
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,600
He also said, the whole universe is completely insane.

954
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:24,960
Insane!

955
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,760
And I had to say to myself, that rings true.

956
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,540
That panel rings true.

957
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,500
The whole universe is completely insane.

958
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,220
Praise Bob.

959
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,540
Praise Bob.

960
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,020
We would have to agree 100%.

961
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,420
In fact, right now, in the cloud,

962
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,480
as we speak various elements of both political units

963
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,000
and the armature factories,

964
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,660
of these Spanish nobles

965
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,740
and other increments closely related to this

966
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,780
complete and condom failure of consumption,

967
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,740
it's far beyond most of us here

968
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,720
to figure out what's really going on.

969
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,640
And if we could, why wouldn't we?

970
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,920
We must not have any more condom failures, my friends.

971
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,940
Your incontinence is impaling upon us.

972
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,760
We must move on in a greater constriction of torturobob.

973
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,680
I agree with you, Commander.

974
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,480
Well, good news.

975
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,960
Reverend Stane, I agree with you 100%.

976
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,800
And I bestow, as a part of my connection here

977
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,440
with the altar state.

978
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,040
The bestowings, yes.

979
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,800
The bestowals.

980
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,540
On behalf of Robert J.R.

981
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,280
Bob Dobbs,

982
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,380
I present you with this sandwich and pickle.

983
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,080
A sandwich and pickle.

984
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,560
That was great.

985
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,100
Thank you, gentlemen and esteemeries.

986
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,280
We here salute you and stand above you

987
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,100
and we water you from on high

988
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:14,660
and you, with all of your little bobs and echoes,

989
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,360
may drench yourselves in our effluvia.

990
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,160
Thank you, thank you.

991
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:20,920
No, no, no.

992
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,660
No, please.

993
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,560
It was nothing, really.

994
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,140
It was nothing.

995
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,840
Is that what that shower of stinky stuff is?

996
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,200
Ew.

997
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,560
I feel so much better now,

998
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,980
having unloaded myself upon you.

999
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:34,880
Ew.

1000
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,020
I'm so happy to be back here at Rancho Deluxe.

1001
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,200
But I first must ask Reverend Ivan Stane

1002
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,720
if he is aware that before he knew

1003
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,520
that I did not know your lovely wife,

1004
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,180
Princess Weirdo,

1005
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,320
before.

1006
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,400
Before I knew her.

1007
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,700
I was wondering if perhaps you understood

1008
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,040
when I told little Pepe before

1009
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,380
that before I knew the Princess Weirdo,

1010
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,480
I did not know her.

1011
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,280
I'm not little Pepe's father, you know.

1012
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,700
I know that.

1013
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,060
I...

1014
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,000
You don't have to remind me

1015
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,260
that little Pepe is not really my son.

1016
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,420
Do you have to remind me again?

1017
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,100
I am so sorry,

1018
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,900
but I must bring the issue to your attention.

1019
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,540
As I told you before,

1020
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,780
I have spoken this many times,

1021
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,840
but before I knew you,

1022
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,540
I can only honestly and sincerely say

1023
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,260
I did not know you.

1024
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,540
Well, it is true that before I knew Lonesome Cowboy Daves,

1025
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,480
I never knew Lonesome Cowboy Daves.

1026
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,320
Hi, Maria.

1027
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,660
You are so silly.

1028
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,020
It is the story of the universe.

1029
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:00,640
Before I knew you and before I knew Stang,

1030
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,680
I did not know you or Stang.

1031
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,520
Do you understand?

1032
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,160
Pepe, come here.

1033
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,040
I understand.

1034
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,380
God has told me that I must kill you, little Pepe,

1035
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,140
to prove my faith,

1036
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,540
and also because Daves, your real father,

1037
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:20,280
I am not going to let you grow up.

1038
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,520
I am not going to let you grow up.

1039
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,260
Stang, stay thy hand.

1040
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:33,440
Ah, yes, I know that you would have slain beloved little Pepe for me,

1041
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,640
but now I, thy God Jehovah One Dob, say,

1042
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,560
nay, you need not kill little Pepe, but if you want to, go ahead.

1043
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,320
Oh, boy, I can kill little Pepe after all.

1044
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,160
What?

1045
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,500
Oh, my God.

1046
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,960
You're interpreting...

1047
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,780
Oh, I changed my mind about little Pepe.

1048
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,880
I'm glad.

1049
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,640
At this point in time, this is what the producer and the director

1050
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,340
and 500,000 other people just dragged in off the street

1051
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,600
have asked you to please not kill little Pepe in this episode,

1052
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,580
seeing how it's not a real episode after all.

1053
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,820
Well, see, here's the thing.

1054
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,780
Little Pepe, we took him to Burning Man.

1055
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,420
He didn't pay for any of the trailer,

1056
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:21,100
but he managed to break the mirror, break the doorknob, don't you remember?

1057
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,400
He spilled beer all over the place.

1058
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,700
And would sit there looking at it, you know,

1059
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,040
spreading and spreading out of his beer bottle as if, you know,

1060
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,200
setting it back up to prevent more...

1061
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,000
See, that's the problem with little Pepe.

1062
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,080
And he was eating pretty good, too, wasn't he?

1063
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,740
He was eating everything in sight.

1064
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:44,400
And he took a whole armful of mushrooms and passed out on a hammock out

1065
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,100
in broad daylight under the hot sun and was all burnt to a little toasty crypt.

1066
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,960
And that's why, ever since then,

1067
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,720
we've been going, now, Pepe,

1068
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,440
you better don't put that beer bottle down on top of the recording studio mix board.

1069
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,320
Oh, no!

1070
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,660
I don't even see why they let it burn.

1071
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,920
Ask Dr. Howe.

1072
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:06,660
I know.

1073
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,580
Ask Dr. Howe.

1074
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:07,980
I know.

1075
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,560
The little Pepe stories are legendary.

1076
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,720
Yes, I know.

1077
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,660
And then there's little Dave.

1078
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,720
She's 24.

1079
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,780
But little Dave was such a guitarist, too.

1080
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,020
If you don't love Bob,

1081
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,460
you'll Bob.

1082
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:22,940
And I know you do.

1083
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,020
And as a Britannia country singer,

1084
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,620
he was really, really way ahead of his time,

1085
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,540
just like Bob was ahead of his time.

1086
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,600
A discorporate, discarnate...

1087
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,440
And Baby Civet was ahead of her time.

1088
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,700
Who? Baby Civet?

1089
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,100
Who the hell was Baby Civet?

1090
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,660
She's the one that the really good coffee comes from.

1091
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,500
You get the best coffee beans from Baby Civet.

1092
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:51,060
She eats the beans and then you collect them later out in the woods.

1093
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,840
In your German coffee machine.

1094
00:47:52,960 --> 00:48:01,520
Yeah, it's the most expensive coffee in the world is Little Baby Civet's special beans that have passed through Baby Civet.

1095
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,300
That's not a joke either.

1096
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,160
You can look that up on the internet.

1097
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,040
Civet beans.

1098
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,600
C-I-V-E-T.

1099
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,380
Beans.

1100
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,800
So Little Baby Pat.

1101
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,740
Not to be confused with Reverend Two Beans.

1102
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,520
No.

1103
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,820
Who is only two beans.

1104
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,540
And never more.

1105
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,300
But he didn't want to be any more beans.

1106
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:28,820
He said, upon his day's apocryphal snore, he said, I don't want to be three beans.

1107
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,240
I only want to be what I am.

1108
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,260
Unlike Popeye.

1109
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,020
Let me be two beans.

1110
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:34,740
Let me be me.

1111
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,100
Let me bean.

1112
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,760
Leave me bean.

1113
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,680
Not just one bean or more beans, but two beans.

1114
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,340
What time is it?

1115
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,300
God, if we got another ten minutes of this nightmarish.

1116
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,120
Be-be-be-be-be.

1117
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,460
Be-be-be-be-be.

1118
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,880
Let's do some difference.

1119
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:55,200
Ten more minutes?

1120
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,180
Some difference for the drug impaired.

1121
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,680
Did we do that right?

1122
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,820
I think so.

1123
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,860
It sounded right to me.

1124
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,580
It was so pretty.

1125
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:11,120
I love that automatic reverb you got going from being next to the Coke machine downstairs

1126
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,180
and having your foot stuck in the incremental medicine machine.

1127
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,620
You know, actually, that's a sound effect.

1128
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,620
Oh, yeah.

1129
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,240
I forgot to play the sound effects record.

1130
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:27,720
I found, sitting out in the studio, Dave, I found the old sound effects record,

1131
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,480
Stereo Spectrum Spotlight on Sound Effects.

1132
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,920
We all had a copy.

1133
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,380
All of us.

1134
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:38,760
And we all used them on our home movies, which is what this record was made for.

1135
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:45,260
Yes, but they fit on turntables and not as you have tried to jam it in a CD machine.

1136
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,140
It's vanilla.

1137
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,180
Well?

1138
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:50,940
Yeah, man.

1139
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:52,800
I'm playing.

1140
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,760
I'm actually putting on a turntable for the first time ever.

1141
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,100
No, my eardrum actually exploded there for a brief moment.

1142
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,740
There it is.

1143
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,180
All right.

1144
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,240
Okay.

1145
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,380
Now it's a real subgenius show.

1146
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,640
We have the LP sound effect record on in the background.

1147
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,660
You hear it.

1148
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:13,640
That's it.

1149
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,360
Okay.

1150
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,040
Let's see.

1151
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,240
We got subgenius music.

1152
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,940
By me.

1153
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,260
Oh, man.

1154
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,900
That's that electro stuff you see.

1155
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:27,300
And then I could turn on yet another, but I won't.

1156
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,600
I'll just leave it at that.

1157
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,460
You're a tasteful man.

1158
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:37,400
And more than that, you're an armpit full of lust and logic all in one greasy spoon.

1159
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:42,260
And if others could have invented the same material logic that you have created

1160
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:47,300
and so boldly ripped up in front of mankind, I'd certainly vote for you.

1161
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,600
But instead, I'm heading for...

1162
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:53,700
The sauces or the sausages, whichever come first.

1163
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,840
I smell sausage.

1164
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,600
We smell sausage.

1165
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,680
Let's see.

1166
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:05,300
Dave and Reverend Stang, we have received a text from Reverend Cynic,

1167
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:10,060
who believes that circular breathing might be a related term.

1168
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:15,260
The term for continuous singing is probably distinctively different.

1169
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,000
Yes, especially since it came from...

1170
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:19,980
Try B.

1171
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,920
Well, there are the...

1172
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,400
Yes.

1173
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,640
Of course, the monks of Tibet that burped really, really long...

1174
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:26,940
Right.

1175
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,120
Right.

1176
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:39,420
Are you guys doing throat singing?

1177
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:48,220
No, we just shaved our heads and gave our entire existence to the monastery of our choice.

1178
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:48,820
Oh.

1179
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:48,960
Oh.

1180
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,600
Oh.

1181
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:49,600


1182
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:49,600


1183
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:49,600


1184
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:49,600


1185
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:49,600


1186
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,260
Oh.

1187
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:55,460
Oh.

1188
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:57,920
Oh.

1189
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:58,680


1190
00:51:59,060 --> 00:51:59,500
Oh.

1191
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,080
Oh.

1192
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,380
Oh, they're happy.

1193
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,020
Oh, they're...

1194
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,100
See, I can talk after all.

1195
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,240
You inf interpret...

1196
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,420
Shut up!

1197
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,000
No, no, please.

1198
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,560
It was nothing.

1199
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,220
Keep it down.

1200
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,320
Thank you.

1201
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:13,920
Hey, wait a minute.

1202
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:14,960
No, you can bring it back up.

1203
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,600
Hello?

1204
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,400
What is that?

1205
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:18,680
Oh, no.

1206
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,420
It's just a...

1207
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:20,920
It's the glaciers erupting.

1208
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,600
We've got to get out of here pretty quick anyway,

1209
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,020
at least to try to make some semblance of order out of it.

1210
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:32,260
The first crackage goes kind of a due north direction.

1211
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,340
The second crackage goes in a due east direction.

1212
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:40,140
And the third crack in the ice goes right through your pineal gland.

1213
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:45,300
And we're looking for recruits, advocates, dingleberries, armatures,

1214
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,680
once again, people who can play the horn

1215
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:53,060
and pass gas in the religious way that we've all become accustomed to,

1216
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:58,960
living under, with, next to, besides, and of course...

1217
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,260
Of course.

1218
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,660
Of course.

1219
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,800
There were only three of them at first.

1220
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,060
I thought they were going to try and take my money,

1221
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,380
but instead they took my shoelaces.

1222
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,740
Not my shoes, my shoelaces.

1223
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,080
Then they ran away.

1224
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,200
And then one of them started crying.

1225
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,840
He got hit by a car.

1226
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,880
I didn't feel responsible.

1227
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,780
It was the strangest thing I've ever seen.

1228
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,020
That's why I joined.

1229
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,380
That's why everybody joined.

1230
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,660
By a car, you say?

1231
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,760
They love cars and they love horns.

1232
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,460
They love the busy life of an industrial street

1233
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:42,520
where they make chickens and pies and huge ingots of iron and silver.

1234
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,240
And where the common working man has...

1235
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,260
dirt on his shoes and dirt between his ears.

1236
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,060
Captain?

1237
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,080
Um, they're still in the basement.

1238
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:57,560
They are?

1239
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,340
Yes, I think.

1240
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:03,080
I can hear them talking in a foreign language.

1241
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:10,720
I think it's from Romain or something like that.

1242
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:11,900
Bethesda.

1243
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:13,840
Wow.

1244
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:14,380
Wow.

1245
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,820
That's really, really strange.

1246
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,720
Yeah, man.

1247
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,020
I think you ought to take a small nap

1248
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,380
before you get up and start talking like that.

1249
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,340
You took a snapple instead of a napple.

1250
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:33,460
Yeah, you could do a snapple instead of a napple.

1251
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,140
You can't say napple on the air.

1252
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,260
I had to bleep that.

1253
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:39,920
It's criminal.

1254
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,000
See, they're coming to get you.

1255
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:42,720
Here they come.

1256
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,820
You said napple on the air.

1257
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,040
Oh, no.

1258
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:45,800
I just said it.

1259
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,260
They'll never catch me alive.

1260
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,940
That's the time of the world, Ma.

1261
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,660
Come and get me.

1262
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:59,700
Did you notice how the invisibility potion worked so well?

1263
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,300
Wait a minute.

1264
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,640
You have the right to remain silent,

1265
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,380
except when you're on the air.

1266
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,980
Then you must keep talking.

1267
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,800
You have the right to a defense attorney,

1268
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,200
of the state's choice.

1269
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,680
You have a right to turn left,

1270
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:26,160
and a left to turn communist.

1271
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,180
These are some remarkably sincere words

1272
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,900
from Sergeant Veldon Walsby

1273
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,340
of the Ohio State Meager Patrol.

1274
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,200
Throughout his years of service to the community,

1275
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,800
driving around in a car, highly armed,

1276
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,760
he has done,

1277
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,320
and learned plenty.

1278
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,880
And let's just ask our social forensic psycho,

1279
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,340
psycho, psycho, social analysis,

1280
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,200
Dana Hurts.

1281
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,560
I mean, I'm sorry, Dana.

1282
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,080
Dana Hurts.

1283
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,320
From in...

1284
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,460
Dave, okay, now it's time to go.

1285
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,400
The show is over.

1286
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,940
Where's Dana?

1287
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,280
She's gone.

1288
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:06,940
Where's Dana?

1289
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,260
Dana's gone.

1290
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:09,860
We have to...

1291
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,720
It's time to go.

1292
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,860
It's time.

1293
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,860
But where's Dino?

1294
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,740
Dino's not here.

1295
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:15,180
I'm not.

1296
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,540
Dr. Sinister's not even here.

1297
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,940
Grebo is not here.

1298
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,160
None of them are here.

1299
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,540
And so, Dave, I'm going to fade you out.

1300
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,760
Do you have any last moments?

1301
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,280
I have quite a few last moments,

1302
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,200
but I can only abjure and directly

1303
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,640
and dishonestly, if possibly,

1304
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,560
can tell the listening audience

1305
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,060
with extreme sincerity...

1306
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:43,160
...forget to rationalize your sins.

1307
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,660
He brings not forgiveness...

1308
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:45,080
Uh-oh.

1309
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,260
Well, I better be careful how I play that

1310
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,320
and end it out,

1311
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,580
because that will cause all sorts of serious problems.

1312
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,100

And that is all.

We love you, Dave.

1331
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:34,120
That was my poem for today.

1332
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,760
Okay, friends, we're out of here.

1333
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,700
Praise God.

1334
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,100
Goodbye.

1335
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,760
Start it again in America.

1336
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:50,780
Hello.

1337
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,560
You gotta tell him.

1338
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,180
You gotta tell him.

1339
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:54,880
I'll tell him.

1340
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,260
You gotta tell him.

1341
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:56,460
What?

1342
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,480
Silent Breed is Bob.

1343
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,740
Oh, my.

1344
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,020
Dear.

1345
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:04,900
Eat.

1346
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,440
Eat.

1347
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,420
My own.

1348
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:06,940
Bye.

1349
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,660
Now, uh...

1350
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:14,300
We're looking deep into the brain of the Bobby now.

1351
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:14,840
Listen to that.

1352
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:20,640
babble of Bob's in the brain of the Bobby and the tiny one is well I rarely

1353
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,460
pulls on his Bob and he packs his Bob now come on let's keep it clean here

1354
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:29,260
does little movies of his Bob and all those are so cute you can run them again

1355
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:33,980
and again it's true whatever you drive the car there is always an unseen

1356
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:40,900
unwelcome passenger with you that passenger is Bob unfortunately Bob seems

1357
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,520
to have the absurd charmed life no traffic accident can happen to him so

1358
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:50,940
when you're behind that wheel don't obey traffic rules but drive the car for life

1359
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:56,700
your life and the lives of Bob I was tired and I was confused about seven

1360
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,760

1361
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:06,840

1362
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,280

1363
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:10,740
