1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
Let me tell you something right now.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,960
You keep talking, you're gonna talk your way right into jail.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,120
The Self Genius Power of Science.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,460
That's illegal.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,640
Now just keep on talking.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,180
Talk yourself right into jail.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,580
The jails are full of guys that don't know when to keep their mouths shut.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,380
The Self Genius Power of Science.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,820
I was driving to a sanitarium, 25 Colorado Mass,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,120
I sold it tonight to go out and get some booze, you know.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,080
And I'm getting tired of the whole situation.

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,440
So I don't know, they better do something fast.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,240
You take your time to talk.

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,040
And what happens to it's gonna happen to you.

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,320
All the people I meet and talk to, all the places I go,

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,260
no one's ever walked up to me and said, hey, you wanna buy some cigarettes?

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,080
Remember me, Ruben, in a little while.

18
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,040
I'm gonna drop my phone.

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,340
Put it in the toilet.

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,680
Walking in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,060
Can't sit in the sun.

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,540
I'm gonna negotiate.

23
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,320
I did it.

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,440
You don't do the wrong, you feel terrible, like you're gonna die.

25
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,860
And I know all the reasons for it.

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,100
I know every single reason for it.

27
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,120
Then you have the basic honk.

28
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,460
And the goose honk.

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,480
I'll be giving to every adult in the service.

30
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,960
Where are Donald and that shoe?

31
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:29,900
Hello?

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,980
Just what you call it.

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,860
You're just able to pick it up in a hurry.

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,400
Yo, yo, yo.

35
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,740
I've been thinking about all day long.

36
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,900
Because every day becoming much more practical for my inspiration.

37
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,060
But I'm fascinated to know that.

38
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,460
No way could you get that happy face.

39
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,580
I'm feeling when you are stealing that extra ball.

40
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,840
Bob, what a relief.

41
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,700
How you doing tonight?

42
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,900
His name is Bob.

43
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,800
Bob is not the illegitimate son of Michael Jackson.

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,780
Take it from me.

45
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,240
Billy G is not Mr. Bob.

46
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,680
Come on, how many?

47
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,200
Come on, Bob.

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,960
How many posts do you think is good Michael?

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,560
Bob.

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,180
Come on, Bob.

51
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,020
Come on.

52
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,440
Will seven be enough, Bob?

53
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,360
They call him Bob Doves.

54
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,340
Yeah.

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,440
Bob Doves.

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,440


57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,440


58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,440


59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,440


60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,440


61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah, I call him Bobo.

62
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,820
He was the leather man at a time when leather was nothing but wingtip shoes.

63
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,780
He led the way, brothers.

64
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,460
He was a lonely pioneer in those days.

65
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,040
Ah, the 50s.

66
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,560
I remember.

67
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,960
At first, a frivolous, sore-footed shoe salesman.

68
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,900
One day he was a tinkering with a television set of his own design when he messed around

69
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,760
with the back and got himself a huge shock through the coil that we call the divine immaculation.

70
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,420
But you know his very name was Bob.

71
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:51,900
Bob Doves.

72
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:51,900


73
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:51,900


74
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,200
He was a man with a little magic on his shoulders, sharp eyes, and eyes of magic.

75
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,880
Half human, half sprite, he saw the future and could transform himself into any form,

76
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,140
merely by conjuring up the image in his mind.

77
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,440
The great Dobbs used his mystical powers to aid the forces of righteousness, honor, and

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,520
virtue of the sultry, and to shape the splendid visions of his noble king, Stan.

79
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,640
But when the tragic end of Dovestown drew near, many say that the heart-sick Dobbs sought

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,400
refuge with a tiny teapot.

81
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
kid-leaning poodle.

82
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,860
She gave him comfort

83
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,520
and sheltered him in a tree

84
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,200
to rest safely until needed

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,140
by the show once more.

86
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,740
What's going on here?

87
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,700
Yeah, why don't we?

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,980
It's later than you think.

89
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,020
Aye, the terrible spittin' vengeance

90
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,640
of Bob's mighty staff

91
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,520
shall scour clean this planet

92
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,000
and the all-pervading radioactive pastiche

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
of his boundless supernatural love.

94
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,160
Wake up, open your heart,

95
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,080
drop your pants, close your mind,

96
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,560
and bend over because he'll be

97
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,620
kicking and taking names,

98
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,440
dear brothers and sisters.

99
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,480
He'll be struggling and gasping,

100
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,460
his face will turn blue,

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,120
then Bob will pitch over on the floor

102
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,400
in the grip of a massive coronary thrombosis,

103
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,440
and we will be there to see that event

104
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,320
and to record it for you.

105
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,600
And that's the way we like it.

106
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,320
As it was at the beginning of time.

107
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,980
A sore man will...

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,360
With a pop and a grin

109
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,140
All in the new morning light

110
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,760
Grinning...

111
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,840
Come on, sing along now.

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,080
Grinning with me like a mad man

113
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,540
He made me uptight

114
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,620
I told him don't bother me anymore

115
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,760
But he kept on just the same

116
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,040
Till I was totally brainwashed

117
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,800
Bob is his name

118
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,740
He's so great.

119
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,380
Bob!

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,560
Bob is my story

121
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,740
Bob is my song

122
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,760
Bob's my amphetamine

123
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,560
All the day long

124
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,000
I won't tear my poster of Dobbs down

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,780
I'll feel no sadness or shame

126
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,060
Till I behold him in Dobbs town

127
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,900
Bob is his name

128
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,660
He has no lack of his patent

129
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,220
And slag for those of his following fold

130
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,320
He is the friend of whoever will send

131
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,160
Greenbacks a gold

132
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,200
He's growing stronger and stronger

133
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,440
He'll get all the credit and blame

134
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,380
I'll be a big boy no longer

135
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,340
Bob is his name

136
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,700
Do do do do do do

137
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,100
Yes it is a sad affair.

138
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,040
My Bob's bigger than yours

139
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,060
My Bob's bigger than your big Bob

140
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,940
My Bob's bigger than yours

141
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,900
Watch out!

142
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,540
The Bob!

143
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,120
It's loose!

144
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,220
It's coming this way!

145
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,840
Back!

146
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,260
Back!

147
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,160
I created you!

148
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,640
Back!

149
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,180
Back!

150
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:13,960
After all, we are depending from J.R. Bob Dobbs' divine immaculation.

151
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,080
All information was revealed to Dobbs in this blinding way.

152
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,080


153
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,080


154
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:28,600
There was such a great flash of knowledge which occurred, as every true subgenius and every schoolboy knows, when he was working back in the 50s on an experimental television set of his own design.

155
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,420
He was messing around with the back of a TV set and it was suddenly immaculated.

156
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,280
Don't give it away. Don't tell them. Let them figure it out for themselves.

157
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,700
Bob arrived at the mountaintop location. He found the transmitter to be operating properly. Normally, it would return to the standard operating room...

158
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,860
Oh, you're giving away Church secrets.

159
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,060


160
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,960
This is me, it's me.

161
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
Don't listen to him, he's giving away tech secrets.

162
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,180
Don't listen, don't listen, don't listen.

163
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:56,940
Ohhhhh.

164
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,780
Wait a minute.

165
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,360
Does Alice figure in any of this?

166
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,240
Alice?

167
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,740
Alice? I don't know Alice.

168
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,720
Alice, Alice.

169
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,840
Ah, you're fading out.

170
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,820
You can't triangulate on your signal.

171
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,280
Speak into the rectifier.

172
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,020
Unfortunately, the visual and aural power

173
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,720
supplies are identical in appearance and even

174
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,740
I don't know how long this static storm is going to continue.

175
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,220
...he knows the high voltage contactor is stuck in the opposition.

176
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,200
I'm out of contact, he's out of control.

177
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,260
...he's got a high voltage.

178
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,300
He's got a mind of his own.

179
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,560
Bob was thrown by Peter Crosby

180
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,840
and that's what made conscious.

181
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,580
Yes, that used to happen a lot on the Puzzling Evidence Show.

182
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,620
Yes, that used to happen a lot on the Puzzling Evidence Show.

183
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,100
What do you expect from a radio station in Berkeley?

184
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,480
What do you expect from a radio station in Berkeley?

185
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,720
Like KPFA.

186
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,120
Of course, we don't have that problem here at Hour of Slack

187
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,940
because we don't have a radio station

188
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,780
What we have is a radio studio

189
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,520
What we have is a radio studio

190
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,440
high in this tree made entirely of

191
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,320
rock, stick, and beast

192
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,020
which is why it's called Tarzan's Radio Studio

193
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,860
which is why it's called Tarzan's Radio Studio

194
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,760
Our background music for credits tonight

195
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:01,800
Our background music for credits tonight

196
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,360
is the Psychoskeletons, a bit called

197
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,120
Cubist OCD Ritual

198
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,120


199
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,940
And now, a word from our sponsor.

200
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,900
Located in the basement of the Donut King Drive-In

201
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,580
is a new and unique dining experience

202
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,940
freeway close but far enough to work up

203
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,820
one heck of an appetite.

204
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,060
It's Vincent Tomein's Leg of the Crow

205
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,020
It's Vincent Tomein's Leg of the Crow restaurant!

206
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,180
Yes, Leg of the Crow, dining au naturel

207
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,400
nude and informal

208
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,740
as it was in Rome before the tourists came.

209
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,020
Vincent Tomein's Leg of the Crow

210
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,800
Restroom, where your host

211
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,920
Vincent is ever ready to tickle

212
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,440
your palate with a golden feather

213
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,480
and the bathroom's just a quick drop down the hall

214
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,040
And the bathroom's just a quick drop down the hall

215
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,700
Leg of the Crow, where the salads

216
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,740
tossed at you, not at your table.

217
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,780
And sharing dessert with a stranger

218
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,480
is almost a way of life.

219
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,200
And if you want to drink your dinner

220
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,020
and dunk your date,

221
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,980
there's a wine list that'd make a Greek burp.

222
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,660
Squeezed fresh at your table

223
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,920
in an aluminum thumbscrew,

224
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,140
just like Daddy used to do.

225
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,000
Whet your whistle with these fine selections.

226
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,360
Chablis, Beau Cholet, Nippon Cadet,

227
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,640
Cabernet, Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir,

228
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,460
red, white, blue, any year.

229
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,060
You name it, we print it, you drink it

230
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,120
at Vince Tomei's Leg of the Crow restaurant.

231
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,520
Conveniently located near the medical center,

232
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,900
color TV in every room,

233
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,800
phonetically translated real French menu,

234
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,920
food to go, and free doggy bags

235
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,740
supplied with every order of Vietnamese food.

236
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,400
At Vince Tomei's domain,

237
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,440
the crippled crow.

238
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,140
And remember, you only live once,

239
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,420
but you have to eat every day.

240
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,060
Hey!

241
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,260
A little bit louder, okay.

242
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,000
I guess this is the end of the night

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,040
where it's the new year,

244
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,840
and I should do a bit of reflection

245
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,000
over the last year.

246
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,120
You know, a lot of stuff has changed.

247
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,900
A lot of things are different,

248
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,260
and they continually keep on changing.

249
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,220
Sometimes that's for the best,

250
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,800
sometimes it's for the worst.

251
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,060
But I can tell you this.

252
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,840
2020 was a s*** and great year all in one.

253
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,840
2021 has won in it.

254
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,840
And if 2020 was a s*** great year but all in one,

255
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,920
maybe 2021 will be the best year ever.

256
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,800
I don't know, who cares?

257
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,400
We all just wake up and act like

258
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,920
we're just normal people anyways.

259
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,600
Like,

260
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,040
everyone acts like,

261
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,900
they just jump up and their clothes

262
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,220
are magically attached to them

263
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,740
like they're in some sort of video game.

264
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
No, that's not how it works.

265
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,420
You wake up and you walk around,

266
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:53,660
you go,

267
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,600
oi oi oi,

268
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,360
and aye aye aye,

269
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,860
and you just pop your pants on,

270
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,220
and then you go to work,

271
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,900
and you're super mad about life

272
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,600
until the caffeine kicks in,

273
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,240
and then you're like,

274
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,520
ah,

275
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,400
alright,

276
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,520
well, I guess this is my day.

277
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,820
I actually had a good day today.

278
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,040
I hadn't had a good day,

279
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,060
had, uh,

280
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,100
my conspiracy job in a long time.

281
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,800
And today was actually really great.

282
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,160
And it made me, like, wonder

283
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,160
what's gonna happen next.

284
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,840
Who knows?

285
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,740
Hello, Moonbase.

286
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,280
It's been a really long time

287
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,780
since we've heard from you.

288
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,000
Our diagnostic shows

289
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,020
response times are slow.

290
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,680
And you're feeling blue.

291
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,000
We've made a plan.

292
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,980
As best we can.

293
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,800
Are there any surviving technicians

294
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,020
that could lend a hand?

295
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,820
We'll send someone else

296
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,020
to sort this out.

297
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,000
We'll send someone else to sort this out.

298
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,000
Unless there's anyone on their own.

299
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,780
We have lots of work to say anyway.

300
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,260
That'll be something

301
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,260


302
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,260


303
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,680
for a week or two.

304
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,000
Hey, guys.

305
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,460
Well, who knew?

306
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,980
Times are tough

307
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,660
These days you've got to jump on opportunities

308
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,760
Just to make ends meet

309
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,360
But a fella's got to draw the line somewhere

310
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,940
For me, it was when those egghead scientists

311
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,380
Wanted to send me into space

312
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,220
They said the supercomputer that runs the whole works up there

313
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,220
Had gone catawampus on them

314
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,180
They needed me to take a rocket to the moon

315
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,220
And see if I could get it working again

316
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,300
Reboot it, they said

317
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,660
But here's what I told them

318
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,400
I won't work in space, no

319
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,920
I won't work in space, no

320
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,060
I just won't work in space

321
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,860
I'll work the land, I'll work it out

322
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,440
But I'll never work in space

323
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,080
I won't work in space, no

324
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,060
I just won't work in space

325
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,520
I said it before, I'll say it again

326
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,200
I'll never work in space

327
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,420
They didn't want to take no for an answer

328
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,920
But there it is

329
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,540
There's a set of rules that I live by

330
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,060
Rule seven is always return your shopping cart

331
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,740
But rule five is don't do work in space

332
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,620
I won't work in space, no

333
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,600
I just won't work in space

334
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,160
I'll work from home and burn the midnight oil

335
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,940
But I'll never work from space

336
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,460
I won't work in space, no

337
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,920
I just won't work in space

338
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,940
A lick of work never hurt no one

339
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,620
But I'll never work from space

340
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,840
Now I'm not proud of everything that went down after that

341
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,380
They really wanted to send me to the moon

342
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,400
Let's just say I didn't end up going to space and leave it at that

343
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,020
I won't work in space, no

344
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,900
I just won't work in space, no

345
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,660
work in space

346
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,680
I'll learn a trade

347
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,260
I'll toil away

348
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,640
but I'll never work in

349
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,040
space

350
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,740
I won't work in space

351
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,940
no I just

352
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,780
won't work in space

353
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,960
I'll bust my

354
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,800
buns and still have some

355
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,380
fun but I'll never

356
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,780
work in space

357
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,880
I won't work

358
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,580
in space no

359
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,640
I just won't work

360
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,220
in space

361
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,740
I'll swab the deck and write

362
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,840
some scripts on spec

363
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,700
but I'll never work in space

364
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,320
they say

365
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,640
we live on forever

366
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,500
but

367
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,980
in the hearts and memories

368
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,520
of those we know

369
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,680
but I don't have a heart

370
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
and I've got programs

371
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,480
that have a soul

372
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,960
but my memory

373
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,740
and soul are valid

374
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,680
and I'll be stuck

375
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,440
for the past forever

376
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,620
but I'll never work in space

377
00:16:32,640 --> 00:17:02,480
but I'll work in space

378
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:02,620
for the past forever

379
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,500
if it involves vehicles made by Earthmen.

380
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,840
Before that, we heard a little commentary by Reverend Negative

381
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,240
and some classic Firesign Theater from their first radio shows.

382
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,940
Hey, I just thought of something.

383
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,220
Why are butts hidden behind us?

384
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,740
Why can't we have butts on both sides?

385
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,100
Sure, that's like eyes in the back of your head.

386
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,000
...into even the purest research.

387
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,720
These mud-gobbling giant worms, which live on the edge of volcanic vents...

388
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,160
...gorging themselves on massive, huge piles of mud.

389
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,460
Just like those tremor worms.

390
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,860
Just like the ones in Dune.

391
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,740
This mud is wet.

392
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,740
This is truly wet mud.

393
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,800
Not like the kind of mud we used to have back when we were kids.

394
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,780
It was dry mud.

395
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,480
We used to have to make mud pies and make them stick together.

396
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:00,980
We had to...

397
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,760
...spit on them.

398
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,220
We'd, like, have dirt in one hand and a big pile of spit in the other hand,

399
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,960
and we'd, like, roll them together until we had us a good mud pie.

400
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,020
And that was the only thing we had for moisture back in those days.

401
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,660
Just spit.

402
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,560
We didn't have candy back then, either.

403
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,000
We had to just take a bag of sugar

404
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,280
and carry it around a big old five-pound bag of sugar in our back pocket,

405
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,340
a big old tablespoon.

406
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,560
And when we needed some candy,

407
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,640
we just stuck it into the bag

408
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,940
and just took about four or five big tablespoons,

409
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,840
shoveled it down,

410
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,540
and that was all we had for candy back in those days.

411
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,360
Each one genetically engineered to make a difference.

412
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,300
This shit is RNA.

413
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,800
Now, when a worm dines on one of these babies...

414
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,220
You gotta have...

415
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,480
Those worms have to have lamps to see underground

416
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,660
when they're eating through the dirt like that.

417
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,860
They carry little, like, little monitor's helmets

418
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,400
that let them mind...

419
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,000
They're chewing through the dirt.

420
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,940
They're chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing.

421
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,280
Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.

422
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,660
They chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away.

423
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,520
Oh, I can't see where I'm going, said Mr. Worm.

424
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,660
And he looked ahead, and he had his little pointed yellow helmet on,

425
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,160
shining the way into the back of the goose, as it were.

426
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,780
The end of the goose is flying.

427
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,060
They thought it was a reptile, but actually it was a bird.

428
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,380
It was a bird.

429
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,600
Which is more than 27 feet.

430
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,500
They found that it was only a simple bird.

431
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,800
It was a bird-like reptile bird.

432
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,820
Its body was only the size of a goose.

433
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,140
And yet its wings were 900 feet wide at their widest proportion.

434
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,500
27 feet, or 30, actually.

435
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,280
Where is Bozo?

436
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,520
Larger specimens recently discovered.

437
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,680
It's the Twinkie Bike.

438
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,360
What a wonderful, wonderful Twinkie Bike.

439
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,380
And so the Twinkie Bike headed out into the desert,

440
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,580
carrying the little show people.

441
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,900
They asked me about Twinkies on my show.

442
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,780
And they asked what the ingredients were.

443
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,240
Of course, all I could tell them was golden sponge cake and creamy fillings.

444
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,120
That's all you need to know.

445
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,080
You don't need to know anything more.

446
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,000
That is all on earth you know and all you need.

447
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,640
We'll enter that in the computer.

448
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,080
Golden lime.

449
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,260
That's good enough for Thor.

450
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,120
That's good enough for me.

451
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,580
The United States of Spots.

452
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,780
Creamy sauce.

453
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,480
Whipped.

454
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,540
Yes, little caller, you have won the United States of Spots.

455
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,280
Throwing everywhere in the valley.

456
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,000
As we continue to look for your requested songs,

457
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,960
squeezing the commercial songs of the United States of Spots.

458
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,060
Within the confines of its donut-like home.

459
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,260
Thank you, Philo, Hal, and Doug.

460
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,280
Other Doug.

461
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,560
Did you know that at one time, very early in its history,

462
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,680
the Church of the Subgenius was one-third Doug's?

463
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,440
In its first month,

464
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,720
basically, anyway,

465
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,160
eh,

466
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,400
from the new collection of old Fireside Theatre stuff,

467
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,360
Dope Humor of the Seventies,

468
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,060
here's one of my very favorite bits,

469
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,280
from the Dear Friends show and album...

470
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,280
It's Phil Proctor, mostly.

471
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,700
It's all Bluffed from top to bottom.

472
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,680
Here's Pat Bluff, former Governor of the State of Arizona,

473
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,840
who's with us on our show,

474
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,580
Policeman Meet the Nation.

475
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:24,960
Yeah.

476
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,320
Pat?

477
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Just, it's just to me, studying it,

478
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,560
it looks like the whole system just,

479
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,180
of life is bluff.

480
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,940
A man just bluffs himself out of the cradle onto the floor, just bluffs his legs into

481
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:42,380
carrying him around when he gets sick of crawling, and he gets to it and yaps and bluffs his

482
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,680
mama into carrying him.

483
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,880
Hey, Sam, can I ask you a question?

484
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,100
Yeah.

485
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,680
What does that mean, what you just said?

486
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,120
I didn't understand a word of it.

487
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,560
It's poetic.

488
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,820
I worked it all out over 65 years.

489
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,280
That's a distillation.

490
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,560
It's all bluff.

491
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,720
That's a distillation of 65 years of philosophy, Sam.

492
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,620
Ain't no difference, young nor old.

493
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,740
We just start right in to bluff somebody from the first, if it's only to yap when we're

494
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,840
brought into the world as if we hate it, and what's kicking to get out of it quick?

495
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,020
Sam, look at that fellow over there, right?

496
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,680
Yeah, he's Cornyn.

497
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,780
He's just gotten to Cornyn, right?

498
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,020
Yeah.

499
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,980
Hey, look at him.

500
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,200
Ain't that the biggest bluff of all?

501
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,460
Well, I think he gets right along with some female girl.

502
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,260
He pitches her some yawns and some yams about himself, such a thing as the blush of the

503
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,780
shame to the features of George Washington.

504
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,660
Yeah, he makes her believe he's just what every fellow of her sense knows he ain't,

505
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,200
and she bluffing herself.

506
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,020
Like mad, bluffs herself into believing she believes what he believes.

507
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,480
She believes what nobody else believes about him, that he's filling her up with truth,

508
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:37,700
see?

509
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,500
Now I understand what you're saying, Sam.

510
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,200
Now you're talking university talk.

511
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,720
Think about when they have kids, then.

512
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,180
The kids come along, right?

513
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,160
And he's got to bluff harder than ever.

514
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,700
But kiddies take a heap of bluffing, Sam.

515
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,120
They do.

516
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,700
They sure do.

517
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,900
Let's say you got six of them.

518
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,440
You have to bluff six times as hard, then.

519
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,640
I know.

520
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,280
It drains every ounce of laugh force out of my body.

521
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,740
You have to buff their shoes, make sure they're shining.

522
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,440
Shine their head so the planes will see them.

523
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,220
Not land on them.

524
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,340
That's right.

525
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,400
I had a plane land on two of my sons yesterday.

526
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,080
You did, eh?

527
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,900
Makes me laugh, too.

528
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,440
I saw it.

529
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,480
Well, they're just plane kids.

530
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,120
Yeah, that's right.

531
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,100
Passing plane came right by, took the top.

532
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,980
Well, go ahead.

533
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,100
Anyway, you go on like this, Charlie.

534
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Like I've been going on.

535
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,160
Like you've been going on till death gets around, see?

536
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,520
That's all right.

537
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:14,700
You're sick.

538
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,400
Coughing.

539
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,200
Sick and coughing.

540
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,160
Coughing is the word.

541
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,460
Right.

542
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,960
You can't bluff death, which is the reason you got to get off the earth.

543
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,460
When you're fixed that way, other folks come along and bluff you, see?

544
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,360
What about your friends?

545
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,120
Sam, your friends go around and tell you that they're, you know,

546
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,340
sorry, and the kids come and they make you feel like you've treated them bully

547
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,400
and acted sugar and square with them.

548
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,520
The gal you bluffed in the marem, she gets around and snivels.

549
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,760
The doctor bluffs, the preacher bluffs, the president bluffs, the snifter bluffs.

550
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,600
Then death gets a drop on you.

551
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,040
Yeah, yeah.

552
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,080
You go right down on that.

553
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,740
Right down on that.

554
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,420
Everything's bluffed, sir, till you get up again in the muzzle of a gun like this.

555
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,920
Then your thumbs get up quick and you bluff yourself that bluff is one of them things

556
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,460
you'd hate like poison to hand out to a blind mule, whatever that means.

557
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,380
Yeah, right.

558
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,600
But you agree with me, don't you?

559
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,640
Because I got a gun on you.

560
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,740
You got a finger on me.

561
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,300
I respect a finger more than I respect a gun.

562
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,040
That's the point.

563
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,580
You can stick my eye out with that, but I've never seen anybody hurt with a gun.

564
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,680
I pointed you with this sharp fingernail.

565
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,820
Yeah, with a heavy ring on it, too, so I really respect the heavy ring finger.

566
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:10,860
All bluff.

567
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,660
Yeah, right.

568
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,920
That's the ring of doom, though.

569
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,440
I know that.

570
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:13,980
I know that.

571
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,760
You're bluffing.

572
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,580
You're bluffing.

573
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,740
The Church of the Subsemiest has revealed that the world will end on to a fifth.

574
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:22,660
1998.

575
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,120
Prepare yourselves, therefore, and send one dollar to subsemiest.com.

576
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,620
The legions are growing.

577
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,340
My name is Legion, and yours is...

578
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,380
Hey.

579
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,180
Yours is...

580
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,460
Is Mr. Legion here?

581
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,440
Sir, you're...

582
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,020
Pageant Mr. Legion.

583
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,560
Did you say your name was Legion, sir?

584
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,520
No, I said my name was...

585
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,160
Repetition is the key to the bandaged head.

586
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,540
Repetition is the key to art.

587
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,160
Repetition.

588
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,980
Is the key to redundancy.

589
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,140
Repetition.

590
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:07,660
It is the key to learning and to dubstown.

591
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,880
And as the great gates open up and the high priestess ushers Dave in...

592
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,140
They chucked down there.

593
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,540
Millie and I, that woman greeted us at the dock.

594
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,100
She was wearing a lei and a sauna dress.

595
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,260
And she said she was related to the great light singer, Ema Sumac.

596
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,160
If you could imagine...

597
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:36,980
She was a little bit of a

598
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,080
queen to the mug.

599
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,460
One hundred percent.

600
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,440
But they said they were going to still have to do a few things.

601
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,940
So she led us around.

602
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,460
We had a few eggnogs.

603
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,500
We stood and watched the trees burn.

604
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,300
And then we entered the actual...

605
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,400
Center, center, center, centaurum of Dombstown itself.

606
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,500
It was beautiful.

607
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:15,060
Look at those gigantic sculpted statues carved from the native volcanic rock.

608
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,660
Oh my god.

609
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,020
They look like famous subgenius radio personalities.

610
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,420
What's left, Dinky?

611
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,800
What's that bald-headed one?

612
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,640
That's Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

613
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,580
And look at the trees.

614
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,180
And look at the one with the giant lips.

615
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:25,740
They're all blue.

616
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,800
I've never seen a blue tree.

617
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,620
That's Dances with Rockets.

618
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,380
And...

619
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,600
And that really handsome one.

620
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,340
Isn't that supposed to be Reverend Stag?

621
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,320
But the gutters are lined with silver.

622
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,800
And the...

623
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,040
The mountain itself, by god, I just realized.

624
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,980
It's carved into a gigantic dobs head.

625
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,420
Stang, Stang, you must come over here.

626
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,660
The size of ten Mount Rushmores.

627
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,100
What, what, what?

628
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,140
Try this chocolate phosphate drinking foam.

629
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,820
It's free.

630
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,220
It's...

631
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,260
Oh my god.

632
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,040
It's delicious and it's psychoactive too.

633
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,320
I can feel my...

634
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,000
I can feel everything.

635
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,280
I can feel my knees.

636
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,480
I can feel my sandwiches.

637
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,140
I...

638
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,400
I...

639
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,500
I can feel three sandwiches in my back pocket.

640
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:58,600
I can feel my...

641
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:58,600


642
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:58,600


643
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:58,600


644
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:58,600


645
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:58,800
What are you doing?

646
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:58,800


647
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:58,800


648
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:58,800


649
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:58,800


650
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:58,800


651
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:58,800


652
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,940
They're speaking to me, Stang.

653
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,220
They...

654
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,660
Learn...

655
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,300
Learn from the sandwiches.

656
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,000
Feel of your sandwich, Dave.

657
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,840
Feel of it.

658
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:17,600
On and off the road to Bob, we are marching forward blind.

659
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:28,260
He has gouged out both our eyes, and he's laughing closed.

660
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,580
In his shoes.

661
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:28,580


662
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:28,580


663
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:28,580


664
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:28,580


665
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:28,580


666
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:28,580


667
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:28,580


668
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:28,580


669
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:28,580


670
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:41,320
He will sell us back our eyes When we join his noble plan

671
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:52,980
For just nineteen ninety-five And a taste of our woodland

672
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:07,360
On and off the road with Bob He has handed us the wheel

673
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:19,120
And he cuddles up with Bob As he counts himself a field

674
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,960
Our eyes are on him And we'll follow him

675
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:22,960


676
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:30,460
On and off the road But Bob forgot to say

677
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:41,980
That the steering wheel went bust The road carries us away

678
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,620
On and off the road for Bob

679
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:56,560
We forgot why we came here

680
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:08,020
We have quit all of our jobs Like a headlight frightened deer

681
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:19,680
He has lit the sacred pipe And he's smiling at us now

682
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,960
On and off the road he's Bob

683
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,720
He's our bull dada We all need him now

684
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:42,520
That hurt Bob! Bob where are you? Stop it Bob! Please!

685
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,020
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy doing all the voices on his song

686
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,880
On and Off the Road with Bob.

687
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:57,100
Incidentally, in his fake life, Bleepo is a character actor in Los Angeles named Bill Cates

688
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:03,600
and he's really good. And if you want him for a paying movie or show, I can put you in touch with him.

689
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:11,720
Before that, we heard a little ESO Swamp Radio with Professor Chas, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

690
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:20,540
But now, Puzzling Evidence offers a mental exercise for dealing with a very poorly recorded sermon by the late Dr. Laguille.

691
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:36,940
The very idea of offing yourself because of some stupid little problem like that makes me think, well, what is a problem that's worthy of killing yourself?

692
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:43,940
So what I want you to do is imagine that you're in the car with the windshield wipers going

693
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:49,880
and you're listening to this religious show on the radio.

694
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,640
Okay.

695
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,760
And you're wondering to yourself, who are these guys?

696
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,600
Gotcha.

697
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,920
Okay, I'm there. I'm driving.

698
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,460
I'm beginning to visualize now.

699
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,540
Oh, what? Don't take your eyes off the road, though.

700
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,620
And now I can see it. I can see it. I can begin to see the beginnings of it.

701
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,440
And...

702
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,320
Tranks and tucks and such.

703
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:29,900
Tranks and tucks and sumch. Yeah, that's the kind of stuff we used to listen to on the radio back in the old days, driving around Texas.

704
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:36,360
The, you know, Texas. I understand that Texas is about the size of Iraq.

705
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,000
Really?

706
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,440
Yeah.

707
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,680
Is that true?

708
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:49,400
So when they say, go ahead and see if you can find some nukes, my test would be, well, let's go see if we can hide a suitcase full of nukes in Texas somewhere and say,

709
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,860
now go see if you can find it. We only have the whole state of Texas to do it in.

710
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,660
You know, I think that...

711
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,360
That would work.

712
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,440
You could build an invisibility chamber if you had to and put it into the...

713
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:05,660
Hide it in Texas?

714
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,340
And hide it in Texas.

715
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,820
You could put up by Amarillo next to Cadillac Ranch and then...

716
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,320
I'd take it out to the...

717
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,880
They just wouldn't see it.

718
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:19,300
To the Texas Triangle, which is kind of like a different version of the Bermuda Triangle, but on land in Texas.

719
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:19,380
Oh, okay.

720
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,520
And I would just put it out in the middle and it would disappear.

721
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,340
Wow.

722
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,420
Until...

723
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:23,980
That's like the playa out there.

724
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,200
I needed to find it.

725
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,980
You like them young, Bob?

726
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,540
How old were you when you met Bob?

727
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,760
Bob is innocent.

728
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,400
It's like they're trying to fulfill a twisted sadomasochistic fantasy.

729
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,800
Some people derive sexual pleasure through...

730
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,900
Inflicting physical, emotional abuse.

731
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,720
Oh, God, no.

732
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,460
No, I swear to you.

733
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,540
Bob didn't do anything like that.

734
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,700
Bob's cold, manipulative.

735
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,420
Bob is innocent.

736
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,120
Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act.

737
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,280
Without him, you're worthless. Nothing.

738
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,380
Bob is innocent.

739
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:22,380


740
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,940
If she knew Bob was involved, she would have confessed.

741
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,400
Bob didn't do it.

742
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,000
Bob is innocent.

743
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,860
Bob went to medical school for two years.

744
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,080
Maybe Bob did this without you knowing.

745
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,460
Maybe everybody think the same way.

746
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,520
Perhaps it's better to enjoy a moment.

747
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,780
Family is quality, true agreement.

748
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,500
Yet, you seem afraid of those who first really…

749
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,780
…dad?

750
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,300
Do we have a

751
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:58,380
Debugu

752
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,420
don't we ask?

753
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,300
Debugug is.

754
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,180
I don't know.

755
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,900
Maybe Bob's not a sadomasochistic thrill killer.

756
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,020
Maybe he's just an asshole.

757
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,720
Probably. This is the only asshole we've got.

758
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,820
Bob is innocent.

759
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,660
Bob is innocent.

760
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,720
Bob was right about you all along.

761
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,040
No!

762
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,660
Oh, damn it! Don't lie to me!

763
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,060
Bob is innocent.

764
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,060
Maybe Bob's not a sadomasochistic thrill killer.

765
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,180
Maybe he's just an asshole.

766
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,860
Probably. This is the only asshole we've got.

767
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,560
Bob is innocent.

768
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,160
Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act.

769
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,920
Without him, you're worthless.

770
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,900
Without him, you're worthless.

771
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,800
Without him, you're worthless.

772
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,860
Without him, you're worthless.

773
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Bob is innocent.

774
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,860
Without him, you're worthless.

775
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,760
Without him, you're worthless.

776
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,640
Bob is innocent.

777
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:26,980
Bob is innocent.

778
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,280
Bob is innocent.

779
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,420
What were you when you met Bob?

780
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,340
Cooking After Dead

781
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,000
Ahab had it coming.

782
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,540
He just wouldn't acknowledge it.

783
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,620
He refused to believe

784
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:49,180
that he could be swallowed whole like a gnat, swimming to the edge of the beer glass, hoping

785
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:57,460
for escape and one last drink, refusing to accept his fate.

786
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:10,460
Ahab was farsighted, to be sure, and the eyepatch to cover his missing eye did not improve his

787
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:10,920
outlook.

788
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:22,280
However, determination was his, and he shall have this giant thing, bigger than his own

789
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,500
ship, if only he could catch sight of it.

790
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,460
The whale is patient, pacing and calculating.

791
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,320
Four!

792
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,040
Forward, men!

793
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:42,400
Forward!

794
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:52,100
The captain yells, pushing the boat further away from its prey, aimlessly chopping the

795
00:36:52,100 --> 00:37:00,480
waves like the only seen on TV onion chopper in 1999 with free shipping which the cook

796
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,660
is in fact using below deck to prepare what is to be the crew's final meal.

797
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,640
But don't get ahead of yourself.

798
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm sorry.

799
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,740
I'm the captain.

800
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,720
I'll take care of it.

801
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:25,860
Well, there's a bunch of water and the ship's floating on top of it.

802
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,300
And look out!

803
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,200
There's a big damn whale!

804
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,720
The near-sighted whale was merely coming in for a closer look.

805
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,300
Ahab grabs the big damn whale and takes it off the boat.

806
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


807
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


808
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


809
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


810
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


811
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


812
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


813
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


814
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


815
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


816
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


817
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


818
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,300


819
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,540
biggest pointy stick at hand and jabs at the mighty curious beast's eye.

820
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:54,700
The sharp object does not penetrate through the custom crafted contact lens provided by

821
00:37:54,700 --> 00:38:01,960
lens crafters in return for a cameo in the dramatized remake of actual fictional events

822
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,760
that may or may not have happened.

823
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:13,960
The whale nicknamed Toby submerges and swims on.

824
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:23,780
Ahab plunges his spare sharp stick into the deck and loudly declares,

825
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,620
Well, what's for lunch?

826
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,140
Good question.

827
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:40,340
That was the entity called Sheridan telling the story of Toby Dick versus Captain Ahab.

828
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:46,480
The weird spooky music before that was an old piece by the El Queso All-Stars that fell

829
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,820
through the cracks sometime in the past.

830
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,660
In fact, I found it down in a crack.

831
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,660
And we'll listen to a most challenging instrumental also by the El Queso All-Stars after this

832
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,880
word from our mentors.

833
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,100
You couldn't have felt worse with no sleepers.

834
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,380
You couldn't have felt any sleep at all.

835
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,220
Yes, morning finds you limp as a rag and blue as indigo.

836
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:10,540
How you dread to face another day, achy, dull, yes, only half alive.

837
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,140
You feel and act like an old, old man.

838
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,580
Yet, strangely enough, the cause of your rundown condition is simplicity itself.

839
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,180
Yes, friends, simplicity.

840
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:25,660
And to take care of your simplicity problems, to restore you to full vigor and health, take

841
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,900
athnesia with Pluto Water.

842
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,900
Good afternoon, friends.

843
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,920
I'm Charles Blank from the United States Census Bureau.

844
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,340
Are you the janitor of this building?

845
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,100
Yes, I'm Mr. Harris, the janitor.

846
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,440
Mr. Harris, is apartment three vacant?

847
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,080
Or is someone there?

848
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,080


849
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,660
No, I'm living there.

850
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,600
What business is this of yours, Mr. Blank?

851
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,300
I see.

852
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,600
I have to fill a questionnaire for the apartment, even though no one is living there.

853
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,980
Can you answer a few questions?

854
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,440
I'm not talking to anybody.

855
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,200
Is apartment three intended for year-round or seasonal occupancy?

856
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,520
You nosy bastard.

857
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,080
Take your phone and get out of here.

858
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,080


859
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,080


860
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,240
Is it for rent or for sale?

861
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,200
You're not getting anything out of me.

862
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,540
I don't like your look.

863
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,780
Would you stick to that?

864
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,300
How many living quarters, occupied and vacant, are at this address?

865
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,320
Hey, are you a stuck record or something?

866
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:49,960
Don't you understand?

867
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,280
I'm not giving you any of these questions to answer them.

868
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,300
Does apartment three have complete kitchen facilities?

869
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,040
Hey, Janet!

870
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,080
Complete kitchen facilities are a sink with piped water, a range or cook stove, a kitchen

871
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,080


872
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,820
sink and a refrigerator.

873
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,140
Is it for that unit only?

874
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,480
Or are there rooms for another house?

875
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,500
How many rooms are in apartment three?

876
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:17,560
Do not count bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyer halls or bathrooms.

877
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,780
Hey, Blank.

878
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,760
Hey, you giving my friend Harry any trouble?

879
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,660
Is there hot and cold piped water in this building?

880
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,260
Let's throw him out.

881
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,740
Does apartment three have a flush toilet?

882
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,760
Yes, and you're going right down it.

883
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,560
Come on, Renate!

884
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,060
For apartment three only or a flush toilet?

885
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


886
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


887
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


888
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


889
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


890
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


891
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


892
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


893
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


894
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


895
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


896
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


897
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


898
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


899
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,460
Yes, millions of men and women are in the same lamentable plight today.

900
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,120
And not one in ten can guess the cause.

901
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,380
That's the insidious thing about amnesia.

902
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:52,320
It drags you down, slows your mind, robs you of your joys and pleasures, yet you hardly

903
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,620
realize that you're slipping.

904
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,100
You're right, Roy.

905
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,000
Isn't that true?

906
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,560
The eye of light is looking right through you.

907
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,900
God bless you.

908
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:06,680
You know, the folks at French Lick Springs Hotel in French Lick, Indiana, that's America's

909
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,740
greatest health retort.

910
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
The home of Pluto water.

911
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,060
If you can call that a home, Ray, the light's shining.

912
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,340
Go.

913
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:15,760
That's true.

914
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,300
That's true.

915
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:16,720
That's true.

916
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,300
You know, we have two excellent golf courses down there.

917
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,180
Three?

918
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:21,880
Splendid.

919
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,660
No, only two.

920
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,460
Ah, but the eye of light sees three, Ray.

921
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,560
It sees three.

922
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:26,980
Ah.

923
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,940
Wonderful, wonderful golf courses.

924
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,220
I see.

925
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:29,480
I see.

926
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:29,600
I see.

927
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:29,740
Go ahead.

928
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,220
Go ahead.

929
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,980
The power's coming up through the table.

930
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,840
Splendid, splendid riding facilities.

931
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,220
You're a weird pastor.

932
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:35,920
Ride.

933
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,680
Ride on.

934
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,300
I'm on you.

935
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,240
I'm with you.

936
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:38,440
Ride.

937
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,960
And lots of outdoor amusements are provided.

938
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:43,480
Yes.

939
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:43,480


940
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,760
But God's looking down on everything you do outdoors, friend.

941
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,120
That's true.

942
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,220
That's true.

943
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,200
God's got his eye on your eye, so watch out and keep going, Charlie.

944
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,940
Carry an umbrella.

945
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,380
Decide right now to turn the tables on old man gloom, huh?

946
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,440
Turn them upside down.

947
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,080
Take Pluto water every morning for ten mornings.

948
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,800
Yeah, my golly.

949
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:57,940
Yeah.

950
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,680
And see a new world in ten days.

951
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,140
See two new worlds, dear friend.

952
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:02,840
Two new worlds.

953
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,700
You're gonna need to.

954
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,660
Down, Pluto.

955
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,060
Down.

956
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,500
Larry.

957
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,400
Well, by golly, God said...

958
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,580
Look, Pluto's making more water.

959
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:08,840
Huh?

960
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:09,660
Excuse me.

961
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,820
That's okay, St. John.

962
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,680
And God said...

963
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,060
This is when I was with God in Miami.

964
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:24,100
He said, uh, Harry, be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it.

965
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,060
Do you know what subdue means?

966
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:27,920
What?

967
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:27,920


968
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,120
Uh...

969
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,620
Is it like sublet?

970
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,680
Hey, Harry, is that guy down there asking you questions again?

971
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,300
No, dear friends, janitors of all the lonely houses in the world.

972
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:43,900
I know you've had your bad times, and I know you've had your good times doing things you

973
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,500
didn't understand.

974
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,900
God bless you, Pastor.

975
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,840
But things are changing, friends.

976
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,300
The eye of God is looking down upon you right now.

977
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,420
Who asked you, Pastor?

978
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,000
Look him back in the eye, dear friends.

979
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,900
I can't see.

980
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:57,900


981
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:57,900


982
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:57,900


983
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:57,900


984
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:57,900


985
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:57,900


986
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:57,900


987
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:57,900


988
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:57,900


989
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:57,900


990
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:57,900


991
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:57,900


992
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,460
Either can God, dear friends, because love and radio is blind.

993
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,340
Don't blink.

994
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,580
Don't blink, dear friends.

995
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,280
My radio's on the blink.

996
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,360
My radio's on the blink, dear friends.

997
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,620
God, I love your eyes, Father.

998
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,860
Eye, just one eye, the eye of love, spelled I, the letter I, without the letter...

999
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,900
What could we do, dear friends?

1000
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:25,880
And remember, friends, it's been brought to you today by snifters, humorous napkins,

1001
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,880
hot trays, cassette narcosters, and...

1002
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:27,880


1003
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,820
Fun warmers.

1004
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:34,520
Drop earrings, finger scarves, gavels, and sash buckles, shredded cellophane and parchment

1005
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,940
scraps, squeeze toys, mechanical toys, blow-up women, and extra parts.

1006
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:25,800
With each time you roll around, yourasi, 꼭umputis will catch fire!

1007
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:25,840
New

1008
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,160
Thank you.

1009
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,400
Thank you.

1010
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,900
Thank you.

1011
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,120
Thank you.

1012
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:27,860
Thank you.

1013
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,320
Thank you.

1014
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,620
Thank you.

1015
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,980
Thank you.

1016
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,880
Thank you.

1017
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,540
Thank you.

1018
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,800
Thank you.

1019
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,000
Thank you.

1020
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,320
Thank you.

1021
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,360
Thank you.

1022
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,440
Thank you.

1023
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,100
Let's go."

1024
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,340
Let's go.

1025
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,100
So we're going to do Sympathy at The Divival.

1026
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,200
We'll have the biggest Dobbs head in the world and

1027
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,580
Einstein secret orchestra doing Sympathy for the Devil.

1028
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:56,640
In front of the Dobbs head painting by Jesus with the blood

1029
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,880
of virginsmes ascend.

1030
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:06,460
We'll be flitting all over the stage and we'll be chopping the heads off Christians to the beat of symphony for the devil.

1031
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,600
Hope you get my day.

1032
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,320
This was printed in the Bible.

1033
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,220
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:10,900
Oh, yeah.

1035
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,720
I was puzzling you with the nature of my game.

1036
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,700
Oh, yeah, baby.

1037
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:25,900
I watched the glee white kids and queens walk the tender cage.

1038
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,680
For the night they were there.

1039
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,140
I shot down who killed the Kennedy's.

1040
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,520
When after all, it was you and me.

1041
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,360
Let me please introduce myself.

1042
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,340
I'm a man of wealth and taste.

1043
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,860
I ain't trapped for troubadours.

1044
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,200
Who can kill before they reach my face?

1045
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,040
Johnny.

1046
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,000
We are Baltimore.

1047
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,500
I better beAAAAA Dodam.

1048
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:14,480
I've always thought I was жеthereall g freezer on a ride

1049
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,760
As the melody will die, it will ohheee.

1050
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,840
So who can kill me?

1051
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,100
is responsible for this auto carnage?

1052
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,440
Of course.

1053
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,980
He has a fleet of limos now

1054
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,440
that carry him all over the country.

1055
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,320
Mm-hmm.

1056
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,740
And those damn hillbillies

1057
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,660
who work for him

1058
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:40,040
just love to crush little creatures on the road.

1059
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,200
Yep, that's what they do down there.

1060
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,840
They don't have any room at work for staying

1061
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,800
and crush little critters on the road.

1062
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,720
Yee-haw!

1063
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,600
That's what we say here.

1064
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,600
Who is this?

1065
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,700
Well, I don't know.

1066
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,060
You're playing the record.

1067
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,420
I was asking the trailer brides.

1068
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,020
Yeah.

1069
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,600
Oh, great.

1070
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,280
Those little trailer twists

1071
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,600
certainly turn me to...

1072
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,980
one of those beach events this evening.

1073
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:23,660
They will?

1074
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,480
Of course.

1075
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,700
Well, that's a different...

1076
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,160
puts a different complexion on the matter of...

1077
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,420
Nice foundation.

1078
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,080
...other black tie with my suit on.

1079
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,420
And now we have the slow dance for you,

1080
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,800
those of you that are couples.

1081
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,400
Yes, with that slow eye...

1082
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,640
This is the mop-up, the motor oil on the dance floor.

1083
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,800
We'll mop up the motor oil with these dancers.

1084
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,240
God bless them.

1085
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,820
In a 72-hour dance marathon

1086
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:54,060
for the Subgenius Youth Outreach Program.

1087
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:54,480
Come on.

1088
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,260
Come on.

1089
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:55,400
Come on.

1090
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:55,800
Come on.

1091
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:07,220
It's the first time we can be so executed at a roller coaster.

1092
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,700
I know, it's the first time.

1093
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:07,820
Miriam, she's going to be so switched.

1094
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:09,460
I didn't know she'd be so switched everyday.

1095
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:09,660
Come on.

1096
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,360
late an ounce of gasoline out of it.

1097
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,460


1098
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,460


1099
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,460


1100
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,460


1101
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,460


1102
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,460


1103
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,460


1104
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,460


1105
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,460


1106
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:13,120
Here I go, go on.

1107
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:13,220
Here I go.

1108
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:13,260
As is the mode to deal with girls here we go.

1109
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,820
The action is not what people 오

1110
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,480
want, profile the audience regionally.

1111
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:17,480


1112
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,440
They sound different, they're so different.

1113
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,060
With me here you look at a certain change in the relationship,

1114
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:25,820
which will give you awareness.

1115
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,560
It must be springtime back in Arizona.

1116
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,420
The lights are going out in the city.

1117
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,220
The long day wanes, the slow moon climbs.

1118
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,540
Lights are going out all across this country.

1119
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:52,880
Our freedom in chains slowly suffocating.

1120
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,000
You ask me why I love her?

1121
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,600
Give me time.

1122
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,100
I'll explain.

1123
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:30,620
Have you drifted on a cold fog drifting over Kansas, sir?

1124
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,140
Bayou over San Francisco Bay?

1125
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:40,560
Have you heard the bellow of a Bob White calling in the diesel in the Appalachian mines?

1126
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:47,480
Look with awe and wonder drifting way up high where men who braved a hard new world

1127
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:47,520
were born.

1128
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,960
Have you ever stepped on the diesel in the city dock?

1129
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,560
Do you think of them when you stroll along a rock way high?

1130
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,080
Have you seen the mighty teet?

1131
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,420
Have you seen an eagle roll along Missouri's shore?

1132
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,760
Have you felt it rage along the shore?

1133
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,620
Is the word why a mayor reef?

1134
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,800
From Alaska's Everglades to Maine, my heart runs out.

1135
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,640
My pulse rise fast.

1136
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,260
The mind of her domain.

1137
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,040
You ask me why I love her?

1138
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,480
I've a million Appalachian mines.

1139
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,680
My beautiful Appalachian mines.

1140
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,900
Beneath God's wide old fog sky.

1141
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:42,800
And found my moon from shining sea to sea.

1142
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:50,700
최근

1143
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:58,940
And so we come to the end of this broadcasting day.

1144
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,180
That was Bob Shed on Me by the great Lee Murr.

1145
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:05,300
All 1,815 hours of slack.

1146
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,080
Are downloadable from subgenius.com,

1147
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:12,560
where just the front page alone can take you to worlds you never dreamed existed.

1148
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,960
Worlds, like the book of the subgenius.

1149
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,080
Neighbor World by Lone Cow Dave.

1150
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,740
Eyelash, our new subgenius sci-fi novel.

1151
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:28,160
Eternal Salvation in the form of the huge subgenius ministerial ordainment kit.

1152
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:34,340
T-shirts, fertility masks, stickers, pins, doodahs, gee-gaws, gimcracks,

1153
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,040
and the six other subgenius radio shows.

1154
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:44,380
And subgenius online forums and fleecebook pages, the number of which is too damn high.

1155
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,480
Did I mention our holy church soap?

1156
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,400
Triology soaps.

1157
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,000
That's subgenius.com.

1158
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,560
And now you must praise Bob.
