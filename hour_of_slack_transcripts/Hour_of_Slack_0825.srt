1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
That thing was created to live in a poisoned world.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,920
The rain came and it was pure.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,880
Man created it, but God destroyed it.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,740
He brought the rain and fresh air.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,560
If he couldn't live, then neither could the others of his kind.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,220
There was a voice on the radio while you were gone.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,920
There are others out there.

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,140
Now hear this!

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,820
Our advanced analyzer software helps you quickly sort through expensive diapers.

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,280
And our streaming data page enables you to size up body parts.

11
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,920
It lives on contaminated flesh. It thrives on contaminated air.

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,320
Things that kill men nourish it.

13
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,600
Things that kill men nourish it.

14
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:25,560
Oh no, wait, shut the, Dave, Dave, Dave, I'm not kidding, shut the door, Dave.

15
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,320
Oh, shit, it's too late, I'm getting out of here.

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,100
Are they all in here now?

17
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,980
Sorry, I'm putting my...

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,460
I'm putting my suit on. Everybody, get in your suit.

19
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,920
Get in your bio suit, now.

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,560
Don't panic! Don't panic!

21
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,360
Suit up, boys!

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,660
All hatches are closing. All hatches are closing.

23
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,000
The audience is puking.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, shit.

25
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,680
Well, welcome to another journey to Endless Vista.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,140
Our favorite destination here for the pre-meet people.

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,180
Those of you human tripods out there want to give it a shout.

28
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,940
And that's the Hour of Slug!

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,620
Time again for the Hour of Slug!

30
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,360
You're listening to the Hour of Slug.

31
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,620
Slug.

32
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,520
Man, this is like the best, best.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,620
Best show I've ever seen in the lounge, man.

34
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,680
And making time go by so fast.

35
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
You're on drugs, dude.

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,340
Yeah, I'm on all of them tonight.

37
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,920
Did you try the Sumerian tablets again?

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
No, no, I don't think I'll do that again.

39
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,140
Oh, man, I had a thing where I was like tough in the middle of my forebrain last night.

40
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,400
Yeah.

41
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,220
And you can be with Bob and be listening to the teachings that come through.

42
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,140
And I tell you, friends, if you can just get that...

43
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,320
If you can just pull out that wallet.

44
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,440
Pull it out of your pocket.

45
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,420
Pull it out of your purse.

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,900
Put your hands on the radio!

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,320
Lay your hands on the radio there in the home!

48
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,260
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,040
Now, this is government business.

50
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,040
And if you stay, you're interfering with government property.

51
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,000
So you better just go on home.

52
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,580
Oh, friends, I just...

53
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,760
The miracle of the Bob world is unfolding in front of me now.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,300
I can see in the spirit through my windshield.

55
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,480
I see superimposed over this mix master.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,320
Across which I drive, I can see an ocean of self-realized subgeniuses.

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,020
All in one place.

58
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,540
They're waiting up to their knees in blood.

59
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,180
But it's the blood of the baptism of the mighty fist face of Bob!

60
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:55,320
The face that can pile through eight-foot-thick titanium steel conspiracy Fort Knox doors.

61
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,860
The face that can burn through metal with that mighty pipe.

62
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,540
The face that can burn through metal with that mighty pipe.

63
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,700
Cobb had promised to show them where he buried the bodies.

64
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,120
They brought in a dog cadaver to help locate the bodies.

65
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,400
They scoured the two victims.

66
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,080
I was, uh, uh, for that, uh, uh, two, two.

67
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,840
Eventually, the searchers discovered easy-squeeze bacon.

68
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:17,880
Priceless.

69
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,520
The world never had a true account of that test.

70
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,960
What are you trying to tell me?

71
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,200
Coyote.

72
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,880
Lots of game in here now.

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,760
Well, contaminated game.

74
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,940
Fighting for life just like we are.

75
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:45,960
Quality, value, style, service, selection, convenience, economy, savings, performance, experience, hospitality, low rates, friendly service, name brands, easy terms, affordable prices, money-back guarantee, free installation.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,360

No one will call on you.

82
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,420

Offer good while supplies last.

87
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,680
Two to a customer.

88
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,700
Each item sold separately.

89
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,640
Batteries not included.

90
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,820
Mileage may vary.

91
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,860
All sales are final.

92
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,960
Allow six weeks for delivery.

Some items not available.

94
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,260
Some assembly required.

No purchase necessary.

114
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,360
It's our way of saying thank you.

115
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,800
Actually, it's our way of saying bend over just a little bit farther.

116
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,740
So we can stick this big advertising dick up your ass a little bit deeper.

117
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,300
A little bit deeper.

118
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,740
A little bit deeper.

119
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,780
And you open the door and you step inside.

120
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,820
We're inside our hearts.

121
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,320
Now imagine your pain is a white ball of healing light.

122
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,520
That's right.

123
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,820
Your pain.

124
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,380
The pain itself is a white ball of healing light.

125
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,920
I don't think so.

126
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,500
This is your life.

127
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,160
Good to the last drop.

128
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,020
Doesn't get any better than this.

129
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,040
This is your life.

130
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,080
And it's ending one minute at a time.

131
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,840
This isn't a seminar.

132
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,360
This isn't a weekend retreat.

133
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,640
Where you are now, you can't even imagine what the bottom will be like.

134
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,620
Only after disaster can we be resurrected

135
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,420
It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything

136
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,840
Nothing is static, everything is appalling

137
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,880
Everything is falling apart

138
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,560
This is your life, this is your life, this is your life, this is your life

139
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,620
It doesn't get any better than this

140
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,600
This is your life, this is your life, this is your life, this is your life

141
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,740
And it's bending one minute at a time

142
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,160
You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake

143
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,780
You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else

144
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,240
We are all part of the same compo-siep

145
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,580
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world

146
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,860
You are not your bank account

147
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,900
You are not the clothes you wear

148
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,200
You are not the contents of your wallet

149
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,900
You are not your bowel cancer

150
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,400
You are not your grande latte

151
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,300
You are not the car you drive

152
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,140
You are not your car you drive

153
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,980
You are not your fucking peckies

154
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,440
You have to give up

155
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,820
You have to give up

156
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,960
You have to realize that someday you will die

157
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,460
Until you know that you are useless

158
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,980
I say let me never be complete

159
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,460
I say may I never be content

160
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,100
I say deliver me from Swedish furniture

161
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,440
I say deliver me from clever art

162
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,120
I say deliver me from clever art

163
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,380
Clear skin and perfect teeth

164
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,780
I say you have to give up

165
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,700
I say evolve

166
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,120
And let the chips fall where they may

167
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,900
This is your life

168
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,240
Doesn't get any better than this

169
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,000
This is your life

170
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,340
And it's bending one minute at a time

171
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,840
You have to give up.

172
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,180
You have to give up.

173
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,660
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

174
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,800
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

175
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,940
Welcome to Fight Club.

176
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,760
If this is your first night,

177
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,120
you have to fight.

178
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,600
And, friends, that was, yes, from the Fight Club,

179
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,640
Dust Brothers,

180
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,820
This Is Your Life, the name of that.

181
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,320
Like this.

182
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:56,160
Music that mocks Scientology.

183
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,180
No punting, wrongs, or a life-beating friend.

184
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,480
She checked, vouched, and asked,

185
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,300
while the race hated,

186
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,200
milk-bombing, homophobic, coke-sniffing,

187
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,380
chain-spooking, salad-pizzing,

188
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,060
wine-dodging, no-gore, con-man.

189
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,660
He lied for a living,

190
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,800
always taking, never giving,

191
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,120
anything but orders,

192
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,520
a whole order of money and guns and drugs

193
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,820
and thugs and intelligence.

194
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,400
It's a good thing that his lackeys were incompetent.

195
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,340
Operations, no, I showed right through.

196
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,820
The disguise of propriety,

197
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,980
the mask of legality,

198
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,920
the nearest script,

199
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,300
the way to show us the true face

200
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,600
of the Church of Scientology,

201
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,740
their actual philosophy.

202
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,020
Make money, make money,

203
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,440
make more money,

204
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,300
make money,

205
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,880
make money, make more money,

206
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,200
make money, make more money,

207
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,600
make money, make more money,

208
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,520
Mary Sue Hubbard and ten other clans

209
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,300
were eventually jailed for a sinister plan

210
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
to infiltrate and wiretap the world's governments,

211
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,620
find info that can harm them,

212
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,720
steal files and documents,

213
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,100
and try to sneak away with them.

214
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,180
But guess who got caught in a paranoid plot?

215
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:48,480
What?

216
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,360
It was Mary Sue.

217
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,580
What's Hubbard gonna do?

218
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,700
You think he stepped in to save the day?

219
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,640
No fucking way.

220
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,440
That coward hid until his dying day.

221
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,300
Make money, make more money,

222
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,900
make more money,

223
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:57,980


224
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,700
make money, make more money,

225
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,040
make money, make more money,

226
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,720
make money, make more money,

227
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,600
make money, make more money,

228
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,280
make money, make more money,

229
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:04,800

230
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,080
make more money,

231
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,440
Scientology, what can be said?

232
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,460
Shit poured from the head of a madman that's dead and gone.

233
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,840
There's something very wrong with Ron.

234
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,280
His don don't work, the guy's a jerk.

235
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,520
His wall of shit ain't real, you think?

236
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,980
Charlatan tricks from Pauper's bitch.

237
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,980
The followers who take the fits don't care,

238
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,760
so all-stars, bring you this.

239
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,700
Little Pauper and Ron is wiggin' like a beat-up virgin.

240
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,400
Cheatin' change, meltin' none more than macaroni.

241
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,500
Cheatin' change, chacun thenbean...

242
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,200
Touch monkey pop Bleed on their pops

243
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,780
Drop in drop with delusion that marks the elusion

Oh, Make Money, Make More Money Mix, friends.

252
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,120
That was the El Queso All-Stars, and that is a band song.

253
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,380
Apparently, the Church of Scientology insisted that they remove that and various other things from mp3.com.

254
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:41,820
But I'm going to tell you where to get more El Queso All-Stars, and that is mp3.com slash El Queso All-Stars.

255
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,000
And I trust you know how to spell El Queso.

256
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:51,760
They also have an mp3.com called Interbulator, so check out Interbulator.

257
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,960
The El Queso All-Stars, friends.

258
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,160
I'm the world's biggest fan of the El Queso All-Stars.

259
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,460
Yeah.

261
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,100
Sign up today.

262
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,780
You could be leaving on that jet plane.

263
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,120
Jumping from 10,000 feet.

264
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,640
Yeah, baby.

265
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,400
What did I have queued up here?

266
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,940
Oh, hang on.

267
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,640
Here, listen to this.

268
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,460
Friday night, my friends.

269
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,260
7.30.

270
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,020
God has given Pastor a message of faith for you.

271
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,720
A message of faith for you.

272
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,060
The devil have gone far enough.

273
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,320
The devil have gone far enough.

274
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,980
Prayer warriors, meet me on my knees, on your knees, Friday night at 7.30.

275
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,120
And listen now, my friends, the prayer tower is open.

276
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,600
Prayer warriors, the prayer tower is open right now.

277
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,920
You that need prayer, my God.

278
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:08,500
Prayer warriors, the prayer team are sitting by the telephones right now to pray the prayer of faith for you.

279
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,600
Prayer warriors.

280
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,860
His name is Jesus.

281
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,140
Oh, make your heart sing.

282
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,520
The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that.

283
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,060
Greed, for lack of a better word, is good.

284
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,120
Greed is right.

285
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,180
Greed works.

286
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:41,260
Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.

287
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,800
Greed, in all of its forms.

288
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:50,880
Greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge of mankind.

289
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,800
And greed, you mark my words.

290
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,120
Greed is its naturalன

291
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,120


292
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,120


293
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,120


294
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,600
The bank turnover of the Charbets will not only save Tel-Dar paper,

295
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,080
but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA.

296
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,120
Thank you very much.

297
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:11,040

304

vern dreaming what the sexist policy true to write a position is not necessary for this has already happened.

305
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,120
So lonesome I could die

306
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,820
So kiss me and smile for me

307
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,420
Tell me that you'll wait for me

Hold me like you'll never let me go

Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane

310
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,940
Don't know when I'll be back again

311
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,820
Oh babe, I hate to go

312
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,660
So many times I let you down

313
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,120
There's so many times I fucked around

314
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,840
I tell you now, they don't mean nothing

315
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,860
Cause every place I go, I'll think of you

316
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,380
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you

317
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,420
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring

318
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,160
So kiss me and smile for me

319
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,740
Tell me that you'll wait for me

320
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,600
Hold me like you'll never let me go

321
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,860
Cause I'm leaving

322
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,640
So kiss me and smile for me

323
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:23,860

00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,360
Don't know when I'll be back again

328
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,280
Oh babe, I hate to go

329
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,460
Now the time has come to leave you

330
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,980
One more time and let me kiss you

331
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,040
Close your eyes and I'll be on my own way

332
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,460
Dream about the days to come

333
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,880
When I won't have to leave alone

334
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,960
About the times that I won't have to

335
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,760
Say

336
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,740
Oh kiss me and smile for me

337
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,420
Tell me that you'll wait for me

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,440
Hold me like you'll never let me

339
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,880
Never let me go

340

Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane

341
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,180
Don't know when I'll be back again

342
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,180
Oh babe, I hate to go

343
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,300
Yeah

344
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,540
Gov'r, Gov'r, hey!

345
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,560
Gov'r, Gov'r, gov'r, hey!

346
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,800
We do not accept any of you

347
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,520
They don't make music like they used to back in the day

348
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,500
Remember the old days of the caravans

349
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,440
When the minstrels would carry their own doodads over their shoulders

350
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,360
And stop in many a squalid town

351
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,020
We got up early in the morning back in them days

352
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,760
We tune our instruments with a cobalt lantern

353
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,380
And wait for those trumpeters to appear

354
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,940
On the horizon of the sky on the horizon of the sky

355
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,860
And then everybody in town would show up and pay us their 14, 15 cents, whatever we charged.

356
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,600
Those were the days.

357
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,580
Remember that, you guys?

358
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,480
Just a ramblin' band.

359
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,940
Oh, you were unconscious.

360
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,080
Yeah, they killed us.

361
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,700
Yeah, they killed you.

362
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,480
Well, they didn't really kill you.

363
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,080
They knocked you into a coma.

364
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,740
And we had to take care of you, but you were the most wonderful thing on the side show.

365
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,500
I've heard those were great times.

366
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,860
Oh, we used to put ice cream cones on your shoulders and have little kids pee on you.

367
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,680
We'd just spoof and goof on you any way we could.

368
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,280
Chaz, you remember those days?

369
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,540
Those were the days.

370
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,140
They're gone, though.

371
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,980
Back in the day, Chaz would forget how to play the piano once in a while, and we'd just stick you up there like as the stiff.

372
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,680
And pretend like your fingers, your little digits, passed the word.

373
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,900
I wish I could remember.

374
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,920
Oh, I wish.

375
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,680
Oh, man.

376
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,920
I think we were a tribe of wandering Hindus, perhaps.

377
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,080
Oh, that was another reincarnation tale.

378
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,480
Wandering bohemians.

379
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,700
Gypsies.

380
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,840
On the road.

381
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,920
On the road of life.

382
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,600
Tingar.

383
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,100
And...

384
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,180
Chiton.

385
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,260
Or living death, as the case may be.

386
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,540
Oui, nous sommes chitons.

387
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,920
We are gypsies.

388
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,300
We travel here, we travel there.

389
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,340
Leaving our little sperm banks everywhere.

390
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,500
That's the story of Coco Paley, is to impregnate each individual town.

391
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,280
That's what Kerouac said we should do.

392
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,880
That's what Bob did.

393
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,840
Bob did do, and that's much to his credit and also his discredit,

394
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,800
because of the miscreant mutant mind.

395
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,020
Monsters that have sprung up in his backyard.

396
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,320
Those cute little bastards.

397
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:31,600
Cute perhaps for those with strange binoculars shaped eyeglasses.

398
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,640
Brad Williams!

399
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,540
Who's knocking on the wall?

400
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,000
Uh, Chut.

401
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,260
Uh, Chut.

402
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,940
Chut.

403
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,040
Hello, faithful listeners.

404
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,840
This is the Colonel, the overseer of the slaves known as Four Letter Words, also known as the Four Letter Words.

405
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:51,840


406
00:20:51,840 --> 00:21:02,460
This album is laden with subliminal messages, here to teach you about the subgenius, the cult of the subgenius, and J.R. Bob Dobbs.

407
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,660
And by the way, can I get a jalapeno?

408
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,100
Jalapeno!

409
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:07,940
Jalapeno.

410
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:17,120
I also want to tell you, by the way, this is protected by the B, the O, and the B, with the D, pinkies!

411
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,880
He's the master of slack!

412
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,700
Bop-Dop!

413
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,080
Bings will stab you in the back!

414
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,720
Bop-Dop!

415
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,700
He's got a soup pipe!

416
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,620
Bop-Dop!

417
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,640
Never listen to the hype!

418
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,540
Bop-Dop!

419
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,460
X stands on its way!

420
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,480
Bop-Dop!

421
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,400
His pot's gonna stay!

422
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,380
Bop-Dop!

423
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,160
He can tell anything!

424
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,320
Bop-Dop!

425
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,360
Fiber does the night in range!

426
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,200
Bop-Dop!

427
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,900
All the chicks dig!

428
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,140
Bop-Dop!

429
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,140
He ain't even fuck a pig!

430
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,120
Bop-Dop!

431
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,060
He's got a briefcase!

432
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,060
Bop-Dop!

433
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,020
He can provide a stain!

434
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,860
X stands on its way!

435
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,840
All you pigs stay away!

436
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,020
X stands on its way!

437
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,840
All you pigs stay away!

438
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,000
X stands on its way!

439
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,860
All you pigs stay away!

440
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,920
X stands on its way!

441
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,900
All you pigs stay away!

442
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,980
Oh, my Bob?

443
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
He's the master of slack!

444
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,920
Bop-Dop!

445
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,160
Bings will stab you in the back!

446
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,900
Bop-Dop!

447
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,840
He's got a soup pipe!

448
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,760
Bop-Dop!

449
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,760
Never listen to the hype!

450
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,700
Bop-Dop!

451
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,480
He can tell anything!

452
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,640
Bop-Dop!

453
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,640
Fiber does the night in range!

454
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:21,820
Bop-Dop!

455
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:21,820


456
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:21,820


457
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:21,820


458
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:21,820


459
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:21,820


460
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:21,820


461
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:21,820


462
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,520
Bob Dog!

463
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,740
X stands on its way!

464
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,500
Bob Dog!

465
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,780
His pa's gonna say...

466
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,400
Bob Dog!

467
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,120
All the chicks dig!

468
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,320
Bob Dog!

469
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,360
He ain't even fuck a pig!

470
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,340
Bob Dog!

471
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,320
He's got a briefcase!

472
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,280
Bob Dog!

473
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,920
He's giving matters payyyy!

474
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,120
X stands on its way, all you pigs stay away!

475
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,440
We'll be right back.

476
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,780
We'll be right back.

477
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,880
The four-letter words.

478
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,200
I'm not sure how I got that.

479
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,260
I'm confused.

480
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:04,680
It was in my computer under the directory labeled Two Beans,

481
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:11,720
as if it were that young, worthy Two Beans who had submitted it.

482
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:17,760
But it just doesn't sound like him because it's a bit slicker.

483
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,680
Friends, we've also heard,

484
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:27,660
and we'll continue to hear a great bit of the old subgenius Media Barrage No. 5,

485
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,840
which is being remixed for the CD world.

486
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,840
It was composed back in that time known as the day.

487
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,080
Yes, the day when Bob walked the earth, my friends,

488
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:49,440
when the hour of slack was about nothing but that man J.R. Bob Dobbs.

489
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:58,640
That one pipe-smoking salesman who has brought us this church of the subgenius.

490
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,180
And what is the church of the subgenius, my friend?

491
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,120
It is the voice of the people who have simply had enough

492
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,340
and will no longer tolerate the normal's assault against decency,

493
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,060
or indecency as the case may be,

494
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,640
with an exciting new attitude and a positive solution-oriented approach.

495
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,880
The tide can.

496
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,460
Can and will be turned, my friend,

497
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,860
through faith and prayer followed by action.

498
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,520
We shall overcome.

499
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,460
Ah, yes.

500
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:41,960
Yes, my friends, the church of the subgenius is an educational missionary effort

501
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,460
to offer a tried, proven, and tested solution

502
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,640
to this rising assault on society's

503
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,660
traditions of family morality

504
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,360
and the law of our cult leader J.R. Bob Dobbs.

505
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,260
Praise Bob.

506
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,760
And, uh, uh, yes.

507
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,040
I've used more water in the last two months than I have in 64 years.

508
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,440
Maybe that's why you're still alive, Pete.

509
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,220
Hmm.

510
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,100
The state of Mother Nature.

511
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,360
One.

512
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,880
Look at them.

513
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,240
They'll tell you more than a thousand words of mine.

514
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,400
Here they are.

515
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,140
All real.

516
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,880
All true.

517
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,820
The cutest of them all.

518
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,060
Our little tiny Mitchet bull.

519
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,040
See them all.

520
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,700
Right here.

521
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,540
Pretty loose.

522
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,560
Actually, two cows into one body.

523
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:47,900
Yes.

524
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,880
A fifth slink right out of a rear end.

525
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,800
Come now and see them here.

526
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,780
Here they are.

527
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,980
Strange mistakes of Mother Nature.

528
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:08,740
One look at them will tell you more than a thousand words of mine.

529
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,480
Oh, Tony, you and me belong together.

530
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,920
We're poured out of the same mold.

531
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,380
I wouldn't make a fuck on that baby.

532
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,740
I hope this clears up any confusion and that you will continue doing business with us

533
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,260
even though we are a cadre of goat-raving malcontents with only spotty regard for dental hygiene.

534
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,620
You know, I see some real gold in the church of the subgenius

535
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,100
and odd ways from unexpected corners and satisfyingly regular intervals.

536
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,440
Once you turn on the wipers and clear the windshield of bullshit,

537
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,660
bouts of clumsiness, vertiginous logistics,

538
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,240
moth-ridden wallets,

539
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,380
slips of the tongue that make you skid all the way into the kitchen

540
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,900
like you stepped on a dog egg at 3 friggin' a.m.

541
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,620
And glasses of tights.

542
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,840
It's one hell of a vista from Stang's old Mindio machine of yore

543
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,340
in a Mike Rittenback room in Dallas.

544
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,460
Didn't there smell that?

545
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,240
All the way back to Bob being made the number one champion of frogs

546
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,760
for the whole 20th century by bleeping Time Warner for dubstix.

547
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,460
I mean, think about it.

548
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,780
We bump off all Time Warner.

549
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,480
Kill me.

550
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,740
You?

551
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,240
I haven't had a good laugh all day.

552
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,460
We are in the dark.

553
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,060
You will assimilate.

554
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,320
The resistance is useless.

555
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,560
Come on, you are very relevant.

556
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,420
A squid eating dough in a polyethylene bag is fast and bulbous.

557
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:43,900
Got me?

558
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,260
I'm afraid he's going out of his mind.

559
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,260
He seems to live in a world all of his own.

560
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,940
He's a mutation, Rick.

561
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,740
Freak of this new atomic world of ours.

562
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,140
What's his name?

563
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,180
Bob.

564
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,560
Bob.

565
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,660
Ain't that a bitch?

566
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,800
Is he live or dead?

567
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,200
I see thoughts within his head.

568
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,500
Running as fast as they can.

569
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,880
Iron Man lives again.

570
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,980
Iron Man lives again.

571
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,340
Iron Man lives again.

572
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,640
Really is.

573
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,480
I'm so upset.

574
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,580
One, two, three, two, three.

575
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,060
Once again, it's time to sit around the old plastic fire

576
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,240
and put our feet up on the diving sofa.

577
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,360
We're gonna have a few half hours with Willy Wanker

578
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,040
and some of the other dinosaur creatures

579
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,940
and then we're gonna show each other our sex organs.

580
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,020
That's right.

581
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,940
We're gonna show...

582
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,040
And especially for you kids under seven and a half

583
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,600
who don't really have fully developed organs,

584
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,940
we're gonna be playing the Farfisa.

585
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,620
It's a wonderful instrument.

586
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,080
Look over here with Uncle Cherry.

587
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,980
Oh, you were magnificent last night.

588
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,380
That's right.

589
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,700
I love you all when you're wearing all four legs and that strange hat.

590
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,440
It's actually a beacon to another cosmos.

591
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:08,940
A parallel dimension.

592
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,960
I loved it.

593
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,220
This show hurts my head.

594
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,660
Oh, God, my head is hurting.

595
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:23,540
This show is an anthem to Christians and other like-minded American products.

596
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,260
Eat your cheese.

597
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,340
Digest your Jizzles.

598
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,600
Think your raggy tag thoughts.

599
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,020
Go to the mall.

600
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
Go to the mall.

601
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,640
Chaz was just having so much fun.

602
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,400
He's got a lot of sex with the volume knob.

603
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:48,880
I'm Britney.

604
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,940
Some people scratch and actually, you know, take care of the age.

605
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,320
I wouldn't even know.

606
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,820
I wouldn't know a damn Britney Spears song.

607
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,940
I'm so out of it.

608
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,980
I've become just like Batman living in the back.

609
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:11,060
I like Christina, and they call her the bad girl of the duo.

610
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,500
And they also call her the loser.

611
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,100
As if you're actually in some sport contest.

612
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,440
I like Mariah Carey since she's become a dumpy has-been.

613
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,200
I like Moses in a big red dress.

614
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,360
But slatternly.

615
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,660
Uh, this is, this is, sighted.

616
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,240
Overgun look.

617
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,660
I like the Buddha.

618
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,160
I like the Buddha in a miniskirt.

619
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,220
Used up young.

620
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,100
28 going on 58.

621
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,180
I like Dobbs, man.

622
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,980
I just made her just five years younger.

623
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,540
I'm a Dobbs whacker.

624
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,380
Yeah.

625
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,440
Pictures of Bob Dobbs in my sex room.

626
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,620
My purple head.

627
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:46,640
I like Bob Dobbs.

628
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:46,640


629
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:46,640


630
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:46,640


631
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:46,640


632
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:46,640


633
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:46,640


634
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,800
And pink pillows covered with pictures of Bob.

635
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,820
Yeah, man.

636
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,440
It's my love, Dan.

637
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,160
And all you young ladies are invited in.

638
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,560
Oh, check it out.

639
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:04,200
Here's a glow-in-the-dark Bob skull, complete with a pipe that gets you high.

640
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,920
Check out some of these fake Bob organs on the wall.

641
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,140
All these were made by Bob.

642
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,960
He defies all the laws of man and God.

643
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,640
There may be an entirely new story.

644
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


645
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


646
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


647
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


648
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


649
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


650
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


651
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


652
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


653
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


654
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


655
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


656
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


657
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


658
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,640


659
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,860
There's a whole new set of laws, Jim, that we know nothing about.

660
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,580
Come out and say what you mean.

661
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,200
I'm only guessing.

662
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,220
Mockery of everything that's decent and wholesome.

663
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:33,260
And I challenge you to point out national talk shows that do not belittle sexual fidelity,

664
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,000
purity.

665
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,320
That they do not belittle the marriage union and the family lifestyle.

666
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,460
That they don't literally flaunt illicit lifestyles.

667
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,620
I mean, I challenge you to show me a talk show that doesn't make a lot of sense.

668
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:46,620


669
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:46,620


670
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,180
I'm glad that we have warning messages on everything now.

671
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,480
So that there's product lia- there is no product liability anymore.

672
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,800
I mean, people can't be- it's a good thing we stamp it on everything now because, you

673
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,540
know, for a while there, lawyers were just getting rich from people that, you know, they

674
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:15,960
walk up, they hit themselves in the head with a hammer because they didn't- couldn't aim

675
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,280
it.

676
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:16,840
Right.

677
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,920
And then they would sue the hammer company and win, you know?

678
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,460
And it's like, so now they put a- they put a label on a hammer that says, do not hit yourself

679
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,840
in the head with this.

680
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,240
And think you can get some money.

681
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:28,700
Yeah.

682
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,940
It all depends who wins the argument.

683
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,320
Oh, it definitely, certainly.

684
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,940
No, people that lose arguments generally don't win.

685
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:38,780
Generally.

686
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,580
So, what happens?

687
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,140
If you find- if you find something offensive on a major label-

688
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,200
Unless, of course, the object was to lose.

689
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,580
If it doesn't have a label.

690
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:47,840
Yeah.

691
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,400
Maybe.

692
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:54,040
Yeah, if it doesn't have like a parental advisory label and you find something offensive on

693
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,240
it, like, and then you let a kid listen to it, can you then sue the major label?

694
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,940
A good lawyer could win the argument.

695
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,660
Probably could.

696
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,880
But, you know, it all depends how good the listener is.

697
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,800
I think if a kid listens to a record that's got the parental warning on it and then he

698
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,020
still goes out and kills, they can sue the parents for not heeding the warning.

699
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,260
I'd sue negatively.

700
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,040
Yeah, that's what I would do.

701
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,920
You can always sue the parents for not being good parents, no matter what.

702
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,320
Yeah.

703
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,020
They're sort of like the last resort.

704
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:30,060
I mean, even if you were suing a major company and they weren't getting what you wanted,

705
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:34,100
you could always sue the president of the company's parents for raising him wrong.

706
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:39,800
And then you could shake them down for a few bucks, you know.

707
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,680
Hey, it's the 20th century.

708
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,000
Whatever you can do to have a good time, let's get on with it.

709
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,000


710
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,000


711
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,000


712
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,000


713
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,000


714
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,920
Let's get on with it so long as it doesn't cause a murder.

715
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,960
There he is, standing there in his fleshy flesh here.

716
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,800
100 percent.

717
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,380
Yeah, hello?

718
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:54,980
Yeah, hello.

719
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,480
Yeah, man, what you got there playing right now?

720
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,380
We're talking.

721
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,820
And we were playing the sexual organ.

722
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,580
We're talking about how dumb Chaz's students are.

723
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,700
And we were making fun of his feces for crying out loud.

724
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,700
The guy still doesn't believe it's a democratic oligarchy we're living in today.

725
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,180
We're not playing any music.

726
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,000
I'll tell you what, man.

727
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,980
That stuff is really bumming me in the butt.

728
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:14,980


729
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:14,980


730
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,400
I'm telling you, man, it's a real bummer.

731
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:15,720
You're bumming me and my fellas out.

732
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,640
Oh, man.

733
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,520
Well, you just made it that...

734
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,620
You want me to play Britney?

735
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,160
You want me to play Britney again?

736
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,200
No, no, man.

737
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,800
I don't want you to play some Britney.

738
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,820
I want some real, man.

739
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,400
You're bumming me and my fellas out.

740
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,160
Oh, you tickled our cockles.

741
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,420
We're shipping home some steel reserves.

742
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,620
That sounds like the river to you.

743
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,020
Here's something for you, just for you, brother.

744
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,080
This song is going out just to you and your brothers.

745
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
All right, up.

746
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,920
Now the time.

747
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,660
Here.

748
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,620
Up, right, up, right, up, right, up.

749
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,820
This is the best song on the planet.

750
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:44,960
This is the best song on the planet.

751
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,180
Sign up today, kids.

752
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,480
If you're sitting on your ass at home right now wondering what the hell you're going to

753
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,500
do tomorrow, hell, there's a recruitment officer sitting downtown waiting to talk to you.

754
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,420
You'll never have to make another choice.

755
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,460
Low pay.

756
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,980
Three meals a day.

757
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,020
Ill-fitting uniforms and crabby hair.

758
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,660
No, they fit the uniform just fine.

759
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,340
You'll be happy.

760
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,460
You'll learn cool songs and get to sing all day long.

761
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:14,940
A couple of days later, you'll be in the gym.

762
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:14,940


763
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:14,940


764
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:14,940


765
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:14,940


766
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:14,940


767
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:14,940


768
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:14,940


769
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:14,940


770
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:14,940


771
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:14,940


772
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,260
You'll be home in a cool body bag.

773
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,240
You'll be all you are.

774
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,120
You are an army of one.

775
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,720
Be all you can be interred as with your head blowed off.

776
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,360
No, you get to blow the other people's heads off.

777
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,100
That's how it works.

778
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,100
This is my church.

779
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,900
There are other churches like it, but this one is mine.

780
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,360
I just want my enforcing.

781
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,740
If I die in combat, no.

782
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,920
Remember, soldier, American forces are impregnable.

783
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,940
I intend to make of you a hero.

784
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:44,940


785
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,600
I intend to make of you a steel pillar, a horse of iron capable of creating enemies

786
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,380
as well as destroying enemies.

787
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,540
The world is your enemy, soldier.

788
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,960
Get that smile off your face and get it in the dirt where it belongs.

789
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,960
Yeah, you'll have fun.

790
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,240
Yeah.

791
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,440
You'll get to meet that guy.

792
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,520
What CD am I playing?

793
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,280
Let me go to the-

794
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,640
Hey, man, who was that guy?

795
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,800
This is the one I like, man.

796
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,060
Hey, Stan, who was that guy, man?

797
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,940
No, Chaz, you're not being sarcastic.

798
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:14,940


799
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:14,940


800
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:14,940


801
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,140
You're not being sarcastic, are you?

802
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:22,020
Because if it weren't for our armed forces, we wouldn't enjoy the freedom to mock our

803
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,360
freedom like we do.

804
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,460
No, no, I'm not being facetious.

805
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,720
I think they should sign off.

806
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,620
Stan, you are not allowed to mock our freedom.

807
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,940
I think 20-year-olds should goddamn sign off.

808
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,440
Well, you were right.

809
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,220
Put in a couple of fucking years and learn what it's like to be in the real world.

810
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:41,940
These kids 20 years old in college have no freaking idea what the real world's anything

811
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,620
about.

812
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,200
Chaz wants to put two X's on Generation X.

813
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,520
He wants to put an X on each eye, if you know what I mean.

814
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,440
Sign up, kids.

815
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,720
You'll get to learn these cool songs.

816
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,400
And that's more employment for us kids because when you come home in a beautiful,

817
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,480
daubed, plastic body bag, that means we get more.

818
00:37:59,660 --> 00:37:59,940
There, there.

819
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,380
I had a girl down in New Orleans.

820
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,280
I had a girl down in New Orleans.

821
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,280
14 youngins and a can of beans.

822
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,200
14 youngins and a can of beans.

823
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,420
Oh, but she was motivated.

824
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:12,600
She was motivated.

825
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:12,600


826
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:12,600


827
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:12,600


828
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:12,600


829
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:12,600


830
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:12,600


831
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,900
She was motivated.

832
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,220
She was dedicated.

833
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,620
She was dedicated.

834
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,100
She was motivated.

835
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,540
She was motivated.

836
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,080
She was dedicated.

837
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,380
She was dedicated.

838
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,420
Lord, I to lay ya.

839
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,900
Lord, I to lay ya.

840
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,040
I love to jab a time.

841
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,540
I love to jab a time.

842
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,360
I listen to the rhythm, listen to the rhythm.

843
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,760
I run wid Marines.

844
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,880
I run wid Marines.

845
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,420
I run wid Marines.

846
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,520
Run wid wid Mo-weans.

847
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,380
Some like to be run wid w leverage with wars, with boats.

848
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,820
Or, what other service is there?

849
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,280
You know…

850
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,820
The Merchant Marine, Chaz.

851
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,820
Merchant Marines, yeah.

852
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,560
Carol Wack was in the Merchant Marine show.

853
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,520
How about there's real good drugs in the Navy, I've heard.

854
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,220
The Coast Guard guys get laid all the time.

855
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,200
Can't I just sign them for a few marine biology courses in college and won't that deal with it?

856
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,460
But you must wear the special uniform, Chaz.

857
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,040
Oh, the marine biologist uniform is very beautiful.

858
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,980
There's a whale on its shoulder.

859
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,540
I was going to major in marine biology.

860
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,980
Isn't that the same as two years in the USMC?

861
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,340
It's the same as two years in Leavenworth, man.

862
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,800
Give up that idea.

863
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,900
That's a false school in Dobbs Town.

864
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,060
I was going to go study iceberg flows.

865
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,320
Better you should study dental flows and mouth flows.

866
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,620
Did you hear about the latest high that's out there?

867
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,220
No.

868
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,580
It turns out that iceberg flows, which is water that's about 15,000 years old from the last ice age,

869
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:36,460
is covered in a coating of bird shit that is equally as old.

870
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,720
And in that time period, when you scrape the bird crap,

871
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,540
off of the iceberg, dry it up.

872
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,860
50,000 year old bird crap.

873
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,460
Dry it up.

874
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,160
You scrape it off.

875
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,180
You drop it on like a mirror or something.

876
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,880
Take a hair dryer and dry it all up.

877
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:49,960
Ecstasy.

878
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,460
Viruses.

879
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:56,400
And then scrape it up with a razor blade and stuff that remnant up in a pipe and smoke it.

880
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,420
50,000 year old bird crap.

881
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,860
American ingenuity.

882
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,720
From icebergs.

883
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,040
Yeah.

884
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,540
Iceberg crap.

885
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,200
Ancient.

886
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,740
Yeah.

887
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:07,520
Our ancestors actually probably dinosaurs' frooms are on there also.

888
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,400
Just think of all the different things we can do with this.

889
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:10,660
Besides.

890
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,320
I'd snort it.

891
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,320
We could probably process it down.

892
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,860
What about modern day?

893
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,760
What's the difference between 50,000 year old bird crap and modern day?

894
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,660
I have no idea.

895
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,720
It may be the compression after, you know, all that time.

896
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,640
Was the air better then?

897
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,500
The birds.

898
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,020
Yeah, maybe.

899
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,240
Actually ate the hemp seeds.

900
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,300
The atmosphere of the Pliocene age was composed of 15% frop smoke.

901
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,980
Well, 15,000 years ago.

902
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,540
Belching from volcanoes.

903
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,760
You know, every couple of thousand years, all the water on earth is recycled, meaning

904
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,880
it's all, you know, urine.

905
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,780
You know, all the water on earth is.

906
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,560
It's been in somebody's bladder before it was in yours.

907
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,620
And that's a condition we're in right now.

908
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,460
At that time period, there was a lot less of that.

909
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,580
Now, here's an idea for you.

910
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,660
Let's pee in the Pliocene area.

911
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,900
You know how some people spend a lot of money on water, really pure water.

912
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,500
Yeah.

913
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,140
They harvest icebergs.

914
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,820
That is something.

915
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:10,340
Think about moon water, Chaz, or asteroid water, or comet water that has never been in a dinosaur

916
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:10,640
bladder.

917
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:15,140
There is water out there that has never been inside a life form.

918
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:22,240
It has been pretty much in pure water form since the beginning of creation.

919
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,800
Is that a high?

920
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,920
2-0 and nothing more.

921
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:32,420
Now, is George W. Bush and H. Ross Crowe sitting at their special country club at the Bohemian

922
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:39,720
Grove sipping on some moon water while you have to drink out of a public fountain?

923
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,240
Oh, no.

924
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,040
That stuff's a little left out there.

925
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,140
Or something like that.

926
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:49,840
A tube station in London somewhere where the worst smelling urine in the universe is coursing

927
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,820
through your veins right now while a rich man smokes his stogie.

928
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,980
What you gonna do about it, boy?

929
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,700
You gonna sit there and take it?

930
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,920
Or are you gonna get up, run to the window, throw an open tank?

931
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,500
I'm married to hell and I'm not gonna...

932
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,700
Hit him, baby, one more time.

933
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,480
Well, I think I'm just gonna have a beer instead.

934
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,420
I guess I will take it.

935
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,100
I guess I will take it one more time.

936
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,040
I'll just go have a beer and calm down.

937
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,560
Bend over and take it one more time.

938
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,000
I'll just take it one more time.

939
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,780
What the hell?

940
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,820
Might as well.

941
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,640
At least I'm not the one being hauled off to that concentration camp.

942
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:26,660
That's right.

943
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,700
It ain't me.

944
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,300
I'm not one of those peoples.

945
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,500
I don't have to worry about it.

946
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,740
They're not gonna come for us stamp collectors.

947
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,500
That's right.

948
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,820
I saw them come for the comic book collectors.

949
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,920
And I didn't do anything because I'm not a comic book collector.

950
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,220
I saw them come for the Trekkies.

951
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,820
And I didn't do anything because I'm not a Trekkie.

952
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,320
Then they came for the science fiction literature readers.

953
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,500
And I started getting worried because actually I'm one of those.

954
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,080
And I had to hide my side fire.

955
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,640
Here's from Cody.

956
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,740
Check this out.

957
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,440
Good afternoon.

958
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:02,600
On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against our staunch friend, Great Britain.

959
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,100
Australia, Germany, and France.

960
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,280
Canada.

961
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,680
More than 40 countries in the Middle East.

962
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,220
Africa, Europe, and across the world.

963
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,820
This military action is a part of our campaign against intelligence.

964
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,020
America can do it.

965
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,160
A new Reich rises from the old.

966
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,460
Like a phoenix from the ashes.

967
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,100
The Reichsland is burned and burned.

968
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,600
We can destroy the world.

969
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,860
Let loose the Kraken.

970
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,580
Let loose the dark.

971
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,000
Let loose the dark.

972
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,200
Onward.

973
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,280
Upward.

974
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,040
In the name of the Lord.

975
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,020
Beefcake.

976
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,720
Season.

977
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:02,680
High five.

978
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,740
Season.

979
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,400
Kiss.

980
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:04,880
Kiss.

981
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,860
Let's kiss, baby.

982
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,160
That's my kiss.

983
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,200
That's my kiss.

984
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:10,760
That's my name.

985
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:15,200
Playing with your genetics is my infamous game.

986
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,060
I'm reaching down deep with my technology.

987
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:24,280
And I'm gonna kill your children like a one, two, three, four.

988
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,600
Well, Connie.

989
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,000
Here's another one you shouldn't do.

990
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,520
That totally kicked my...

991
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,860
I know that over the years, many of you have seen the pictures and news clips of the...

992
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,400
The concrete and mortar.

993
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,520
The guard posts.

994
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,220
And machine gun towers.

995
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,380
The dog runs.

996
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,820
And the barbed wire.

997
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,920
That is American.

998
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,940
We will, we will rock you.

999
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,760
Sign up today, kids.

1000
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,180
Become part of the machine.

1001
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,600
Sign up today so they don't come and get me.

1002
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,680
If they ain't first, you're gonna get us.

1003
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,300
Remember that when you show up.

1004
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,200
The more of you that sign up, the less chance they're gonna get.

1005
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,200
And come looking for me.

1006
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,800
One, two, three.

1007
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:40,500
All the brain.

1008
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,520
Butt motor.

1009
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,360
All the blood.

1010
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,020
The wanderers.

1011
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,300
But of all sarcasm.

1012
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,080
Fashion double.

1013
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:45,600
But.

1014
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,580
Lord, that's butt.

1015
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,640
Get your butt out of my face.

1016
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,720
Yo, butt.

1017
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,720
Bedrock to the city.

1018
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,460
Sit on.

1019
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,000
The buttocks are gone.

1020
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,880
The biggest butt of all.

1021
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,460
Everybody has a butt.

1022
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,980
Everybody has a brain.

1023
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,080
Oh, nobody is a super butt.

1024
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,500
But all butts are super.

1025
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,100
Stick it up.

1026
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:05,780
Stick it up the butt.

1027
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,500
Keep it going.

1028
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,460
Stick another butt until it foams at your mouth.

1029
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,380
Butt mania, I love it, give it to me, I'm a butt.

1030
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,920
Oranges, drip out the butt, poetry uses my mouth, I'm a butt.

1031
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,360
Funny butt, sad butt, I'm a happy butt.

1032
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:32,420
Suck butt, clogged butt, butt plug, butt strangler, butt simulator, butt man, butt woman, butt babies, butt ninnies, butt brains, brain butts.

1033
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,820
How many butts does it take to change an insurance policy?

1034
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,100
How many butts does it take to crack a brain?

1035
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,380
How many butts does it take to get published?

1036
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,280
How many butts does it take to stick it up the biggest butt?

1037
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,220
Who is the biggest butt? Who has the biggest butt of all?

1038
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,540
Is a big butt best, or a tight little butt?

1039
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,220
The littlest butt on Christmas?

1040
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:10,080
Ma told us how the littlest butt, clean butt, stanky butt, sweet butt,

1041
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,120
sour butt, sour-puss dictator.

1042
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,120
Butt, butt, butt, butt, butt, butt, butt.

1043
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,300
You guys don't like a peon to the butt.

1044
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,600
When all the other organs of the body argued and bitched and carried on

1045
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,760
about who was the most vital, the most necessary, the most important of all,

1046
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:31,480
until it was obvious that all the bullshit was gonna back up on them.

1047
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,020
If they didn't pay their homage to the butt, the butt, the butt, the butt, the butt, the butt, the butt, the butt.

1048
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,120
So butt out!

1049
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,540
The butt head!

1050
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,120
May I butt in you butt?

1051
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,540
Butt body!

1052
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,520
Can a busy body be as busy as a butt?

1053
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,480
Are you a butt?

1054
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,200
Do you even have a butt?

1055
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,480
Keep those buttocks!

1056
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,320
Butt, butt, butt, butt, butt, butt, split!

1057
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,820
The Butt Song by Walls of Genius, dear friends.

1058
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,900
Walls of Genius, the genius of little Theodore.

1059
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,780
The third in that song, baby!

1060
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,340
A little baby fist.

1061
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,140
Are you giving ready to be one?

1062
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,140
Or are they coming out anyway?

1063
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,500
That's something that's kind of hard to...

1064
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,480
I think what we've got here is a brand new incantation.

1065
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,320
We've got three heads with us.

1066
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:29,940
Should be two.

1067
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,440
And you are ready to join a special class.

1068
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,200
A very special class of mootantos and erectoids.

1069
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,040
Well, that's it.

1070
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,100
Until next week, keep your head on your toes.

1071
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:40,380
Keep your head on tight.

1072
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,840
You're back to the wind and you're sacking the saddle.

1073
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,840
Well, yeah.

1074
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,320
Chasmodelia!

1075
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,260
Let's go.

1076
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,300
Listen to this.

1077
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,240
Do you know what's going to happen at 8.02 p.m. on my birthday, February 20th?

1078
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,080
I think that the Gronk will come to try to eat your foot.

1079
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:05,680
Time itself, as we know it, will be more symmetrical looking on a digital readout

1080
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,920
than it's ever been since...

1081
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,160
Since...

1082
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,080
10.01...

1083
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:11,640
What's going on?

1084
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,760
August 10th...

1085
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,020
The year...

1086
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:14,200
The year...

1087
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,220
One thousand one.

1088
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,680
One thousand and one.

1089
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,240
Yes.

1090
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,700
That's the last time that time has been this symmetrical.

1091
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:25,240
Because at 8.02 p.m. in military time, it will be 20.02...

1092
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,480
22...

1093
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,220
O-2-2-2-22...

1094
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,920
On the 20th day of the O-2 month...

1095
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:30,980
Wow.

1096
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:31,920
The year 2002.

1097
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:37,880
Now, when we like to talk about synchronistic events in human development...

1098
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,240
We notice some of the less developed humans have a...

1099
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,400
Well, it looks like some sort of cranial draining device there.

1100
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:51,220
And that's sure to keep all of the bad thoughts flowing out instead of back in.

1101
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,720
Now, that's just two tubes.

1102
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:01,620
And we notice one of the mutants dancing here actually has three pork chops hanging from her navel.

1103
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,500
See, Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1104
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,860
Impersonate Britney Spears live on...

1105
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:07,860


1106
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,280
On stage.

1107
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,700
...freaks and freaks.

1108
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,400
And I'm saying...

1109
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,260
We're doing it.

1110
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:11,740
We're doing it.

1111
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,620
Oops, I did it again.

1112
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,120
The groups on the outside...

1113
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:21,280
I'm going to be bringing up videos like, man, all kinds of new subgenius video the likes of which no one has ever seen.

1114
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,680
Dave and I and the whole ESO, we all have our steps down for Baby Baby.

1115
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:25,860
Really?

1116
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:30,600
Oops, you think I'm in love, that I came from above.

1117
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,220
You know, hands up.

1118
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:32,500
Wow.

1119
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,600
Are you going to do the main singing or Dave?

1120
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:34,900
We're not that innocent.

1121
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,100
Yeah, we're going to do it all.

1122
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,780
Who's going to be the main vain?

1123
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,860
I'm sure Dave will be following.

1124
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,000
Chaz is going to put the thing in his navel.

1125
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,780
I'm sure Dave will be following.

1126
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,560
I follow no one but my own leadership.

1127
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,580
Chaz is going to be wearing the thing in his belly button.

1128
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,360
So this is Britney Spears.

1129
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,120
I've never heard of Britney Spears.

1130
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,260
And it's a USO show.

1131
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:52,860
But it's pretty good.

1132
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,860
I can dance to this.

1133
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,420
It's going to be...

1134
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:59,520
Well, she's not bad for a 12-year-old girl with those hirsutism pills and the glandular

1135
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,680
development kind of thing.

1136
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:06,380
Oh, I saw pictures of her in my favorite newspaper, the National Enquirer, without makeup.

1137
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,300
She's just a...

1138
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:07,760
You would think she's a little bit more...

1139
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:07,760


1140
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:07,760


1141
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:07,760


1142
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,820
You wouldn't look twice at her.

1143
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,380
It's showbiz, baby.

1144
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:10,820
No, I know.

1145
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,480
You know, showbiz is a beautiful thing.

1146
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:12,720
I know.

1147
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,520
Without makeup, Britney's like a pig.

1148
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,520
Just plain ordinary...

1149
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:15,960
Well, no.

1150
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,220
She's just a very ordinary-looking young woman.

1151
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:23,120
Nothing especially sexy about her without the makeup.

1152
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,200
I like it sped up more.

1153
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,540
I like it sped up more.

1154
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,800
I like it sped up more.

1155
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,040
I like it sped up more.

1156
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:28,180


1157
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:28,940
You know what you want.

1158
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,000
You're a child spedicist.

1159
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,820
You put it at plus 12.7 here.

1160
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,240
You got to have it.

1161
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,400
Do you know something?

1162
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,160
Beep, beep, beep.

1163
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,760
So this wife, by having the exact same thing, is going to be a little bit more...

1164
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,980
I can accept that our geographical distances have left me sometimes feeling isolated to

1165
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,040
a greater degree than I choose.

1166
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,840
I can also say that I'm damn pleased to be tangentially involved with a group that has

1167
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,000
never really let me down.

1168
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,580
And boy, is that a rare, prescient thing.

1169
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,400
It's been like a 55-gallon drum of astroglide in a reality otherwise often devoted to carefully

1170
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,040
pouring grit into my rubbers.

1171
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:56,960
Amen...

1172
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,820
Now, can you say any of that good stuff about any job you've held, or even your own damn

1173
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,640
family after a 19-year span, like my own intermittent affiliation with the mob world?

1174
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:05,900
Bet you can.

1175
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,200
Yes.

1176
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:07,740
Yes, you might.

1177
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:20,880
I'd love to have flying saucers come down here and brush me to kill off the multiple weasels, smirklers, yuppies, drunks, food tubes, glorifices, and other upright crap sacks that paint them crapping on this otherwise random nice planet as they haul my popish ass off to some nirvana.

1178
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:28,100
But in the new of that kind of thing, even though I can always use some more of them kind of pills, I figure I'm getting a pretty damn good deal.

1179
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,880
My love goes with Capri's Bob.

1180
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:30,500
Hooray!

1181
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,980
Ladies and gentlemen, help up Huey!

1182
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:50,540
When they write their first check to the Subgenius Foundation, that's when their luck begins to change, their finances improve, and that kind of thing.

1183
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,300
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere.

1184
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,260
Where are you leading us, Bob?

1185
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,300
Is he?

1186
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,820
And where is Bob leading them?

1187
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,780
Right now it acts like it's going to make me rich.

1188
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:07,740
I don't know.

1189
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:07,740


1190
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,560
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere.

1191
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,620
Kelly Lane, Channel 4 News, Dallas.

1192
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,120
As the song says, different strokes for different folks.

1193
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,800
Deb's been standing out in the sun too long, I think.

1194
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,300
Throughout his long, 50-week-long career,

1195
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:36,020
Lord Greystump performed many operations and experiments on the children he was given through the shoots shown here and here.

1196
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,520
These are now...

1197
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,320
are now national monuments, to those who have gone before and came after.

1198
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,580
As we look Skyward, the planes are flying.

1199
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,680
Almost in such close formation there is no sky left!

1200
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,200
The world is truly a barbed wire paradise.

1201
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,960
For you and I are one with The Machine!

1202
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,320
가 폴� tanta Chunatti

1203
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,440

1206

immortality

1207
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,800
Chaz, what's the historical significance of that music you were just playing?

1208
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,480
It's Nazi-era marching music.

1209
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,220
It had that kind of ring to it.

1210
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,720
Maybe we want to have a beer and just go hang out with the guys, most of them.

1211
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,520
Of most of them.

1212
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,800
Late in our searches.

1213
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,960
Putting our spurs on.

1214
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,020
We've got to be riding off.

1215
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:28,500
Yeah.

1216
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,120
Turn them on the inside out.

1217
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,800
I noticed you changed the sign-off music, Chaz.

1218
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,960
Well, because things are not good, I guess.

1219
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,020
The wounded are coming in finally, Stan.

1220
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:40,860
Didn't you know?

1221
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,680
Life, death, it doesn't, to me or not to me, what the hell's the difference?

1222
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,200
Why ask me, man?

1223
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,980
Why ask, why ask, why ask, why ask, why?

1224
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,900
Well, Stan, the stumpers are coming in, man.

1225
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,240
The losing card all Sunday late.

1226
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,720
The body bags are landing in Virginia, man.

1227
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,700
By themselves now, we've got the new ones.

1228
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,740
They fly on their own power.

1229
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,600
You just put the postmark on there and the address and they're back.

1230
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,820
In your own hometown graveyard.

1231
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:08,040
How do you think they get the 50,000-year-old guano smuggled in and the moon water, man?

1232
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:08,620
Yep.

1233
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,000
Comes in on the body bags.

1234
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,120
The company's always on the job.

1235
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,400
Yep.

1236
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,320
Well, I hope, I don't hope anything.

1237
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,920
Yeah, we're hopeless, man.

1238
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:25,740
Well, I thought you said you hope they all sign up and join the military and ship out

1239
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,620
so we can get the good-paying web jobs.

1240
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,500
That's like having sex with three women at a time, though.

1241
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:32,720
Yeah, right.

1242
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:32,780
You know what I mean?

1243
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:32,780


1244
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:32,780


1245
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:32,780


1246
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:32,780


1247
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:32,780


1248
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:32,780


1249
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,480
A lot of those kids.

1250
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,180
It's just a fantasy, you know?

1251
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:35,740
We know they'll want to go away.

1252
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:36,200
And their girlfriends.

1253
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:37,720
Yeah.

1254
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,620
I mean, there's practical parts of this, too.

1255
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,220
Yeah, right.

1256
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:45,720
There's going to be a lot of young ladies left behind when those boys all sign up and

1257
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,780
go off to fight the evil.

1258
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,600
The evil, what is it?

1259
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,160
The triad of evil?

1260
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,420
Those who would charge too much for gas.

1261
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,320
The new axis of evil, yeah.

1262
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,860
Axis of evil-dorse.

1263
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,400
Whose dorse are always in a kill class.

1264
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:01,660
There you go.

1265
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,820
Is it to be or not to be?

1266
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,340
And I reply, why the fuck was me, man?

1267
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,440
Get out of my face.

1268
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:17,680
And it's time for all of our faces to go back to whence it came from.

1269
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,820
That's right, the dump behind Grandma's house.

1270
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,240
The place we all sprang out of.

1271
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,840
Let's spring all the way back.

1272
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:27,420
Back.

1273
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,560
Yeah.

1274
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,960
Yeah.

1275
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,240
You can do the same thing if you please.

1276
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,220
Until next week, keep your hat on tight.

1277
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,440
You're back to the wind.

1278
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,160
And you're sacking the saddle.

1279
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,040
March 15th.

1280
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,060
Go on and get it over with then.

1281
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,520
Devival, March 15th.

1282
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,260
Peachland Ballroom.

1283
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,500
And don't forget to use...

1284
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,840
We'll go on and get it over with then.

1285
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,220
Sign up.

1286
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,480
Oh, yes.

1287
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,320
And, uh...

1288
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,840
You can also write for free information.

1289
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,680
From the Church of the Subgenius.

1290
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,240
About anything you've heard tonight.

1291
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,480
Actually, the easiest thing to do is simply email yours truly,

1292
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:15,940
Reverend Ivan Stang at stang at subgenius.com.

1293
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:23,080
And it's so calm at www.subgenius.com.

1294
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:29,700
It's also calm at our sacred post office box in Dallas once you can get free information.

1295
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:30,780
Rent it wise.

1296
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,900
And that box number, of course, is...

1297
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,720
That post office box.

1298
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,840
1-4-0-3-0-6.

1299
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,520
Dallas, Texas.

1300
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:48,100
7-5-2-1-4.

1301
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:56,800
Again, that Cleveland address to send me tapes and CDs for this syndicated show would be...

1302
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,520
Reverend Stang or Hour of Slack.

1303
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,720
Just Stang.

1304
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,000
Box 181417.

1305
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,580
Cleveland Heights.

1306
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,300
Ohio.

1307
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,560
44118.

1308
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,900
And now this.

1309
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:22,660
Give me the box.

1310
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,660
Give me the box.

1311
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,700
Give me the box.

1312
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,640
Give me the box.

1313
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,060
Proud Warriors.

1314
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,600
Proud Warriors.

1315
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:29,500
Proud Warriors.

1316
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:29,500


1317
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,040
Proud Warriors.

1318
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:37,700
One look at them will tell you more than a thousand words of mine.
