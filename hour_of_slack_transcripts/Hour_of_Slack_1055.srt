1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,540
Can you feel the slack emanating?

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,000
Vibrating?

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,600
Can you feel the slack emanating?

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,900
You're relaxing now.

5
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,820
Who knows what evil lurks in the...

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,940
The genius, powerful, swanky!

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,640
Dobbs, can I speak to Dobbs directly through this radio show, for once?

8
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,660
He's listening.

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,180
How could I stop you?

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,820
Okay, all right, look, Bob...

11
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,960
And then suddenly...

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,580
You said it a long time ago.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,020
You said that it was going to take a whole lot longer.

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,640
Bob happens.

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,040
Longer and stronger.

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,660
Yeah, Bob happens all over, busting out all over like June.

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,260
Only in July.

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,660
Only...

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,320
It's the end of June and everything else.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,500
The end of the world.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,700
And it was incredible when the giant gleaming, glittering saucers

22
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:22,880
came out of the sky.

23
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,520
Came down to whisk Ivan's dang and his rag-tag band of followers

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,300
off to a planet of pulsating pleasures.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,240
Yeah, we left, and now we're gone.

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,280
Once blind, but now we see.

27
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,520
Off into the sky.

28
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,540
Yep, X-Day happened, folks.

29
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,660
The world's over, and you're not listening to anything.

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
And you missed it.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,280
We're not here.

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,320
We're already up there having...

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,300
Having the illicit sexual practices with...

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,580
You can call 849.

35
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:52,880
See you.

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,760
...space aliens.

37
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,500
You can call as the Yakatisma will yak to you.

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,820
And, um, you know, we actually pre-recorded this show

39
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,780
knowing that we would be gone from this terraqueous globe,

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,440
this ball of dung, planet mudball.

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,540
Hey, quit stepping on my ball.

42
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,680
I'm talking about this run-down sack of sheep shite,

43
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,400
which we call Earth.

44
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,380
Hey, don't...

45
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,900
Don't look at my face when you say sheep shite like that.

46
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,220
All right, I...

47
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,780
I was...

48
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:22,980
I was...

49
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:22,980


50
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,560
Perhaps, uh, a little bit harsh on the old place.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,700
After all, born and raised here myself under one terrestrial gravity,

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,300
uh, right in the temperate zone of this dear little planet.

53
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,020
And I must say, uh, it's an honor.

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,920
But, uh, there is a time when one has to move out of the backyard,

55
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,780
leave one's tiny, backward, introverted, and inbred peasant village,

56
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,820
and go to the big city, the big yard,

57
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,400
where all sorts of...

58
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,280
wonderful things happen.

59
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,000
They start churning up the, uh, succotash, the goulash, and the molasses.

60
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,440
I went down to Brushwood on X Day

61
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,040
Dreamin' about that saucer day

62
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,380
And he who has the holy luck

63
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,280
Good Bob, show me the way

64
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,860
Oh, Bobbies, let's go to the big yard,

65
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:22,860


66
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:22,860


67
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,280
and slow down

68
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,040
Hello.

69
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,220
Well, this is a group of twelve people from, uh, Russia

70
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,740
who want to visit the festival, X Day Festival, tomorrow.

71
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,420
Uh, we will try to call you back, uh, early again,

72
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,560
and find out how we can manage with it.

73
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,320
Thank you.

74
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,380
You are at peace with the world.

75
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,000
You are at peace with yourself.

76
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,940
Can you feel the slack emanating?

77
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,160
Can you feel the slack vibrating?

78
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,220
You have no worries.

79
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,560
You have no pain.

80
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,720
You are at peace with yourself.

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,500
You are at peace with yourself.

82
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,420
You are at peace with yourself.

83
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,140
You are at peace with yourself.

84
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,780
It's biofeedback.

85
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,300
Slack biofeedback.

86
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:47,920
Relax.

87
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,960
Breathe deep.

88
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,340
Speak up, Dave.

89
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,180
Everything's all right.

90
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,380
Folks, this is the live hour of Slack here at X Day...

91
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,000
Which one is this?

92
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,480
Number nine.

93
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,020
Number nine.

94
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,780
Number nine.

95
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,560
Nine X Day.

96
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,500
Number nine.

97
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,340
Three times three.

98
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,100
It is the number.

99
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,320
The number is nine.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,560
Nine.

101
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,380
Nighan.

102
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,280
Nighan.

103
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,520
Vise ya to X Day nine.

104
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,780
Now, this...

105
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,720
The recorder's machines can't hear you.

106
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,680
I just dreamed...

107
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,480
Speak into the rectifier.

108
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,120
...the bottom of the swimming pool.

109
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,120


110
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,120


111
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,160
...the bottom of the swimming pool.

112
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,400
Speak into the rectifier.

113
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,800
Speak into the rectifier.

114
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:22,800


115
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,500
The little barbed pool noodles surrounding my body like the squid.

116
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,760
I was fattened.

117
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,200
And I couldn't...

118
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
No longer move.

119
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,620
I could feel they were starting to become part of my body.

120
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,400
My body was absorbing the barb-pool noodles.

121
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,640
And I was fatter, and soggy, and I couldn't get out.

122
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,820
But then you surely must have realized...

123
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,380
...every time you've been sick, your body's getting weaker and weaker.

124
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,380


125
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,380


126
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,380


127
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,380


128
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,380


129
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,380


130
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,380


131
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,380


132
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,380


133
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,380


134
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,380


135
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,740
Everything was all right.

136
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,660
If you would only give in and allow yourself to be sucked down into the abyss of Bob.

137
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,860
Step into the vacuum.

138
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,960
Fall into the abyss.

139
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,920
Fathom after fathom into the inky darkness.

140
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,920
Now, if I could just get my right arm splashed and dried here just correctly.

141
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,760
I can fly.

142
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,920
I can fly.

143
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,900
This pipe.

144
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,600
I can fly with this pipe.

145
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,280
In terror and woe, he flung his right arm to the left.

146
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,160
His left arm to the right.

147
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,980
And his feet stamped the nether abyss in trembling and howling in dismay.

148
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,060
And cry.

149
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,240
What have I lost?

150
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,220
What have I gained?

151
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,840
And when are we going to get something to eat?

152
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,360
I think the sandwiches are on their way.

153
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,140
Here comes the sandwich boy now.

154
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,680
The sandwich encompasses the entire earth.

155
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,540
The wasteful desert.

156
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,980
It's not a sandwich.

157
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,960
It's a gun.

158
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,980
Some kind of weapon.

159
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,760
Guns or sandwiches.

160
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,580
Which shall it be?

161
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,560
Hello, you're on the air.

162
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,140
Oh, hi, Dr. Sinister.

163
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,860
Welcome, Reverend Stang.

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,720
How are you?

165
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,160
Let me turn down my time-controlled machine there in the background.

166
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,960
Now you're experiencing everything six seconds in the future.

167
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,140
Uh, yeah.

168
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,580
Yeah, it's easier here in the future.

169
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,320
Yeah.

170
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,140
Everything hurts, though.

171
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,260
I'm recuperating from X-Day, which was very physically strained.

172
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:21,500
It's been continuous.

173
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,880
Just from having to put up the displays and everything on the stage there and take it

174
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:25,980
down?

175
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,520
Yeah, I had to pack everything and then unpack it all and then pack it all up and

176
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,820
then unpack it and so forth.

177
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,660
I was expecting to get a new body.

178
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,860
And so I kind of misused the one I had.

179
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,360
Well, they're sending us refurbished bodies, obviously.

180
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,680
Well, the one I'm using is getting refurbished right now, I think.

181
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,400
It's in the shop?

182
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,060
Sort of.

183
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,060
Slowly but surely.

184
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,500
Oh, me?

185
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,840
Oh, my.

186
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,880
Who the hell is in this club?

187
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,140
I never felt this way.

188
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,280
I think I like to stay.

189
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,340
It's given me excitement.

190
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,700
It's given me damn right.

191
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,340
It's given me so much more.

192
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,220
It's a slack orgasm.

193
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,580
It's a slack orgasm.

194
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,680
Yes, it's a slack orgasm.

195
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,480
It's a slack orgasm.

196
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:34,400
It's a slack orgasm.

197
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,260
What?

198
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,540
Not that.

199
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,520
I can't believe you thought of that.

200
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,240
It feels so fascinating.

201
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,400
Oh, wow.

202
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,040
Oh.

203
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,480
Woo!

204
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,480
It's very titillating.

205
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,200
It's a slack orgasm.

206
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,960
Oh! It's a slack orgasm!

207
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:11,900
Oh!

208
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,280
It's a slack orgasm!

209
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,020
Oh my god!

210
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,960
It's a slack orgasm!

211
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,760
Faster.

212
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,540
Harder.

213
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,880
Give me more!

214
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,420
Master.

215
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,380
It's a slack orgasm!

216
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,860
It's a slack orgasm!

217
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,860
Oh my god!

218
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,100
NONE YET!

219
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,780
NO DON'T STOP!

220
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,500
OH IT'S A SLACK OR NASTER!

221
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,520
Oh yay!

222
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,960
Oh yay!

223
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,220


224
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,840
Dear friends that was Princess Pisces singing at the 9X Day Drill

225
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,520
Improvising the words which she did for like two hours on Sunday night

226
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,300
With Reverend Carter LeBlanc on bass

227
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,220
Reverend Phil on drums

228
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,380
Reverend 2Beams on synthesizer

229
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,740
And Reverend Angry Larry on the guitar

230
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,800
And the amino acids are heard in the background

231
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,400
There's lots more where all of that came from

232
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,440
...of a great and powerful civilization

233
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,880
Yeah

234
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,140
Let us prepare for our world-est

235
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,720
Cool

236
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,120
Friends we're also going to be hearing some amazing talk and music from Dr. Howell

237
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,660
This is Hour of Slack number 1055

238
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,820
The first of at least four shows scavenging the holy recordings from the World Subgenius Festival

239
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,580
Plus

240
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,080
Other radio shows

241
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,580
Such as

242
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,420
A Dr. Sinister's Radio Synesthesia on WCSB in Cleveland

243
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,500
And also

244
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,640
A puzzling evidence from KPFA in Berkeley with Dr. Philodrummon and Dr. Howell

245
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,600
To which we can now return if you are man enough

246
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,260
I'm man enough for both of us

247
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,080
And now she's going straight up into the UFO

248
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,700
But I'm woman enough for all

249
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,060
It is like Independence Day

250
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,880
It's all cream and porcelain

251
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,460
There go all the little sub gum beans

252
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,820
There they go

253
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,780
Into the little hole in the bottom of the UFO

254
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,400
Streaming like particles into the solar wind

255
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,540
Ah yes carrying their little pencils and pens where they take notes in heaven

256
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,260
Is that what those are?

257
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,240
Ringing like wind chimes as they disappear through apertures into the black ether

258
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,120
Look they tickle her as they go by

259
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,320
And he prophesieth not

260
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,520
Yeah it feels kind of nice doesn't it?

261
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,660
For on the fields of Moab did Paul speak of unbelief

262
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,480
Oh no

263
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,760
Unbelief

264
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,920
That means he had it and then he undid it

265
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,080
He was a tax collector

266
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,520
And yea though I say unto ye the spirits of Moab leaketh not unto thine face

267
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Ew

268
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,100
You know tax collector

269
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,500
Sounds like him

270
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,900
A tax collector invented the Doberman Tenture

271
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,580
Oh yeah

272
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,500
Yeah to help collect taxes

273
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,560
Giveth no place to the devil

274
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,140
Oh oh

275
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,640
Put not by the devil

276
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,180
I have seen my fingers under the armpits of another one

277
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,280
Say thanks my friend

278
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,280
I lift a maggot from his cloven hook

279
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:03,340
I have seen my uncles and aunts put their fingers under the armpits of another person and lift

280
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,800
By levitation of the Holy Spirit

281
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,860
Here we go folks I was trying to keep it on end state

282
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,900
The end of the world happened

283
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,960
And these are the semi-demigods of the church right here

284
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,460
Witnesses to the end of the world

285
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,640
They were actually there

286
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,320
My dear Jesus Christ

287
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:24,800
Yes, X-Day continues. The spectacle, the human triumph of X-Day.

288
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:37,160
They started as humble primates, simple humans. It's turned way too high up, I think.

289
00:15:38,420 --> 00:16:01,440
And then, in the fullness of time, over millions of years of evolution, these shambling pre-humans acquired a better posture and less shuffling gait and more responsibility and a job and a place in the corporate state.

290
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:07,140
No more shambling through the veldt, chasing the exhausted world.

291
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:20,460
Or vice versa for Homus Novo, the new man, salary man, on his way to his job at Beetlebrow Industries.

292
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:29,540
But the workaday world must go on, whether of capitalism or communism or any system.

293
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:37,140
But it's lucky for us, for you and everyone, that we, members of the Church of the Subcontinent,

294
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:47,060
are able to pervert that productive impulse into performing these services, obsequies and ceremonies.

295
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,820
That's X-Day, folks.

296
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,560
All I can say is, well, there'll be another one next year.

297
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,800
Yet another X-Day.

298
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,260
The next.

299
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,840
And the end of the world happens again and again and again.

300
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,420
Well, until we get it right, dadgummit.

301
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,140
Well, or, yeah.

302
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,140


303
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,140


304
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,100
And I wrote a song about it.

305
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,760
Was that a pigeon?

306
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,720
Uh, no, it was a, uh...

307
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,480
Did I just hear a pigeon?

308
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,540
I actually did perform it with two members of the amino acids, uh, on stage.

309
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,400
Seriously, am I hallucinating?

310
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,000
And Princess Wee harmonizing, harmonization, harmoni...

311
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,700
Princess Wee was singing along on the chorus.

312
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,180
Could be a morning dove, maybe.

313
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:35,780
The subgenius hymn, for in the midst of life, the subgenius gene will suddenly activate.

314
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,820
Destroying red blood cells with an embarrassing noise.

315
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,680
Friends!

316
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,920
Intellectual stimulation has not ended.

317
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,340
The amino acids is not the last band standing.

318
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,360
Oh my fucking God!

319
00:17:51,460 --> 00:18:00,980
On the way here, uh, Dr. Howland Owl, our esteemed guest, the toast of San Francisco.

320
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,920
He was delayed on a plane for, uh, 48 hours.

321
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,120
He'd have to circle around the world.

322
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,160
He's from Philadelphia, and he spent that time writing a song, which is 48 hours long.

323
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:21,360
However, uh, he and Princess Wee are going to perform an excerpt from this song, an ex-day song.

324
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,780
I have not heard it. I don't know anything about it.

325
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,400
And most importantly, I am not responsible.

326
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,260
Dr. Howl and Princess Wee, praise Bob Hilkamp.

327
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,660
Woo!

328
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,880
I have to get my lyrics.

329
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,660
Thank you!

330
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,100
Hello, friends.

331
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:47,140
You know, I did have a terrible amount of trouble getting here,

332
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,700
because I was opposed by the demons of the air, the powers of darkness.

333
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,540
And yet, uh, for all their formidable power, here I stand.

334
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,500
I managed to make it among you.

335
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,860
And so, as a final expression of triumph

336
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:13,520
over these inchoate, uh, entities of, uh, evil and chaos,

337
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:20,200
uh, Princess Wee is going to assist me in, uh, singing this ex-day song, which I wrote.

338
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
You may consider this, uh, an irritating imposition,

339
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:29,660
or you may consider it a moment of subgenius history in the making or on the hoof.

340
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,540
The choice is yours.

341
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,540
Yay!

342
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,760
Ex-day is here.

343
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,560
The mountains fall.

344
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,980
I cringe and hide my head.

345
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,080
I never send in my thirty bucks.

346
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,060
My soul is filled with dread.

347
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, Bob, just let me live.

348
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,460
And all that is mine.

349
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,140
I most surely will give.

350
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, lift me away on your bright saucer ship

351
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,740
to my subgenius home.

352
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,920
Oh, bear me away on your bright shining ship

353
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,740
to my subgenius home.

354
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,480
I laughed at Bob.

355
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,780
Ah, woe is me.

356
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,240
I thirst for slack.

357
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,780
I'm back in vain.

358
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,580
Now he still grins and smokes his pipe.

359
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,020
I must have been insane.

360
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,380
Oh, Bob, just let me live.

361
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,860
And all that is mine.

362
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,340
I most surely will give.

363
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,000
Oh, lift me away on your bright saucer ship

364
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,900
to my subgenius home.

365
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,740
Oh, bear me away on your bright shining ship

366
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,600
to my subgenius home.

367
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,560
I saw the pigs and normals flee.

368
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,500
The dreadful harvest from the sky.

369
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,040
They perish by the melting snow.

370
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,840
Yet not a one knows why.

371
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,840
Oh, Bob, just let me live.

372
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,260
And all that is mine.

373
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,540
I most surely will give.

374
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,380
Oh, lift me away on your bright saucer ship

375
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,160
to my subgenius home.

376
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,100
Oh, bear me away on your bright shining ship

377
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,840
to my subgenius home.

378
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,720
The towers of the proud did fall.

379
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,560
There was no shelter from that storm.

380
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,160
While far above the subgeniuses watched

381
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,660
in comfort, safe and warm.

382
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,600
Oh, Bob, just let me live.

383
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,860
And all that is mine.

384
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,140
I most surely will give.

385
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,580
Oh, lift me away on your bright saucer ship

386
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,440
to my subgenius home.

387
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:46,460
Oh, bear me away on your bright shining ship

388
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,600
to my subgenius home.

389
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,260
base

390
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,380
to James

391
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,020
Allィ

392
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,480
Wilson

393

00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:10,580
Bo

402
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,040
and

403
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,880
Wednesday

404
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


405
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,880


406
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,560
Bo

407
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:17,880
du

408
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:25,760
You know, there's a thin, thin line between subgenius and complete idiot fuckhead, and

409
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,600
sometimes I cross that line.

410
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:35,300
In fact, what frightens me the most is how frequently I find myself doing something so

411
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:42,840
stupid, I can barely believe it or forgive myself, and yet I do, because I'm then always

412
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,840
reminded, the next guy's probably even worse.

413
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,540
That is the horror of today's modern world.

414
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:56,640
As dumb as the subgenius is, his neighbor is even dumber.

415
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,780
And right now we're listening to a baby bellowing on a bullhorn, folks.

416
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:09,820
Just one of the many ambient sounds you can hear at Camp Nake of the Woods, hideaway.

417
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,260
Oh, here's a little...

418
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,820
I came up with a dumb...

419
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,940
dumbness rant, speaking of dumbness, my own dumbness and that of others.

420
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,880
Nikki had reported that she had almost gotten killed by a...

421
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,160
and yet was saved by dumbassery.

422
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,740
A dumbass almost killed her, but the reason...

423
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,240
in a truck.

424
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,160
But the reason she wasn't killed by the truck is because she'd been held up in the ATM line

425
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,120
by another dumbass.

426
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,020
Held up, you say, in the ATM line?

427
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,740
Well, so to speak.

428
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,220
And I was prompted to say...

429
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,800
that I was really glad she wasn't killed, because then we'd have to cancel X-Day and so forth.

430
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:55,460
And speaking of helpless, mewling crybabies, that that's what I'd be without her and...

431
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,840
Reverend artist formerly known as Magdalene to do the stuff that they do, because I don't even know what it is.

432
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,780
But the... but the point was, I do not envy you lovely younger people.

433
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:13,440
You're 20 years or more younger than I am, so you'll probably live 20 years further into the future.

434
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,820
And that just means you'll see 20 years...

435
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,860
worth more of the devolution.

436
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,260
Everybody is getting dumber.

437
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,160
The dumbest reproduce fastest, and because of that, death becomes a blessing for the old.

438
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,280
And for everybody else, since people often get dumber as they grow old.

439
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,360
You can't imagine how painful it is to watch people getting dumber and dumber.

440
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,000
Some of them dumber even than me.

441
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,500
And knowing that it's only gonna get worse and worse.

442
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,660
Only a truly species-threatening crisis like X-Day...

443
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,840
or a massive asteroid strike or war or disease...

444
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,460
could cause human intelligence to start evolving upwards again.

445
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,540
Oh sure, somebody may come up with an intelligence drug...

446
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,860
that lets nerds remember pointless facts and figures better.

447
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,840
But that's not quite the same as 10,000 years of hard knocks...

448
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,780
and furtive illicit fucks behind bushes when the silverback isn't looking.

449
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,500
You're probably gonna have to watch humans get 20 years dumber than I will.

450
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,440
Unless you do get hit by a truck or something.

451
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,060
And you probably can't dumb yourself down to whatever is the current lowest common denominator...

452
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,740
in order to accept it all better.

453
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,500
I tried for years, but I found I just could not keep up with the Joneses, so to speak.

454
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Self-dummification-wise.

455
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,440
I had to give up.

456
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:37,240
I couldn't wipe out brain cells fast enough to keep pace with the younger people or the older people.

457
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,600
Most of them don't even need drugs to become dumber.

458
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,760
It happens for those lucky stiffs automatically.

459
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,020
So said Reverend Ivan Stang that one day.

460
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,700
Amen.

461
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,600
That is my rant.

462
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,180
Yes, Reverend Ivan Stang.

463
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,060
That is my testimony.

464
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,480
And so there.

465
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,020
And a goodly rant it was.

466
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,540
Listen to that massive applause here in Carnegie Hall.

467
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,780
This well of applause attests the sincerity of the belief of the audience...

468
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,140
in all the principles you have espoused here today.

469
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,460
Here on Tarzan's radio station.

470
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,640
Which, by the way, sounds so much better in these headphones...

471
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,460
than it does through my son's hand-me-down speakers.

472
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,740
And anyone who ever wanted to donate speakers to the Subgenius Foundation...

473
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,400
we're begging.

474
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,640
Help us articulate our message.

475
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,540
There was a lot encoded in that noise I just made.

476
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,060
If you can have the decompression codec...

477
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,140
Yes, you need good stereo equipment to decrypt it.

478
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,260
And that we are unable, ethically and legally, to provide.

479
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,040
You have to supply this high-tech equipment yourself.

480
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,460
Or make your ears a lot better.

481
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,520
But we can't make you smarter, as Nenslow said.

482
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,520
So shut up, as Nenslow said.

483
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,180
You can lead a horse to water.

484
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,220
But you can't make him drink.

485
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,280
You know, that's another one of those old wise-sounding sayings...

486
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,100
that probably isn't true and makes no sense.

487
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,420
Oh yeah, you think you can make him drink?

488
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,880
You think you can make that horse drink?

489
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,020
It depends on the horse. It depends on the master.

490
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,780
Bob could make that horse drink, you know.

491
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,280
Bob could make him drink.

492
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,320
But the horse, if it drinks, then it was its idea.

493
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,900
Not necessarily yours.

494
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,480
I see you're missing some keys on your pad here.

495
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,820
But bravely we soldier on.

496
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,740
Though we may be sleep-deprived.

497
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,080
Brain buzzed and a few bats shy of a belfry.

498
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:55,520
We're still able to handle the tremendous, titanic, organizational mass of duties, devotions, and events at X-Day.

499
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,260
Like hiding from the rain and lightning.

500
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:29,120
And we never get to see a song.

501
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,120


502
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,140
I'm sure you've heard of it.

503
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,300
It's called a dance.

504
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:29,700


505
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:29,700


506
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:29,700


507
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:29,700


508
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:29,700


509
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:29,840
Dance!

510
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,840


511
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,840


512
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,840


513
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,840


514
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,840


515
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,840


516
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,840


517
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,840


518
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,840


519
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,840


520
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,840


521
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,840


522
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:29,860
Dance!

523
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:29,860


524
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:29,860


525
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:29,860


526
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,400
It's a slack disco

527
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,800
Slack go-go

528
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,960
Start bouncing!

529
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,040
My brain is empty!

530
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,280
I can't see clearly!

531
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,480
It seems something's happened to me?

532
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,020
Things are strange.

533
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,740
They're not quite the same.

534
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,520
Something's emanating.

535
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,260
My breathing.

536
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,660
It's flowing through me.

537
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,540
It's kinda groovy.

538
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,780
It's getting stronger.

539
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,620
I can't take it any longer!

540
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,880
You couldn't do it if you hadn't played.

541
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,300
Shake it!

542
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,400
I'm gonna feed myself!

543
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,780
No I can't!

544
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,660
Was too much!

545
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,640
No, you were too much!

546
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,440
Do something!

547
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:39,820


548
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:39,820


549
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,180
You give me a break.

550
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,180


551
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,300
and by drugs I mean

552
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,800
hugging

553
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,700
and coffee

554
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,480
and beer

555
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,920
there was beer

556
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,960
and even hugging

557
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,480
if that's what you said

558
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,300
did you say hugging?

559
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,540
let's all cuddle

560
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,880
not exactly

561
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,960
come on you know you'd be into it

562
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,720
is there a big bowl full of cornstarch

563
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,380
and orange pulp

564
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,000
there was some sort of thing that I missed

565
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,280
involving naked women sliding

566
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,380
downhill on a plastic slide

567
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,240
slip and slide?

568
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
yes that's it exactly

569
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,060
oh yay

570
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,940
once again

571
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,220
Ragnar's girlfriend was a participant

572
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,020
and she claimed about

573
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,040
the bruising she received

574
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,080
also the bruising she received

575
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,220
at the naked uluhuk contest

576
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,940
which did indeed

577
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,040
produce bruises on her waist

578
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,020
which everyone was looking at

579
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,620
is she anemic?

580
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,940
not at all

581
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,540
more full blooded I should say

582
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,320
so

583
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:10,980
then

584
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,320
we had the body painting contest

585
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,560
you got that girl because of Bob

586
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,620
and we covered each other's bodies

587
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,700
with beloved subgenius icons

588
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,020
meanwhile Susie the floozy was leaving

589
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,840
tiny tattooed turrets of angels

590
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,300
around the campsite

591
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,500
and she also made special new insignia

592
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,200
for the subgeniuses

593
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,720
of an eyeball supported by wings

594
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,240
sort of like a fascist

595
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,540
Nazi eyeball subgenius thing

596
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,460
that we wore on our clothes

597
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,440
and our equipment

598
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,240
and some of us made new friendships

599
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,940
over and over again

600
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:56,980
yes

601
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,080
and now

602
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,380
now what about swingers?

603
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,960
is there a subgenius swinger community out there?

604
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,800
are you kidding?

605
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,460
there's yeah I mean there's a

606
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,100
I'm actually not part of it

607
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,660
because I'm an old square and I'm so

608
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:11,780
I'm an old square and I'm so

609
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,600
happy to be so happily married now

610
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,120
I don't want to shake it up

611
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,180
but there's a

612
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,180
I almost think that the square types

613
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,180
are outnumbered by the swingers

614
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,820
there's quite a bit of that going on out there

615
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,680
during X day and also

616
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,880
Starwood of course features

617
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,920
a lot of members of the church of all worlds

618
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,420
which is an overtly swinging and swapping cult

619
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,760
which is an overtly swinging and swapping cult

620
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,420
kind of fat old gray haired hippies

621
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:43,680
kind of fat old gray haired hippies

622
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:43,680


623
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,520
but hey if you're a fat old gray-haired hippie

624
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,980
that's hot action

625
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,220
yeah I think that's the problem

626
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,540
that a lot of the younger Bobby's

627
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,260
you know had is that you know those who

628
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,880
those who are available tend to be

629
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,520
a bit older

630
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,980
and not that there's anything wrong with getting old

631
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,780
it's just that

632
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,840
oh I don't know from what I hear

633
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,120
the kids nowadays are all practically

634
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,940
practically doing

635
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,740
in elementary school the kinds of things you know

636
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:11,740


637
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,940
that I was just starting to learn about in college.

638
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,560
Well, keep in mind...

639
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,120
Of course, that was in the previous century.

640
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,760
Well, keep in mind they're arresting the teachers

641
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,720
responsible for that as fast as they can,

642
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,360
you know, and the priests as well, you know.

643
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,320
And plus, bragging ultimately isn't the bragging

644
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,300
more important than the sex itself.

645
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,080
That certainly seems the way it is.

646
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,260
I don't know about that.

647
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,020
The amount of bragging I've heard

648
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,680
versus the amount of actual sex that I have heard

649
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,460
I mean, there's just no comparison.

650
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,640
And I think there are some people that...

651
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,660
Well, I don't know.

652
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,000
It's the only way they can hurt other people's feelings

653
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,740
is to brag about who they've done.

654
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,880
Whereas others, the only way that...

655
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,600
The best way they can hurt other people's feelings

656
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,020
is to brag about who they declined to do.

657
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,160
And I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings,

658
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,660
so I'm going to...

659
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,340
I'm going to shut up.

660
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,960
Before you do that, Reverend, saying,

661
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,620
well, first, to beg Jonathan,

662
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,720
thanks for the role of confidence.

663
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,100
Second, I have a question for you

664
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,660
about how many subgeniuses would you say are not white?

665
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,200
What?

666
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,540
Are not white?

667
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,200
Yeah.

668
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,500
I have no idea.

669
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,640
I mean, I don't know...

670
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,240
We don't even know how many subgeniuses there are.

671
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,280
Oh, okay.

672
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,300
Yeah, no sense.

673
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,600
If you looked around next day,

674
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,800
if you looked at the stage,

675
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,640
the stage...

676
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,360
The subgenius church is about a fifth black.

677
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,960
But that was just the stage.

678
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,780
Yeah, if you look at the audience, it's pretty pasty.

679
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,220
Yeah.

680
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,860
In fact, if you count the living dead,

681
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,780
they're whiter than white.

682
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,460
Yeah.

683
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,580
I was...

684
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,300
To tell the truth,

685
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,420
it's not just white people

686
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,940
because there were a whole lot of Italians

687
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,320
and Puerto Ricans, subgeniuses that were there.

688
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,080
And even, I dare say, I suspect,

689
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,520
there may even have been one or two Jewish people.

690
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,500
Then there was Rasna.

691
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,960
Well, Rasna is an alien.

692
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,580
He's from another world.

693
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,960
Rasna doesn't count either way.

694
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,920
Yeah, I don't think...

695
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,100
In subgenius land, none of those things matter.

696
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,760
Exactly.

697
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,540
You know, we're...

698
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,240
Pinkness is not a color.

699
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,160
It's an attitude.

700
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,820
We're all descended from the Yeti.

701
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,480
You know, not all of us look alike.

702
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,200
Some of us look pretty different from now on.

703
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,140
But the point is, you know,

704
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,600
there's the Yeti race

705
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,680
and then there's the rest of you.

706
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,060
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

707
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,440
Oh!

708
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,280
Oh!

709
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,300
Oh!

710
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,660
Oh!

711
00:37:59,720 --> 00:37:59,880
Oh!

712
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:00,880
Oh!

713
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:04,960
Oh!

714
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:06,640
Oh!

715
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:06,840


716
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,020
Oh!

717
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,020


718
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,440
Oh!

719
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:07,440


720
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:07,440


721
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:07,440


722
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,320
Oh!

723
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,020
Oh, Bob!

724
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:12,440
Oh!

725
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,220
What?

726
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,620
Yeah, you can do it there.

727
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,180
You're a dirty little Bob.

728
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,460
Meow.

729
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:37,660
Meow.

730
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,400
Not too hard, Bob.

731
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,220
It's Charlie and his orchestra.

732
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,460
Yeah, they should have played that during certain intervals.

733
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,920
Big videos and some big projector over the hot tub or something.

734
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,060
Oh, at X Day?

735
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:02,500
Yes.

736
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,820
No, they did not.

737
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,540
No, they didn't.

738
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,460
In fact, that has never been tried.

739
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,580
It could be done inside the bathhouse.

740
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,320
There's probably enough room for a throw.

741
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,620
But you'd ruin your equipment and get it wet, which you don't want to do.

742
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,300
Well, no, you put it outside and have it.

743
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,460
To perform the baptism in the pool, I wore the fez.

744
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,040
And that's all, right?

745
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,880
No, I wore complete outfit, pants, T-shirts.

746
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,180
I'm not going to be naked.

747
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:32,900
I'm an official.

748
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,200
Oh, yeah, that's right.

749
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,200
I forgot.

750
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,420
I did.

751
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,240
That's like me.

752
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,960
I'm never naked.

753
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,560
Use my hands.

754
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,780
I'm just never naked, ever.

755
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,080
Well, first of all, whenever I get naked, I embarrass all the guys.

756
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,500
It's true.

757
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,420
But that's because...

758
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,080
You want another cup of my rum martini?

759
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,940
My job was to make sure that people who sang pushed under the water came back up.

760
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,960
Just have one more.

761
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,500
It'll make you feel better.

762
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,500
My job was to hold them underwater by the ankles.

763
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,160
I got to say this because he has...

764
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,340
You're passing out?

765
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,040
I have another one, sweetheart.

766
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,280
It's night, ain't it?

767
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,400
You're passing out again.

768
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,240
That's why he says I can't hold my...

769
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,400
Well, folks, we're trying to get the new talent here.

770
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,920
He has my...

771
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,780
I got your back.

772
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,700
I got your back.

773
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,460
I got my...

774
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,060
Shut up.

775
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,160
Oh, the backseat of the show.

776
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,580
There she goes.

777
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,060
That's going to be hard to clean up.

778
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,620
Ah, yes.

779
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,040
Just right on time.

780
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,020
Well, Santa was...

781
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,440
You guys just gave so much...

782
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,200
You know, Santa...

783
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:34,980
Hold on still.

784
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,400
When you and Santa were close...

785
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,440
...at one time.

786
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:37,960
Yeah.

787
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,660
Yeah, that was just like...

788
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,700
Do you think it was the cough syrup?

789
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,340
It was the cough syrup.

790
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,140
Or the liquid slime.

791
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,240
Oh, Robitussin.

792
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,380
Just because Santa gives you Robitussin for Christmas

793
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,160
doesn't mean you have to drink it.

794
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,620
Here is my...

795
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,580
...tussin.

796
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,340
The...

797
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,960
Brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius.

798
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,700
Dallas, Texas.

799
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,980
J.R. Bob Dunn.

800
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,660
No longer in Dallas, Texas.

801
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,520
Now operates from an all-new Cleveland, Ohio address.

802
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,320
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

803
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,420
Pretending like it was an oldster thing.

804
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,460
Cleveland's flats and St. Louis' clapper alley.

805
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,760
Boston's north end.

806
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,240
Beware, beware.

807
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,640
Subs are everywhere.

808
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,680
But, anyway, that's all right.

809
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,620
From each according to his means

810
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,400
to each according to his needs.

811
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,260
What?

812
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,200
That's not Dobbsian.

813
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,760
No, that was Chairman Mao Zedong.

814
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,540
Yeah, that's...

815
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,640
Bob's no commie.

816
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,540
But when dealing with Philo,

817
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,340
you have to use...

818
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,960
Whatever system can catch his slippery essence.

819
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,320
From each according to his means to Bob.

820
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,760
From everybody to Bob.

821
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,080
That's the direction everything ultimately flows

822
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,300
in the great vortex,

823
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,060
which makes him the center of the luck point.

824
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,880
Which is the ball of the pipe.

825
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,120
Right.

826
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,520
The vortex point.

827
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,440
The maelstrom.

828
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
The singularity.

829
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,100
In the bunch bowl.

830
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,300
Yeah, singularity in the punch bowl, friends.

831
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,360
Well...

832
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:07,820
Are you ready?

833
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,560
When your cup dips up...

834
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,980
We must gird our loins

835
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,240
and put on our spiritual armor.

836
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,900
Strap on our buckler

837
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,320
and sharpen our sword

838
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,260
for the reaping of the horrible harvest is nigh.

839
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,140
We'll stand, oh we'll stand

840
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,780
hand in hand

841
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,020
when the trumpet calls

842
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,360
extending

843
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:45,680
in a brother and sister band

844
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:52,940
while they blow the world away.

845
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:00,300
We shall have paradise

846
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,880
subgenie of the world

847
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,540
united.

848
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,380
Alien sex

849
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,660
every night.

850
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,620
Subgenie of the world.

851
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,140
Subgenie of the world.

852
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,280
Subgenie of the world.

853
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,660
Unite.

854
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,520
Fly, Dagi!

855
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,740
Come on, cockpit.

856
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:43,440
Now, we are among the hyenas...

857
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,760
...in an army of dinosaurs.

858
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:49,760


859
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:49,760

00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:03,080
We shall have paradise, so dreamy of the world you'll die

872
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:13,140
And I'll search for happiness, so dreamy of the world, so dreamy of the world, so dreamy of the world you'll die

873
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:33,160
Are you alone or died? Not sure you're all away

874
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:40,140
Such a long life, they all in one must die

875
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:46,860
We shall have paradise, so dreamy of the world you'll die

876
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:56,160
Every night, so dreamy of the world, so dreamy of the world, so dreamy of the world

877
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,160
you'll die

We shall have paradise, so dreamy of the world you'll die

883
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,820
YAY!

884
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,360
Thank you Dr. Drummond.

885
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:56,140
The malarkey's not over yet!

886
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,560
Well, of course.

887
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,820
I got a little malarkey.

888
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,220
Alright, let's continue with the malarkey then.

889
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,600
Oh no, not more malarkey.

890
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,200
I got my malarkey coat on.

891
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,180
Oh yeah.

892
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:07,500
Oh.

893
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,740
Yeah, it's right here actually.

894
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:18,880
Just a few, a few quick words for you before you all go to bed, because I know you're going directly to sleep tonight because we all have to go to church in the morning.

895
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,700
Yeah, funny, joke.

896
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,360
I kid, I kid.

897
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,140
Regardless, I have to just say this.

898
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,480
Just to speak to you very quickly on a topic, a topic that's dear to my heart.

899
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,380
I need to talk to you about, well the general topic of my conversation can be summed up in one word.

900
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:34,980
Evolution.

901
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:40,000
Now those of you that know me will know that I do dabble in a bit of the old anthropology.

902
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:56,120
I may have fiddled with some genetic material here, a few archeological remnants there, some bones, some fossils, some australopithecines, and some, you know, various, various devices and creatures of the, of the distant and near future.

903
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:56,360
And I'm not going to go into that.

904
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:56,360


905
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,960
But I need to talk to you about the topic of evolution.

906
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,600
But before I do that, I'm going to cast your memory back.

907
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,740
I don't know if you remember the early 90s.

908
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,300
I remember the early 90s pretty well.

909
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,920
It was a formative time of my life.

910
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,460
It was, it was a wonderful time.

911
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,060
It was heady.

912
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,040
It was, it was exotic.

913
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,520
There was a lot of fun things happening.

914
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,560
There were, there were, well I don't know if you remember that the alien motif had become fairly strong.

915
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,960
You couldn't turn, you couldn't turn a corner without seeing an alien head somewhere.

916
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,780
Or somebody's X-Files poster somewhere.

917
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,500
Or a conspiracy theory.

918
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,960
We had these great movies like JFK.

919
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,020
Great conspiracy movie.

920
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:37,800
These other, you know, shows like Millennium and these dark sinister references to the conspiracy.

921
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,100
The conspiracy, the conspiracy that we all know so well.

922
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,480
And these things were so strong they were ever present.

923
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:49,800
They were, they were, it was like a rich and varied tapestry that we could, we could pull from.

924
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,600
We could pull these, these crazy magazines.

925
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,500
I don't know if you remember.

926
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:52,940
Myles.

927
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,560
The Condo 2000.

928
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,280
What a great magazine.

929
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,900
All sorts of freaky articles.

930
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:01,040
And things like, well, things like, well, 2600 which still publishes.

931
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,040
But what a great magazine.

932
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:07,840
These, these rich and, and fertile counter cultural moments that we had to enjoy.

933
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:12,140
And, and, and you, you, you got to watch these things and see these things happen.

934
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,240
And the conspiracy was in the air.

935
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,460
You, people were taught, people were aware of it.

936
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:16,960
People knew.

937
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:17,780
Aliens.

938
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,740
Area 51.

939
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,300
Conspiracy theories.

940
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,160
Yetis.

941
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:21,960
Alien abduction.

942
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:22,940
You know.

943
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,540
The, all these exciting things.

944
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,240
It was great.

945
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,100
It was fantastic.

946
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,760
And, and, and if you notice, these things have faded into the background.

947
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,100
I mean, for those of us that are, are still willing to look, they're still there.

948
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,160
They haven't gone away.

949
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,300
But we don't hear about them.

950
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,320
They don't make movies about these things.

951
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,040
Yeah.

952
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,300
They don't, they don't talk about these things.

953
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:43,960
And conspiracy theories.

954
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,880
Oh, ha, ha, ha.

955
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,220
9-11 conspiracy theories.

956
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,240
They're so funny.

957
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,860
Oh, as if anybody would do anything like that.

958
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,720
But you know, the thing is, is the conspiracy theorists themselves have become ridiculous

959
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,060
attention hounds.

960
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,720
And, and, and all this, when, when did this change?

961
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,020
Oh, September 11.

962
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:01,920
No, it didn't change.

963
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,700
I'll tell you exactly when it changed.

964
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,180
It changed on July 5th, 1998.

965
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,240
Do you remember what happened after July 5th, 1998?

966
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,680
It all went to hell.

967
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,420
Yes.

968
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,480
Now, I want to bring you back to that thought.

969
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,000
Because.

970
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,700
I'm going to tell you something very interesting about the aliens.

971
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,560
The greys.

972
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,100
You know, everybody knows about the greys.

973
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,340
We've all seen the pictures.

974
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,200
We've looked at them.

975
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,500
We've thought about them.

976
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,720
Alien abductions.

977
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,720
Ooh, what are the greys?

978
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,380
Where are they from?

979
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,040
What do they do?

980
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:35,740
Why are they here?

981
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,000
Who are they working for?

982
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,280
Well, let me tell you something.

983
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:46,140
The alien greys are us in the future coming back to try and secure their own existence.

984
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,740
But they only one path.

985
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:49,980
There is a path.

986
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,500
There is another path.

987
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,540
It's another one we haven't heard a whole lot about lately.

988
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,140
The other path.

989
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,880
This is divergent evolution.

990
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:04,520
See, evolution conducts itself in a fashion known as punctuated equilibrium.

991
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:08,880
And let me tell you, the subgenius is the punctuation in that equilibrium.

992
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,220
If you're a Bavarian, well, then it's a question mark.

993
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,540
And if you're an emergenteal, it's an exclamation point.

994
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,880
But regardless, the subgenius is the punctuation in punctuated equilibrium.

995
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:25,380
And let me tell you, the equilibrium is about to be punctuated.

996
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,160
Praise God!

997
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,660
Praise God!

998
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,040
Thank you.

999
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,380
And let me tell you why.

1000
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,260
Because we are at a point where we can decide what direction we want to go in.

1001
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:43,900
And when we're thinking about the greys, that possibility becomes more real and more

1002
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,460
potential.

1003
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,880
But let me tell you something else about the greys.

1004
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,860
You don't want to be a part of it.

1005
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:49,860


1006
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,680
You don't want to become like they are.

1007
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,580
Because they are only one possibility.

1008
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:54,700
They don't eat.

1009
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:02,060
They smear decomposed, rotting cow parts that they have dipped in acid until it's retained

1010
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,880
its sole biogenic qualities.

1011
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,260
And they paint it on their skin and absorb it.

1012
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,160
They don't enjoy food.

1013
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,200
They don't drink beer.

1014
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:10,860
They don't fuck.

1015
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:11,640
They don't taste.

1016
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,360
They don't even have fucking teeth.

1017
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,040
You want to keep your teeth, don't you?

1018
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:19,840
You don't want to keep your teeth.

1019
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,300
You don't want to become like them.

1020
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,840
What's in the other direction?

1021
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:28,880
Because if you look at evolution, you move in one direction, you get less teeth.

1022
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,640
Because you become specialized.

1023
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,120
This is something that Darwin figured out.

1024
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,340
He said specialization.

1025
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,900
You discard these unnecessary characteristics.

1026
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,760
Unnecessary characteristics.

1027
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,200
I like my teeth.

1028
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,780
I like my functioning genitalia.

1029
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,660
I like my sense of taste.

1030
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,820
I like my ability to process alcohol and other alcohol.

1031
00:51:49,820 --> 00:52:01,060
You got to call me up on a date.

1032
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,060


1033
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,060


1034
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:01,100
Listen.

1035
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,240
I don't have any of that.

1036
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:03,460
How can I you?

1037
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:03,460


1038
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:03,880
Your video clip shows my eyes.

1039
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,500
I miss the Levitis.

1040
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,060
I make my eyes look like ecstell procure and gloves on!

1041
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,160
The idea of getting rid of the balloon is awesome, but it didn't like these snobbish

1042
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:07,160


1043
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:07,300
That was the idea, baby.

1044
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,880
You just have to understand 엉

1045
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,680
Let's try that again.

1046
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,760
Or even at your place, why don't the fools from the

1047
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,400
their house throw me out there?

1048
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:14,960
Because he wants to remove me?

1049
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,000
How does that hurt?

1050
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,280
My whole, whole body hurts.

1051
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,120
Man, there's no pain.

1052
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,760
Change the mileage day.

1053
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:19,760


1054
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,520
we don't want to become like those sterile

1055
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,040
saucer crashing

1056
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,300
motherfuckers

1057
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,200
those abducting anal probers

1058
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,720
that have no life

1059
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,160
they have no slack

1060
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,400
they are grey

1061
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,860
they aren't even pink

1062
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,840
but let me tell you

1063
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,060
we're not hearing about them

1064
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,120
and we're not hearing about the yetis

1065
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,820
why? because both

1066
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,240
possibilities seem to be

1067
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,780
fading and receding

1068
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,960
and we're at a crossroads

1069
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,100
we're at a crossroads

1070
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,260
we can go this way or we can go this way

1071
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:56,020
well I don't know if you've ever been at a crossroads

1072
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,220
there are four directions

1073
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,300
at every crossroad

1074
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,020
and we're at that crossroad

1075
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,660
and one direction

1076
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,240
leads towards certain death

1077
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,700
for all of us

1078
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,680
extinction for the homo sapien

1079
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,480
sapien

1080
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,320
and I'll talk about pinks

1081
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:16,820
a little bit

1082
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,760
but I tell you

1083
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,560
biogenic structuralism indicates

1084
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,260
that the religious

1085
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,820
ecstatic experience

1086
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,740
is hardwired into every single human being

1087
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,400
we all have the potential

1088
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,740
to be a subgenius

1089
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,720
but let me tell you

1090
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,940
not everybody's going to use it

1091
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:37,300
there's two kinds of monkeys

1092
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,300
on this planet

1093
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,460
there's the dumb monkeys

1094
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,380
and there's the stupid monkeys

1095
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,360
and thank Bob I'm a dumb monkey

1096
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,340
but I ain't no stupid monkey

1097
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:46,820
yeah

1098
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,180
yeah

1099
00:53:47,760 --> 00:54:17,760


1100
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,080
but I

1101
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:19,680
will be static

1102
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,380
just throw me a drink

1103
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,600
or a glass of toast

1104
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:21,640
with my drink

1105
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,980
do I have to slow my ding dung down

1106
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:25,980


1107
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:25,980


1108
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,140
just

1109
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:26,360
got to

1110
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,440
at

1111
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:26,840
go

1112
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:26,840


1113
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,780
at

1114
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,660
yeah

1115
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,620
right now.

1116
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,480
Yeah!

1117
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,560
Ow!

1118
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,840
Is that your direction?

1119
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,080
No, okay.

1120
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,640
But one direction

1121
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,080
leads towards the

1122
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,100
greys, and one direction

1123
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,900
leads towards the yeti.

1124
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,000
And I know what direction I'm moving in.

1125
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,340
I want more hair on my body,

1126
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:52,960
not less.

1127
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,820
I want functioning genitalia.

1128
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,120
I want a sense of taste, smell,

1129
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,680
touch, hearing.

1130
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,320
I don't want to fucking hear what's in your brain.

1131
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,220
I don't give a shit about telepathy.

1132
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,320
I can see what's

1133
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,240
on your mind by looking at

1134
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,120
your face and smelling

1135
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,100
the pheromones that come

1136
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:12,980
out of your skin.

1137
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,960
And that's what

1138
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,140
subgeniuses do. The ooze

1139
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,800
squirt is something

1140
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,020
a grey will never understand.

1141
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,540
And let me tell you,

1142
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,920
the conspiracy loves the

1143
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,960
idea of the greys

1144
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,340
because they're all the same.

1145
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,900
But the subgenius

1146
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,000
is irreplaceable.

1147
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,440
Every single subgenius is irreplaceable.

1148
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,460
How many Janers do we have here tonight?

1149
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,480
I'm a Janer!

1150
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,120
Woo!

1151
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,600
You're an Alex, bitch!

1152
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,040
And I know it.

1153
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,520
And you should never be anything

1154
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,120
but, because you're

1155
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:50,920
fucking awesome.

1156
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,320
But Janer told me I was a Janer!

1157
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,520
That's because he's Janer, and he says those things.

1158
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,540
But there's only one

1159
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,480
Ivan Stang.

1160
00:55:59,680 --> 00:55:59,760
He's the only one

1161
00:55:59,760 --> 00:55:59,980
that's going to be here tonight.

1162
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,400
There's only one Princess Wee.

1163
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,900
There's only one single...

1164
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,780
Every time we lose a subgenius,

1165
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,380
that subgenius is gone.

1166
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,720
Gone. Irreplaceable.

1167
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,960
Every single one of you

1168
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,260
represents a unique,

1169
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,840
evolutionary perspective.

1170
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,220
And we need to preserve that.

1171
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,400
We need to preserve that.

1172
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,640
Like I said, we're at the crossroads.

1173
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,920
It's going to get really ugly up ahead.

1174
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:29,660
It's going to get really ugly up ahead.

1175
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,900
And y'all better be ready.

1176
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,260
And you better be ready to move in

1177
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,660
the direction that's going to give your life flavor.

1178
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,500
The direction that's going to give your life substance.

1179
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,540
The direction that's going to give you

1180
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:45,160
good, squishy, ooze, squirt, and sex hurt.

1181
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,940
The direction that's going to give you SLACK!

1182
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,900
Can I get a praise, Bob?

1183
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,280
Praise Bob!

1184
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,200
Woo!

1185
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,200
Yes, David!

1186
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:57,940
Yeah, baby!

1187
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,280
E-Y-I! E-Y-I!

1188
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,800
E-Y-I! E-Y-I!

1189
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,440
E-Y-I! E-Y-I!

1190
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:07,440


1191
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,960
That was, of course, the Reverend

1192
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,180
Carter LeBlanc, ladies and gentlemen.

1193
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,480
Let's hear it for him once more.

1194
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,320
Praise Carter LeBlanc!

1195
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,360
You have been hearing the

1196
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,900
subgenius radio ministry, Hour of SLACK.

1197
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,160
The song before

1198
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,580
Reverend Carter's incredible rant

1199
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,440
there was Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1200
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,380
jamming with Princess Leigh and

1201
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,520
basically the two of the Amino

1202
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,800
Acids. Who are also heard

1203
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,300
in the background playing at 9XD

1204
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,360
and of which more can be had at

1205
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,940

Ohio 44118

1213
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,040
Praise Bob!

1214
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,440
So that's your next

1215
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,700
big thing now, right Hal?

1216
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,000
You're going to get ready for the man?

1217
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,820
Yeah, I guess I'm going to have to,

1218
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,060
but I'll tell you this, I'd be surprised

1219
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,520
if I had as much delight and pleasure

1220
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,280
at the man as I have just had it

1221
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,440
right at X Day.

1222
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,080
Aww, you had a good time last year, right?

1223
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,580
Last time I had an okay time, yeah sure.

1224
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:18,900
Last time I had a pretty good time,

1225
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,400
but this year I was extremely...

1226
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,840
The man's just a lot of work now.

1227
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,160
There's no SLACK at the man anymore.

1228
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,480
Well, now you're talking about

1229
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,540
um, um, yeah... You can't get

1230
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,080
SLACK at the man. You're talking about Vernon Mann now.

1231
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,560
I've gotten SLACK at Vernon Mann.

1232
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,240
It's X Day though, that's the place

1233
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,700
that's designed for SLACK.

1234
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,060
It's designed for SLACK, man.

1235
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,240
Designed for Hagar SLACK.

1236
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,120
Sammy Hagar.

1237
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,360
So what are you drawing pictures of?

1238
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,880
I see those diagrams you have in front of you there.

1239
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:48,880
So, X Day,

1240
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,000
actually it's the lyric sheet

1241
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,860
for my song, but I think

1242
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,520
it does contain irrelevant

1243
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,440
drawings that have nothing

1244
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,860
whatever to do with the lyrics.

1245
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,840
Electronic mail flying around

1246
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,840
for almost a whole weekend.

1247
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,600
But I can explain this to you

1248
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,300
if you would like.

1249
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,360
Yes, I would like.

1250
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,980
What you have is an iron bar

1251
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:13,400
and it's drawn up this ramp by a magnet.

1252
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,560
As it moves up the ramp...

1253
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1254
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1255
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1256
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1257
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1258
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1259
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1260
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1261
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1262
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1263
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1264
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1265
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1266
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1267
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1268
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1269
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1270
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1271
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1272
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1273
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1274
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680
