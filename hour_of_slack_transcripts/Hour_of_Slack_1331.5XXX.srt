00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,140
Ooh, baby, baby

94
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,940
I'm gonna be afraid he's gonna touch me

95
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,600
Ooh, baby, baby

96
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,780
I'm gonna be afraid he's gonna touch me

97
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,300
I've lost in a whirlpool

98
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,000
Ooh, I can't even see

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,280
And I've lost in a whirlpool

100
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,400
Ooh, I can't even see

101
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,400


102
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,400


103
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,020
One, two, three, four.

104
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,300
One, two, three, four.

105
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,320
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

106
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,480
And now, we're up to our longest dedication.

107
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:23,580
And now, we're up to our longest dedication.

108
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:32,880
And this one is about kids and pets, a situation we can all understand, whether we have kids

109
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,800
or pets or neither.

110
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,260
Uh huh.

111
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,460
Hmm.

112
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,860
It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio.

113
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,360
Here's what he writes.

114
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:53,060
Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere.

115
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,700
It'll mean a lot if you play.

116
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,520
Recently, there was a dad in our family.

117
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,040
He was a little dog named Snuggle.

118
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,320
Little dog named Snuggle.

119
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,700
But he was most certainly a part of the company.

120
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,180
Start again.

121
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Coming out of the record.

122
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,940
Play the record, okay?

123
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,200
Please.

124
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,040
You can't get on the rhythm to the rhythm.

125
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,040


126
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,040


127
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,040


128
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,100
I'm on the rhythm.

129
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
You're the son of a bitch.

130
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,500
That's the letter U and the number two.

131
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,440
The four-man band is Adam Blaine on bass.

132
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,180
Larry Mullen on drums.

133
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,560
Dave Evans, nickname the Edron.

134
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,520
Ooh, this is bullshit.

135
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,660
Nobody cares.

136
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,720
He's passed off from Franklin.

137
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,000
Who gives a shit?

138
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,800
Oh, yeah.

139
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,460
Just a lot of what you can have, so don't take any shit.

140
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,240
I'm sure, for sure.

141
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,500
You guys don't know where it's at.

142
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,920
You don't know shit about it.

143
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,780
This is bullshit.

144
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,880
This is bullshit.

145
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,880
Sounds like he's portable.

146
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm sure.

147
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,040


148
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,040


149
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,040


150
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,040


151
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,040


152
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,040


153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,860
This is abortion through bitchy putty.

00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,400
I'm sick of the fucking phone

173
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,700
You ever found anybody

174
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,300
Anywhere, anytime

175
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,700
You never have, you've got a correct address

176
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,960
Right on description

177
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,580
Or a call, nothing

178
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,920
You've got some fucking bullshit info

179
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,420
You haven't done shit with him

180
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,540
Couldn't find you yet

181
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,020
If I need a first time

182
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,440
When was the first time, huh?

183
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,960
When was the first time?

184
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,980
Hey, I told you about his address

185
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,000
And what it looks like

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,920
And all that fucking information

187
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,240
You've got to have him found

188
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,360
You've got to have him found

189
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,360


190
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,220
Goddamn, got somebody there

191
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,440
And I don't know who

192
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,780
Go ahead and get all that shit out of you

193
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,280
Why don't you go over there

194
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,740
And knock on his fucking door, man

195
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,380
Think you know where he's at

196
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,760
And all this shit

197
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,960
See you when you come out of the temple

198
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,580
Goddamn numbers, man

199
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,860
It's impossible to make those transitions

200
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,160
Then you've got to go into somebody's time

201
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,760
Goddammit, if we can't come out of the low record

202
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,280
You don't understand it

203
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,220
Why you got to go into somebody's time

204
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,380
Why we doing these instrumentals

205
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,500
Cause we got to

206
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,200
I don't understand it

207
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,000
This is also nothing new

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,360
I don't understand it

209
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,200
This is also nothing new

210
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,680
I don't understand it

211
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,800
Well, we found something

212
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,100
And it's really there

213
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,720
Somebody find out the goddamn answer

214
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,160
In the 50s, they considered it vulgar

215
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,900
And despicable to have songs like

216
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,620
Teach Me Tonight

217
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,520
Let's Do It by Cole Porter

218
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,580
All of you by Cole Porter

219
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,240
These were considered euphemisms

220
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,380
For something dirty

221
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,520
Who gives a shit

222
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,960
Some vulgar dirty ass

223
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,420
Diddly shit, diddly shit

224
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,540
The Kingston Trio sang a song

225
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,640
That used the word damn

226
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,200
It was banned on the radio

227
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,940
Goddammit

228
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,540
In the 60s, it was a song called

229
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,500
Louie Louie

230
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,080
Goddamn

231
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,680
It was played upside backwards

232
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,240
Goddamn

233
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,540
Every way they could play it

234
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,820
Looking for the dirty message

235
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,460
Goddamn

236
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,000
Never found the dirty message

237
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,860
The FCC brought it

238
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,360
Oh fuck

239
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,260
In the 70s, people went through the same period

240
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,360
Looking for the dirtiness of the song

241
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,820
Say

242
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,760
I

243
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,340
Say

244
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,460
I

245
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,260
What

246
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,780
I

247
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,400
I

248
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,240
I

249
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,440
I really don't think the Titanic message is this

250
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,700
Go out and walk your fine new man

251
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,260
No goes

252
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,680
You better be prepared to meet your maker

253
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,480
I

254
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,420
I

255
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,820
I'm after your ass boy

256
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,460
I

257
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,700
Sounds like one of those gay babe boys

258
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,640
No goes

259
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,360
You're gonna need to meet me at Moline and the Monument

260
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,140
I wanna personally meet you

261
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,220
You'll see me

262
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,940
I'll be wearing a bow tie

263
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,560
A red and white baseball cap

264
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,760
Says KBC's Potterpots on it

265
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,020
Can't miss the sun

266
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,840
Oh it sounds like the real Fancy Dressen

267
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,800
I don't even have a hat

268
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,780
I'm gonna whoop your fuckin' ass

269
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,580
I want a goddamn concert at Ebony

270
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,960
To find out what record it is

271
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,320
So fuck it up, it won't record

272
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,600
Every time I do a goddamn death dedication

273
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,180
It's the last goddamn time

274
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,520
I want somebody to use his fuckin' brain

275
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,060
To come out with a goddamn record that it's all that it tells us to know

276
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,020
And I gotta talk about a fucking dog's eye

277
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,460
Hey guys, it's the 70s

278
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,100
And there's so much shit

279
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,060
Stupid shit

280
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,280
Who knows

281
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,840
Who knows what the fuck's gonna get done

282
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,680
What's the point

283
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,640
Of a fucking punk

284
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,340
Punk

285
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,120
Punk

286
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,660
Punk

287
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,040
Punk

288
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,400
Punk

289
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,680
This is American Top 4

290
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,840
Right here on the radio station you grew up on

291
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,900
With Music Radio 1384

292
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,520
Oh fuck you, Liz

293
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,500
Fuck you too, Richard

294
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,240
Oh fuck you, Liz

295
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,080
Fuck you too, Richard

296
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,400
Yeah, I'd love to, wouldn't you

297
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,960
I'm such a nice kid, though

298
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,900
The 180Gs on C-Land Records, NegativeLand.com

299
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,920
NegativeLand without the E

300
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:40,160
There's some guys in Detroit, The 180Gs, who do covers of Negative Land experimental collage songs

301
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,940
That particular cover contains so many underground radio trash songs

302
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,200
or inside jokes you can't even imagine.

303
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,820
By the way, the negative land originally got hold of that Casey Kasem outtake

304
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,120
from a member of the Church of the Subgenius.

305
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:06,100
Now, some good taste from Heart Ignition on pussy taste,

306
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,200
followed by the song Can't Keep a Secret by Nervous Energy

307
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,020
live at the Devotional of 2010.

308
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,340
We've got three very strong flavors.

309
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:19,640
Pussy.

310
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,180
But I need something from you to satisfy my sweet.

311
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,800
Quote, quote, action.

312
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,280
I'm totally fine with strong flavors like purple and grass.

313
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,780
Is that true?

314
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,420
Please.

315
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,740
But getting them fresh is obviously the best way to go, right?

316
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,860
Well, if you find them at the market and they're still on the stem,

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,600
that's one of the best ways to buy them.

318
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,700
You know that they're fresh.

319
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,760
Pussy.

320
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,400
And they are bizarre looking.

321
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,880
It looks like a cabbage for most of the year

322
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,860
and gets this long stem on it with this kind of cabbage-like,

323
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,680
head on the top that starts popping out.

324
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,340
What kind of a vagina do you have, darling?

325
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:49,880
Squirt.

326
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,560
My life was ended way too short

327
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,800
And now I'm standing here in the pearly gates court

328
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,920
Right in front of a brown wall

329
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,300
Head boy

330
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,640
He tells me to call him Leroy

331
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,840
My life is a book

332
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,540
He holds in his hands

333
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,300
My final judgment he sternly demands

334
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,880
Remember the time

335
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,300
You pissed on your cousin for no good reason

336
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,720
Remember the time

337
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,980
You were 17 but you shit your pants

338
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,640
Remember the time

339
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,320
You jerked up in the corner while watching a three-way

340
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,500
Remember the time

341
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,220
You told a bunch of people there was some dude in the woods trying to molest you

342
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,280
And there really wasn't a dude there at all

343
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,660
And everyone went out looking for him

344
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,840
And of course they couldn't find him because he wasn't really there

345
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,700
But everyone went anyway

346
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,180
And you know what they did find?

347
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,640
They found a fucking bee's nest

348
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,700
And everyone got stung

349
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,760
Because of you

350
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,380
Not very cool, bro

351
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,520
I knew I recognized this kid from somewhere

352
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,920
But where could I find him?

353
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,280
Where could it be?

354
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,160
Hmm

355
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,400
Perhaps a series of children's literature

356
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,660
Started in 1963 by author Donald J. Sobel

357
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,380
And then briefly a 1989 television series for kids on HBO directed by savage Steve Holland

358
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,540
Better known as the director of Better Off Dead and One Crazy Summer

359
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,240
Yeah, maybe that's...

360
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,040
That's how I knew the guy

361
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,480
Can't keep a secret, can't keep a secret

362
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,000
Can't keep a secret from Encyclopedia Brown

363
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,460
Keep a secret, can't keep a secret

364
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,860
Can't keep a secret from Encyclopedia Brown

365
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,340
Keep a secret, can't keep a secret

366
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,840
Can't keep a secret from Encyclopedia Brown

367
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,720
Why should I let you in?

368
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,540
For being ridiculous and admitting sin

369
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,620
Why should I let you in?

370
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,360
For being ridiculous and admitting sin

371
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,520
I should send you to hell

372
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,280
With vermin and swine and R.L. Stine

373
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,400
But at least it made me great

374
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,500
At least it made me great

375
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,300
At least it made me great

376
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,580
At least it made me great

377
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,340
At least it made me great

378
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,620
At least it made me great

379
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,540
At least it made me great

380
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:31,540


381
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,960
It at real

382
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,500
At least it made me great

383
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:34,500


384
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,920
An wielder

385
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:35,960
At least it made me great

386
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,400
Can't keep a secret, can't keep a secret

387
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,900
Can't keep a secret from Encyclopedia Brown

388
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,340
Keep a secret, can't keep a secret

389
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,380
Can't keep a secret from Encyclopedia Brown

390
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,200
Keep a secret from Encyclopedia Brown. Keep a secret you can't keep a secret.

391
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,100
Can't keep a secret from Encyclopedia Brown. Keep a secret you can't keep a secret.

392
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,540
Can't keep a secret from Encyclopedia Brown.

393
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm considering a request

394
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,840
for tens of billions more dollars to be deployed to Afghanistan.

395
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,560
Afghanistan. Federal authorities in New York generated $20 million in illegal profits and

396
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,920
then detonated a suicide vest, killing a prominent turd. But apparently the turd is one of the

397
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:29,900
wealthiest men in America. The complaint says $7 billion. Peer News. On Wall Street 399957,

398
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:38,380
the federal budget deficit is $4. This is PR News. The Department of Justice posted

399
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,080
disappointing quarterly results. Justice Department profit fell 2 billion percent

400
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:51,340
from a year ago. The military says this is PR. I didn't consider that sexual abuse, but

401
00:20:51,340 --> 00:21:02,360
I know that I did get involved in abusing some. One of them is Michael.

402
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:22,360
I knew it was wrong when he tried to get my bone. But he'd beg and beg and plead all the

403
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:30,060
while on his knees. I told him I preferred vagina over the producer of diarrhea. But

404
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:36,620
I don't know what to do right now. Cause I'm in love with a Catholic priest.

405
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:47,220
He's got me down on my knees. Catholic has a new meaning. I'm in love with a Catholic

406
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:59,400
priest. He's got me down on my knees. Catholic has a new meaning. I asked him why I had to

407
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:06,640
lick his asshole. He said the Bible says so. He lured me in with gum. Then he baptized

408
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,920
me with his cum.

409
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:31,220
I took a shower. I could see. He leaves me feeling undermined. And I say at my age, Look

410
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:31,920
at this old year's

411
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:38,360
up Promise I 힘. I'm not saying I complaining. I took a wide it gets enough stinks off my

412
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,200
new meaning

413
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,920
he converted

414
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,640
me

415
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,100
where it's dirty

416
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,100

417
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,520
alright

418
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,400
he converted me

419
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,460

420
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:56,720
dirty

421
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,600

422
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
me alright

423
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,860
he said

424
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,640
I've been a bad boy

425
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,120
as he punished me

426
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,380
with ash joy

427
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,220
he converted me

428
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:12,660
alright

429
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,040
I'm in love with the Catholic

430
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,580
priest

431
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,340
he's got me down on my knees

432
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,340
Catholic

433
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,500

434
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,460
I'm in love

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,600

436
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,320
he's got me down

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,440
on my knees

438
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,920

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,060

00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,800
If you're gonna dance with me tonight

548
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,040
Gotta put your pepper

549
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,980
Oops, I didn't realize I didn't

550
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,340
It came out of my crotch

551
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,320
My vagina is

552
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,000
Is this cocktail of disappointment?

553
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,980
Oh, I hate that

554
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,500
I love the smell of semen

555
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,740
What's going on in that bed?

556
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,200
Thanks to Heart Ignition

557
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,160
for that short bit

558
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,980
and to Evolution Control Committee

559
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,900
Ministry of Slack

560
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,800
and Slander Bob at 14X Day

561
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,360
for the jam before that.

562
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,120
Now, back to X Day Drill

563
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,600
for a segment on stage

564
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,080
with Dr. Howell,

565
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,360
Dr. Philo Drummond,

566
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,560
and yours truly,

567
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,800
Reverend Ivan Stang.

568
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,180
When you picked up

569
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,980
your program book,

570
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,800
you may have noticed

571
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,700
these papers that show

572
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,140
that have blanks

573
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,860
as if you're supposed

574
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,740
to fill them in.

575
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,580
The gorillas and demons

576
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,520
in your life,

577
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,220
have you ever felt beset

578
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,420
by an inner gorilla

579
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,200
that was making you feel small

580
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
or an inner demon

581
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,240
that made you want to go

582
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,100
shoplifting or be mean

583
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,140
or whatnot?

584
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,160
A refugee from a gorilla loving.

585
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,360
inside your head on this

586
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,100
and later in the festival

587
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,800
when we run out of material

588
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,960
we'll use yours

589
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,600
and read from it.

590
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,160
There's also

591
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,280
the What's the Next line

592
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,140
for senile dementia patients.

593
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:03,920
Thank you.

594
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,760
It starts with famous

595
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,760
fairy tale or nursery rhymes

596
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,820
and the poor old person

597
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,400
is encouraged to remember

598
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,380
the second part of the nursery rhyme.

599
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,020
Of course, subgeniuses,

600
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,540
half of them never heard

601
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,340
those nursery rhymes to begin with

602
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,520
so they fill it in

603
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,780
with their own ideas of

604
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,380
what happened to the little girl

605
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,060
who had a little curl.

606
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,640
Right in the middle of her forehead.

607
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,440
Well, you know,

608
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,160
most subgeniuses have also

609
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,720
not even been in a nursery

610
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,040
even to purchase a potted palm.

611
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,320
Is that the same one

612
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,940
with the necklace made of pearl?

613
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:40,880
No.

614
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,460
Right, there was a little girl

615
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,360
who had a little curl

616
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,280
and on top of that

617
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,620
a necklace made of pearl.

618
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,140
That's the kind of thing

619
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,520
people...

620
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,000
That's how it goes.

621
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,440
Georgie Porgy pudding and pie.

622
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,440
I'm sure you can finish that one.

623
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,460
Stuck a red hot poker

624
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,440
in his left eye.

625
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:58,800
Yeah.

626
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,640
Wee Willie Winkle

627
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,880
runs through the town.

628
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:02,880


629
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,520
Wee Willie Winky

630
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,700
runs through the town

631
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,200
upstairs and downstairs

632
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,160
in his nightgown.

633
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:10,720
No, but...

634
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,920
Well, I come from San Francisco.

635
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,380
Al's gonna play it straight.

636
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,280
There's nothing...

637
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,020
What are you saying?

638
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,420
You're gonna play it straight.

639
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,580
With his tiny penis

640
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,760
made up like a clown.

641
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,720
You should give a good alternate verse.

642
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,140
Peeping through the window,

643
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,800
squinting through the lock.

644
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,560
Are all the children in their beds?

645
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,120
Because now it's eight o'clock.

646
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,860
You better get tied in your bed

647
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,600
because I'm gonna grab your cock.

648
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah, he had the ox sound to work with.

649
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,340
Back off.

650
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:37,640
Wait a minute.

651
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,720
I can't use this stuff on Hour of Slack.

652
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,280
That's right.

653
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,700
Remember, the seven dirty sacred words.

654
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,680
This is an Hour of Slack, right?

655
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,940
This is gonna be used later on the radio.

656
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,900
There was a little woman

657
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,280
who lived in a shoe

658
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,700
and her husband had a fetish for poo.

659
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,440
But you could...

660
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,380
Hush, little baby.

661
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,460
Don't say a word.

662
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,280
Now, you gotta have turd

663
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,360
at the end of the next round.

664
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,340
Well, no. Only...

665
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,160
I'm gonna have to pay for your doctor, Trevor.

666
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:01,460
It's important.

667
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:07,440
Little boy blue, come blow your horn.

668
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,280
The sheep's in the meadow.

669
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,360
Who's getting the corn?

670
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,040
That was so easy to...

671
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,080
Diddle, diddle.

672
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,140
Little child that looked after the sheep.

673
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,420
Diddle that dumpling, John.

674
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,680
Daddy's gonna humbly...

675
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:22,740
My son.

676
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,420
Diddle, diddle dumpling, my son John.

677
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,600
Diddle, diddler and chicken diddler.

678
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,280
The trick of picking chicken...

679
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,780
It's an old saying.

680
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,320
Picking what chicken to pick.

681
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,300
Diddle the chicken with a chicken feather.

682
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,600
And this is how you use the divine gift of speech?

683
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,840
Yeah. Bob gave us the gift of tongues.

684
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,020
And this is what we use.

685
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,960
Yes, the gift of tongues.

686
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,120
Just a tongue each other.

687
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,200
Speaking in tongues.

688
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,180
I always used to enjoy a good tongue sandwich.

689
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,600
We used to eat that back when I was a boy.

690
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
I don't know who does now.

691
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,960
I prefer a tongue bath.

692
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,140
They're good with horseradish.

693
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,400
The sandwich, not the bath.

694
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,180
Warning!

695
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,160
The Bible warns against...

696
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,540
The Bible.

697
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,740
The Bible is bold.

698
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,120
We are believing the prayer of morabilities as it is of evil.

699
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,640
Fast and bulbous.

700
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,000
How much of...

701
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,520
Expect.

702
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,520
That's right.

703
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,940
It is the business of the future to be...

704
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,320
in...

705
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,720
Al spareeen.

706
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,660
True.

707
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:31,660


708
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:31,660


709
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:31,660


710
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,120
And one to die for.

711
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,120


712
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:32,800
There is no other...

713
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:32,800


714
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:32,800


715
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,020
Cu...

716
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,540
San...

717
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,020
In...

718
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,420
My eyes бу...

719
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,760
Fascination.

720
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:40,760


721
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:40,760


722
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:40,760


723
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,560
Ahcall, at most, to right...

724
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,180
Guido...

725
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,240
Tonight, you...

726
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,680
My friend...

727
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,920
We're the ingredients for the New Worldamos

728
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,120
and throw you off the balcony, you stinking little cocksucker.

729
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,700
If you don't hurry to tell me where and what's left of that fucking dope

730
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,000
that you and that other fucking weasel have been slamming into your dope-fiend fucking vase

731
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,680
during your fucking convalescence.

732
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
God, Mr. Swindler.

733
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,660
Jesus, what a fucking stink!

734
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,220
Not to mention you killed a fucking chink courier,

735
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,320
and the headache over that I'm going to have with fucking woo

736
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,080
if I ever get this fucking stench out of my fucking nostril.

737
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,460
I just shit myself, sir.

738
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,500
I'm saying it now before the smell gets you.

739
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,040
Bob!

740
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,580
Bob.

741
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,000
You know, there was this gangster dude.

742
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,560
He was a gangster, and he was telling everybody,

743
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,940
man, I'm a gangster, G.

744
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,980
I'm a gangster.

745
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,880
Follow me on Twitter. How the hell is you a gangster and you got internet access?

746
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,120
Can someone please help me out here? How is you a gangster and you updating your Twitter?

747
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,920
How's that gonna go? Man, I just shot four people, dawg.

748
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,280
Man, I just raped a bitch. I'm selling this crack, nigga.

749
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:21,520
I got that weed, son. If you need some bootleg DVDs, look me up, man.

750
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,660
Stop with the Twitter. No one gives a damn.

751
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,860
In just a moment, tonight's story, but first, a message from America.

752
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,100
The whole country's talking about Mr. Carl Moore of Kingston, Pennsylvania.

753
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,600
It's still as new-looking as when I bought it, but you'd never know it to look at my 54-inch paint job.

754
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,460
But first, a brief message from America.

755
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,720
From coast to coast, more funny. More in Comps, more in Performanford, and more in the coast.

756
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,420
But only through Midship Ride and the fine rubber front seat. You'll agree, more funny.

757
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,120
Only by smooth ability. Once you've priced, how much agree?

758
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,620
Vogel. Yeah. Uh, Vogel.

759
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,860
Good night.

760
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,380
Mr. Carl says.

761
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,620
Mr. Rooster says.

762
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,360
To the cat.

763
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,740
Here's a duck.

764
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,620
The sheep.

765
00:34:54,660 --> 00:35:24,660


766
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,460
Here's a chicken.

767
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,080
Money works best inessional.

768
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:40,660
And I said to Mr. Rooster, you never live a day with getting more meat than you're needed to deliberately keeping on.

769
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:40,820
I said to him, if I use any 500 quid you were gonna have to pay an all year pension or soqué, he'll feed you to whatever dining table can give him air.

770
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,780
He said, There's no letter for this.

771
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,780


772
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,780


773
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,060
The business difficult for you.

774
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:07,340
The business difficult for you.

775
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,100
The business difficult for you.

776
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,860
The business difficult for you.

777
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,560
The business for a guy that's got to come up here and tell the truth.

778
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,420
Come up here and tell the truth.

779
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,220
Come up here and tell the truth.

780
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,260
Come up here.

781
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,840
From PR News in Washington, I'm turning ugly.

782
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:54,120
President Obama's plan for 5.6 million homos is running into trouble.

783
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,640
Sales were down 2%.

784
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,180
But 902,000 homos can't deal with all the PR news, at least temporarily.

785
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:08,020
At last, check on Wall Street, 2010, 5-4, 2287, 1435.

786
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,740
Exiled former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Arras.

787
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,380
Arras says he's ready to set up roadblocks out of corpses and rocks.

788
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,640
Even worse.

789
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,260
This is PR News.

790
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,700
But, but wait, wait.

791
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,860
There's hope.

792
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,040
We are not hopeless.

793
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,000
We have hope.

794
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:33,420
Because if you spend $30, just $30.

795
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,120
How much?

796
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,780
$30.

797
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,180
$30.

798
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,360
Think about it.

799
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:38,800
$30.

800
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,540
You spent more than that in the dealer's room today.

801
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,840
You spent more than that in the dealer's room today.

802
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,960
If you spend $30, you will be saved.

803
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,680
Not only will you just be spared the torment of being burned alive for weeks on end,

804
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:03,760
you will also get to go to the saucers with the sex goddesses or sex gods of that church.

805
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,960
And if all you've ever been dreaming about doing is missing Tracy Lawrence,

806
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,760
you can have that.

807
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,780
Whatever it is that you want, you can have for $30.

808
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,300
And the great thing about it is it doesn't just apply to you.

809
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,480
So you know that great chick that you've been banging?

810
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,620
Because if she doesn't have $30 paid for her, she's going to burn too.

811
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,340
Because everyone will burn.

812
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,200
So what happens then?

813
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,000
Well, you better pay your girls $30.

814
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,160
Because then you can share a saucer.

815
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,380
And you can share a sex goddess.

816
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,240
And guys, you know you've thought about that.

817
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,540
You and your girl share on a sex goddess.

818
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,280
You know you want it to.

819
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,240
But let's say maybe you're not into that, you know?

820
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,500
Because I don't care what you're into.

821
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,340
Maybe you're into, you know, your dog Fluffy.

822
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,620
If that's what you're into, that's fine.

823
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,540
But if you don't pay your $30 for Fluffy, Fluffy burns too.

824
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,920
And if you're willing to let Fluffy burn, I don't know.

825
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,760
Maybe we should get Fluffy.

826
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,180
Maybe we should get you to go hang out with Mike Vick.

827
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,340
So this is what we're here to tell you about.

828
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,000
I know you want to see stuff in that.

829
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,820
The truth of the matter is that they have to register in a while.

830
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,700
So you guys think.

831
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,120
It could be worse.

832
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,160
It could.

833
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,980
Why don't you play some music?

834
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,320
You're a DJ, right?

835
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,680
You're a DJ like every DJ there ever was.

836
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,240
Who's convinced that his...

837
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,900
His mix is the hottest thing ever.

838
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,100
And it will be the hottest thing ever when the X's come and he burns.

839
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,360
Oh, really?

840
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,280
Really?

841
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:55,900
You know what?

842
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,800
You guys are nothing like some genius hecklers.

843
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,660
I gotta tell you that.

844
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,600
I really do.

845
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,260
I want...

846
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,380
It's like, I'm going to give Bob a gift.

847
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,600
Because he's so funny.

848
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,160
Yeah.

849
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,480
That's so fucking weird.

850
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,020
Yeah, right?

851
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,800
Oh, it's fucked up.

852
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:10,880
It's fucked up.

853
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,480
Oh, you did that?

854
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:11,760
And what?

855
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,320
Oh, yeah, sure.

856
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,080
Oh, yeah, yeah.

857
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,020
Dude, I was in.

858
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,960
I drank the Kool-Aid.

859
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,020
From the dark.

860
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:16,620
Alert.

861
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,700
And the end.

862
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,360
Bob.

863
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,400
It's Bob.

864
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,120
And...

865
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,900
Alert.

866
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,440
And...

867
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,180
And...

868
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,640
Alert.

869
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,200
Alert.

870
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,100
And...

871
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,800
And...

872
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,480
And...

873
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,020
And...

874
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,440
And...

875
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,620
And...

876
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,620
And...

877
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:34,820
And...

878
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,760
Please do that sex with me.

879
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:39,660
And...

880
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:39,900
And...

881
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,320
And...

882
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,420
And...

883
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:40,440
Alert.

884
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,440
Fuck Bob Dobbs by Reverend Heart Ignition.

885
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:59,220
Before that, the Kool-Aid clip was from Reverend Royal Decapitator.

886
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:06,020
And the live rant with a big crowd was Priestess Pisces at Dragon Con

887
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,940
preaching about the church and Tracy Lords and Pinks

888
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,980
against a tide of the latter, actually.

889
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,600
Lee Murr did PR News.

890
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:23,800
The children's book was Evolution Control Committee and Ministry of Slack at 14X Day.

891
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,140
And other collages were by, going backwards in time,

892
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,740
Reverend Decapitator the Large,

893
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,000
Reverend Sweetness McGee of Ministry of Slack,

894
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,220
Jason Myrek,

895
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,560
and the nursery rhymes business was Dr. Hal Philo and I at 12X Day,

896
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,180
or one of those X Days.

897
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,300
The background music, by the way, right now is from Devo,

898
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:56,700
the musical-only tracks from their latest album, Without the Vocals.

899
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,100
And now, a segment about titties.

900
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:04,720
Oh, and thanks to Reverend Abnorm Nihill for that Devo.

901
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,540
Thank you.

902
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:06,540


903
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:11,900
This segment about titties, I mean breasts or teats,

904
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,220
starts with Radio Synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland,

905
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,300
right after Hour of Slack.

906
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:28,700
Two songs about titties will follow by Rodney Carrington and the Psychoskeletons.

907
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:34,060
You know, one of my memories of, actually one of my memories of Chaz,

908
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,320
is probably,

909
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,520
I have a lot of memories hearing the Hour of Slack tonight.

910
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,840
Stuff from 2002.

911
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,900
Yeah, that was a real emotion-packed one, if you were...

912
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,020
And, you know, 2002 was actually the first year I went to X Day.

913
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,080
Wow.

914
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,360
But one of my fond memories of Chaz was him,

915
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,420
he showed me like this live footage of a Skinner concert from the old days,

916
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,100
and it was outdoors, and he like pointed to the front row in front of the stage

917
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,200
with all these young topless chicks jiggling their titties back and forth,

918
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:04,540
and he said,

919
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:04,640
he said,

920
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,680
that right there, that is what rock and roll was all about.

921
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,600
Praise God.

922
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,640
Hey, I'll reveal to you the punchline,

923
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,860
the ultimate end sentence, you might say,

924
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,240
of my rant at Starwood to the pagans,

925
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,560
was, I actually borrowed this from our friend Mr. Sister,

926
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,960
but the line was,

927
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,700
you know, people ask me what I really believe.

928
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,660
Stang, you must believe in Satan.

929
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,420
We know you don't believe in magic,

930
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,240
but what do you believe in?

931
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,320
Well, I believe that I would really enjoy

932
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,960
crawling across an ocean of titties on my belly.

933
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,920
Okay, I might like that too.

934
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,240
I had women were coming up to me all day today,

935
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,640
quoting that to me.

936
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,800
They'd like this wheelchair.

937
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,280
They love it.

938
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,320
And I would love it.

939
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,480
And when that day comes,

940
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,460
that dream will come true,

941
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,180
the ocean of titties,

942
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,480
the bare belly crawling across it.

943
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,960
My friend, anything you can imagine,

944
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,600
anything there.

945
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,260
I promise it's true.

946
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,880
Yes, dear friends.

947
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,980
Mr. Sister, what have you started?

948
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,340
Oh, shit.

949
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,100
What'd you say?

950
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,080
Love you.

951
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,600
I love you.

952
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,320
I don't know if I love you,

953
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,020
but you sound like somebody I could love.

954
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,880
You know, drunk and horny.

955
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:37,880
And I love that.

956
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,180
Oh, it seems to me this whole world's gone crazy.

957
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,140
There's too much hate and killing going on.

958
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,980
But when I see the bare chest of a woman,

959
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,960
my worries and my problems

960
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,800
are all gone.

961
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,120
No one thinks of fighting

962
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,680
when they see a topless girl.

963
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,040
Maybe if you would show yours too,

964
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,020
we could save the world.

965
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,520
Show them to me.

966
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,440
Show them to me.

967
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,980
Unclasp your bra and set those puppies free.

968
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,000
They'd look all right.

969
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,000


970
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,020
They'd look a lot better without that sweater, baby.

971
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,500
I'm Ceriola Gray.

972
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,760
Baby, you got two fun facts.

973
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,980
God bless you, woman.

974
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,440
Show them to me.

975
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,200
I don't care if they don't match

976
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,380
or one's bigger than the other.

977
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,020
You can show me one,

978
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,760
and I'll imagine the other.

979
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,120
Even if you're really old,

980
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,040
there's nothing wrong.

981
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,600
Don't be sad, your boobs ain't bad.

982
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,480
They're just a little long.

983
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,960
Show them to me.

984
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,300
Show them to me.

985
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:21,560
Lift up your shirt and let the whole world see.

986
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,640
Just this wrong.

987
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,620
Show your clothes and a happy man I'll be.

988
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,020
And if you got dos chichis,

989
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,880
which is Spanish for two titties,

990
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,160
and I think we just love two Spanish titties.

991
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,960
Show them to me.

992
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,280
I've met a lot of them,

993
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,580
but never one I've hated.

994
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,220
Even if you've had thirteen kids

995
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,260
and you think they look deflated,

996
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,500
there's no such thing as a bad breast.

997
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,640
I believe this much is true.

998
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,000
If you're a big boy,

999
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,840
I'm a big fat man,

1000
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,840
I'm a titty fan,

1001
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,400
and I'd love to see yours too.

1002
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,800
Show them to me.

1003
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,080
Show them to me.

1004
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,660
Just like the girls gone wild on TV.

1005
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,680
Just lean back and show your act,

1006
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,320
and I'll be in ecstasy.

1007
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,320
If you got two cassavas,

1008
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,700
show them to me.

1009
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,660
Come on baby, let me see

1010
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,160
all the world live in harmony.

1011
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,940
It'll do you good,

1012
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,100
and it'll give me what

1013
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,880
will make history.

1014
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,640
If you love your country.

1015
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,620
I'm gonna say it one more time.

1016
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,100
I said if you love your country.

1017
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,240
Dallas, Texas,

1018
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,500
do you love your country?

1019
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,760
And you stand your ass up

1020
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,700
and show them big old titties to me.

1021
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,300
Ah, woo, boo, boo, woo, woo, woo.

1022
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,160
My God.

1023
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,600
I'd like to shake your daddy's hand.

1024
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,380
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1025
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,140
These tits were made for milking.

1026
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,380
Milk right in your face.

1027
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,740
One of these days,

1028
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,860
these tits are gonna milk right in your face.

1029
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,040
in your face.

1030
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,480
I'm glad you

1031
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,500
respect me

1032
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,240
enough to

1033
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,600
call my bluff.

1034
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,840
Chip off

1035
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,840
the old shoulder.

1036
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:13,760
A3

1037
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,400
calls lovely.

1038
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,540
I'm glad

1039
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,460
you respect

1040
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,260
me enough

1041
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,520
to call my

1042
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,340
bluff.

1043
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,100
Cute

1044
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,200
curiosity.

1045
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:31,580
The

1046
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:32,920
present has

1047
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,940
ended.

1048
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:37,340
Here

1049
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,160
is a poem

1050
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,520
for any women

1051
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,220
who may be

1052
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,560
listening right

1053
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,120
now.

1054
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,820
Don't bang the cable

1055
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,880
guy. Not even if

1056
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,280
he's a Greek man

1057
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,680
or a Portuguese.

1058
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,340
Geese don't bang

1059
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,340
the cable guy.

1060
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,400
Not even if he's a swirly

1061
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,500
Italian or a

1062
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,440
Spaniard. Don't

1063
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,840
bang the cable guy.

1064
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,040
But if it's a black dude,

1065
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,340
go for it.

1066
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,360
Keep me out

1067
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,840
of your

1068
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,660
revolution.

1069
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,740
Cause today's the day

1070
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,360
the teddy bears have their

1071
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,100
picnic.

1072
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,140
Oh, and what

1073
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,020
teddy bears. That one,

1074
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,640
meat on meat anti-manifesto

1075
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,680
was by the Psychoskeletons.

1076
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,660
And the previous song,

1077
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,680
Show Them To Me,

1078
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,480
was by a

1079
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,220
Rodney Carrington.

1080
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,200
A Carrington with a C

1081
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,520
and two R's, which we

1082
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,580
copped from a YouTube

1083
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,720
video. Next, a little

1084
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,800
story from Reverend Sweetness

1085
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,160
McGee's razor.

1086
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,380
And then some live

1087
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,240
14X Day Drill

1088
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,440
double teaming.

1089
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,900
Tell me a story.

1090
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,860
Tell me a story.

1091
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,640
Tell me a story.

1092
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,500
Blood and blood.

1093
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,320
Tell me a story.

1094
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,380
Tell me a story and

1095
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:15,900
blood.

1096
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,000
A story?

1097
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,540
Sure, I would be glad to tell you a story.

1098
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,700
Then wash your hands with soap.

1099
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,180
Right at this minute,

1100
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,520
the finger of death

1101
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,600
is pointing at their little family circle.

1102
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,140
And the sad thing about it is

1103
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,840
they do not know it.

1104
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,220
I'm sick.

1105
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,980
Got to be careful that I don't hurt it.

1106
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,540
Then wash your hands with soap.

1107
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,560
Is it a lie?

1108
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,620
What on earth?

1109
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,280
There. You'll die.

Get that sharp butcher knife and hold it in the fire.

1151
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:07,560
Why?

1152
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,280
Hold it in the fire, Betty.

1153
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,320
We have to get it hot until the germs are burned off.

1154
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,280
Then wash your hands with soap.

1155
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,640
Betty, give me the knife.

1156
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,200
Now hold still, Billy, and don't try to pull away.

1157
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,820
I've got to do it.

1158
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,100
There's no other way.

1159
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,640
Die, die, die, die.

1160
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,000
Is he dead, Mother?

1161
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,200
Yes, he's dead.

1162
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:34,860
He's dead, poor fellow.

1163
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,680
Put my mouth on the wound and suck out all the blood.

1164
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,400
Now do you see why I told you to wash your hands with soap?

1165
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,840
Yes, I do now, now that it's too late.

1166
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,580
Then wash your hands with soap right now.

1167
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,380
This is the legend of an unsung subgenius folk hero.

1168
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,620
Some of you who have been in the chats might remember it.

1169
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,780
It is the legend of Zappy McPeepy.

1170
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:08,380
Zappy McPeepy meant no offense when he took a pee on his neighbor's fence.

1171
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:13,220
But his neighbor had grown tired of the stinky stains and electrified that fencing chain.

1172
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,880
Zappy McPeepy got quite a jolt as his urine turned to thunderbolts.

1173
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:22,360
And everybody says, but nobody ever looks, that Zappy McPeepy's wieners cooked.

1174
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,660
With his fence-pissing days well in the past, some children came to him and asked,

1175
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,700
Old Zappy, is your wiener burnt and crisp?

1176
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,060
Then Zappy's smile made a funny.

1177
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:39,720
And out from his pants a burnt sausage fell that made the chillin' scream and yell.

1178
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,860
And with the kids off his lawn and the wind at his back, Zappy picked it up and he had a snack.

1179
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,080
Old Zappy had a secret he never did tell.

1180
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:53,040
But if you stood near enough his house, you'd smell some sausage crisping in the pan.

1181
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,320
That Zappy always was a mischievous man.

1182
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,380
Zappy's dick didn't have much girth or punch.

1183
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,400
But to hear some tell it did have crunch.

1184
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,060
That Zappy McPeepy does get around.

1185
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,920
With a grin and a shuffle and a faint sizzling sound.

1186
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,260
Old Zappy McPeepy meant no offense when he whizzed upon his neighbor's fence.

1187
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:17,220
But the thunder left up to his dick and Zappy, somehow, he made it stick.

1188
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,060
Morose or Dr. Holocaust?

1189
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,420
And the drugs they give you are so powerful that you wake up going,

1190
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,180
I went, where am I?

1191
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,140
Cleveland.

1192
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,080
Why?

1193
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:36,860
Yeah.

1194
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,440
Bob.

1195
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,140
You're so vulnerable in a weird way.

1196
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,580
It is so fucking insanely powerful drug.

1197
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,920
I can't date these humans.

1198
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:49,680
They're disgusting with their skin and their, their lives.

1199
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:56,400
But they have this weird like thousand yard, you know, post acid stare that just burns into your fucking soul.

1200
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,620
Yeah.

1201
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,100
They are so touching.

1202
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:34,100

Woodward.

1210
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:48,880

00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:19,380

1228
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:34,180
Friends, that was the Evolution Control Committee as redone by the

1229
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:38,220
DJ Two Beans, who is also heard in the background.

1230
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:46,520
He took the piece that was recorded by Evolution Control Committee at 14X Day,

1231
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:52,980
recorded by Frodo Shaw, and did more to it.

1232
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:53,960
That's all I know.

1233
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,660
That's DJ Two Beans in the background.

1234
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,700
And now, what?

1235
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:33,520
DJ Two Beans, who is also heard in the background.

1236
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:03,780
DJ Two Beans, who is also heard in the background.

1237
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,000
Open your mind.

1238
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,700
The human centipede.

1239
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,100
The human centipede.

1240
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:04,160
The human centipede.

1241
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:33,700
The human centipede.

1242
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:44,940
The human centipede.

1243
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,160
The human centipede.

1244
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:13,520
The human centipede.

1245
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:21,220
The human centipede.

1246
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,140
The human centipede.

1247
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,840
Priestess Pisces

1248
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,880
and Saint Byron Werner

1249
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,160
try to figure out how to end the show

1250
01:04:55,160 --> 01:05:00,400
and whether I'll need my ride from the station to bed.

1251
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,260
Praise Bob.

1252
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:09,040
I think that Stang is going to have to escape ever so briefly

1253
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,740
unless, of course...

1254
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,000
Unless my ride is listening to the radio.

1255
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,600
But what are the odds?

1256
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,560
Right, right.

1257
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,060
Actually, yeah, there are some odds against it.

1258
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,400
Oh!

1259
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:25,960
Oh, no!

1260
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,320
I'm sorry, somebody should keep talking.

1261
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,180
Somebody should keep talking while we're on the...

1262
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,000
No, no, everything's going everywhere

1263
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,940
and there's...

1264
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,060
But the workmen are here

1265
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:40,500
and they'll put everything back in place in the proper order.

1266
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:40,920
They'd better.

1267
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,240
That's what they always say.

1268
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,060
And they're going to clean up after they're done, right?

1269
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,240
They're spilling stuff all over the place.

1270
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:46,500
They always leave that.

1271
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,040
There's a greasy outline where the body fluid soaked into the carpet

1272
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,340
because we didn't clean it up right away.

1273
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,840
Well, you have to.

1274
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,420
And they have to do it every 108 minutes.

1275
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:57,900
Mm-hmm.

1276
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,900
I've told...

1277
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,580
You know, as far as the cleaning up the blood,

1278
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:02,120
I mean, I don't know, you know?

1279
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,020
It's not the blood.

1280
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,040
There's some other goo.

1281
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,540
I'll tell them where to go.

1282
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,360
Excuse me, I have to go tell somebody where to go.

1283
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:11,960
She's really good at that.

1284
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:12,620
She really is.

1285
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,880
You know, I usually do that, but it's okay.

1286
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:16,480
That can be done by someone else.

1287
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,500
And, oh, look, there are...

1288
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,220
You know what?

1289
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:19,460
It only gets worse from here.

1290
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,720
Sometimes I don't have to tell people where to go.

1291
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,460
I can just kind of raise one finger and show them where to go.

1292
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,140
If you're very careful, you can raise one eyebrow,

1293
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,620
and that one eyebrow will go up with a look.

1294
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:33,300
Yeah, and the person that had the best eyebrow control,

1295
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,380
as far as I'm concerned, is Greta Garbo.

1296
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,200
Oh, yeah.

1297
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,520
Much better than John Belucci.

1298
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,900
I don't even want to mention John Belucci in the same breath,

1299
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:40,900
but I already did, so...

1300
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,560
Oh, too late.

1301
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,060
What are you going to do?

1302
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:43,160
Too late.

1303
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:43,900
Too late.

1304
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,280
Yeah.

1305
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,580
There's a lot of subgeniuses who have the eyebrows.

1306
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,680
There's a lot of eyebrow control as well.

1307
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,380
You can sort of see it across the room.

1308
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,720
Probably not Garbo fans, I'm guessing.

1309
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:53,920
Well, you know, there are some.

1310
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:54,660
I don't know.

1311
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:58,220
I mean, it's a very strange group we are

1312
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,780
with our different thoughts and different imaginings.

1313
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,760
Yeah, they're probably more Gummo fans than they are Garbo fans.

1314
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:06,440
Well, yeah.

1315
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,260
I don't mean Gummo Marks either.

1316
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:14,160
Look, he's got Gummo Marks all over him.

1317
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1318
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,740
Gummo was filmed in Ohio.

1319
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,700
Typical Ohio neighborhood.

1320
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,480
I love Ohio.

1321
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,320
There was Groucho film.

1322
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,600
I really absolutely adore Ohio.

1323
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,860
I have no desire to live there.

1324
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,300
I like the part where it's round on the ends, you know?

1325
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,280
High in the middle.

1326
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,280
High in the middle and round on the ends.

1327
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:37,620
Because my first experience with Ohio was Youngstown,

1328
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,840
it sort of burned it up for me.

1329
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,300
I understand that they've got a couple of cows in Ohio,

1330
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:46,800
somewhere.

1331
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,180
Isn't it the state bird?

1332
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:51,760
No, that's the Buckeye.

1333
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:53,600
Ah, yeah, you're right.

1334
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1335
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:57,360
I still think that's a very high price for an eyeball.

1336
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,960
I find the Buckeye is interesting because it's not edible, is it?

1337
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,860
I don't even know.

1338
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,080
Eyeballs are edible.

1339
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,000
I don't think it's edible.

1340
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:11,560
And it's like worshipped as if it were Jesus' nut.

1341
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:12,920
Hmm.

1342
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,400
Ah, is it Sunday already?

1343
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,420
Yeah, actually it is.

1344
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,020
It is.

1345
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,460
It is indeed Sunday already.

1346
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:26,740
And since it's Sunday, we're in church here at WREK and sort of in...

1347
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:28,840
The Church of the Left Nut, is that what it is?

1348
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,440
No, this is part of Bob's slack time.

1349
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,300
The Right Nut.

1350
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,680
The Right Nut for the job.

1351
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:36,340
Right.

1352
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:36,740
Yeah.

1353
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,820
The Left Nut to just...

1354
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,040
The Left Nut...

1355
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,460
I don't got anything for that one.

1356
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:42,920
You know...

1357
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,760
Left Nut was left.

1358
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,260
There's a series of head and nut jokes.

1359
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,560
That I just can't run with.

1360
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,220
I just can't...

1361
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,820
I don't have anything for it.

1362
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:50,920
It's best.

1363
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:51,740
It's really...

1364
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:52,560
It's best that way.

1365
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:58,240
Well, I was thinking that you could show a triple bill of the movie's monkey...

1366
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:07,200
The monkey's movie, Head, with the Blaxploitation film, Shaft, and the Barbara Streisand film, Nuts.

1367
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:10,300
And have a pretty good program there.

1368
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,460
It'd be a long showing, I'm sure.

1369
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:15,060
It would be like five, six hours.

1370
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:15,900
Well, you know...

1371
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:22,040
Right now, ladies and gentlemen, I know you're thinking about it, but mashing that up would be just fine.

1372
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,840
I think you better do it in that order, though.

1373
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:27,860
Right, right, right, right.

1374
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:29,400
You don't want to have nuts first.

1375
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,900
Well, it depends.

1376
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,360
I mean, if you start out that way...

1377
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,500
Why do people pick on me like this?

1378
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:35,420
I don't know.

1379
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:36,080
I was going to ask you.

1380
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,660
Yeah, no, Charlie Brown used to say that.

1381
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:42,420
You know, who walked in the classroom cool and slow, who called the teacher Daddy-O?

1382
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,580
Charlie Brown, he's a clown.

1383
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:45,060
I think...

1384
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:45,400
I think...

1385
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,960
Why is everybody always picking on me?

1386
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:56,060
From PR News in Washington, I'm growing more violent as the FBI investigates the attempted Bloody Cock block.

1387
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:59,620
Troops fired rubber at crowds of protesters near a cock park.

1388
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:07,220
Authorities have been demanding cock for weeks, but the demonstrators want to be shot in the cock, possibly by a renegade army officer.

1389
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:11,760
PR's agents fanned out across three search warrants this morning.

1390
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,800
The investigation has led agents to the PR News.

1391
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,020
Home of the 101st Division.

1392
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,700
Hawaii's governor has signed a bill saying this is PR.

1393
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,620
Hawaii's state officials say they can ignore PR News.

1394
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:30,240
Today, the Labor Department dropped by a fourth to a seasonally adjusted 4.9 per 4,000.

1395
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:36,200
At least 41 people arrested in the riots that broke out after PR.

1396
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:37,880
Like.

1397
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,340
Like.

1398
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,020
Like.

1399
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:39,620
Like.

1400
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:40,220
Like.

1401
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:40,760
Like.

1402
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,300
Like.

1403
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:41,880
Like.

1404
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:42,280
Like.

1405
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:42,500
Like.

1406
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:42,820
Like.

1407
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,380
Like.
