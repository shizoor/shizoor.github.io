00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack, and saint of Satan, on Planet Planet Planet Planet Planet.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:19,300
You have to love Bob. He loves you, but you love Bob. You have to.

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,060
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

4
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,740
He'll kill you. He'll Bob you out.

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:33,240
He'll Bob you out, folks. You heard it here first. If you don't love Bob, he'll Bob you out, man.

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:47,120
You are letting yourself go. A little more. And a little more.

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,160
Every nerve. Every tongue.

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,780
90.90.0. F-ing.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,560
And down.

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,380
That's Texas.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,800
You just yelled to it.

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,740
No, no, no.

13
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,700
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sets adjusted.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,180
We're having operating difficulties, which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our Sunday movie.

15
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,720
It's a success.

16
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,420
It's a wonderful life.

17
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,540
It's a wonderful life.

18
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,880
We live so wonderful life.

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,260
We live so wonderful life.

20
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,040
We live so wonderful life.

21
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,840
We live so wonderful life.

22
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,220
No trouble.

23
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,800
Get set.

24
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,480
Get going.

25
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,060
Amen.

26
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,460
Recording.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,540
Everything's going fine.

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,320
No trouble.

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,680
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,380
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,520
I have Bob's luggage!

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,100
Bob?

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,500
Bob?

34
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,180
Bob?

35
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,300
Bob?

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,660
That's your key phrase.

37
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,380
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:13,180
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

39
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,740
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:25,620
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.

41
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,580
With Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

42
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,280
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

43
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:44,020
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack, and saint of silence on planet Earth.

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,700
Are we controlled by secret forces?

45
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,780
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

46
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,000
Do people think you're strange?

47
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,420
Do you?

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,860
Then you may be on the right track.

49
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,320
Are you abnormal?

50
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,060
Then you are probably better than most people.

51
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,040
Yes, your time shall triumph.

52
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,380
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,420
This is it.

54
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,760
The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

55
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,840
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,500
Stand erect for your own.

57
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,620
Have normality.

58
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,980
Bob is a way of life to millions.

59
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,360
Yet half of them don't even know it.

60
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:40,740
He's the one true living Slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

61
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,360
He is the one real shortcut to Slack.

62
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,580
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

63
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,640
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

64
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,500
Become physically attractive overnight.

65
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,800
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

66
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,500
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

67
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,460
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

68
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,040
And coming right back.

69
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,980
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

70
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:25,620
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormal behavior.

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,480
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

72
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,680
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.

73
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,240
That will fool normals and get you sex.

74
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,500
Bob!

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,840
Bob!

76
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,160

Bob!

120
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,240
Thank you.

121
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,720
Thank you.

122
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,820
Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

131
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,560
That was horrible.

132
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,180
I've never been smoked by dogs.

133
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,140
Oh, we're back in Rock and Roll Hill now.

134
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,760
Oh, no.

135
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,400
Is this Rock and Roll Hill?

136
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,100
Oh, man.

137
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,420
I always get stuck here at 2 in the morning.

138
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,680
Rock and Roll Hill.

139
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,480
Get down.

140
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,080
Party.

141
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,200
Shoot up.

142
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,400
Praise Satan.

143
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,020
Rock and Roll Hill.

144
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,400
Yeah, yeah.

145
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,320
Rock and Roll Hill.

146
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,780
Go out and kill some kids tonight.

147
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,460
Rock and Roll smells like body roll.

148
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,160
Rock and Roll Hill.

149
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,000
Be destroyed.

150
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,160
Destroy your life.

151
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,060
Praise Satan and Rock and Roll Hill.

152
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,940
Rock and Roll.

153
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,160
Sex.

154
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,020
Drugs and alcohol.

155
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,680
DJs on this show.

156
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,340
Corruption.

Here is a special editorial.

Cause you ain't no twit.

197
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,880
You ain't no twit.

198
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,040
Yeah.

199
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,640
Yeah.

200
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,160
Step out of your clothes.

201
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,320
Girl, step into hoes.

202
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,980
You'll be the latest hit.

203
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,820
The latest hit, yeah.

204
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,700
It's about time to let my hormones wake up.

205
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,100
Put off the homework.

206
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,160
Let's put on the makeup.

207
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,040
Don't wait a second.

208
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,340
Cause you'll stay in limbo.

209
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,940
I give my old stuff to my sister, that bimbo.

210
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,080
When I wear underwear, I'm liberated.

211
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,720
It's like the movies, M-I-V-G.

212
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,680
Or X-rated.

213
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,420
I dance just like a virgin in these clothes.

214
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,300
I hold my belly, but the lip won't show.

215
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,120
Step into this league.

216
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,000
Start being a tease.

217
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,920
Hey, you ain't no nerd.

218
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,800
You ain't no nerd, yeah.

219
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Step into the streets.

220
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,800
Put guys into heat.

221
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,800
Be a little flirt.

222
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,120
A little flirt, yeah.

223
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,220
Wanna get to dress up.

224
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,040
Move around and prance.

225
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,700
Wanna get in front.

226
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,620
All my fans dance.

227
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,920
Don't try to fight it.

228
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,600
Cause your fist is really you.

229
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,620
Just burst your lips.

230
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,600
And flare your nostrils too.

231
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,680
I must be dreaming.

232
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,360
This is just too cool.

233
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,440
Cause in real life, I rip my lips and then I drool.

234
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,580
I really love in the life I wanna.

235
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,620
It feels so good to be a prima donna.

236
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,920
Step into the streets.

237
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,560
Girl, do you watch it?

238
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:32,940
Please.

239
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,840
Now you're not a wimp.

240
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,640
You're not a wimp, yeah.

241
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,900
Step into the lights.

242
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,480
You know it's alright.

243
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,480
If you wanna rip.

244
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,940
You can't rip, yeah.

245
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,460
You can take your mind where it wants to go.

246
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,440
Tell the boys to come.

247
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,500
Or tell the boys to blow.

248
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,260
Whether I'm awake or if it's a dream.

249
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,100
I can make my life feel like a magazine.

250
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,160
Step into this league.

251
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,200
Girl, do what you please.

252
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,080
Cause you ain't no twit.

253
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,880
You ain't no twit, yeah.

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,960
Step into the beat.

255
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,800
Put guys into heat.

256
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,880
You're the latest hit.

257
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,660
The latest hit, yeah.

258
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,060
When I start to strut, I wanna squish my nose.

259
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,620
My body really sweats, but hey, that's how it goes.

260
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,720
I'm in a world like Hammer Girl.

261
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,940
It's simple.

262
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,640
I'm never going back to clear or fill and purple.

263
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,280
You can take your mind where it wants to go.

264
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,240
Tell the boys to come.

265
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,320
Or tell the boys to blow.

266
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,120
Whether I'm awake or if it's a dream.

267
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,860
I can make my life feel like a magazine.

268
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,760
Be like a magazine.

269
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,680
Be like a magazine.

270
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,660
Oh, yes, dear friends.

271
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,680
You can be like that.

272
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,680
You can be like that magazine, I suppose.

273
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,660
This is the horrible Madonna parody.

274
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,980
I might as well tell you what's going on here, friends.

275
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,320
This is gonna be a real hip show.

276
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,660
This was real cool a few months ago, I suppose.

277
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,640
Madonna parody here from Reverend Bleepo Abernathy up with the Hour of Slack show in Boston.

278
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:28,440
A little bit before that and after this, the Serious Abuse radio show from...

279
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,240
The Rat Cave, dear friends.

280
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,840
We'll be going back to that.

281
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,760
But in the meantime, friends, draft registration.

282
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,020
You do have a choice.

283
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,800
Do you have alternatives to military service?

284
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,100
I did, flat feet.

285
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,360
But you may have others.

286
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:55,000
Talk to one of the trained draft counselors at the War Resisters League for an evaluation of your particular situation.

287
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,600
It'll cost you nothing to learn the facts, folks.

288
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,020
Remember, know the facts before you make your decision.

289
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,700
For draft counseling, call 214-421-1984.

290
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,040
That's a good number there for a draft counselor.

291
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,640
421-1984.

292
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,960
I was number 30 in the lottery.

293
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,460
And they didn't believe any of the lies I told them until finally they looked at my feet and said,

294
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,920
Son, sorry.

295
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,580
Just two flat-footed folks.

296
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,500
I'm sorry for this man's army.

297
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,080
But friends, this is the subgenius hour of slack in Dallas, Texas.

298
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,740
And sorry, the phone lines aren't working tonight.

299
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,060
So we can't take your prayer requests right now.

300
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,660
I mean, they just flat out aren't working, friends.

301
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,600
You're going to have to...

302
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,100
They're trying.

303
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:44,840
They're trying.

304
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,400
But you're going to have to pray.

305
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,500
You're going to have to, you know, put something important in an important place and think about it and pray.

306
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,580
And say things like...

307
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,540
Oh, Dobbs head.

308
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,280
Silly pills, Bob Slack.

309
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,040
I want my pills.

310
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,440
Some devil works for me.

311
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,440
Give me your pills.

312
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,180
Bob pills, Bob pills, Slack Bob.

313
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,000
Give me pills, Bob.

314
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,900
Yes, that's the misconceptions of many subgeni.

315
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,060
That's your typical pink boy pretending to be subgenius.

316
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,800
Yes, he paid his $20.

317
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,520
His money was green, but he was still pink inside.

318
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,460
Yes.

319
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,260
It's a pathetic thing to watch.

320
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,800
He tries to quote all the slang that he got from the books.

321
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,540
Hey, pull the wool over your own eyes, guys.

322
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,640
Hey, yeah.

323
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,020
Yeah, you'd pay to know what you really think.

324
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,460
Oh, yeah, like repent and quit your job and slack off.

325
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,680
Yeah, really cool.

326
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,420
Do something to them if they can't take a joke.

327
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:42,980
What was that?

328
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,320
Let me open it back up here.

329
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,940
Oh, wow, man.

330
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,160
Like, are we punk rock, man?

331
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,320
I thought it was punk to talk about Bob.

332
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,200
I thought it was like cool or something to talk about Bob.

333
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,400
Hey, we ought to hassle the clerk at best because she's a capitalist, man.

334
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,920
Hey, you believe in anarchy, man?

335
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,840
Well, if you don't, I'm going to kill you.

336
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,940
Kill you, kill you, kill you.

337
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,560
We'll show you punk rock.

338
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,000
You thought it was hair and clothes.

339
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,640
You thought it was like big spikes and bracelets and leather and stuff.

340
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Yeah, you thought punk rock came from a record company.

341
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,220
You thought wrong.

342
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,120
You thought it was like...

343
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,760
You are God participating in himself, just me.

344
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,940
Man, this guy's...

345
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,200
Wow, this guy's a real prophet.

346
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,780
Elder God may not be all that correct.

347
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,160
He's a surdeu for Sam, for sure.

348
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,440
They find more dominance when tomorrow becomes today.

349
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,760
Responsible for this.

350
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,300
All right, enough of this silliness.

351
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,060
Yes.

352
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,500
Say goodnight, Stank.

353
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,420
Ah, yes, friends.

354
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,980
I'm all hooked up.

355
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,140
I'm ready to answer your questions.

356
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:02,860
Now, we've been getting letters and phone calls from noble subgeniuses out there asking,

357
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,800
Reverend Stank, how can I be more subversive?

358
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:14,840
How can I be of more service to Bob in bringing down the conspiracy that enslaves us?

359
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,440
And friends, I'm afraid that that is entirely up to you.

360
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,140
Now, the conspiracy will tell you how to be more subversive.

361
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,820
And I'm not going to be aggressive against it.

362
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,860
So we sure won't.

363
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,900
But I can give you one helpful hint, friends.

364
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,980
There's nothing wrong with looking normal.

365
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,820
If you want to be more subversive, friends, you don't have to show off about it.

366
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:51,420
If you wear a uniform like a high-fashion punk haircut or leather and spandex and whatever,

367
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,360
unless it's really extreme, friends,

368
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,040
you're just playing along with the conspiracy,

369
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,820
joining a conformity of nonconformists.

370
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,340
You're labeling yourself as someone who the conspiracy doesn't really need to worry about

371
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,900
because you're going to follow a predictable pattern,

372
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,040
one that they've co-opted already.

373
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,960
But what kind of subversion are we talking about anyway, friends?

374
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,280
Bringing down the state?

375
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,480
Blowing up polluters?

376
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,120
Nay, nay.

377
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,080
That only kills people, friends, and gets you in jail to boot.

378
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,440
It's stupid, but not stupid in the right way.

379
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,140
Bob said, Bob said,

380
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,080
Thou shalt kill none but me.

381
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,720
Unless they're literally about to kill you or if they insult your ancestors.

382
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,080
That's what Bob said.

383
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,220
And, you know, there's nothing wrong with technology, friends.

384
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,080
We don't need to subvert technology.

385
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,340
After all, only technology is the only thing we've got to do.

386
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,020
We've got to clean up the mess we already made.

387
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,660
So who are we trying to subvert?

388
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,980
The Republicans?

389
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,020
Huh.

390
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,800
Friends, an awful lot of subgeniuses are Republicans.

391
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:13,000
But, you know, subgenius doesn't mean left-wing pinko or right-wing anything.

392
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:20,120
All it means to most of us is patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism, friends.

393
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,900
Every yard a kingdom.

394
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,760
Every child and dog a serf.

395
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,300
It doesn't matter what party is in control,

396
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,980
as long as none of the parties really have that much control over how much you party.

397
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,760
Besides, what you're fighting ain't just a political system.

398
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,420
I mean, as political systems go, the U.S. is one of the least evil.

399
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,480
Just as Jesus is okay.

400
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,780
It's just that some members of his fan club make him look bad.

401
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,720
Same goes with Bob and the Bobbies.

402
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,940
Surely some of you have met nerds on the street who started trying to talk Bob at you and you were just embarrassed.

403
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,320
Well, friends, see, the conspiracy is a great combination of things.

404
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,320
Work is one of the main ones.

405
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,020
That's how you're really controlled, friends.

406
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,400
You have to work for someone else to make a living.

407
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,980
Now, this subgenius actually likes to work at what he likes to work at.

408
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,440
But that's the rub and the bub, my friend.

409
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,240
The conspiracy is also ancient customs and new invented customs.

410
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,240
It's a whole background attitude.

411
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,080
The conspiracy is an attitude.

412
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,440
An attitude of hatred for anything weird.

413
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,720
So what you want to subvert, friend, is that attitude.

414
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,920
Now, some strange things are bad.

415
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,420
But all great inventions and ideas started out as strange ones.

416
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,780
So if you want to subvert the government or some manufacturer or blow buildings up,

417
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,500
that's just what the conspiracy wants you to do, my friend, so they can catch you,

418
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,820
make you look like a kook in front of millions.

419
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,460
Now, history proves that every time you overthrow something overnight,

420
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,700
ditch some old government, what replaces it always ends up just as bad.

421
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,260
We have to break that cycle, friends, and this isn't anarchy we're talking about.

422
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,780
Anarchy is just another political system.

423
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,740
Just like atheism is just another religion.

424
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,520
To truly subvert, my friend, you work alone at your own pace, casually,

425
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:33,000
but with alertness to subvert the attitude of hating everything weird.

426
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,500
Remember, leftists are just as guilty as rightists in this respect.

427
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,900
And you don't go out subverting by being an obnoxious, bobby,

428
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,900
enforcing weirdness down the throats of normals who can't possibly appreciate it anyway.

429
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,880
That just makes them hate weirdness more.

430
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,980
You should seduce them with abnormality, my friend.

431
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,840
You have to break them in a little at a time. It depends.

432
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,580
And you can't indiscriminately hate all normals,

433
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,180
because that only proves that you are a normal yourself,

434
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:11,460
because you don't understand yet that half of what you call normals are actually weirder than you are.

435
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,180
A

436
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,660
goes

437
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,760
11

438
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:48,760


439
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,940
8

440
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,520
Cause they're laying down the walls

441
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,940
I've been before so many times

442
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,760
I can't remember them all

443
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,480
And I say

444
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,340
Who do you want to be today?

445
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,080
Who do you want to be?

446
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,820
Who do you want to be today?

447
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,640
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

448
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Just like somebody on TV

449
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,400
I think I'll be a teddy boy

450
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,200
I think I'll be a hump

451
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,640
I think I'll be a tough guy

452
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,680
And I think I'll be a punk

453
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,340
I'd like to see a fashion star

454
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,300
All dressed in curly rags

455
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,900
Over half across the other side

456
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,620
And walk around in drag

457
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,180
Who do you want to be today?

458
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,040
Who do you want to be?

459
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,620
Who do you want to be today?

460
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,480
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

461
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,280
Just like somebody on TV

462
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,900
Oh yeah

463
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,140
Do you like to live just like a rock

464
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,700
In the middle of the sea?

465
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,440
Do you want to suffer by yourself

466
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,180
In a pool of blissful misery?

467
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,980
Do you feel like a saint in honest clothes

468
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,700
With a rosary in your hand?

469
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,380
Do you want to be crazy like Fando

470
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,780
Like a stranger in a strange, strange land?

471
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,300
Would you rather push the button?

472
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,740
And be feared by all humanity?

473
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,260
Or perhaps you'd like to be a boss?

474
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,660
Do you want to be stupid just like me?

475
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,560
Who do you want to be today?

476
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,480
Who do you want to be?

477
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,040
Who do you want to be today?

478
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,920
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

479
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,760
Just like somebody on TV

480
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,880
Who do you want to be today?

481
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,600
This is Man 1A

482
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,080
Now it's going to be on FM in Dallas, Texas

483
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,220
Praise Bob!

484
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,780
Who do you want to be today?

485
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,220
Who do you want to be today?

486
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,640
Who do you want to be today?

487
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,400
Who do you want to be?

488
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,100
Who do you want to be today?

489
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,860
Who do you want to be?

490
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,020
To use my own

491
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,540
Super cool

492
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,040
Studly self as an example

493
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,600
Now in person I don't really appear

494
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,560
Like a mad prophet of the airwaves

495
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,760
I've been a fan of the airwaves for a long time

496
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:48,980
I've been a fan of the airwaves for a long time

497
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:48,980


498
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,640
Very deliberately look like an innocent

499
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,320
Computer whiz or something

500
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,720
If a policeman stops me for speeding

501
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,420
I look like a regular citizen

502
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,160
And part of me is

503
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,160
And so he doesn't look in the trunk

504
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,740
To see if I'm carrying 5,000 copies

505
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,320
Of subgenius pamphlets

506
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,520
To hand out to grade school kids

507
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,280
Which I am

508
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,920
Get away with murder this way friends

509
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,120
And that time the secret service

510
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,520
Came to my house

511
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,420
They took one look and said oh

512
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,700
He's just a poor humorist

513
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,800
He isn't building bombs

514
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,860
Not physical bombs

515
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,820
Nay my friends

516
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,140
But me and perhaps many of you

517
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,560
Are from that 1970s

518
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,960
Post hippie

519
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,400
Nihilistic generation more or less

520
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,280
And aside from not working for a living

521
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,420
I and perhaps you

522
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,340
Are still that same

523
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,100
Devious hippie

524
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,840
Not a commie nay

525
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,700
Not a pinko but a soldier

526
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,920
For slack

527
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,140
A warrior

528
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,840
Against the conspiracy

529
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,560
Of the normals

530
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,660
And so

531
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,400
To truly suffer

532
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,300
To smite them

533
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,940
But not physically

534
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,460
Smite them psychologically

535
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,520
With your jokes

536
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,800
Your cryptic statements

537
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,400
Your band

538
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,540
Your paintings

539
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,480
Your weird car

540
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,160
Your whole attitude

541
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,460
Not just your haircut and clothes

542
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,340
My god

543
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,240
The normals can wear weird haircuts and clothes

544
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,180
And they do it all

545
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,620
The time

546
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,700
If they are normals

547
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,300
My friends

548
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,320
They'll recoil in fear and jealousy

549
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,480
To see a free man

550
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,360
Or woman

551
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,900
But for latent subgeni

552
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,220
Who are right to be saved

553
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,180
You're setting a good example

554
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,080
To be weird in your own way

555
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,880
Achieve slack in your own life

556
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,400
My friend and those

557
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,200
Who are worthy will turn toward it

558
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,500
As towards a beacon

559
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,100
As a moth dives headlong

560
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,900
Into the flames

561
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,320
They're

562
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,880
They're not trying to

563
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,320
To steal your slack

564
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,340
Or to imitate you

565
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,640
But merely to see

566
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,980
What is possible

567
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,400
Then and only then

568
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,160
Will they learn

569
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,460
To pull the wool over their own eyes

570
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,460
So you don't have to talk about Bob, friends

571
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,960
They have to just stumble upon Bob

572
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,500
In their own sweet time

573
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,820
And I'm not saying

574
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,840
Be yourself

575
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,120
Quote unquote

576
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,120
There are too many yourselves

577
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,660
You might end up being your own

578
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,320
Conspiracy normal lynch mob self

579
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,560
You must try

580
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,000
To try not to

581
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,680
Achieve the development

582
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,120
Of your Bob self

583
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,580
That in you

584
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,320
Which is Bob-like

585
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,080
And there is no rule book for this

586
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,640
My friend

587
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,700
Except the one you make

588
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,000
And the one that you buy

589
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,620
From Bob

590
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,840
Praise Bob

591
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,520
Help me somebody

592
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,260
Pull the lever

593
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,000
Down you go

594
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,040
Ha!

595
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,320
You are listening to the Hour of Slack.

596
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,740
I'm K.N. Olin.

597
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,640
Praise Bob!

598
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,720
Yeah!

599
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,480
Yeah, people will go off

600
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,340
And worship their stylish fashion gods

601
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,260
Their Madonna gods

602
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,520
Their Peter gods

603
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,920
Their Jim Morrison gods

604
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,980
Jim Morrison gods

605
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,160
Mick Jagger gods

606
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,660
All those are false prophets

607
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,400
They're false prophets

608
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,940
Jerry Falwell gods

609
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,740
How did you get in this terrible box?

610
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,080
Listen to this.

611
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,180
Listen to this.

612
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,160
Can I get a T.I.?

613
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,080
T.I. man

614
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,640
Far out man

615
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,960
T.I. man

616
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,660
Slave labor in Nicaragua

617
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,160
Making electronic parts

618
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,360
A brain slave

619
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,100
Slave to their reality

620
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,180
Their world

621
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,440
Their society

622
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,180
Their way of life

623
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,480
Their religion

624
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,760
Their ideology

625
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,740
Their conformity

626
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,660
Because conformity

627
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,000
And creativity

628
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,080
Are the same thing

629
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,080


630
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,080


631
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,080


632
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,080


633
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,080


634
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,740
They're the same in their world

635
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,380
Imagination

636
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,400
What's that?

637
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,560
I've got super dynamic overdrive

638
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,300
The sidewalk surf

639
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,540
Was dancing with tricks

640
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,720
In that whirling circle

641
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,740
They love more kicks

642
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,200
They look each other

643
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,960
Like drugs to their blood

644
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,420
Like drugs to their blood

645
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,240
And drop trumps and traps

646
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,480
And drop trumps and traps

647
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,660
When they're playing studs

648
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,800
And they're pretty folks

649
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,360
Pretty folks

650
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,120
Bending the trend

651
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,120
Pretty folks

652
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,560
Pretty folks

653
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,400
They'll never mend

654
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,660
They'll never mend

655
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,040
Splitting their cells

656
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,240
Looking for pills

657
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,520
They blow their change

658
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:16,540
They blow their change

659
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,940
And they're gonna blow their change

660
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:17,940


661
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,900
They don't pay their bills

662
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,340
They don't pay their bills

663
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:21,360
And they're gonna blow their change

664
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,060
Hard to find what you love

665
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,000
Spend X, D, K

666
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,520
Blocks of flash zeros

667
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,000
There's nothing to say

668
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,440
And they're pretty folks

669
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,040
Pretty folks

670
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,800
Bending the trend

671
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,720
Pretty folks

672
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,220
Pretty folks

673
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,040
They'll never mend

674
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,220
They'll never mend

675
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,100
They'll never mend

676
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:08,760
And they're pretty talk

677
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,280
Pretty folks

678
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,800
Pretty folks

679
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,400
Pretty folks

680
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,400


681
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,400


682
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,400


683
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,400


684
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,400


685
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,400


686
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,400


687
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,960
They're pretty folks

688
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:14,960


689
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,420
Bending the trend

690
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,680
Pretty folks

691
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,660
Pretty folks, pretty folks, they'll never met.

692
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,900
In funhouse mirrors, they don't seem to age.

693
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,860
As they decompose in memory's cage.

694
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:41,080
The total loss is not something to hide.

695
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:47,180
When the last big sleep has started inside.

696
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,120
Cause they're pretty folks, pretty folks, bending each other.

697
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,300
Pretty folks, pretty folks, they'll never met.

698
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:39,140
Pretty folks, pretty folks, they'll never met.

699
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,260
Pretty sure he's a psychopath.

700
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,260
Now, how do we spot him?

701
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,620
Well, if he's wearing a Napoleon hat, it's easy.

702
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,220
Otherwise, they come in all sizes and shapes.

703
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,280
11-year-old girls, 80-year-old men.

704
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,140
Yeah, they all look perfectly normal.

705
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,320
I keep telling y'all, this is a sick and perverted nation.

706
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,880
All tired.

707
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,140
And nobody wants to listen to me.

708
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,820
Nobody wants to hear about Bob.

709
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,460
Nobody.

710
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,060
Nobody.

711
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,320
I try to tell everybody what's going on.

712
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,920
They won't listen to me.

713
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,140
Well, to tell you the truth, I can't stand it anymore.

714
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,780
Bob.

715
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,540
Bob.

716
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,280
Bob.

717
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:32,980
Bob.

718
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,760
Bob.

719
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:37,940
Bob.

720
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,440
Bob.

721
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:40,680


722
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:40,720


723
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:40,940
Bob.

724
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,020
Bob.

725
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,860
Bob.

726
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,300
Bob.

727
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,300


728
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:43,860
Bob.

729
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,200
Bob.

730
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,320
Bob.

731
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:45,560
Bob.

732
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,200
Bob.

733
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,220
Bob.

734
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,260
Bob.

735
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,300
Bob.

736
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:48,680
Bob.

737
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,100
Bob.

738
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,820
Bob.

739
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,480
Bob.

740
00:37:59,480 --> 00:37:59,540
Bob.

741
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,800
The fist and the fear behind it.

742
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,580
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.

743
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,820
It's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture

744
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,040
that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes.

745
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,600
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.

746
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,680
It's not just the child zombies that murder their mediocrity parents

747
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,620
and then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

748
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,740
It's not just those starry old vecks on the park benches

749
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,920
with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.

750
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,800
It's not just the anesthesiologist for Negi.

751
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,220
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

752
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,680
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.

753
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,800
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antennae, and human excrement on your car hood.

754
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,620
It's not just that the old ways were best.

755
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,100
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

756
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,640
It's not just the kill a ganja from the dark side of the bush.

757
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,520
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise car.

758
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:29,760
It's not just the high-rise rooftop.

759
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:37,080
It's not just the widescreen technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet.

760
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,780
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-fas the size of basketballs.

761
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,340
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

762
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,620
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland, non-entity son of a bitch

763
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,260
who thinks workers are property.

764
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,520
It's not just the blueness of the world.

765
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,000
It's not just the wound cleansed by evil.

766
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,960
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature

767
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,520
without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer.

768
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:16,000
It's not just some asshole with a pipe and a 90 more than you do dog grin all over his homogenized face.

769
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,540
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world

770
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,200
that you certainly never made.

771
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,700
It's not just the doorway to doom.

772
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,520
It's not just the doorway to doom.

773
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,440
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

774
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,660
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

775
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,720
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

776
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,540
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum show.

777
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,760
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

778
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,320
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

779
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,600
Shout salvation and fight in Jesus.

780
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,000
You'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty.

781
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,520
Bob, not off.

782
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,420
He's got tough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

783
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,400
In his back pocket.

784
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,940
Just you try it.

785
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,220
Bob is a clump of mud.

786
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,460
Bob is a tape recorder.

787
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:20,180
Bob is things that don't always run.

788
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,140
Bob is masking tape.

789
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,080
Bob is a ballpoint pen.

790
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,980
Bob is a ballpoint pen.

791
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,860
Bob is a rooster.

792
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,760
Bob is a hen.

793
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:44,600
Bob is a hen.

794
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,020
We want Bob!

795
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,680
Where's Bob?

796
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,460
We want Bob!

797
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,800
Right now!

798
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,140
We want Bob!

799
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,200
Okay, Bob's probably not going to be here in physical manifestation.

800
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,000
Oh, no!

801
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,660
Whoa, where is Bob?

802
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,140
He's everywhere.

803
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,440
Check yourself and feel if you're Bob Glenn

804
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,660
and make sure it's overactive like it's supposed to be.

805
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,600
This is the headquarters for the Church of the Subgenius.

806
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,640
Now, wait a minute.

807
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,140
No, wait a minute. I love that area.

808
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,320
I represent a group of scientists

809
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,840
who work with but one purpose, to put an end to war.

810
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,360
Naturally, such a goal can't be attained.

811
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,480
Men of vision, men such as you, Doctor,

812
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,460
gathered here, exchanging information daily,

813
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,000
putting aside all thoughts of personal success.

814
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,140
We hope to achieve exciting new techniques,

815
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,980
leap years ahead of the others.

816
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,640
I don't think I need to tell you how effective our voices will be

817
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,160
when the world learns of our achievements.

818
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,140
Well, there you have it.

819
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,740
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?

820
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,120
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?

821
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,740
However, let me assure you, Doctor, that we are dedicated men and women,

822
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,980
and as such, we can accomplish wonders.

823
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,740
Like any other church,

824
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,800
the Church of the Subgenius

825
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,760
has divine tenets,

826
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,680
divine rules,

827
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,840
divine orders.

828
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,280
The first rule of the Subgenius Church is

829
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,000
too much is always better than not enough.

830
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,940
Can I get it too much?

831
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,340
Can I get it too much?

832
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,820
What is it always better than?

833
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,340
I don't know!

834
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,360
Praise Bob!

835
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,800
Praise Bob!

836
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:31,720
Hello, Paul.

837
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,620
Welcome to the End Times.

838
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,680
In today's End Time essay,

839
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,120
we will be covering the difference between

840
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,620
the Bofram and the Bloodyhead Launcher Society itself.

841
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,580
As seen here in our first slide,

842
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,160
the Bloodyhead Launcher Society goes on forever.

843
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,340
end and there's no use resisting.

844
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,740
Look at those heads fall in slow

845
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,720
motion. Just beautiful.

846
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,360
Bouncing down the celestial stairs.

847
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,780
Yes, dear friends, those

848
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,960
are the things I want to tell you about today.

849
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,720
The very minute things.

850
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,660
The parables about the less traveled past.

851
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,220
Ha!

852
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,180
Bob gives you the bulldozers

853
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,560
you need to pave your own path.

854
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,680
Ignore those gray-suited hippos

855
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,580
and those third-stage fashion clones

856
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,720
are killing me. You gotta stand up.

857
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,760
You gotta stand up now and you gotta stand up

858
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,880
for all of us.

859
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,580
Stand up and make it legal.

860
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,820
Don't let them whitewash your

861
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,920
subconscious mind.

862
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,980
Just like the 50s.

863
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,740
Hey, if we're supposed to be moving ahead,

864
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,200
why is the scenery changing?

865
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,360
Do machines get smarter as people get dumber?

866
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,480
Well, forget it for now.

867
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,620
That's exactly the way they want you

868
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,320
to behave so they can have an excuse to

869
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,100
mount their gun turrets against all the

870
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,220
supposed fringe groups.

871
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,940
Oh, no, no, come on. Keep those thoughts to yourself.

872
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,020
You shouldn't depress anybody.

873
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,240
You'll be seen as a downer

874
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,780
spreading bad karma.

875
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,360
People don't want to be reminded of it.

876
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,540
Yes, this is the theme

877
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,780
of the neurotic 80s.

878
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,840
The human race is cracking up.

879
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,660
The toxic waste of the

880
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,780
me generation has seeped into our homes.

881
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,020
The McCarthyite witch hunters

882
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,260
are back, but this time

883
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,740
they're out for us.

884
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,400
Physical perfection

885
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,660
and mental vacuousness make us a little more.

886
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,880
Oh, but don't bomb us out.

887
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,540
We want to have fun.

888
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,600
Just watch that soft core

889
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,360
.0 soda can work

890
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,280
your boring job.

891
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:39,920
On some occasions,

892
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,200
Baphomet seems to be associated

893
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,400
with an apparition of a bearded head.

894
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,800
In any case,

895
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,380
we found hospital evidence

896
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,300
for the charge of

897
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,180
Well?

898
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,640
Well?

899
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:07,920
. . .

900
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,920
. . .

901
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,420
There's a world

902
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,680
. . .

903
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:12,680


904
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:12,680


905
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,560
There's a world going on underground.

906
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,000
Jeez, this is awful, Dad.

907
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,280
Lord Lord, I'm dope and he's killing people.

908
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,860
Tell it to the X-mas bunny, kid.

909
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,640
You watch the Astros.

910
00:46:48,060 --> 00:47:09,720
You watch the Astros.

911
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,900
You watch the Astros.

912
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,880
How do I know I'm here?

913
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,280
Not in some very lonely place.

914
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,060
How do I know I'm not on a star?

915
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:21,440
Got a problem?

916
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,120
Bring it to the friendly people.

917
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,180
People touching people.

918
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,500
People running against people.

919
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:36,960
People developing the nuclear first strike capability to incinerate people.

920
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,380
Sound like a flash in the pan?

921
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,220
It's got to be.

922
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,660
You don't say.

923
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:42,660


924
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,320
Subtle for less.

925
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,080
You don't have to.

926
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,680
You're you.

927
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:52,900
And you've got needs bigger and more earth-shaking than your grandfather could have dreamed.

928
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,860
How do we keep bringing them to you, year after year, bigger and better?

929
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,580
By using the technology of tomorrow on the consumers of today.

930
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,140
The now people.

931
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,620
People on the go.

932
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,500
Going from the smart shopper to new low value in the time it takes to dial our number.

933
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,860
Call now, won't you?

934
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,040
For more of what you've come to expect from us.

935
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:18,980
Style.

936
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:20,440
Mood.

937
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,860
A certain dependable kind of image.

938
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,600
An image of the way you'd like people to be.

939
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,520
Passive.

940
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:29,800
Pretty.

941
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:31,740
White.

942
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,500
As white as the complexion of our finest women.

943
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,600
Grown right here by our special process.

944
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,660
As white as the hair of God.

945
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,360
White as it was in life.

946
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,840
As white as the blank sheet on which we write your mind.

947
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,760
Who are we?

948
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,440
We're the happy people.

949
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,340
Happy to live in a world of images.

950
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,180
Images of war.

951
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:58,580
Family.

952
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,180
Crime.

953
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:08,000
Fun images that help rinse away unsightly self-images so you can get away from the privacy of your own home.

954
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,500
After all, aren't you what everything's here for?

955
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,360
You're what we're here for.

956
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,820
That's why we made everything.

957
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,180
And that's why everything made you.

958
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,360
And that's why you made us.

959
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,400
Who are we?

960
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,700
We're the money people.

961
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,740
The people who take your money.

962
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,780
No more money hassling.

963
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,660
But what about little Dicky you say?

964
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:42,660


965
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:49,980
What's little Dicky gonna do when you're working late and Wilma's minding the fort and Sis is in and out?

966
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,320
Put away those straps and buckles.

967
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,580
Dicky's safe with us.

968
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,840
He's even learning to speak again.

969
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,800
Our way.

970
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:03,680
Best of all, he's safe with the people who know what it is you want from a world.

971
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,400
Simplicity.

972
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,500
Reliability.

973
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,640
A world you can go to without worrying about whether your money is safe.

974
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:12,640


975
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:12,640


976
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:19,080
You know, when we first got into this business, we didn't know much more than you.

977
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,880
Like you, we thought there was a world out there.

978
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,580
A world of value.

979
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,860
A world that needed meaning.

980
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,540
Beauty.

981
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,380
Love.

982
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,900
A world that needed a better product.

983
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,200
Uh-uh.

984
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,440
There's just you.

985
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:42,700
You.

986
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,400
And you want to know something.

987
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,200
You want to know just exactly what it is you're supposed to do.

988
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,680
You don't really care why.

989
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,200
Just so long as it's the right thing.

990
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,240
It's natural.

991
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,720
Everyone wants to do the right thing.

992
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,040
But sometimes it's hard to know just what the right thing is.

993
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,580
Let's say you're black.

994
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:17,180
And you've just lost both your arms and legs defending U.S. interests in El Salvador.

995
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,280
You come home and get thrown in jail for life for beating up four white cops.

996
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,760
You want to know just exactly what is it I'm supposed to feel.

997
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,160
We can't give you all the answers.

998
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:36,480
But we can help you flesh out your fantasy that there are some.

999
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,580
At our labs, we use only the finest homemade ingredients.

1000
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,160
Love.

1001
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,760
Children.

1002
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:46,880
God.

1003
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,380
And the purest blend of money your needs can buy.

1004
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,580
Grown right here by our special process.

1005
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:58,400
A process in use since our first mom and pop operation.

1006
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,500
Who are we?

1007
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,280
We're the normal people.

1008
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,380
I am. I am becoming what?

1009
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,220
I am. I am becoming what?

1010
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,520
That was Michael Pepe, yes.

1011
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,920
Remember that name, folks?

1012
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,700
Off his tape, Life Itself.

1013
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,320
The Greatest Hits of Michael Pepe.

1014
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,900
You can find out more about Michael Pepe

1015
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,720
and more creatures like that

1016
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,360
from the Church's thening Our T expreses of the ends of the broadcast.

1017
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,180
You'll get that fox number at the end of the broadcast

1018
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,400
Vamos. Vamos. Vamos. Vamos.

1019
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:47,440
I am, I am, I am to come, I am, I am, I am to come, I am, I am, I am, I am to come, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am to come, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am to come, I am, I am.

1020
00:52:53,700 --> 00:53:02,640
Dynamic overdrive. I'm operating in 10,000 revolutions. My motor is being preserved because I'm operating in supernatural overdrive.

1021
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,020
I'm certain you know what the reality is.

1022
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:13,200
No matter what I do to change it, normal I remain.

1023
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:19,940
Normal can be just as bad as riding in a wheelchair.

1024
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:29,020
Today, serious heresy is a deviant state of consciousness.

1025
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:42,400
Not so much deviant opinions as having a kind of experience which is different from regular experience.

1026
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:46,480
We are taught what experiences are permissible.

1027
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:56,140
And therefore, if a person has so-called strange experiences and endeavors to communicate these experiences to other people,

1028
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,000
he is looked at in a very odd way.

1029
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,880
And asked, are you feeling all right?

1030
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:09,600
Because people feel distinctly uncomfortable when they realize that they're in the presence of someone

1031
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,680
who's experiencing the world in a rather different way from themselves.

1032
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,700
They call in question as to whether this person is indeed human.

1033
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,320
The cigar is something.

1034
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,960
They look like a human being.

1035
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:28,940
But because the state of experience is so different, you wonder whether they really are.

1036
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,960
And in rather the same way, in a very everyday kind of circumstance,

1037
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,960
when you're sitting in a bar drinking, and you find you have a drunk next to you.

1038
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,900
And he turns to you and says,

1039
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,500
I say,

1040
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:48,380
and you sort of move your stool a little way away from this man.

1041
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,780
Because he's become, in some way, what we mean by non-human.

1042
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,700
We expect a high of about 65 degrees tomorrow.

1043
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:58,900
Increasingly cloudy skies.

1044
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,840
Once again, with some rain in the forecast.

1045
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,180
So I found this little dish, crawled in and I, I say I'm happy.

1046
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,760
All right boys, Bob's got you hooked.

1047
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,560
Bob's got a monkey on your back.

1048
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,820
Hey, you know that, that...

1049
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:15,220
Bob's is doing something spooky again ain't he?

1050
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,300
That's what you're listening to?

1051
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:17,640
Yeah.

1052
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:20,020
Yeah.

1053
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,380
That's the kind of Bob that comes up out of the shadows.

1054
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,300
It's the kind of Bob that follows you home.

1055
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:26,740


1056
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,000
It's the kind of Bob that follows you home.

1057
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000


1058
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,100
It calls you up in the middle of the night and hangs up and sees you.

1059
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,740
Hey, let's kill Bob.

1060
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,420
I got...

1061
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,000
I, um...

1062
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,340
I saw these hot dogs, Bob.

1063
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,740
And, uh...

1064
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,620
And they're like...

1065
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,000
When my daddy got killed with a baseball.

1066
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,220
Because those are the kind they sold there.

1067
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,140
And...

1068
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,240
And...

1069
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:02,800
And...

1070
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,980
Ohio.

1071
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,660
Ohio.

1072
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:09,100
Ohio.

1073
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,100
She's gone...

1074
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,480
To...

1075
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,660
Ohio.

1076
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,240
They've got paddle wheels there.

1077
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,860
They've got paddle wheels there.

1078
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,900
Paddle wheels...

1079
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,540
Bigger...

1080
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,600
Than a Panzer tank, Bob.

1081
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,980
Bigger than a Panzer tank, Bob.

1082
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,460
Bigger than a...

1083
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,200
Panzer...

1084
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,540
Tank...

1085
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,460
Bob...

1086
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,000
Ohio.

1087
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,000
Ohio.

1088
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,120
And...

1089
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:42,820
Ohio.

1090
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,040
You've got Ohio.

1091
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,500
Ohio.

1092
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,920
Ohio.

1093
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,680
Ohio.

1094
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,160
Panzers.

1095
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,120
Panzers.

1096
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,780
Panzers.

1097
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,040
Highness.

1098
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:28,980
impose equations on the

1099
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:28,980


1100
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:28,980


1101
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:28,980


1102
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,260
Oh, dear friends.

1103
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:58,400
And now we come down near the end of an hour of slack with this song, this offensive song.

1104
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:03,100
From negative land, I must admit, this is just really disgraceful.

Friends, that P.O. Box you can write to for more information about the Church of the Subgenius and its publications is Bob.

1106
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,340
Friends, you can write to Bob at P.O. Box.

1108
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,560
Thank you for listening, dear friends.

1109
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:31,340
And stay tuned for the Monday Morning Show with Johnny Horton and Norm Ward.

1110
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,300
Other things.

1111
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,120
And I'm on a date.

1112
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,800
If I can't whoop it, I'm going down.

1113
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,460
All right, man.

1114
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,660
He can't whoop it.

1115
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,700
He's going down.

1116
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:11,860
If the last 50 years made such a change, just imagine the New York of 1980.

1117
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,360
When everyone has a number instead of a name.

1118
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,700
And the government tells you whom you should marry.

1119
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,640
Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast.

1120
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,520
For it is the number of a man.

1121
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,680
The number of a man.

1122
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:37,300
His number is 603 score and 6.
