00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,780
Time to rock.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,760
Time to rock.

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,820
Time to rock.

9
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:15,560
Time to rock.

10
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,360
Too much.

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,240
Too often.

12
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,800
Time to rock.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,800
Time to rock.

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,640
Time to rock.

15
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,940
I'm in there and have to dig life

16
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,600
with Father, and I mean

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Father Slack.

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,380
We're

19
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,180
really

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,860
old.

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,280
That is Pat Paulson.

22
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,980
I just want to say that I endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election.

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,360
And this is the hour of slack in Dallas, Texas.

24
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,100
I know where that is.

25
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,200
Coming up on your morning station, it's the hour of slack drive-by comedy hour.

26
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,740
Once again, your wacky hosts Ivan Stang and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

27
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,060
help ease your morning commute with a fun-filled hour of classic rock, laughs, and trivia

28
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,220
where you can win fabulous prizes.

29
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,800
So stay tuned to your classic rock station coming up right after this.

30
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,700
Goodbye, Earth.

31
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,680
Good morning, Planet X.

32
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,980
Good morning, Planet X.

33
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,600
Good morning, Planet X.

34
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,040
Enter night.

35
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,800
Take my hand.

36
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,020
We're off to Never Never Land.

37
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,520
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob

38
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,940
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob

39
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,260
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob

40
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,080
Eternal salvation or triple your money back

41
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,420
All of the religions will be having a heart attack

42
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,040
A pipe full of fraud equals what?

43
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,880
A lot of slack, no matter how you kill it

44
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,540
He always keeps coming back, Bob

45
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,340
I'm talking about Dobbs

46
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,220
Repent, quit your job and slack off

47
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,400
Get ready to blast off

48
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,300
The next day comes and all the pigs are on the run from Bob

49
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,900
Pull the wool over your own eyes

50
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,260
Start to realize what till now has been disguised

51
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,600
Keep looking through the skies at the saucers flying by

52
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,420
And maybe by and by you will see the light at the end of the pipe that leads to Bob Dobbs

53
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,300
Bob Dobbs

54
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,620
Talking about the salesman to the gods

55
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,560
He's still in check the coffin lid on a conspiracy of normality

56
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,720
Oh, who could it be but Bob?

57
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:43,700
Oh, who could it be but Bob?

58
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,340
Oh, who could it be but Bob?

59
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,640
Crazy about Bob

60
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:44,880
Crazy about Bob

61
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,440
Cause I looked deep into his eyes

62
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,860
All the dots there and soon I was hypnotized

63
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,060
Now there is no difference between two divides

64
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,260
The rich became the beggar and the fool became the wise

65
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,800
Cause it's a way out, far out

66
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,960
Psychedelic freak out

67
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,860
Took a hit at Bob

68
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,420
I'm starting to freak out

69
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,300
Geek out

70
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,320
My friends are gonna love it

71
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,320


72
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,660
Look out, look out everyone, here he comes, it's Bob!

73
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,060
You wish you could forget

74
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,020
about Bob!

75
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:18,900
Uhhhhhhhhhh

76
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,320
Yo, yeah, you know what time it is?

77
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,660
Aye, do do, well, time to rock, friends, and...

78
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,940
the Bob rap were by this new guy, the great...

79
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,840
Neptune!

80
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,260
Yes, the great Neptune!

81
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,000
We're gonna be playing tons more stuff by the great Neptune,

82
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:41,360
who is at www.neptune.itgo.com

83
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,780
or josephicus at yahoo.com, friends!

84
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,080
And we heard of...

85
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,420
Well, this whole show is the show designed to drive you insane

86
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,880
and make you think somebody slipped you a Mickey!

87
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,720
Isn't that a Mickey-meat?

88
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,520
And so we also heard Pat Boone and Moda Mac

89
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,320
driving you insane,

90
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,020
driving you crazy,

91
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,260
and upcoming friends,

92
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,520
J.R. Bob Dobbs himself!

93
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:06,380
Ugh!

94
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,580
And in the background we hear

95
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,980
MC Kevrock with time control!

96
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,560
And then...

97
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,000
Au revoir!

98
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,440
dyurance...

99
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,320
Show yourself...

100
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,300
Come on in.

101
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,000
The worst thing was I got a little angel baby hair in my spaghetti.

102
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,840
That was the worst thing.

103
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,800
I hate angel baby hair in my spaghetti.

104
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,520
Once it gets in my spaghetti, I start to get a little noodley, you know.

105
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,360
I hate that.

106
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,460
I hate to feel noodley.

107
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,940
Once you run around here along the sun, you can't camp a little too long.

108
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,160
You just get noodley, you know.

109
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,860
You start to hang out a little too long.

110
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,080
And it's noodley.

111
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,200
And noodley starts to noodley.

112
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,880
That's a sad day.

113
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,160
I hate it when my little noodley noodley starts to fart along.

114
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,440
So I try to rub things on it.

115
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,560
And little baby toes.

116
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,900
Little baby toes all over the tent too.

117
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,360
There's one right up there, Bob.

118
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,920
Right up on the sleeve of the shirt of the jacket of the tent.

119
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,660
It's sort of tangly.

120
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,960
Okay.

121
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,680
And now.

122
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,300
I want you.

123
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,100
To gently feel your neighbor's nipple to your left and to your right.

124
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,400
Bob?

125
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,340
People say that I gotta grow up.

126
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,540
I ain't got it any younger and I gotta settle down.

127
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,680
Find a wife.

128
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,120
I make a move to the white bread part of town.

129
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,940
Get a job.

130
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,520
I work at Fort O'Mare where they don't really appreciate you.

131
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,220
I try to go watch in a bed on the back way.

132
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,640
When your heart gives a labor of proof.

133
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,980
Don't want no babies.

134
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,960
Don't want no wife.

135
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,580
Don't want no nine to five.

136
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,180
I want a life.

137
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,420
Don't want no babies.

138
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,520
Don't want no wife.

139
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,020
Don't want no nine to five.

140
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,740
I want a life.

141
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,980
I want a life.

142
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,420
Don't want a wife.

143
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,860
Don't want no nine to five.

144
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,800
I want a text.

145
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,300


146
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,300


147
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,300


148
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,300


149
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,300


150
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,300


151
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,300


152
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,300


153
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,300


154
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,300


155
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:38,200
You think you don't want no baby, don't want no wife, don't want no nine to five, I wanna lie.

156
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:46,980
Cause I love to play music, love to make money, love to meet women, is that so funny?

157
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:56,080
Love to play music, love to make money, love to meet women, is that so funny? No!

158
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,060
People say I gotta grow up, I ain't getting any younger, and I gotta settle down.

159
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,080
Find a wife, I'll make a move to Long Island.

160
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,960
Get a job, I'm working for the man, baby, don't give a s*** about you.

161
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,220
I'll shiny go watch in a bed on the back when your heart gets a labor of cruel.

162
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:29,640
Don't want no baby, don't want no wife, don't want no nine to five, I wanna lie.

163
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:38,260
Don't want no baby, don't want no wife, don't want no nine to five, I wanna lie.

164
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:47,040
Cause I love to play music, love to make money, love to meet women, is that so funny?

165
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:56,120
Love to play music, love to make money, love to meet women, is that so funny? No!

166
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,800
Yeah, yeah.

167
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,020
Praise me, Bob.

168
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:40,320
My fellow Americans, the only thing we have to fear is a crippling, decade-long depression,

169
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:47,480
one in which thousands will die by starvation, riots, or even their own hands.

170
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:53,960
This is the sort of depression that destroys the faith of a people and their nation,

171
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:02,500
a sort of depression that does not make one stronger from the great challenge it brings, but rather weaker.

172
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:11,180
I stand before you today with a message born not of hope, but of despair.

173
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:20,020
Yes, misery awaits us all, and there's nothing we can do to avert this grim fate.

174
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,240
This economic depression is...

175
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,420
It is far too great for any of us to overcome,

176
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,940
and there is nothing left for America to do but suffer.

177
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,960
All is lost.

178
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,300
The situation is hopeless.

179
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,260
Yes, we as a nation are doomed.

180
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,640
Doomed! Doomed! Doomed!

181
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,240
Next song.

182
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,820
Ah, yes, took a little while until...

183
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,900
we found something that was, uh...

184
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,340
Oh, how shall I say? More spiritually enlightening...

185
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,800
to our, uh...

186
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
to our, uh...

187
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,300
general atmosphere of, uh...

188
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,460
view of reality.

189
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,180
Uh, I don't know the title for this song,

190
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,160
Andrew, I'm sure will write it down on the tape afterwards,

191
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,480
but here we go.

192
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:41,580
Hello, boys and girls and snuggles, the floppy bunny.

193
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,820
How you like my ears?

194
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,620
They're really floppy, huh?

195
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,160
And really fuzzy.

196
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,800
Ha ha ha!

197
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,980
A funny crowd!

198
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,460
Everywhere!

199
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,420
Oh look!

200
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,620
There's a fuzzy bear!

201
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,800
Everybody be happy!

202
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,500
Or else...

203
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,720
...I'll be a little bit more...

204
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,960
...fancy!

205
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,840
Cotton candy and clowns!

206
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,680
Balloons flying in the sky!

207
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,640
Everybody be happy!

208
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,920
Don't question how or why!

209
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,820
Happiness is inventory!

210
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,220
Sadness is a sin!

211
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,580
Don't be ugly!

212
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,600
Be cute and snuggly!

213
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,180
Be fuzzy!

214
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:08,980
Buries in!

215
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,280
This is Knuckles!

216
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,500
Your commentator!

217
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:16,500


218
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,860
Real cuteness is what I want!

219
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,380
Must be cute!

220
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,880
Don't be scary!

221
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Gotta be hairy!

222
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,620
Don't be hairy!

223
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,080
Happiness is inventory!

224
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,420
No sad ending!

225
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,000
To the story!

226
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,020
Happiness is mandatory!

227
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,560
Do you feel cute?

228
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,240
Well do ya?

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,140


234
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,920
Oh!

235
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,980
Oh look at my fluffy tail!

236
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,180
Oh it's so fluffy and...

00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,120

And everyone must be cute!

Everyone must be cute!

242
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,980
Our cute people...

243
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,200
...must be...

244
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,340
...obeyed!

245
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,380
Our uncute people...

246
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,320
...must be...

247
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,080
...destroyed!

248
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,180
The final solution...

249
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,920
...to ugliness...

250
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,060
...will be...

251
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,980

252
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,900

...big bright eyes!

257
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,160
Ha!

258
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,900
We must all be cute!

259
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,820
We must all look up in the sky...

260
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,400
...and see the white fluffy clouds!

261
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

262
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,060

Also heard in the background here.

308
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,700
Jehovah Hates Fred, by the way, I gave their website wrong last time.

309
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:53,300
Jehovahhatesfred.com is spelled J-E-H-O-V-A hatesfred.com.

310
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,860
And Fred is spelled P-H-R-E-D.

311
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,960
And it's all one word.

312

I don't deserve to die.

320
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,340
I don't deserve this phone abuse.

321
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,200
So please just stay your wife.

322
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,280

Work in a graveyard shift.

326
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:51,180
You said I should have known.

327
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,180
I didn't know.

328
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,460
I didn't know anything now.

329
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,460


330
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,460


331
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,460


332
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,460


333
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,460


334
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,460

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,460


336
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,460


337
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,220
Because it doesn't get to me tomand me.

338
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,680
You could be fired from trying to sell me.

339
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:58,680


340
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,380
You could be fired from trying to sell me.

341
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:00,380


342
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:00,780
Why didn't you

343
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:00,860
This thing?

344
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,000
What is it?

345
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,620
глиphism

346
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,440

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:48,020
More things in heaven and earth than your books

349
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,640
I was working the graveyard shift late one Sunday night

350
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,640
Making sure all the trains were running smooth and uptight

351
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,480
Keeping a close eye on the backbeat in 409

352
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Making sure the trains were running on time

353
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,820
Then I lucked off into the cold distance and what did I see?

354
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,020
Looked like one solitary headlight coming after me

355
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,340
One solitary headlight with his eyes on me

356
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,220
Coming to take me away

357
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,500
Coming to take me away

358
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,380
Coming to take me away

359
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,560

Working the graveyard shift

364
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,140
The hand that holds you down

365
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,820
Is the hand that lifts you up

366
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,400
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,080

Is life

376
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,360
To you

00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,380
Is life

378
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,560
To you

379
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,120
Is life

380
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,980
To you

381
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

382
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,520
I won't think so

383
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,160
I won't think so

384
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,620
To you

385
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:16,420


386
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,200
Ha ha ha ha ha

387
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,140
No Brenda she stirs me up

388
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,000
No Brenda she stirs me up

389
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,540
No Brenda she stirs me up

390
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,000
No Brenda she stirs me up

391
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,360
Is life

392
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,400
Is life

393
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,880
Is waking up

394
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,400
Baby, the room has

395
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,800
No Undie

396
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,500
things made mama cry

397
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,600
she hid her heart stone

398
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,440
and lie deeper

399
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,480
into hell I slide

400
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,940
you gotta get off the devil's

401
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,420

get off the devil's payroll

403
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,600
that's what

404
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,680
mama said to me just

405
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,620
trust the lord he'll set

406
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,740
you free but

407
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,660
only you can't save your soul

408
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,120
you gotta get off the devil's

409
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,680

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,420
get off the devil's

411
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:20,980
payroll

412
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,840
sitting on my bed

413
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,140
behind bars

414
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,260
reading my road map

415
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,420
of scars mama's

416
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,240
kitchen seat so far

417
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,600
you gotta get off

418
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,240

419
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,060
get off the devil's

420
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,680
payroll

421
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,400
then came the day I saw

422
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,440
the light the lord

423
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,400
he came to me that night

424
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,880
said if forgiveness

425
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,100
was inside if I

426
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,500

427
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,440

428
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,800
devil's payroll

429
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,460
that's what mama said

430
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,840
to me just

431
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,120
trust the lord he'll set you

432
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,400
free but only you

433
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,840
can't save your soul

434
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,300

435
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,820

436
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,620
get off the devil's

437
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,140
payroll

438
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,340
I stand before you

439
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,600
a changed man

440
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,880
just the way the lord

441
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,380
had me

442
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:47,840
planned

443
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,440
try as you can

444
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,380

445
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,060
if you get off the devil's

446
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,620

00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,380

448
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:56,860
payroll

449
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,880
I hope you know

450
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,520
these words ring true

451
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,480
the lord he just has

452
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,680
love for you

453
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,340

00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,120

455
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,760

that's what mama said

459
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,100
to me just

460
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,140
thing is

461
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,820
trust the lord be

462
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,520
the smell of love

463
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,620
God��

464
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,120
you will

465
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,120


466
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,120


467
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,540
hope for

468
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:23,660
your salvation

469
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:23,660


470
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,840
be your

471
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:24,840


472
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,920
God

473
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:25,920


474
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,340
and look at

475
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:43,620
his arm

476
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,460
burning

477
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:51,560
Bob is a rock and Bob is a tree.

478
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,980
Bob is a bear and Bob is a bee.

479
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,280
Bob is truth and Bob is lies.

480
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,620
Bob is cakes and fruits and pies.

481
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,860
Bob's my house, Bob's my watch.

482
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,280
Bob's my sandwich, Bob's my crotch.

483
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,440
Bob's my toothpick, Bob's my brain.

484
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,600
Bob's an ugly, yellow stain.

485
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,280
Bob's a cactus, Bob's an itch.

486
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,280
Bob is take off every stitch.

487
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,580
Bob's my master, Bob's my slave.

488
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,920
Bob will rob me, Bob will save.

489
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,200
Bob's my toaster, Bob's my fridge.

490
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,380
Bob's my little sister Mitch.

491
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,760
Bob will cost you, Bob is free.

492
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,180
Bob's the watch and Bob's the key.

493
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,420
Bob's the watch and Bob's the key.

494
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:41,420


495
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,580
In short, Bob is the man who used your leg as a frying pan.

496
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,360
If your mind is a jar, you can pour it out of the sink.

497
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,620
And the subgenius church is the missing link.

498
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,220
Damn it.

499
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,540
Jump! Jump off and down for Bob!

500
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,680
Cause Bob is the future!

501
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,220
Come on you lazy ass drag off and don't jump!

502
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:05,840
Bob!

503
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,420
You can see the future, it surrounds you and it surrounds you.

504
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,560
It surrounds the imagery in the church.

505
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,620
Bob is the industrial information and quantum revolution.

506
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,440
Bob is the color of the future.

507
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,120
What color is the future?

508
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,220
Bob is the bright refraction of the quantum field around us.

509
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,100
It's because Bob has slack.

510
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,300
Slack is the quantum field.

511
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,700
And that's why I'm on my knees praying now.

512
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,680
Praying here before Bob.

513
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,520
Because I am Bob.

514
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,400
And that's the odd thing.

515
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,400
Because I am Bob.

516
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,400
And I don't know if my mom was raped by a

517
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:53,080
parapaetic man with blonde hair who was delivering the milk.

518
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,600
Pounding the milk.

519
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,700
It was a little hard but there it was.

520
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,580
I just came.

521
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,120
And I just came again.

522
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,100
And I just keep coming.

523
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,860
I can't help but come here.

524
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,640
It's a special thing.

525
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:09,880
Hallelujah brother!

526
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,020
Bob is going to lead us into the future.

527
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,700
Bob is going to be the next revolution.

528
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,220
Bob is going to be the nanotech revolution.

529
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,120
The quantum revolution.

530
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,380
The spiritual revolution!

531
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,280
Ah!

532
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,820
Ah!

533
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,960
Ah!

534
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,540
Woo!

535
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,820
All right.

536
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,380
Yeah.

537
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,460
All these dot coms that you see.

538
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,820
There's only one dot com that matters.

539
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:38,500
And that is www.subgenius.com!

540
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,540
Woo!

541
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,640
So what does this all have to do with you?

542
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,380
Well, you guys.

543
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,100
You're yetis.

544
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
You are the future.

545
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,920
You have to use that quantum field for your future.

546
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,860
You guys have to make the apocalypse happen.

547
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,740
The more you're yourself, the faster the apocalypse will come.

548
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,000
Yes, friends.

549
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,860
Mystic Homeboy at XXX Day.

550
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,600
We also heard Bob is a Rock.

551
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,380
That great old classic remastered by Bob.

552
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,020
It's now from the original tapes by Bleepo Abernathy.

553
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:22,280
And before that, get off the devil's payroll by the folks behind Broken Circle Gospel Deluxe.

554
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,200
Praise Bob.

555
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,880
That's all good.

556
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,300
Hey!

557
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,580
Yeah!

558
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,140
Yeah!

559
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,360
Yeah!

560
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,100


561
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,260
Yeah!

562
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,600
Yeah!

563
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,580
Yeah!

564
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:32,960


565
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,580
Yeah!

566
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:33,680
Yeah!

567
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:33,860
Yeah!

568
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,200
Yeah!

569
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,860
Yeah!

570
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,100
Yeah!

571
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,220
Yeah!

572
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:37,320
You see?

573
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,020
Something's wrong?

574
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,960
Shut the light.

575
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,480
Heavy thoughts tonight.

576
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,760
And they are too snow white.

577
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,460
Dreams of war?

578
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,640
Dreams of liars?

579
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,840
Dreams of dragon's fire and the things that will bite?

580
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,100
Sleep with one eye open.

581
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,280
Grip in your pillow tight.

582
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,040
Exit light.

583
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,960
Enter night.

584
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,200
Rain over...

585
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,200


586
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,860
Hi, this is Pat Paulson.

587
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,860
I'd like to endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election.

588
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,740
Bob's a lot of, well, he's not fun.

589
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,740
But anyway, this is the hour of slack in Dallas, Texas.

590
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,080
One of my shoes got cow stuff on them.

591
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,500
It's the way conspiracy works, friends.

592
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,460
Conspiracy creeps into every human endeavor.

593
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,600
By nature of humanity.

594
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,140
That's why we just try to say, well, screw the humans.

595
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,920
We're subgeniuses. We're different.

596
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,340
Subgenius can be any age, any size, shape, color.

597
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,780
Can be from any background, any nationality, any damn planet or species.

598
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,620
We don't care.

599
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,820
As long as they have the fragment of Bob consciousness.

600
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,660
And have sent $30 to P.O. Box 1436 Dallas, Texas.

601
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,300
I'm not doing.

602
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,440
Oh, yes, friends.

603
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,560
You can be saved even if it kills you.

604
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,840
And that's how much Bob loves you, friends.

605
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,320
He will kill you to save you.

606
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,280
Because, you know, once you're saved and Bob, you never really die.

607
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,180
You know, it's, you know, his old saying.

608
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,940
What Bob offers his most famous discovery.

609
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,780
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

610
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,020
What other words?

611
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,260
You know.

612
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:35,460


613
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,120
What does Bob offer, Zach, friends?

614
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,080
If you don't live forever, you get your money back.

615
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:49,800
A perfect, perfect formula for belief and love and slack.

616
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,740
Or slack, whatever that is.

617
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,740
Slack for me would be to shut up for a minute.

618
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,900
It's been a long day.

619
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,420
Someday the exes will come.

620
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,500
Bob's promise will come true.

621
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,080
Our alien benefactors will give us our own planets.

622
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,460
And we will be able to create the 25-hour day.

623
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,500
The 26-hour day.

624
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,420
The Martian time slip.

625
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,360
The day that lasts forever.

626
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,520
The night that never ends, dear friends.

627
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,900
The night that smells like cinnamon for three days.

628
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,280
And then it smells like epoxy the next three days.

629
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,740
Any planet you want.

630
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,120
The most bizarre.

631
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,420
Outlandish things you can imagine.

632
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,200
Could come physically, literally true.

633
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,940
You better hope you have a pure mind when that happens.

634
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:48,040
You better hope that you aren't thinking real paranoid bad thoughts in the back of your mind

635
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,360
at the moment when every wish can come true.

636
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,900
You better hope that you really have some good wishes in your head.

637
00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:00,720
And so you can't be constantly thinking about how you're gonna get back at that conspiracy bastard.

638
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,920
Or so forth.

639
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,860
Friends, you gotta just learn to ride.

640
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,720
And you gotta be wise about it.

641
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,780
Time control is what Bob has been preaching all along.

642
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:19,600
And unfortunately, until we get the time machines working, the only true form of time control available to us is that boring virtue called patience.

643
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,180
And that's why you need to remember about the funny little monkeys.

644
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,420
Because otherwise it's so easy to lose patience with them.

645
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,520
And God knows, only Bob stands between most of us.

646
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:43,620
And us becoming mad serial killers, machine gunning entire McDonald's full of pink boys out of their smugness.

647
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,800
Neat.

648
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,580
You is what you am.

649
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,200
They count, don't they count.

650
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,300
You ain't what you're not.

651
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,200
So you see what you got.

652
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,320
You are what you is.

653
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,160
And that's all it is.

654
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:29,160
A foolish young man from a middle class family started singing the blues.

655
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,300
Cause he thought it was manly.

656
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,620
Now he talk like a kingfish.

657
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,220
From a Amos and Andy.

658
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:44,100
He tell you that chitlins, well they taste just like candy.

659
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,880
He thinks that he's got the whole thing down.

660
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,820
From the Nibbley Ocean to the Royal Crown.

661
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,840
Do you know what you are?

662
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,840
You are what you is.

663
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,940
You is what you am.

664
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,620
They count, don't they count.

665
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,660
You ain't what you're not.

666
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,580
So you see what you got.

667
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,780
You are what you is.

668
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,540
And that's all it is.

669
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:25,840
A foolish young man of the Negro persuasion.

670
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,280
Persuasion?

671
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,500
Did he say persuasion?

672
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,620
Devoted his life.

673
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,820
To become a Caucasian.

674
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,440
He stopped beating poor.

675
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,420
He stopped beating green.

676
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,620
He traded his dashi again.

677
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,280
For some Jordan's jeans.

678
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,520
He learned to play golf.

679
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,340
And he got a good score.

680
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,100
Now he say to himself.

681
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,160
I ain't no nigger no more.

682
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,740
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

683
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,180
I don't understand you, poor wama macumba.

684
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,540
Would you speak a little clearly, Mercedes Benzine?

685
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,780
That's your mama, baby.

686
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,340
Who is who?

687
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,180
I don't know.

688
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,240
And what is what?

689
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,180
Something I just got to know.

690
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,360
And why is this?

691
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,160
Somebody tell me now.

692
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,360
Appropriate.

693
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,620
That's a funny pronunciation if I ever get it right.

694
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,480
If you don't like.

695
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,720
Well, did you like?

696
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,540
You get that word.

697
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,460
But you have got.

698
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,440
You have got.

699
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,760
I spend all my days.

700
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,260
Driving in the dirt, yeah.

701
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,520
And let it rot.

702
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,120
I can smell it now.

703
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,720
Someone else.

704
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,700
Here they come, here they come, here they come.

705
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,440
They surely come.

706
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,140
I told you they were coming.

707
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,720
To pick it up.

708
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,920
To pick it up, yeah.

709
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,520
But she won't stop.

710
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,120
And she won it for free.

711
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,720
And when one day.

712
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,060
And then one day.

713
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,540
You wonder who.

714
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,020
You wonder who.

715
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,560
You used to watch.

716
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,500
Who watched it anyway.

717
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,520
And what'd you do?

718
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,400
I used to work at the post office.

719
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,520
You scratch your head.

720
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,560
I scratch my head.

721
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,240
And look around.

722
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,480
I don't wanna, I don't wanna do that.

723
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,460
But what you lost.

724
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,900
Just so you see.

725
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,440
Will not be found.

726
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,380
It just can't be found.

727
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,420
Do you know what you are?

728
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,880
I'm gonna buy me a Mercedes.

729
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,380
You are what you are.

730
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,440
I need a big red one now.

731
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,440
You use what you have.

732
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,260
And I'm on a 450 SLC.

733
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,520
It count don't make half.

734
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,880
Oh yeah.

735
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,320
You ain't what you're not.

736
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:28,540
You ain't what you're not.

737
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:28,540


738
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:28,540


739
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:28,540


740
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:28,540


741
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,200
You got a club sticking out of the truck.

742
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,300
So you see what you got.

743
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,420
I'm going down to the Lincoln Square.

744
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,220
You are what you is.

745
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,840
Do you wanna see my grandma?

746
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,200
And that's all it is.

747
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:37,660
No ma'am.

748
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,320
I'm hiding from UFOs.

749
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,360
You are what you is.

750
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,220
This is some lumpy gravy you made here.

751
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,160
And that's all it is.

752
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,920
I look like a damn cabana.

753
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,320
You are what you is.

754
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
And your mama.

755
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:47,960
Oh.

756
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,060
And that's all it is.

757
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,240
Give me a car with a headlight.

758
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,000
You are what you is.

759
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,580
I'm about to shoot you.

760
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,000
And that's all it is.

761
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,280
I know a fat old policeman.

762
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,140
He's always on our street.

763
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,360
A fat and jolly, red-faced man.

764
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,560
He really is a treat.

765
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,580
He's too kind for a policeman.

766
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,360
He's never known to frown.

767
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,040
And everybody says he is the happiest man in town.

768
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:21,640
Aah.

769
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,120
Aha.

770
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,760
He laughs upon pointy feet, he laughs upon his feet

771
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,440
He laughs at everybody when he's walking in the street

772
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,100
He never can stop laughing, he says he's never tried

773
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,080
But once he did arrest a man and laughed until he cried

774
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,960
His jolly face it wrinkled and then he shut his eyes

775
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,660
He opened his great mouth and was a wondrous sight

776
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,060
He laughed at everybody when he's walking in the street

777
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,320
He said I must arrest you, he didn't know what for

778
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,260
And then he started laughing until he dragged his jaw

779
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,680
So if you chance to meet him when walking round the town

780
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,500
Just shake him by his fat old hand and give him half a crown

781
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,100
His eyes will beam and sparkle, he'll gurgle with delight

782
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,280
And then you'll start him laughing with all his blessed life

783
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:58,040
He laughs at everybody when he's walking in the street

784
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:26,200
He laughs at everybody when he's walking in the street

785
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,360
Gentle giggling and laughing

786
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,140
And singing

787
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,840
Dog panting

788
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:57,840
Dog panting

789
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,340
Pinky Booble.

790
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,160
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

791
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,540
Beautiful.

792
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,680
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

793
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:07,540
Raisin.

794
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,180
Ah, Bob.

795
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:17,660
I get up every day.

796
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,720
Work my life away.

797
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,460
I break my back.

798
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,600
I never get into slack

799
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,700
When X day comes, all you peeps better run

800
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,620
Cause the X-ists might blow up the sun

801
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,420
If slack was what I'd be sold

802
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,440
And if they can't take a joke

803
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,460
Atomic particles

804
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,240
Oppenheimer's blitz

805
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,300
But as for Bob

806
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,860
Yeah, he cut the shit

807
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,700
When X day comes, all you peeps better run

808
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,260
Bob's your own

809
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,640
Cause the X-ists might blow up the sun

810
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,680
Bob's your own

811
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,380
If slack was what I'd be sold

812
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,900
Bob's your own

813
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,360
And if they can't take a joke

814
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,400
Bob's your own

815
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,440
Bob's your own

816
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,720
You just can't believe everything you believe

817
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,720
You just can't believe it at all

818
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,820
You just can't believe it at all

819
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,640
You just can't believe it at all

820
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,000
You just can't believe it at all

821
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,360
You can't believe it at all

822
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,840
You can't believe it at all

823
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,000
You can't believe it at all

824
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,540
Oh yes, Bob's Your Uncle by the Reverend LeChuck

825
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,500
delivered to alt-binary slack in mp3.form.

826
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:31,760
Before that we heard Space Ghost with Minky Boodle

827
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,860
and You Are What You Is.

828
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,340
That was The Persuasions doing Zappa

829
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:40,680
from their album Frankly A Capella.

830
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,960
Before that we heard some preaching

831
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,760
from the Puffer Dome at Starwood 2000

832
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,600
with Einstein's Secret Orchestra

833
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,620
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

834
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,480

Once again, that's Bob at Box.

846
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,980

Abel meinen Honey

855
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,020
Abel meinen Honey

856
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,420
Abel meinen Honey

857
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,320
Well there once was a man

858
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,960
the world's greatest salesman

859
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,080
and he had devised a plan

860
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,300
to get the shanties from Baskin Robbins

861
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,760
Here I am, oh now he's gone

862
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,600
A martyr for the cause of his father

863
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,540
And he's coming again

864
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,520
Who knew that the first shot

865
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,480
Was gonna be the last shot

866
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,040
But he's got a hard driving pipe

867
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,160
The gas smoke all through the night

868
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,540
And although he may be hurting

869
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:38,040
The universe will keep on squirting

870
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,100
All the fun, oh

871
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,260
And he's coming again

872
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,360
He can save us from the men in black

873
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,660
With just a shot from his mighty sack

874
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,180
If only he could make it back

875
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,900
From the land of the dead

876
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,060
But until that happy day

877
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,560
We can only drink and say

878
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,740
Father's my Lord

879
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,960
And he's coming again

880
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,960
I know he can make it

881
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,840
Without him we can't take it

882
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,080
We'll lose the pieces of our minds

883
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,840
To the pink boys and the whims

884
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,040
Until the day that he comes back

885
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,460
It'll be over

886
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,880
We'll lose the pieces of our minds

887
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,160
To the pink boys and the whims

888
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,220
Until the day that he comes back

889
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,000
And he's coming again

890
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,320
Father's my Lord

891
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,200
Father's my Lord

892
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,000
Father's my Lord

893
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,840
Father's my Lord

894
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:18,840


895
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,520
Father's my Lord

896
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,240
And he's coming again

897
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,260
And if we don't want the exits upon us

898
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,000
And if we don't want the exits upon us

899
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Then we need Bob to be on his part

900
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,140
Then we need Bob to be on his part

901
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,740
Then we need Bob to be on his part

902
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,540
Then Bob is my Lord

903
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,800
Then Bob is my Lord

904
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,960
Then Bob is my Lord

905
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,260
Bob is my Lord

906
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,120
And he's coming again

907
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,580
Great God is coming

908
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,240
So bring my death

909
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,540
Again

910
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,560
Wow!

911
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,560
Praise Pope Bob!

912
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,340
This is an epistle from

913
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,480
This is an epistle from the Reverend David Lee Black

914
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,580
The Reverend David Lee Black

915
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,480
I don't believe this

916
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,460
Read the first and last paragraph

917
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,760
Dear fellow subgeni

918
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,820
The evil forces of anti-slack that prevent me from going to America

919
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:16,620
Are the very same ones that prevent me from being with my brothers and sisters of slack on X Day in Brushwood

920
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:17,700
Subsequently

921
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,140
I think he meant consequently

922
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,360
Subsequently

923
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:27,520
I must have my own X Day in Kiel, Germany with my brothers and sisters of slack here

924
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,460
There's nothing

925
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,460
I mean nothing

926
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,200
That will stop me from getting on board the intergalactic love ships

927
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,140
On Wednesday the 5th of July

928
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,060
And being with the rest of you

929
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,240
Not the DEA

930
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,160
Not Janet Cujo Reno

931
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,140
Not Bill Clinton and his hordes of concubines

932
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,120
Not customs

933
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:49,800
Not even Mulder and Scully and the reanimated corpse of J. Edgar Hoover

934
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,600
Could stop me when that platform lowers

935
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,480
The red carpet rolls out

936
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,420
And I'm carried on board in a throne like an African chieftain

937
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,140
By my leather clad alien love slaves of the cosmos

938
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,740
I had a dream the other night

939
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,140
Which makes me believe this year is the year

940
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,360
One of the love goddesses came to me in a dream

941
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,420
Like a space cherub loved succubus

942
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,900
She floated through the air and revealed to me a divine revelation

943
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,020
Which I make known to you now

944
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,680
On her right leg and left leg there were ten holes

945
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,640
And a piece in the middle there were three

946
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,660
And in the middle there were three holes

947
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,840
She could suckle

948
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,160
Twenty-three

949
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,740
Which is the number of the illuminated

950
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:36,320
She took my hand and we floated up to the heavens

951
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:40,280
The pills are kicking in about this part in the epiphany

952
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,380
A-bom-a-ged-i

953
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,500
And anyway he foresees a battle of Armageddon

954
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,260
Where the demonic forces which you guys were talking about

955
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,100
Which have enslaved the human race

956
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,580
With the yoke of bad television

957
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,820
And have sold them sportswear, media-induced self-conceit

958
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,640
Landmines and cheap adrenaline-producing drugs

959
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,940
To then herd their unwitting victims into soccer stadiums

960
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,940
And pop-star concert halls

961
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,920
Only to farm their pain and misery

962
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,120
To feed its insatiable appetite

963
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,840
For hurt and suffering

964
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,340
Have finally realized that the exes know about their evil intentions

965
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:23,220
To make hostile bids for benign alien space corporations

966
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:26,520
Only to peddle their superficial cheapness

967
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:26,820
Of the evil of the universe

968
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,740
Hollywood black magic and so space mines

969
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:34,480
So they can create a hell in space

970
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,000
The intergalactic federation of alien races

971
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,180
Which currently live in peace and harmony

972
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:44,920
Will not tolerate their universal garden of Eden

973
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,880
To be invaded by the evil monkey-snake god of earth

974
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,240
The evil demon monkey-snake god

975
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,940
Who will replace all the stars with poison apples

976
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:56,040
And sell fig leaves to the goddesses

977
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,880
Who have 23 holes

978
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,740
This is all black all right

979
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,700
As I looked down into earth

980
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,060
I saw the saucers hovering over brushwood

981
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,700
Lemuria and Kiel

982
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,400
I saw smaller craft hovering over several other locations

983
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,620
Where subgenius ministers who are rich in slack

984
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,760
But poor in human money supposedly reside

985
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,700
I could see the masses of the illuminated

986
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,080
With their suitcases of cool

987
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,880
Boarding the saucers of love, hope and happiness

988
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,680
As they did the armies of earth

989
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,080
Scrambled to destroy the invading love ships

990
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,680
Of the sex goddesses

991
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,480
The very threat to their existence

992
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,880
Then it was the great and final war

993
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,960
As the last space saucer

994
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,520
Sex space saucer lifted high into the heavens

995
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,040
I could see great war begin

996
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,760
The navies and air armadas

997
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,900
With their rapid response forces scrambling to attack

998
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,420
I could hear the sirens of war around the planet wailing

999
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,980
Heralding the inescapably impending doom

1000
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,100
That awaited citizens of this sinking battleship

1001
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,480
Of hate, war and misery

1002
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,660
But the great armies of earth didn't battle with the stars

1003
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,560
But the star cruisers of the love goddesses

1004
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,160
They battled with themselves

1005
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,880
They battled with each other

1006
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,160
For the right to battle with the invading saucers of slack

1007
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,520
Hovering above the planet as it burned

1008
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,140
I could hear the screams of billions of human souls

1009
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,840
Who weren't lucky enough to get off this planet with the chosen ones

1010
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,400
The alien sex goddesses took my hand again

1011
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,520
And floated with me back down to earth

1012
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,680
To my bed

1013
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,400
Back to my alcoholic narcosa

1014
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,680
And so I awakened with this revelation I now give

1015
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,880
And with this revelation I also send the symbolic other half

1016
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,940
In the form of a cake

1017
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:37,380
I want Stang to have everyone line up for this cake

1018
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,500
To be ritualistically served as communion of slack

1019
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,840
For all at Hex Day in Brushwood

1020
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:47,160
Make sure Nikki Death Chick gets a big piece

1021
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:52,160
I want a lion's share of the ass whopping next time I see her

1022
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:22,180
I want a lion's share of the ass whopping next time I see her

1023
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,040
moim phil
