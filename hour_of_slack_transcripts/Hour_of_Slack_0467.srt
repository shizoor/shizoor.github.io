1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:18,180
And you, yes you, are about to experience the awe and mystery that reaches from the

2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,920
inner mind to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,680
Uh, yes, and we're going to get right into it tonight, friends, because we have a lot

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,060
of ground to cover.

5
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,540
A whole lot of ground to cover.

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:42,480
This is going to be, uh, the Dr. Legumes super PR normal freak out special, uh, episode of

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,120
Hour of Slack here with Church of the Subgenius.

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:55,420
And, uh, and also we've got, um, the amazing tape Apocalypse Now the Opera by, uh,

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,560
Brain Rot West radio shorts.

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,160
I thought I was playing that last week, but it turned out to be, uh, just the prelude

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,660
to the actual opera itself.

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,420
But in the meantime, friends, I would like to read to you, uh, by way of introduction

13
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:20,040
to everything from this, uh, Christian newsletter called the Christian Sentinel, a quarterly

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,160
publication of Eastern Christian Outreach, September 1994.

15
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,900
They have...

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:37,300
Well, it's a little article in here called Peter Popoff Meets His Match by Jackie Alnor.

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,560
And there's a singularly inaccurate picture of our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

18
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,800
And it says here, Bob is sometimes referred to as deity.

19
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,660
The symbolic leader of the Church of the Subgenius is a caricature of a man whose 1930s

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,540
photo was used as the inspiration.

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,880
I'm sorry, but the leader of our church is not the caricature of a man.

22
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,820
He is a man who is a caricature of all men.

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,020
And, uh, actually, this music in the background is irritating the living daylights out of me.

24
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,260
Let's see if this is a little bit less busy.

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,220
Uh, Sosodata here in the background.

26
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,260
That sounds fairly smooth.

27
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,940
I think I can read this, uh, Christian article to you.

28
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,940
And, uh, to those of you who've never heard...

29
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,520
known anything about the Church of the Subgenius, in some ways, this article by our enemies

30
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,620
and the one I'm about to read from a newspaper, uh, may clue you in better than anything we

31
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,520
could say ourselves.

32
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,480
And according to this article, Peter Popoff meets his match in the Christian Sentinel.

33
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,180
Quote,

34
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:02,320
Dr. Legume, as he likes to be called, used the word cheesy to describe his group's literature.

35
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,440
He and Popoff have something in common.

36
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:12,020
Earlier this year, uh, ECHO, that's, uh, Eastern Christian Outreach Volunteers,

37
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,740
attended a Peter Popoff crusade in Philadelphia in order to hand out literature warning people

38
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,300
about the evangelists' deceitful fundraising methods.

39
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,640
Popoff is well known, especially in the Christian Sentinel, for his work on the Christian Sentinel.

40
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,640
And, uh, he's also known as the American Subgenius, his friend, for faking so-called words of

41
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,380
knowledge via an electronic listening device hidden in his ear, dictated by his wife as

42
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,740
she learned people's identities and ailments.

43
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,980
The discovery was made by the agnostic magician, the amazing Randy, who brought the recorded

44
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,900
evidence on Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show in the early 80s.

45
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,300
As we were standing in the driveway of the hotel where the Peter Popoff crusade was taking

46
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,620
place, holding our...

47
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,740
holding our signs that read,

48
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,140
Peter Popoff could be hazardous to your spiritual and financial health, we got into a somewhat

49
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:07,280
heated discussion with some of Popoff's devotees who were furious with us for taking a stand.

50
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,360
They were too young in the Lord to know of the now-faded memory of Popoff's 15 minutes

51
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,420
of humiliation on national television, which no doubt is one of the reasons that Popoff

52
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,400
has resurfaced.

53
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,420
As we were attempting to enlighten them, a large man wearing a clerical collar,

54
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,860
over a black turtleneck and dark jeans appeared.

55
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,040
He said nothing, but just listened in on the conversation.

56
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,380
When the hostile Popoff followers left, we turned our attention to the curiosity seeker.

57
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,920
He said he was on the same side as us, but that we wouldn't like his cult either.

58
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,320
When pressed for the identity of his group, he told us about the Church of the Subgenius.

59
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,000
Now this is unlike any...

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,440
Church.

61
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,100
That anyone is familiar with.

62
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,220
It's pretty much an organized, ongoing spoof of religion, both true and false.

63
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,960
I recognized the cartoon picture of the group's fictitious leader, Bob.

64
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,460
I had seen some of their literature that was distributed in the early 80s in Southern California

65
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,780
and remembered their cynical style of writing about religion.

66
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,900
Our strange ally, Dr. Legume, as he likes to be called, not his real name, actually it

67
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,920
is his real name, friends.

68
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,400
He used the word cheesy to describe his group's literature and described his church as a

69
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,520
Roll Your Own religion.

70
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:40,660
Members of the 1970s rock group Devo participated in the formation of the Church.

71
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,480
It didn't take long to discover the Subgenius' method of collecting the data that inspires

72
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,560
his writings.

73
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,820
We saw Dr. Legume again in the hotel ballroom as we waited for Popoff's crusade to begin.

74
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,180
He was standing in the rear by the book table.

75
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:03,720
He walked up to me wearing a Cheshire Cat grin, a Cheshire Shat eating grin one might say, and said,

76
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,280
Look what I found! Popoff's Bible!

77
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,260
He showed me a red leather Bible stuffed with notes and asked me if I wanted to make off with it.

78
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,480
I don't work that way, I responded. That would not be honest.

79
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,600
After the singing ended, Popoff took the stage and began to tell many stories about angels have helped believers in gaining finances.

80
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:30,480
Some friends wrote to me and gave me a testimony of how unseen angels protected their farmhouse from a tornado headed straight for them.

81
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,220
Unfortunately, said Popoff, I was going to show you the picture they sent of their intact house amid devastation all around,

82
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,700
but I had it in my Bible back there on the book table, and now it's gone.

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,700
I looked over at Dr. Legume, and he was wearing a devilish grin.

84
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,220
The Church of the Subgenius and Peter Popoff have something in common.

85
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,580
They both throw.

86
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,440
They both thrive on spiritual deception.

87
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,220
The difference is, the subgeniuses admit their own depravity, and Popoff denies his.

88
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:08,480
Dr. Legume ridicules things that are holy, as well as things that are not holy, and blurs the distinctives between the two.

89
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:17,760
Popoff lifts up what is holy, the Bible, and misuses it for his own ungodly gain, which discredits the Bible when people become victimized.

90
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,660
The results are the same.

91
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,580
Disillusionment.

92
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,920
Disillusionment in God and his word.

93
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,560
And yes, friends, it's true.

94
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,500
Our good friend, Dr. Legume, has shown up.

95
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,420
Actually, there's a photograph of Dr. Legume speaking with Peter Popoff.

96
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,600
He was, in fact, trying to warn Popoff about the evils of the Church of the Subgenius,

97
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:51,380
so that Popoff, in his hilarious radio broadcast, would start griping about this new threat to Jesus' power.

98
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,360
You know, even scarier than the Scientologists or the Moonies.

99
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,440
Dr. Legume has been a dues-paying subgenius for several years now.

100
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,340
He's a fine...

101
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:02,960
Oh, excuse me.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,720
A fine...

103
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,640
I shouldn't have eaten those Malaysian beans for dinner.

104
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:17,660
Dr. Legume is not only an excellent writer, known for his little comic books and his tracts, such as Evil Grinning Death,

105
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,500
a wonderful description of Bob,

106
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,860
also for his preaching, which he has frequent...

107
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,840
I have had the honor of preaching with Dr. Legume all over the East Coast.

108
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,440
He's rather an imposing-looking subgenius of the Sternoidean or Sternoidal type.

109
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,280
He actually is a steroid experiment.

110
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:48,760
He's a large, handsome, very muscular fellow who has a sort of a Clint Eastwood killer death long coat that he wears,

111
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,380
along with his clerical suit.

112
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,320
And his black semi-cowboy hat.

113
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,640
And kind of a skinhead look with a beard, but kind of a skinhead look to him.

114
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,580
Very short.

115
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,780
But wait a minute.

116
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,480
This music...

117
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,040
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,840
This music just...

119
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,420
Now it's fighting me again.

120
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,800
One has to constantly shift materials in and out here.

121
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,660
We'll put on an old standby here.

122
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,560
I believe this is...

123
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,880
Yes!

124
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,680
Yes!

125
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,480
But the best of all!

126
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,440
Better than being reported upon.

127
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:27,160
By some knee-jerk little fiddly-biddly Christian fanzine.

128
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:40,320
September 25th, on the front page of the Courier Times, one of the biggest newspapers in the state of Pennsylvania, servicing most of Philadelphia.

129
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:49,800
On the front page is this article about, well, prayer, praise, and a man named Bob.

130
00:09:49,800 --> 00:10:01,620
And there's this color photograph of the evil Dr. Legume showing off his Wings of Slack tattoo and his clerical collar,

131
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,560
and looking like he's about to hit somebody, possibly the photographer, right in the face.

132
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:16,920
And the article by the renowned Dana DeFilippo, or DePhilippo, or whatever, goes like this.

133
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,720
They worry.

134
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:19,780
They worry.

135
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,800
They're worried about witches and wackos.

136
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:37,640
So, vigilantly, Bill Park and his 20 Warriors for Christ watched over this weekend's happenings at the Philadelphia Conference on Cults, the Occult and Word Faith in Feasterville.

137
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,340
Quote,

138
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,300
It's a cult conference.

139
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:48,500
You never know if things could get out of hand, said Parks, a retired Philadelphia police officer,

140
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,820
who kept a firm grip on his walkie-talkie and a steady eye on the door.

141
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,940
Actually, it was the cult conference, billed as the biggest Christian conference on cults ever on the East Coast.

142
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:07,960
It drew about 1,000 Christian countercultists from across the country.

143
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:15,960
Their aim? To educate and network, but most importantly, to fight the growing presence of cults nationwide.

144
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,280
And on Friday, they didn't have to look far to start fighting.

145
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,020
Praise Bob!

146
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:30,840
Dr. Katahdin Legume strolled into the cafeteria at high noon, and everywhere, heads turned.

147
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,700
Maybe it was the clerical collar.

148
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,720
Most likely, it was the tattoos and black leather vest.

149
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,640
Whatever the reason, Legume didn't care.

150
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,620
He didn't come to cause trouble.

151
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,380
He wanted, simply put, to, quote,

152
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,380
give them a look in the ugly mirror.

153
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,100
And Dr. Legume continues,

154
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,380
A lot of churches, they insist that they're right and all the other churches are wrong,

155
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,640
said the 30-year-old Legume, an admitted cultist from Delaware County.

156
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,840
In our case, we'd have to say the same thing.

157
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,840
See cults 13a.

158
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,980
Let's see, ah, here we go.

159
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,960
That case is the Church of the Subgenius.

160
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,060
It's God.

161
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,840
J.R.

162
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,660
Bob.

163
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,600
Dobbs.

164
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,500
Bob was a salesman in the 1950s, Legume explained during a break in the conference Friday.

165
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,200
One day, he was working on a TV set.

166
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,720
The wiring went wrong, and he was zapped.

167
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,100
He had a vision, was seized up, and taken before Jehovah One.

168
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,540
Jehovah One, for all those unversed in the finer points of belief in Bob,

169
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,520
is the same Jehovah,

170
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:51,260
Christians believe in, except that subgenius followers think Jehovah was an extraterrestrial.

171
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,580
Jehovah One gave Bob the sacred prescriptures, Legume said.

172
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,860
And what did they say?

173
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:02,740
The message of the prescriptures is that we're right and they're wrong, Legume said,

174
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,780
gesturing to the Natalie-dressed mainstream Christian ministers eating lunch around him.

175
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,700
The conspiracy of normalcy took slacking off away from everyone,

176
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,500
and Bob wants us all to have that slack, too.

177
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,460
It sounds silly, and it is, Legume admitted.

178
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,660
It spoofs much of what mainstream religions preach.

179
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,560
Bob's wife, Connie, is known as the anti-virgin,

180
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,640
and subgenius worshippers go to devivals instead of revivals.

181
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,060
But the 40-year-old faith, headquartered in Texas, is serious,

182
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:42,180
and counts 75,000 to 100,000 members worldwide, Legume said.

183
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,880
Such numbers are what kept worried conference participants nodding their heads and shouting,

184
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,800
Amen, and praise God, as speakers denounced the evils of cults.

185
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,840
The three-day conference held at the Calvary Chapel of Lower Southampton

186
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,540
offered about 50 workshops on everything from Satanism to mind control.

187
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,220
Cults still are a tremendous problem, said Bill Alnor,

188
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,860
a Calvary Chapel staffer and president of the anti-cult Eastern Christian Outreach of Philadelphia,

189
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,540
the guy who wrote the article we read previously.

190
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,140
We get people out of cults every day.

191
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,580
Oh, this county boasts its share of cults,

192
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,180
most notably a large population of witches in the New Hope area, Alnor said.

193
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,460
I bet I know them witches.

194
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:40,940
What they say about how cold they are is not true.

195
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,220
Conference-goers define cults rather broadly to include televangelism,

196
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,140
the Mormon Church, Islam ,

197
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,680
Scientology, and any non-Christian faiths.

198
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,040
It's been a problem for an eternity and probably will be forever,

199
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,160
said Pat Ryan, a Philadelphia counter-cult counselor

200
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,820
and former member of a transcendental meditation cult in which followers believed they could fly.

201
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,740
That was TM, where they'd go hopping around on their butt muscles.

202
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,480
But that doesn't mean it's a lost cause.

203
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,300
Cancer's existed forever, but we try to prevent it and help the people who have it.

204
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,540
That's what we've got to do with cults.

205
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,880
And you know the wonderful thing about that conference and the way this newspaper reported on it

206
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,420
was they gave Dr. Legume and the Church of the Subgenius three-quarters of the article.

207
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,820
And, uh, and...

208
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,800
So...

209
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,240
Speaking of evil Dr. Legume...

210
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,780
By the way, although I don't believe he listens to the Hour of Slack in Philadelphia,

211
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,720
I must, must congratulate him on that.

212
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,840
Really, one of the greatest subgenius PR scams yet.

213
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,420
He is a master of the royal mind-rape of the normals.

214
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,300
He truly is.

215
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,580
And to prove that, I'm going to take a plunge and play you a tape,

216
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,540
which I will have to severely and probably most clumsily edit,

217
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,720
uh, for profanity and bor- boring stretches.

218
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:26,580
A tape of Dr. Legume initiating a young would-be subgenius.

219
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,780
He was a dues-paying subgenius, but, well, until we got through with him,

220
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:38,040
you might call him sort of a praise-Bob, gimme-slacks-spouting Bobby.

221
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,520
He was just a young feller.

222
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,040
Young Reverend Josh.

223
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,440
I can understand that.

224
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,160
I was the same.

225
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,020
I was the first one.

226
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,740
I was the first of the Bobbies myself.

227
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,400
I was initiated just, well, in rather a different way.

228
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,800
It took longer in those days.

229
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,660
Dr. Legume, over a period of a year, developed this initiation.

230
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,380
And I cannot give you the final punchline,

231
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,360
and I cannot play the end of the tape,

232
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,560
because that would ruin it for everyone else.

233
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,160
But the build-up to it is quite nice.

234
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:07,940
Hopefully.

235
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,120
This is assuming I edited it well.

236
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,800
To set the scene.

237
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:18,280
This happened at a place that those anti-cultists,

238
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,260
if they could see it for half a second,

239
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,020
would flip their lids, drop their drawers,

240
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,280
and bend over, giving up forever.

241
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,980
Because the power of the cults would look so attractive to them.

242
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:37,100
I'm talking about the Starwood Festival in rural New York,

243
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,380
held in the woods at a big sort of campground in rural New York every year.

244
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,980
The Starwood Festival actually is,

245
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,920
it's more like Mondo 2000 come to life,

246
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,440
with a smattering of witches and druids doing their corny thing here and there,

247
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,460
and sort of cyber weirdos doing their spectacular things here and there.

248
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,320
There are always subgenius revivals.

249
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,620
It's one of my favorite events.

250
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,420
I love it.

251
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,400
It's good, clean fun.

252
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,840
And especially since they have hot showers and so forth there.

253
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,000
Anyway, Friday night, I believe it was, at the festival,

254
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,800
very, very late, Dr. Legume rattled my tent door,

255
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,480
woke me up, said,

256
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,440
Reverend Stang, I got young Reverend Joshua primed.

257
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,840
He's going to go through the initiation.

258
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,520
Grab your tape recorder and let's do it.

259
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,380
So I come hobbling out of the tent,

260
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,600
with my little handheld deck stuck in my pocket,

261
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,900
with a mic clipped to my belt buckle.

262
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,620
And we meet Reverend Josh in the woods,

263
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,620
and stride off across this field in the dead of night.

264
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,760
Now, while you're listening to the tape,

265
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,180
keep in mind that it is a stormy night.

266
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,180
It's not raining, but there's thunder and lightning.

267
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,440
And the wind is whipping pretty hard.

268
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,660
You may hear that on the mic.

269
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,260
And on top of that, I mean, this is a pagan sort of festival.

270
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,460
There is drumming going on all the time.

271
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,640
Primitive, proto-Zermatic drumming.

272
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,880
The drumming of Ahor.

273
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,740
Like something to summon the demons from below hell.

274
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,500
Actually, there's not a Satanist around.

275
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,240
A lot of subgeniuses.

276
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,500
Well, let's just go to that tape before I take up any more time.

277
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,760
And then after that, we will hear just some more,

278
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,360
much more slickly recorded material from Reckless.

279
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,960
Radio shorts, the apocalypse now.

280
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,280
Opera.

281
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,400
But for now, let's go into that horrible replay

282
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,960
of the disgusting and terrifying for this young man.

283
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,820
Because, you know, he didn't know Dr. Legume,

284
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,900
and he didn't know me.

285
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,860
And he's like this college kid from up north

286
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,340
who has come to see his subgenius heroes preach.

287
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,740
Well, they probably weren't his heroes when all was said and done.

288
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,660
But knowing this, of course, Dr. Legume and I

289
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:13,300
cranked up our fierce redneck accents to the max.

290
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,960
Legume's appearance I have described.

291
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,760
I, nowadays, kind of look like David Koresh

292
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,840
crossed with Charlie Manson,

293
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,320
crossed with Howard Stern.

294
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,720
And, uh, it's just the sorts of things,

295
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,580
you know, these sort of tattooed, covered rednecks.

296
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,300
The kind who would most,

297
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:41,000
uh, easily, uh, intimidate a trusting young, uh, a Yankee.

298
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,620
So, we go now to those tapes.

299
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,580
Thank you.

300
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,120
Which kid is this? Do I know him?

301
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,660
His name is Joshua.

302
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,520
Oh, yeah. Okay.

303
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,720
Joshua is standing in the future.

304
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,500
Oh, right.

305
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,140
Ready for his test of faith.

306
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,260
Yeah, I want to see this.

307
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,100
You better stand.

308
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,720
Yeah, we're gonna go.

309
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,160
Greetings.

310
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,780
Howdy.

311
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,860
I am Joshua.

312
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,920
Yeah. Have we met before?

313
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,260
Uh, I bought a tape from you.

314
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,620
Showed it to some friends.

315
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,740
They really, they haven't been able to sit down for a week.

316
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,880
Uh-huh.

317
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,180
Had a party, uh.

318
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,160
Won't be able to do all kinds of things for a week after this.

319
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,200
Yeah, the old subgenius test of faith.

320
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,840
See, you really like Bob.

321
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,080
You talk about Bob an awful lot, don't you?

322
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,600
It's time to learn.

323
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,860
Go have a little chat with Bob ourselves.

324
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,420
What do you say?

325
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,380
It's not illegal to talk with this man, Bob.

326
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,180
Yeah.

327
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:41,740
His...

328
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,880
You might be seeing him face to face if you're not careful.

329
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,180
They always want to get close to Bob.

330
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,760
As long as it's face to face and not some other orifice to orifice.

331
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,700
Oh, no, no. Nothing like that.

332
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,740
Young Joshua pulls out a toy plastic knob.

333
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,700
Come, let's take a walk over to where I can find a place for me to sit.

334
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,660
I think I'm going to need a little more.

335
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:04,660


336
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,080
But, um...

337
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,340
Uh...

338
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,140
The boy is now walked to a, uh...

339
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,860
Doesn't he need like a table or a altar or something?

340
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,460
There's sort of a little area right over here with a whole bunch of...

341
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,020
I don't want to use the car because...

342
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,960
Yeah, let me stop here.

343
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,400
Um.

344
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:25,020
Dr. Legume is leading us over to what basically looks like an altar in the middle of a field

345
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:30,000
far, far away from where anybody could hear the screams of pain.

346
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,700
And, so, therefore it's rather spooky or something.

347
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,720
You know, the kid, there really isn't anybody around to help him.

348
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,340
It's very, very dark and very stormy and spooky.

349
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,500
And in the middle of this field is like a teepee frame.

350
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:55,260
It was later used to fill up with logs so that the gigantic bonfire could be created on that spot.

351
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:08,500
But this Friday night, it was just this mysterious looking bunch of long logs set, lashed together in sort of a teepee shape.

352
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:20,700
And in the center were, well, was one very large stump, a chopped off stump, forming sort of a table, kind of a mysterious altar thing.

353
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,580
So let's see.

354
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,280
This guy's in this cute little plastic place, visiting it out.

355
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,240
I have a stake that is irretractable.

356
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,560
Oh, man.

357
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,040
Dr. Legume is displaying the spike.

358
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,620
That's what you used on the last guy?

359
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,220
Yep.

360
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,340
It's a good thing I only had to do the ganja bar.

361
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:52,100
This spike, dear friends, is like a railroad spike, a stainless steel, very sharp spike, about nine inches long.

362
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,060
I've got a lighter.

363
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,760
That's okay. I've got a blind bolt.

364
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,720
Oh, that's right. That's right. I forgot about the blind bolt.

365
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,300
Here's a suitable piece of wood.

366
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,920
What is this thing?

367
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,840
Is this like, oh, this is where they, uh...

368
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,220
This is where they bring the sacrifices.

369
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:06,900
That's right.

370
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,920
You can't sacrifice my friend.

371
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,440
I told you. I told you a thousand times.

372
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,220
Whoa. Yeah, this is good. This is just right.

373
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,160
Man, it's pre-made.

374
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,180
A little bit of blood.

375
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,740
A little bit of blood.

376
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:24,740


377
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:24,740


378
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:24,740


379
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,220
We bring them forth.

380
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,100
A lot of blood.

381
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,680
Whoa.

382
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,020
This is...

383
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,640
They've been doing some maypole.

384
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,920
Look at this. Look at this stump.

385
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,920
Come on.

386
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,720
The sacrifice. The slack-rifice. Yeah, the slack-rifice.

387
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,480
Check your soul at the door, boy.

388
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,480
Okay? So you want to know what the test of faith is all about.

389
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:47,900
Okay?

390
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,260
I'm going to take your hand, and I'm going to hold it down here on this table.

391
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,580
Okay?

392
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,940
And I'm going to do it.

393
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,460
I'm going to do this left-handed because I'm right-handed.

394
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,580
I can't even legally drink yet.

395
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh, you'll need to after I get through with you here.

396
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,580
Your nuts will drop after this.

397
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,560
Yeah, I have to do this left-handed.

398
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,240
Uh...

399
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,500
Okay, give me your hand.

400
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,580
Put it down here on the table.

401
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,780
Okay.

402
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,820
Here's what I'm going to do.

403
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,460
I'm going to take this spike,

404
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,720
and I'm going to try to get it out of the way.

405
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:24,720


406
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,640
And drive it into this tree stump without touching your hand.

407
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,840
With a head full of LSD.

408
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,540
A dangerous witness right here

409
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,480
who will collaborate with anything that I say.

410
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,040
And a blindfold.

411
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,740
I swear...

412
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,660
And all you have to do...

413
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,020
...to the altar of Almighty God that if...

414
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,180
A who?

415
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,420
...any mention of blood...

416
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,760
Oh, man, you're in the wrong damn place for that.

417
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,500
You think you're safe here?

418
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,460
Oh, man, you're gonna...

419
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,300
Well, it just wasn't me talking.

420
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,140
Look at this.

421
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,840
The white man named it after the dog.

422
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,000
This guy loves Bob so much, and here he is talking to God.

423
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,560
Is he talking to Bob now?

424
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,700
Now when he's facing having this spike driven right through his hand Jesus-style?

425
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,560
Well, prayers ain't gonna do much good no matter who it is.

426
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,320
You don't know who I am, do you?

427
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,540
You've probably only heard horror stories from all the other preachers about me.

428
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,800
I come hopping into your life like a fluffy little bunny of love.

429
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,560
Yeah, do it, do it. It's okay.

430
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,000
You saw that movie Aliens?

431
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,820
Did you see Aliens?

432
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,220
Yeah.

433
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,180
Where the android can go ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba like that?

434
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,740
It's sort of like that, but...

435
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,560
But it's, it's...

436
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,400
You know, not...

437
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,640
He didn't try to get in between each finger or anything like that.

438
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,520
He only has to do it once.

439
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,700
I only have to do it once.

440
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,360
That's right.

441
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:50,460
Now, it could be that I just really, really get off on inflicting all of these big Jesus holes in people's hands.

442
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,960
That would be a common characteristic among men who wander around...

443
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,480
Yeah, this doesn't have to be.

444
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,960
...the pagan festivals with church, uh, Catholic priest collars on.

445
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,660
They have a thing for stigmata.

446
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,000
Okay?

447
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,940
So I may just get off on doing this.

448
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:09,160
And I may do it just for chits and giggles, and it doesn't matter because he's got the shovel and I got the trash bags.

449
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,420
So nothing bad's gonna happen on us one way or another.

450
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,160
No one will ever know.

451
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,480
No one will ever know.

452
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,740
All you gotta do, man, is have faith and put your hand out here on this wall.

453
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,480
Yeah. Yeah. You're trusting in God this morning.

454
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,980
This is, this is, this will pretty much determine whether you get on the escape vessels or not.

455
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,040
And they are real.

456
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,500
This, this is gonna, this is gonna make or break your, your, uh, seating, uh, category.

457
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:43,440
Can this event itself actually determine the...

458
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,800
He asks too many questions.

459
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,680
...the foreshadow of the future?

460
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,560
Well, we assume you, you, you got your membership pack, right?

461
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,280
...was once future untold.

462
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,140
Did, did you get your membership pack? Did you ever order the $20 membership?

463
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,060
Yes, I have my ordained membership card in the church.

464
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,480
And you got your card. Oh, well, you've got nothing to worry about.

465
00:27:59,580 --> 00:27:59,800
...lovely subgenius.

466
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,300
You've got nothing to worry about.

467
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,080
Except for right now.

468
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,860
Oh, not if he has faith. That's the whole thing.

469
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,200
Not if he has faith.

470
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:19,520
Look, the only ones who are gonna get ruptured up on X-Day are the ones who can watch the other subgeniuses bursting into flame and screaming and hold their membership card and say,

471
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,160
I'm not gonna tear it up. I have faith. I'm just abandoning the shell.

472
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,240
It's like taking your shoes off.

473
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,520
It's as easy as that.

474
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,420
It'll be just like taking off a glove.

475
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,920
You'll have a new body aboard the escape vessel.

476
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,400
You'll even have a new hand.

477
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,740
Is that how it was said to you originally, or...

478
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,440
Well...

479
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,400
You don't think all these dark storm clouds and the wind around here are just for dramatic purpose, do you?

480
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,440
Just coincidence.

481
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,380
The drums don't mean anything.

482
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,380
No, they don't mean anything.

483
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,620
The yogg's have fought three times during the ceremony.

484
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,020
What's the matter, man? You keep pulling your hand off of the stump.

485
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,540
I may have.

486
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,140
Are you nervous?

487
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,420
I'd be damn nervous if I were you.

488
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,640
I'd be going, God damn it, Bob, I know you're there.

489
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,600
I know you're there.

490
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,900
Find out.

491
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,380
Find out if Bob's there.

492
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,980
Hey, you wanted to talk?

493
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,540
I know he's there. You know he's there.

494
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:14,680
We all have the scar.

495
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,260
Somewhere, wherever he is.

496
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,940
Which I don't know. All I know is it was very similar to this.

497
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,000
Look. Look at the scar.

498
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,700
It was a long time ago.

499
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,380
About, uh...

500
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,160
Where is it?

501
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,280
I was... It was right in the middle of the back of my hand.

502
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,460
Oh yeah, sure enough.

503
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,620
Yeah.

504
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,780
Yours shows. Mine doesn't show.

505
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:37,740
Yeah.

506
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,660
Eventually it heals.

507
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,200
You can't tell because of all the other ones.

508
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,860
Well, you know, the Yeti biology, we can absorb these things pretty well.

509
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,540
Hey man, I just started. Come on.

510
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,380
Somebody was not yeti by some strange coincidence.

511
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,660
If this guy had no Yeti blood in him, then...

512
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,580
Oh man, I'd hate to think I'll stumpy me if I stuck this spike in his hand.

513
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,420
At this point, I have no friend in the universe.

514
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,400
It's Yeti blood.

515
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,080
You have no friend in the universe? What about Bob?

516
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,420
Bob is your friend. You paid him 20 bucks to be your pal.

517
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,260
But will he be the pal of young Reverend Joshua?

518
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,380
We'll find out on side two of show.

519
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,560
What do you mean?

520
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:26,640
Friends, we now return to the initiation of young Reverend Joshua at the hands of Dr. Legume at Reverend's stand.

521
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,260
It's like a halfway faith.

522
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,000
It's a halfway knife.

523
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,720
You know, it's like being halfway pregnant. There's no such thing.

524
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,080
It's all or nothing.

525
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,480
It's all or nothing, man.

526
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,920
You gotta be willing to spill your blood on a stump for Bob.

527
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,340
20 dollars plus all.

528
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,660
Or nothing at all.

529
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,560
I mean, hey man.

530
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,460
The blood that soaks into this stump could be

531
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:46,880
your own.

532
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,420
Go for it. He's gonna prove this guy's got balls.

533
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,080
What blood type are you?

534
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,820
Jeff, by the way.

535
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,680
Well, see, that's the one thing, you know, when I was in New York

536
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,640
and he was facing me with that gun,

537
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,960
I didn't bother to ask.

538
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,320
You would face a man with a gun, but not a priest with a spike.

539
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,380
That's been said.

540
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,640
A cop in Baltimore actually said the same thing

541
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,080
about tentatively inconvenience.

542
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,820
He said, I'd rather face a man with a gun

543
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,320
than what I saw in that tunnel.

544
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,200
And it was just artwork.

545
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,700
That's all the guy was doing.

546
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,420
It was the horse smellin'.

547
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:18,640
It's all performance art, right?

548
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,360
Yeah, it's just performance art. It's just a gag.

549
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,120
It's like Penn and Teller, you know.

550
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,160
And you, young Joshua, your part is the bleeding man.

551
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,800
Yeah.

552
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,180
Yeah, you drew the wrong card, man.

553
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,040
When you pulled the wild card, you were

554
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,580
you came up a joker.

555
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,380
Some are aces, some are jokers.

556
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,560
Does that mean that I'm gonna be impaled on this

557
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,280
piece of wood just for your sick amusement?

558
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:41,580
He was one of the ones that we chose, especially for this.

559
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,680
Bob's a joker, too.

560
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,100
People think he's an ace, but he's really a joker.

561
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:46,680
Yeah.

562
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,340
So, you know, he's your friend.

563
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,980
So is Bob gonna be your friend, man?

564
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,100
Yeah, or is Bob gonna go,

565
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,560
man, he came so close.

566
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,100
He came so close.

567
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,700
Keep it up.

568
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,360
He's talking to Bob again.

569
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,500
Bob's not listening to you, man.

570
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,100
Why don't you put your hand on the snow?

571
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,320
Bob's got Connie. Bob's going down on Connie

572
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,440
somewhere back in those trees over there.

573
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,160
I don't know why he does this to me.

574
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,640
He just circles buzzwords

575
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,600
around my head.

576
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,400
Well, you won't do that anymore after this.

577
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,640
That's what I'm hoping.

578
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,360
That's right. There you go.

579
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,020
He's getting there. He's getting there.

580
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,460
There's hope. There's hope?

581
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,600
Okay, let's get this over with. Come on, I'm getting tired of this.

582
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,860
Yeah, this is getting kind of old, man.

583
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,500
Yeah.

584
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,200
He may not have that special spark.

585
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,700
He may not have that special spark.

586
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,120
He might have to go into it.

587
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,000
Todd, you are never gonna get another chance like this.

588
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,720
He had shown it to me.

589
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,040
No, don't try to interpret it.

590
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,240
Take it literally, man. There's no interpretation.

591
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,420
There was this smiling face above my head

592
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,660
while I was looking at him.

593
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,900
He's babbling. He's scared to death now.

594
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,420
Come on, stick your hand on there.

595
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,300
Stick your hand on there. Okay, there you go.

596
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,820
I'm gonna hold him in place.

597
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,380
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

598
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,900
I gotta put on the blindfold.

599
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,400
J.R. Bob Dobson.

600
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,880
And the flowers were sort of like spinning,

601
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,080
grinning Dob's heads while they were

602
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,020
looking around.

603
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,980
Looking down at me, this

604
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,240
grinning figure.

605
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,980
Oh, okay.

606
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,900
What was that?

607
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,240
Nothing.

608
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,120
Okay, go ahead.

609
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,560
Keep it up, Bob. Keep it up.

610
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,340
Because I didn't want to accidentally impale him

611
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,620
while I was trying to impale you.

612
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:28,840
That's okay.

613
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,700
The trembling is perfectly normal.

614
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,820
I've trembled all my life.

615
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,280
See what I mean?

616
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,520
Your hand isn't on the stump anymore.

617
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,100
Look, his hand left the stump.

618
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,700
Is Bob pulling your hand off of the stump?

619
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,640
It is not Bob that pulls your hand off.

620
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,840
Bob is drawing your hand to the stump.

621
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,660
Bob is pulling your hand from the stump.

622
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,560
Bob, good one.

623
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,820
Go towards the light.

624
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,320
There you go. Okay, now put it there.

625
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,800
Now don't move it. Don't move it.

626
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,600
Alright. Dr. Leguima is lining up.

627
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,340
Okay.

628
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,800
He's pulling the blindfold down.

629
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,080
Captain Zegematic.

630
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,680
He's down into...

631
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,280
Alright.

632
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,460
Okay.

633
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,320
Standing by.

634
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,780
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

635
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,220
Your blindfold? I didn't see you put that blindfold on.

636
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:15,980
Excuse me, sir.

637
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,320
Don't move your hand.

638
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,600
Excuse me, sir.

639
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,000
Test of faith.

640
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,920
Test of faith? Where's your faith at?

641
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,540
What do you mean, excuse me, sir?

642
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,440
Excuse me who? Are you talking to me?

643
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,880
I felt a moment of doubt in this situation.

644
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,280
Your faith in Bob is shaken, isn't it?

645
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,860
Don't ask for forgiveness whatever you do, man.

646
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:36,780
Don't pray.

647
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,760
That's the worst thing you can do.

648
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,760
They will draw down just the ones you don't want to be hurt.

649
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:42,760


650
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,600
That's it, man.

651
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,920
They'll take you...

652
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,160
They'll juice out of you like a stump will when I get done.

653
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:48,880
Okay.

654
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,900
I felt a moment of doubt.

655
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,020
No, no. That's okay. They always do.

656
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,300
They always feel the moment of doubt.

657
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,520
He did. You can barely see that scar.

658
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,840
Yeah, this is true.

659
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,320
Okay. I just want to make sure that you don't move.

660
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,060
Is this really necessary?

661
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,760
Yes, this is.

662
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,240
This is vital.

663
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,120
This is the most necessary thing that has ever happened to you in your life.

664
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,760
It's a beautiful thing.

665
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,620
No, no.

666
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,240
Go ahead.

667
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,620
Now he's getting horrible stomach cramps of doubt.

668
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,400
You have to put him right back there.

669
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,780
We've got to do this.

670
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,660
He's got thousands...

671
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,140
Here you go.

672
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,220
Don't move your fingers.

673
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,340
Don't clench your fist.

674
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:31,660
No, man.

675
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,560
On your mark.

676
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,200
In the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

677
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,960
Connie Dobbs,

678
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,420
and the X's fighting team,

679
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,260
Tova 1.

680
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,520
And at that point, dear friends,

681
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:51,940
in deference to the delicate sensibilities of the listener,

682
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:58,300
we tastefully must cut away and move on to other things.

683
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,920
I will say that Reverend Joshua did not only survive,

684
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,840
he passed the initiation with flying colors,

685
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,320
and in fact went on to accompany Dr. Legume

686
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,760
at that self-same time.

687
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:12,760


688
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:12,760


689
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:12,760


690
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:12,760


691
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:12,760


692
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:12,760


693
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:12,760


694
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,740
He was also a member of the so-called anti-cult festival,

695
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,520
where he comported himself in accordance with the dignity

696
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,000
and terrifyingness that is the birthright, yes,

697
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,860
of the true subgenius,

698
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,100
the son or daughter of the Yeti.

699
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,320
So hail the good Reverend Joshua,

700
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,880
and certainly the great Dr. Legume.

701
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,260
As for what tape we will be hearing next,

702
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,740
I will tell you in the next few minutes.

703
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,740


704
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,740


705
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,740


706
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,740


707
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,740


708
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,740


709
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,240
I have no idea.

710
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,320
Thank you.

711
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,900
Now, Reverend Stang's radio show

712
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,360
got cancelled

713
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,220
recently down in Texas.

714
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,740
Well, it got cancelled down in Texas

715
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,540
by some nice man named Bobby

716
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,320
who said that his show did not empower

717
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,400
the common man.

718
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,140
Oh, no.

719
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,780
It doesn't empower the common man.

720
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:10,800
Well,

721
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,680
I'm standing right here to tell you that

722
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,960
this man's wrong,

723
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,800
because, hell, if it wasn't for

724
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,980
Reverend Stang's Church of the Subgenius,

725
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,360
I'd have climbed that damn tower

726
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,460
long ago with a rifle.

727
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,180
Some of us already did.

728
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,080
Yeah, and

729
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,500
the church has come in on a lot of hard times

730
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,340
recently, and

731
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,200
they need money.

732
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,360
Lots of it!

733
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,700
Lots of money.

734
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,800
And we all could think that...

735
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,020
Y'all could sit back and think,

736
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,140
oh, it's another sales pitch for Reverend Stang.

737
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,200
But,

738
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,060
hey, the longer Reverend Stang

739
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,500
can put out the word, Bob,

740
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,740
the longer there's going to be people like me

741
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,320
who are ready to climb the damn tower

742
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,640
who are going to look around and they're going to say

743
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,800
to themselves, hey,

744
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,640
it's time to take back

745
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,560
what's mine. It's time to take back my

746
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:04,960
slack.

747
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,380
Does anybody here want to take back their slack?

748
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,080
Yes!

749
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,700
Because you ain't going to just have it handed to you.

750
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,620
You gotta take that slack.

751
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,820
You gotta take that slack back.

752
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,700
Oh yeah, oh yeah, little man.

753
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,380
We will see you with the spike later.

754
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,780
And you will see how well

755
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,140
Bob will protect you.

756
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,620
See, I have my happy Bob shirt

757
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,740
on today, don't I?

758
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,580
Oh, oh, I love

759
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,000
Bob just as much as you.

760
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,460
Come into the darkness with me and my

761
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,580
spike, and I will show you

762
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,360
how much Bob loves you, little man.

763
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,120
It will deprogram you Bob-style.

764
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,620
You can laugh,

765
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,320
you can point your finger,

766
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,380
and you can talk about good old Bob

767
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,280
and how happy it is that you're out here

768
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,900
with Bob.

769
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,280
And you can sit there

770
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,860
and sing your happy little songs

771
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,740
about Bob and the bleeding head

772
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,760
of Arnold Palmer.

773
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,540
But when that spike's

774
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,620
sinking through your palm

775
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,900
and you're whistling in the wind like Jesus

776
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,180
or finding some new way to jump off

777
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,040
like this through your stigmata hole,

778
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,400
I like that.

779
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,360
And we'll see where Bob's gonna take you.

780
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,160
And we'll see if Bob's gonna

781
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,060
protect you. And we're gonna see

782
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,980
if you want your

783
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,920
sixty dollars.

784
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,980
You want your triple your money back? I tell you,

785
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,040
if I had a bag full of twenties, I'd go through this crowd

786
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,060
right now, and I'd give half of you your damn sixty

787
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,160
dollars back right now.

788
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:36,440
Oh.

789
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,120
I'll be carrying my garbage out

790
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,880
in a bag made of all of your skins

791
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,280
tonight.

792
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,580
Oh.

793
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,960
Oh, yes, Bob

794
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,100
will have a use for you.

795
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,080
He'll make you into a corn

796
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,500
on the cob holder, little man.

797
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,040
He may

798
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,780
make you into a corn on the cob holder.

799
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,760
That's, believe me, that was old

800
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,140
history. He'll make you the back end

801
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,020
of his rotisserie.

802
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,900
I'll be back in a little while

803
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,540
while Bob gets back in his

804
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:36,540


805
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:36,840
believe me, I'll be going in a perpetual

806
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,020
palms for rejoice, and

807
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,140
presented by Lauren Swelk and the usual suspects.

808
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,580
Ladies and gentlemen, and children of all ages,

809
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,020
Apocalypse Now, the opera.

810
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,160
applause

811
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,000
All shots

812
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,000
Stuck in Saigon

813
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,160
Without a mission

814
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,800
Wake up!

815
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,760
Wake up!

816
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,700
Wake up!

817
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,120
It's time to

818
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,240
Wake up, Willard, there's no time to lose

819
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:58,060
Let's clean up all this blood, my God, you stink of booze

820
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,040
It's time to hit the shower

821
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,780
To hit the shower

822
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,780
Throw him in the shower

823
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,260
Arrgh!

824
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,320
Have a shrimp, jumbo shrimp

825
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,740
It's a bit like the Army Intelligence

826
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:28,080
And jumbo shrimp, they're both oxymorons

827
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,840
Willard, please, tell us, please

828
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,020
Can you spell CIA?

829
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,480
If you can, Willard, please

830
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,000
Will you spell CIA?

831
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,080
Kill Colonel Kurtz

832
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,300
Your mission's a loop, decide to accept it

833
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,040
If you go and terminate Colonel, terminate Colonel, terminate Colonel, terminate Colonel

834
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,460
Kurtz is not in your band

835
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,220
He's bad, he's bad

836
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,360
You must go up the river, pass the Durong Bridge

837
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,780
And you must terminate Colonel, terminate Colonel, terminate Colonel, terminate Colonel

838
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,640
Kurtz is deadly rebel, war command

839
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,480
Go back!

840
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,420
Come back!

841
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,080
Go back!

842
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:09,900
Hey!

843
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,480
Hey!

844
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,180
Hurry! Hurry!

845
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,660
Terminate Colonel Kurtz?

846
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,160
Aye-ya!

847
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,860
The Train

848
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,540
The Train

849
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,600
The Train

850
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,560
The Train

851
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,220
The Train

852
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:55,220


853
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:55,220


854
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:06,120
To went underground

855
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:06,440
Turn in the air

856
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,520
The Train

857
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:08,320
The Train

858
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:08,600
To the right

859
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:08,600


860
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:08,700
As you see, on this sign

861
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,100
Tell him I've got either funÖ

862
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,100


863
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,380
Cause she says, ìTo hell with the worldî

864
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:09,380


865
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:09,380


866
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:09,420
Tell her who I am

867
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:09,540
And you'receready white bitchring in here

868
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:09,540


869
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,520
Holy and loud!

870
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,960
Vigil enemies are true!

871
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,600
Holy and loud!

872
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,860
A problem for the few, for the few!

873
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,380
Yeah!

874
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:24,960
There's cavalry is here, there's nothing for to fear, we've got our butts in gear!

875
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,120
Hey, Brevin, where's the beer?

876
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:31,260
There's cavalry's exciting, just a little frightening, bring your surfboard here!

877
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,340
Now soldier, would you rather surf or go and fight?

878
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,300
Now soldier, would you rather surf or go and fight?

879
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,700
Oh, super-dye, oh, super-dye, oh, super-dye, oh, super-dye, oh, super-dye!

880
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,200
Air-cat!

881
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,840
We're over budget, we're over budget, we're over budget!

882
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,180
We're shooting now!

883
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,720
Big but a bunting, big but a bunting, big but a bunting!

884
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,740
What can we do?

885
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:13,300
Keep it rolling, look like you're fighting, look like you're fighting, we are the noose!

886
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,160
Taking the choppers!

887
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,460
The bank is falling!

888
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,940
And I can saw you!

889
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,680
That's what I say!

890
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,400
We are the noose!

891
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,260
We are the noose!

892
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:31,720
We are the noose!

893
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,620
We are the noose!

894
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:33,500
We are the noose!

895
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,240
We are the noose!

896
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,400
We are the noose!

897
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,920
We are the noose!

898
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:47,920


899
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,200
It's all broke now!

900
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,820
Aren't they gnarly? I wish I was a serpent!

901
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,640
A big foot in the world!

902
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,680
Woodland Wagner!

903
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,180
You guys are crazy!

904
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,900
Woodland Wagner!

905
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,480
Just as the goose

906
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,840
Will ever march and keep it rolling

907
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,120
March and it's there!

908
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,420
Ha ha ha ha ha! Till I sing!

909
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,960
I'm a serpent! I'm a serpent!

910
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:46,260
I'm a serpent! I'm a serpent!

911
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,580
I'm a serpent! I'm a serpent!

912
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,220
I love the smell of victory!

913
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,480
It smells like Nepal!

914
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,220
You can listen to the conflicts now

915
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,480
The opera, Act 1, The Only Turnback, 2, and these messages.

916
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,120
End of Act 1

917
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:29,320
While we pause for our intermission, I should like to borrow a few moments to read some of the weekly community service reminders just handed to me.

918
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,380
The Church of the Bizarre Shepherd will be holding its fourth annual chapter of the Bizarre Shepherd.

919
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:35,380


920
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,320
It will be a charity foot wash all day Saturday in the parking lot next to the school.

921
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:46,260
Like last year, in the event of rain, it will be held in the girls' gymnasium.

922
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:54,840
On Sunday at 8 o'clock in the hairless William Memorial, Dr. Wigley Hedges will be showing off.

923
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:04,120
On Monday night, there will be a special singles night tug of war held between the corners of Jekyll and Hyde and Polk and Beans.

924
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:11,400
This event is sponsored by the Friends of Money, and I am reminded that it is for a good cause.

925
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:17,260
Thursday night, there is nothing scheduled, so we'll skip over this one.

926
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,060
We return to Apocalypse Now, the opera, Act 2.

927
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,460
Gee, guys, going up this river is kind of scary.

928
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,780
Yes, chef, but not as scary as that innocent merchant family we ventilated today for a puppy.

929
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,540
A puppy.

930
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,920
Take me up the river to the Dulong Bridge.

931
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,420
This is my boat, Willard, my ship, my crew.

932
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,660
I'm on a really secret mission, captain.

933
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:50,280
Besides, I've already had a nervous breakdown and a heart attack on this stupid film. Let's get it over with.

934
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:55,860
Well, if you put it that way, okay, I'll take you to the bridge, but I really don't like you at all.

935
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,280
How far to the bridge?

936
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,480
Nine clicks.

937
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,000
Oh, wow, the Dulong Bridge.

938
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,800
That's right, Lance, looks pretty surreal to me.

939
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,220
Hey, Lance, you look kind of weird.

940
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,260
My last cup of acid, my last cup of acid.

941
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,460
Hark over there by the bodies.

942
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,580
Sir?

943
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,940
No, the American bodies, you fool.

944
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,760
I need someone to come with me.

945
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,260
For comic relief, while I go up and find out who's in command.

946
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,480
Hey, dude, I'll go.

947
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,940
Wanna come along, sir?

948
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,980
Never get out of the boat, never get out of the boat, never get out of the boat.

949
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:49,860
Like, wow.

950
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,880
Hey, dude, what is you?

951
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,800
Lance, get off at the top of that bridge.

952
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,960
We've got work to do.

953
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,060
Oh, wow, dude.

954
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,940
Ain't flaming death, you gosh darn communist dude.

955
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,700
I'll face this off last year, Kyle Dar-

956
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,940
Sorry, sir, I'll screen you from here and leave the hoops outside the wire.

957
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,100
Oh, wow, hoops outside the wire.

958
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,620
Shut up, Lance.

959
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,600
Hey, soldier, who's in command here?

960
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,480
Face to the Vegas, sir.

961
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,740
Well, the Ned Cady-

962
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,960
Better get back to the boat, better get back to the boat.

963
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,120
Carry on, Lance, get over here.

964
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,400
Lance, that's a cart post, not a tree.

965
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:48,940
I have in front of me Kurtz's dossier, or in English, his resume, and it's big, really big.

966
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,880
There's enough paper here to stuff J. Edgar Hoover's cocktail dress and a pair of size 12 party pumps,

967
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,860
with even more left over to make one hell of a paper airplane.

968
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,420
Man, this guy gets around.

969
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,260
Intramural office dodgeball co-captain for two straight years,

970
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,660
sergeant at arms in a cashmere sweater club for still another.

971
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,040
The Mrs. Fields Chewy Award for overall consistency.

972
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:21,960
The A.V. Squad's Golden Goose Award to Green Thumbs Corridor Patrol's Safety First Bronze Banjo recognition.

973
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,560
Man, this guy gets around.

974
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,840
There must be more than 1,200 pages of credentials all printed on those boards.

975
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,020
He makes sheets of paper he used to get in grammar school.

976
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,400
You know the kind.

977
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,320
They smelled sort of funny, and he'd take a sniff as he passed them back to the kid behind him.

978
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,820
Mimeo Graft, that's what they were called. Mimeo Graft.

979
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,240
I remember those.

980
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,340
I got around, but not as much as this guy.

981
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,620
Three awards for carpool congeniality with the Yo-Yo Dine Institute.

982
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,700
Future Retailers, America's Brown Shoe Award.

983
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,920
The J.V. Real Estate Agents Award for penmanship, punctuation, and hygiene.

984
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,820
This guy's background is impeccable.

985
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,560
Even to guard glasses.

986
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,460
Future Grocery Courts of America, Certificate of American.

987
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,840
Member of the I Hate to Smoke Club Committee to re-elect anyone in Office Committee.

988
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,340
Graduated the 12th Step.

989
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,240
I'm okay, you're different, so I'm better asserted in this training program.

990
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,040
Special citation from the board again, and your face, Disciples of District 12.

991
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,740
Rolfing Club Med Frequent Flyers Club.

992
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:23,920
This guy really gets around.

993
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,820
Six months later, Kurtz passes a civil service exam.

994
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:28,820


995
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:33,540
And is immediately appointed an official government courier for Operation Post Office.

996
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:38,540
For ten years, Kurtz served as a top-ranking official for Post Office.

997
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,060
Until something happened.

998
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,360
Something snapped.

999
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,480
He got cranky and moody. Threw his he fits.

1000
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,020
Became disgruntled.

1001
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:53,900
Two days later, he appoints himself Chief Post Master General of the entire tiny island, including the five townships.

1002
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,500
He just wanted his honkers.

1003
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,160
What'd he do?

1004
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,620
He was totally off his juj, screwy pocket bays and bouncing off the walls.

1005
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,660
He was stark, raving, nuttier than a fruitcake ape.

1006
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,880
And with the help of the musicians, I was set to stop.

1007
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,160
Must be a temptation to be God.

1008
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:23,780
As some truffle head blade makes staples in the way, is that Bill Graham?

1009
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,040
I want to get a mango, I need to get a mango.

1010
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,860
But there's a tiger, a mango, a tiger, a tiger.

1011
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,720
A spear?

1012
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,260
Never get out of this, never get out of this, never get out of this boat.

1013
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,920
Never get out of this, never get out of this, never get out of this boat.

1014
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,060
Look, look, look.

1015
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:53,500
Captain!

1016
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,200
Captain Willard!

1017
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,800
The catcher, the net is.

1018
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:03,300
The catcher, the body is.

1019
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:10,560
This must be Kurtz's hideout.

1020
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,520
Please don't mind the monkeys, they don't bite.

1021
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,480
Come on in.

1022
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,680
Willard!

1023
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,420
Can't you tell that I'm American?

1024
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,200
Stop him with your sirens!

1025
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:37,200
Come, sing, the power of the glory.

1026
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:44,760
Listen to his story, it's a living glory.

1027
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:50,660
Come, sing, the power of the glory.

1028
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,440
He's a hero.

1029
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:07,480
I'm a little man, and he is a great man.

1030
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:15,940
Don't call me oldie, Stanley Kowalski.

1031
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,140
How about a blue spree?

1032
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,640
I came to chat.

1033
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,560
With the occupant?

1034
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,940
With the resident.

1035
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,760
So tell me your zip.

1036
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,120
Um, the zip code, sir?

1037
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:29,600
Uh-huh.

1038
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,440
The five digit or ten?

1039
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,000
The ten.

1040
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,340
I don't remember it.

1041
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:33,940
Uh-huh.

1042
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,140
Don't call me oldie, Stanley Kowalski.

1043
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,920
Your voice is just as high as your salary.

1044
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,240
More ravioli, some tortellini.

1045
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,060
Give me spumoni or go away now.

1046
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,260
I have a message.

1047
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,920
I have a mission.

1048
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,900
I'm here to kill you at this song.

1049
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:57,120
My forehead all sweaty, but let's sing some more.

1050
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,940
I am the Eggman, you are the grocery cart.

1051
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,040
Oh, Kurtz, Kurtz, look, the song's over.

1052
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,120
Time to die.

1053
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:15,520
Why don't we just cut a cow in half and watch it twice in slow motion?

1054
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,920
In slow motion.

1055
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:27,520
I rise from the river, zoom in on my face, the mud on my lips.

1056
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:36,120
I am the summer cows in half, slow motion, slow motion, lights down low.

1057
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,000
Have you any last wish?

1058
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,900
Hurry, Willard, make it sexy.

1059
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,320
We're die.

1060
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,800
The output was fair.

1061
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,380
Fighting wild enough to faint.

1062
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,760
Partice over the

1063
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:57,760


1064
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,480
Yes, dear friends.

1065
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,580
Apocalypse Now, the opera,

1066
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,420
created there by Radio Shorts

1067
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,320
out of San Francisco, California.

1068
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,940
And you can get more information

1069
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:41,080
on how to procure those self-same tapes

1070
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,020
from...

1071
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,000
You got your pencil ready, my friend?

1072
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,380
You can just write to, for information,

1073
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:53,560
write to Wes Jenkins, Radio Shorts,

1074
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:01,240
2935 Van Ness Avenue, number 9.

1075
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:08,480
That's 2935 Van Ness,

1076
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,380
N-E-S-S Avenue, number 9.

1077
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,640
Number 9.

1078
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,060
9.

1079
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,440
San Francisco, California.

1080
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,420
9-4-1-0-9.

1081
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,580
For the rather amazing Apocalypse Now piece

1082
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,220
from Radio Shorts.

1083
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,140
And you know that you are listening to

1084
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:37,600
the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack

1085
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,060
here on Radio Station.

1086
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,160
And...

1087
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,240
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

1088
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,060
And if you want more information

1089
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,400
about the hour of slack

1090
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,600
and the church of the subgenius,

1091
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,520
or anything that you hear on this program,

1092
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,740
please feel quite free

1093
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,660
to write for free information.

1094
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,900
And I'm going to give you that box number now.

1095
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,820
It's so simple.

1096
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,640
Anyone can do it.

1097
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,500
Just address that postcard

1098
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,640
or letter with self-addressed stamped envelope.

1099
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,980
The more the merrier.

1100
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:11,380
Two.

1101
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,540
Bob.

1102
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:15,920
That's right.

1103
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:16,480
Bob.

1104
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:25,000
At post office box 140306.

1105
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:29,140
That's P.O. Box 140306.

1106
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,840
In lovely Dallas, Texas.

1107
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,300
75214.

1108
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,520
And in the background here,

1109
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,620
we're listening to Arnold Mathis,

1110
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,560
his new tape,

1111
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,460
Galaxy A Go-Go.

1112
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,180
Quite a lovely,

1113
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,220
almost new-agey sounding piece,

1114
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,140
one might say.

1115
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:54,940
Uh-huh.

1116
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,360
Yes, friends, we love you

1117
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,760
and we want to hear from you.

1118
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,680
Well, actually,

1119
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,900
we really don't care about hearing from you.

1120
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,280
We would just like to sell you things.

1121
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,760
And that's why we give that P.O. Box.

1122
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,320
We can't tell you what things

1123
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,300
until you let us know

1124
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,300
that you really,

1125
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,380
really have to know.

1126
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,180
And you do.

1127
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,740
So in the meantime,

1128
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,880
we'll say good night

1129
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,060
or good morning

1130
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,220
or whatever it is

1131
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,080
where you are

1132
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,700
for this week.

1133
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,880
I've done three shows

1134
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,240
in the last nine hours.

1135
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,140
And I don't know what's next.

1136
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,440
I really don't.

1137
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,320
Thank you.

1138
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:43,920
Thank you.
