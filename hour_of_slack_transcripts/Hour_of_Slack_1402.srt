1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Most young people will continue through life as normal responsible citizens.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,740
Others, the shunted and unloved, the unguided, the seekers of thrills and kicks

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,680
are candidates for the slave world of lifelong...

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,480
How does it happen? Where does it start? What are the signs?

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,320
The pattern is generally the same.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:21,780
Bob?

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,700
Take a lack of responsibility, the inability to make right choices,

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,020
add to it ignorance and indifference, and top it off with a desire for escapism and kicks.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,000
The sum total is then...

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,160
The subgenius power of SWAT.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,340
This is the real action. This is the test.

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,760
The time to separate the man from the boy.

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,040
Willpower, individuality, character are slipping down the drain.

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,240
In their place comes Bob.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,860
Don't be chicken.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,520
The first of the three.

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,880
Okay, this is the part two of the Puzzling Evidence show we did a week or a month ago.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,800
Because Puzzling Evidence shows are two hours long.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,400
The hour slack is one hour long.

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,860
So we're continuing the grand themes from last week's stolen show.

21
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,760
Stolen from the Puzzling Evidence.

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,600
Two hours on KPFA in Berkeley.

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,700
Thanks to Puzzling Evidence.

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,260
Dr. Howell.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,720
Dr. Philo Drummond.

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,760
Who's my host and captor for this week.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,920
And K-Rob was there also.

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,740
And Princess Wee.

29
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,700
And so back in time to the Puzzling Evidence show of that week.

30
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,840
I've been to the skyscraper where they have that subgenius foundation in Dallas.

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,240
I met Stang and Philo and all those people.

32
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,240
I bet at the time they had power in Chicago.

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,220
So what now?

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,600
You stole their power.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,400
Now.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,680
I met a person who explained all that to me.

37
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,360
Really?

38
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,380
Yeah, at a party.

39
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,160
He said.

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,520
I went to Dallas and I went to that skyscraper where the subgeniuses live.

41
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,140
I met Stang and Philo and I'm good friends with all of them.

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,460
Really?

43
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:14,680
Yeah.

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:14,940
Wow.

45
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,380
Everyone around me was kind of laughing at this idiot.

46
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,060
That's really impressive.

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,320
And finally he said, what's everybody laughing at?

48
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,660
Stang and all those guys.

49
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:32,840
And he explained that in fact he had actually wandered into a little bookstore in downtown Dallas and noticed some subgenius stuff in there.

50
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,340
And they said, oh, the subgeniuses are in that skyscraper over there.

51
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,300
And that's where his story came from.

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:51,640
It went from some people in a bookstore lying to him to him having, you know, being good buddies with the famous subgeniuses who were so famous he didn't know what they looked like.

53
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,460
Well, you know how.

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,220
And didn't know if he was talking to one.

55
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,920
A good story can grow and become more exuberant and robust over time.

56
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,820
Yes, the tale can grow in the telling.

57
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,480
It can actually stretch the information much farther than the previous data would ever support.

58
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,340
And that'll help you stretch your entertainment dollar here in the jungle.

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,060
Touch.

60
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,120
We extend that information and project it far, far into the future.

61
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,400
As far as you and I can see.

62
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,120
From just a tiny, tiny little bit.

63
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,440
As far as you and I can see.

64
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,820
From these two bits of data.

65
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,740
See the vision of the world.

66
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,160
We're able to see into the future.

67
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,800
And all of it.

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,620
For a million years and know what's going to happen.

69
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,640
Two data points.

70
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,400
That's it, folks.

71
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,960
That's how powerful that is.

72
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,340
That's scary.

73
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,080
Yeah.

74
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,480
The subgenius stockbrokers corporation.

75
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,600
It's just like in Clown Atlas when you go in the studio and you hit the remote and it goes vroom.

76
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,700
You can see all this pretend world.

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,080
Hello.

78
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,420
Yes.

79
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,420
Go away.

80
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:48,980
Hello.

81
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,760
Hello.

82
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:51,960
Hello.

83
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,300


84
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,600
Hello.

85
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:52,720
Hello.

86
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:52,940
Hello.

87
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:52,940


88
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,420
Hello.

89
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,420


90
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,420


91
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,420


92
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,900
Welcome, ladies and gentelmen, to the future.

93
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,720
On the new anti color repellant spray.

94
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,500
You are the past.

95
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,000
Welcome, ladies and gentelmen.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,980
You are a clown in this universe.

97
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,220
One thing we're always going to have more of in the future is the past.

98
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,400
So you can look yourself up in the Clown Atlas.

99
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,020
Until one day there will be-

100
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,500
Oh, here I am.

101
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,500
No more room for any more future.

102
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,280
The past will ocuify all space and time.

103
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,100
More pages in Con Atlas.

104
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,740
We've got to purge them.

105
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,700
Put those dogs out!

106
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,980
Who let the dogs out?

107
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,580
We have to purge them.

108
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,800
I hate chihuahuas.

109
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,740
It's a catastrophic event.

110
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,440
Under the Antarctic ice.

111
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,860
They're just radio dogs.

112
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:44,360
A discovery that offers the first glimpse of a vast ecosystem of microscopic life in underground lakes in Antarctica.

113
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,900
This gives us hope that we can maybe escape the tortures of the asteroid collision.

114
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,140
Too far away.

115
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,900
Never mind, we can't.

116
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,060
Too far.

117
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,980
Too far.

118
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,080
Radio canines.

119
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,860
I welcome the astronaut collision.

120
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,000
Come on, baby, blow me up!

121
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,680
Let's just put our DNA in cryosuspension and shoot it into space in every possible direction.

122
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,740
This dog's got bone fever.

123
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,300
If the galaxy is to be compared to the continent of North America,

124
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,200
the nearest habitable exoplanets are supposed to be the equivalent of a walk across

125
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,120
Yeah, rocket, Hal, rocket.

126
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,880
Central Pacific.

127
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,280
Park in New York.

128
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,440
Hey, it's the Ask Dr. Hal show.

129
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,440
But even that is a distance of 11 light years away.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,420
Who can believe that's true?

131
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,560
Which we now can't attain because we don't have the energy to go there.

132
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,860
If the show is like this, you know, it'd be great.

133
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,540
Yeah, we don't have the political wherewithal.

134
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:47,000
There's not enough energy on Earth to drive a vehicle that distance.

135
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,800
11 light years.

136
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,680
Unless you don't care how long.

137
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,760
It takes to get there.

138
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,660
There's nothing that can go to approach that speed, right?

139
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,020
Earth-like world.

140
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,080
Maybe.

141
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,960
Well, we have, uh, we've always got solar power.

142
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,060
And closer.

143
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,460
We use solar-powered spaceships.

144
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,240
They're greener.

145
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,960
They can, they can, but they move far too slow.

146
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,300
11 light years is still a long distance, even though by sidereal distances it's not as long as others.

147
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,760
Well, what if we just say, okay, we're gonna, it's gonna take us like 50 years to get there, right?

148
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,760
What are we gonna do then?

149
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:33,220
Okay, so for 50 years we're gonna have to lift up some young, very young astronauts because

150
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,880
they're gonna be 50 if they're like, yeah, we need like, of course, by then people will

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,440
live longer and be younger and fresher for longer.

152
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,060
Actually, on board the ship, time will not pass as fast as it does for everybody else.

153
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,680
Relief.

154
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,020
Yeah.

155
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,280
Especially if those listening to this are like, oh, we're gonna have to do this.

156
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:58,600
If they come back, although they wouldn't, everybody they ever knew would be dead.

157
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,040
But they're not coming back.

158
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:03,960
They're not coming back.

159
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:11,100
No, this would be for taking our population and repopulating it in a place where we haven't

160
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,400
crapped on the planet so much.

161
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,440
What you might do is hollow out a large asteroid and put motors on it and get it started toward

162
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,260
the distant future.

163
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,400
Oh, yeah.

164
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,400


165
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,400


166
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,400


167
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,820
And then they'll be ready to start moving to the next planet, exoplanets, and just grow

168
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,140
generations of people inside it.

169
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,120
Let them be born and die and finally some future generation.

170
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,680
Ah, those stories about earth and anything outside of this asteroid.

171
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,040
That's just fairy tales that the old folks tell.

172
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,440
Blasphemy!

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,800
There was no earth!

174
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,740
Yeah, what was that cartoon movie recently where the people are floating around on these

175
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,500
little bat chairs.

176
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,060
Oh, you're thinking of WALL-E?

177
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,900
Yeah, yeah.

178
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,240
That was kinda funny.

179
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,240


180
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,240


181
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,240


182
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,180
Oh, I thought he was thinking of Wall-E.

183
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,960
Jesus loves me, but he can't stand me.

184
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,360
It was Wall-E.

185
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,200
Was it?

186
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,300
Yes, it was Wall-E.

187
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,680
I don't remember.

188
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,640
There was people in that?

189
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,040
I thought it was just robots in that.

190
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,440
The people had left the planet, but the people were all there being fat instead.

191
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.

192
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,480
That's us.

193
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,920
The beautiful bag people.

194
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,860
Now, many habitable worlds may inhabit red dwarf stars.

195
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:22,340
But if they do, they have a lot more time to evolve more complex life forms.

196
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,120
Our superiors.

197
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,960
The question you have to ask yourselves is, can canines be affected by radio waves?

198
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,360
Ask yourself, Dr. Hall.

199
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,020
By all means.

200
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,940
We have to stop the show and ask ourselves, will the dog star take over?

201
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,060
Dog flu station.

202
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,220
Will Michael Bradford call him?

203
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,740
Dog star.

204
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,700
That's the question.

205
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,460
I ask myself, can Michael Pepe call him?

206
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,340
Is he able to actually navigate?

207
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,440
Yes.

208
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm deeply disappointed in Michael Pepe's.

209
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,320
Let's lift Michael Pepe up to the stars.

210
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,280
So do I have to smoke by myself?

211
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:05,960
Yes, you do.

212
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,320
Yeah, we would be helping you, but we're not there.

213
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,400
No, but I mean, in spirit, you guys smoke with me or am I doing this by myself?

214
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,540
If the temperature drops sufficiently.

215
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,460
Vapor will rise.

216
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,140
Vapor will rise.

217
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,800
Oh, never stop.

218
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,760
Oh, Mr. Philodrum and this stuff stinks, buddy.

219
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,780
You should be out of here.

220
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,160
It's stinky.

221
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,580
Stinky as a metal.

222
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,840
Is this the show or is my tinnitus just acting up really badly?

223
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,340
I don't know.

224
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,360
I'm wondering the same thing myself.

225
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,620
I think that we have a number of show punks who are attempting to the joy of the event.

226
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,860
Show tinnitus?

227
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,020
You have to take your headphones off and check it.

228
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,300
I am all tinnitus.

229
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,880
Men of two minds about this exclusivity.

230
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,220
Is that like a disease where you get too much show?

231
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,840
It's my tinnitus.

232
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,120
Show tinnitus.

233
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,560
Here in the church of the sub-genius.

234
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,760
It's my tinnitus.

235
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,600
Yeah, like a show timeout where the show stops.

236
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,000
Hey, you can breathe.

237
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,940
It says breathe, but I ain't breathing.

238
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,000
This is the Bay Area.

239
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,840
We do show.

240
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,440
That's it.

241
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,180
That's it.

242
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
Slow down when entering a station.

243
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:10,340
Once I was traveling and I think I was in Nevada or Utah and somebody said, where are

244
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:10,620
you from?

245
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,340
I said, I'm from the Bay Area.

246
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,220
And he goes, oh, you do show there, right?

247
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,840
I said, I'm from the Bay Area.

248
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:14,840


249
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:14,840


250
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:14,840


251
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:14,840


252
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,740
I said, you bet.

253
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,540
We have to.

254
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,720
That's what people do to our job.

255
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,380
Always stop for a red flag waving and stay on the rails no matter what.

256
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,700
Just have that look about you, I guess.

257
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,040
That's what it looks like when you're on the show.

258
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,740
Yep.

259
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,300
It's just like this.

260
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:41,520
When you're down inside the show hole looking up at the distant sky far, far above you,

261
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,820
dreaming of the time when you can climb up out of that show.

262
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:44,820


263
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:44,820


264
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:44,820


265
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:50,880
A time which may never come, but sometimes the dream itself is the answer to life.

266
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,720
And you'll finally shed that medicine smell.

267
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,960
Get back to your Yeti forebears.

268
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,760
You know what I'm talking about.

269
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,120
You ever stick your nose in a bottle of vitamins?

270
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,900
With hearing problems.

271
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,040
Yes, they're good folks.

272
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,980
You feel me?

273
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,360
Oh, I'm rooting for vitamins.

274
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,740
Marshall, Will, and Holly.

275
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:14,800


276
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,640
Drummonds who had a feud going on for eight years.

277
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,520
I came to town on a beautiful day, saw a pretty girl was looking my way.

278
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,840
All those around me said, son, beware of the little girl with the golden hair.

279
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,200
All right.

280
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:33,920
Now let's see.

281
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,800
Golden hair.

282
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,320
And friends, you too can have a Princess We Are Doe t-shirt.

283
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,100
I have on here.

284
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,440
You can feel of it.

285
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,240
You can stroke it.

286
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,660
You can?

287
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,120
Wow.

288
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,980
I'm stroking Princess We.

289
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,960
Oh, my gosh.

290
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,680
I really, really did have a Princess We.

291
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,080
Stroking.

292
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,680
Good.

293
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,780
Princess We fan club t-shirt, available at subgenius.com.

294
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,100
There's two of them.

295
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,680
Edible product, edible Missouri.

296
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,300
It shows Princess We flying through space followed by all of her UFO subjects.

297
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,420
It's just one of them identified.

298
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,020
It's just too much.

299
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,900
Man, I can't do that.

300
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, I can't do that.

301
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,620
There's a lot of them.

302
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,380
They're so cute.

303
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,040


304
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,040


305
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,480
They're so cute.

306
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:13,540
They're so cute.

307
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:13,540


308
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:13,560
They're so cute.

309
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:13,560


310
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:13,560


311
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:13,980
Oh, my gosh.

312
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,800
They're so cute.

313
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:14,800


314
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,500
to a dance-filled girl.

315
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,440
She'll only play you for a fool.

316
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,800
That's the Princess We song.

317
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,840
Yeah, no, no, whatever they're saying.

318
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,080
Something about ass and class.

319
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,560
Yes, the usual litany of complaints.

320
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,540
Of the soft trial or a fight that caused the man...

321
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,800
Well, the further we get away from Earth, the more...

322
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,960
...left by and it intermits...

323
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,500
So, Steve, how long does it take you to get away from Earth?

324
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,120
...when his prosthetic eye popped out...

325
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,200
...as he was testifying in a...

326
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,140
Princess We, where are you?

327
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,800
This show is giving me vertigo.

328
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,960
He testified about the impact of losing his eye...

329
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,120
It's not a big deal.

330
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,240
...2011 fight in the parking lot of a bar.

331
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,340
Suddenly, the $3,000 prosthetic blue eye popped out.

332
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,780
Hutick caught it and cried out as two jurors gasped.

333
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,140
Whoa!

334
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,580
Whoa!

335
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,780
A mistrial was declared...

336
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,620
Reach through your phone and grab a piece!

337
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,880
...and the wayward eyeball was recaptured.

338
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,240
Reach through the phone!

339
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,160
In a moment, the result of that trial.

340
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,020
I heard the bomb explode.

341
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,300
I'm right here, go ahead!

342
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,520
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie lashed out...

343
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:39,880
Hold on here!

344
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,160
...and he, from workers' stimulation...

345
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,780
Shoot a phone and grab for me!

346
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,700
...and white bloods brought to Earth...

347
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,100
I can feel you!

348
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,080
Someone just played one, I heard it.

349
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,340
Yeah!

350
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,420
I can feel you!

351
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,140
All right, all right.

352
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,160
Doug, Doug, the show is broken.

353
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,920
Okay, he said...

354
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,640
What happened to it?

355
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,500
It fell in that crack.

356
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,300
It's 420.

357
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,200
Oh, I see a banana peel.

358
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,600
You notice how Philo disappeared at 420 by himself?

359
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,640
Eh, banana rye.

360
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,400
Well, I need to get going too.

361
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,960
What a coincidence.

362
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,060
Wow, 420!

363
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,500
Yeah.

364
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,820
Coincidence or a conspiracy?

365
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,520
What the...

366
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,540
There's an obvious clue here, Robin.

367
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,660
Hey, you know what I found the other day?

368
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,280
So we began putting clues in all the albums.

369
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,060
Yeah, to avoid the...

370
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,580
I can't tolerate that, man.

371
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,340
The callers are once again trying to take over the show.

372
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,220
...my clues in all the shows.

373
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,520
And clue in all the CDs!

374
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,840
Which is related to what I wanted to do originally with the original subgenius original VHS tape.

375
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,080
VHS?

376
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,640
You have 20 minutes at the end of the tape.

377
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,220
It says, don't go past this point.

378
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,940
It will ruin your VCR.

379
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,480
Do not go past this point.

380
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,140
Three warnings? That must be trouble.

381
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:42,600
Yeah.

382
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,980
Four rings?

383
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,960
That's probably the chief.

384
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,940
Yeah, but of course they wouldn't stop.

385
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,320
And at the last maybe foot of VHS tape would be sandpaper.

386
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,560
Ruining your $800 VHS machine just like Bob said.

387
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,760
I thought that would have been a geeky thing.

388
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,380
It was, wasn't it? In those days?

389
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,860
A geeky thing.

390
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,620
Well, we're on the pier here.

391
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,240
On the pier.

392
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,180
We're waving goodbye to Uncle Philo as he sends off his...

393
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,060
I have another fried clam bucket.

394
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,220
A Kentucky fried clam.

395
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,600
Here at the Ivar's in the Navy of England.

396
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,300
I'm as happy as a cherry stone clam myself because I graduated...

397
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,140
That's pretty happy.

398
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,980
...a 12-module course in success in sex and real estate.

399
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,540
And now you can't.

400
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,140
Lonnie found some lamb's breast seed.

401
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,660
I'm going to offer you a hand up.

402
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,240
There he goes.

403
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,960
Oh, this is where Philo starts talking about his 13-step program.

404
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,240
So, my beloved, I say unto you...

405
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,420
Hey, hey, lamb's bread, you guys. Lamb's bread. Remember that?

406
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,760
Be ye lifted up and dine on the bread of lamb.

407
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,340
Yes, I found some lamb's bread seeds. They were trashed. I lost them and I found them again.

408
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,940
I wonder if they're going to germinate.

409
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,260
The yams did it. The yams did it.

410
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,840
Lamb's bread. They only eat the softest, tenderest bread.

411
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,620
It's all about the cat pissing on the sourdough.

412
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:11,880
Diesel.

413
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,580
Cordy is bread. Anybody's bread.

414
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,320
Okay, and it's good for our good little green friends in our space, too.

415
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,040
We say urinate on this show.

416
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,000
Urine over your head now.

417
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,100
It must be the cat that must piss on the...

418
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,600
Feline urination.

419
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
You're in trouble.

420
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,600
That stank up the house that Jack built.

421
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,960
Stank up the entire...

422
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
You're in heaven on this show, though.

423
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,820
Stank up the entire movie set for the movie.

424
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,320
Not as bad as tiger piss is splashed around.

425
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,600
Lonnie will straight up...

426
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,260
Yeah, that's the worst.

427
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,000
If one must discuss the exceptionally pungent...

428
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,180
In the movie, you're an albino.

429
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,340
A cowboy loves cats.

430
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,880
So they made a closed set and they just found a bunch of cats in the city.

431
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,000
Dare to be a juicer.

432
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,580
And put them on the set.

433
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,340
And they lived in the set with plenty of food and water and cat boxes for the entire shooting of the movie.

434
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,920
Remember, folks, save the demonically possessed cats.

435
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,060
And the director's wife was a veterinarian.

436
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:11,580
So she came over to visit and get a little vacation in a foreign country with her husband while they were shooting the first album.

437
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,800
There will be a...

438
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,360
What about when the movie was over?

439
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,920
The diseases in the room.

440
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,620
She could name the diseases that the cats had because the urine was so powerfully stinking.

441
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,400
The entire thing.

442
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,240
Of course, shooting three months in there.

443
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,340
It got pretty nasty.

444
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,280
It gets to the point where you don't even notice it anymore because you just have to get to the scene.

445
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,880
Oh, you notice.

446
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,980
And other people notice.

447
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,260
And then they were saying, you know, you don't.

448
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,120
It just shuts it down.

449
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,080
Ed Holmes is talking about this where you get to a point where the human brain just can't...

450
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,040
You can't work like that.

451
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,980
So you just shut it down.

452
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,400
And you go ahead and do the work.

453
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,960
But you don't smell the bad smell anymore.

454
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,500
Yeah.

455
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,100
Well...

456
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,560
Because otherwise, you can't do it.

457
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,340
You can't finish up.

458
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,000
Ed Holmes on a submarine.

459
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,180
He found out about that.

460
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,780
Or if you went in the space shuttle, Columbia.

461
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,240
They had cats on the submarine?

462
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,320
Any of the space...

463
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,840
Because the Columbias are all 40 years of people's sweat and poo and...

464
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,660
Or like those people that have to sit for 25 years next to that guy in the office in

465
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,960
the other cubicle who's constantly emitting these noisy, noxious vapors.

466
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,140
He's a real four square guy.

467
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,000
He's just right for the cubicle.

468
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,380
They tried to fire him.

469
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,600
But they couldn't do it.

470
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,220
Call me Joe Vapors Johnson.

471
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,620
He worked for the IRS.

472
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,040
That was not me, Joe Vapors Johnson.

473
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,560
A rattle song, Joe Vapors.

474
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,600
Yes, a rather vaporish individual.

475
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,200
They put him on a program.

476
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,700
His head was muddled with...

477
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,160
Not a 13-step program or a 12-step program.

478
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,080
My name is Joe Vapors.

479
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,120
It's but a one-step improvement program.

480
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,040
Yeah, that's the one.

481
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,440
Yeah.

482
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,380
Stop farting or get fired.

483
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,160
But what about the day's business of digesting the mulch and roughage?

484
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:41,360
I'm not a...

485
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,360


486
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,360


487
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,360


488
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,360


489
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,360


490
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,360


491
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,360


492
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,360


493
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,360


494
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,280
It's a huge museum.

495
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,920
There's the

496
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,180
louisianожд"?

497
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:57,860
welthaveitenoesw technoi?"

498
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,560
Get off of me.

499
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,760
thing. Who is the epitome

500
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,500
of civilization?

501
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,800
The Sybarite?

502
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,920
I can't. Here, take this rope.

503
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,040
Self-hating and hedonic

504
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,340
person. What? Rope?

505
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,960
You gotta help pull this

506
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,980
thing. Forbidding others the pleasure

507
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,480
which she's not able to do.

508
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
Throw me the idol first.

509
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,740
This is the choice of all social

510
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,320
engineers. I can't.

511
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,620
Throw you the idol first.

512
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,960
Alright.

513
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,060
I'll throw you the idol.

514
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,820
Here you go.

515
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,180
Another pillow idol.

516
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,380
Now the rope. The rope.

517
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,320
K-Rope. Throw me the rope.

518
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,920
The rope, yeah. Where did I get that thing?

519
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,280
I put it around here somewhere.

520
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,180
Hurry! Don't drop it.

521
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,240
They're getting closer.

522
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,160
I can't seem to find it.

523
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,400
I had it. It was here.

524
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,440
I don't know. Really.

525
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,780
And I do appreciate your being here.

526
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,000
K-Rope! K-Rope!

527
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,200
K-Rope. K-Rope.

528
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,780
It's too late. We lost him.

529
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,740
Woo!

530
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,980
Woo!

531
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,840
The party of giant sharks

532
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,900
is going on right now

533
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,440
off Guadalupe Island

534
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,540
in the area known as

535
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,040
the Red Triangle.

536
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,980
Part of the

537
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,880
lengthy ocean migration

538
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,860
of these two deep red fish

539
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,320
is the time

540
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,540
when all the sharks

541
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,460
party as if there were no tomorrow.

542
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,080
Well, they can't sleep.

543
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,700
Sharks, of course,

544
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,360
cannot sleep.

545
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,520
They can only party.

546
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,540
Mass party area.

547
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,280
Sharks don't need to sleep.

548
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,480
They have no need of sleeping.

549
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,240
Throw me a rope.

550
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,580
They do collect in areas where the

551
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,480
water moves so fast

552
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,940
and there's so much oxygen in it

553
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,320
that they stop moving.

554
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,800
In an area between

555
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,140
But they study a couple things.

556
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,040
They don't have bones.

557
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,800
Stuffing cancer.

558
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,900
They can't get cancer.

559
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,200
There are a couple things going on there.

560
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,880
We're looking at it very closely.

561
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,920
But they don't need to sleep.

562
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,540
That's another reason why they're looking at them

563
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,760
because of the astro nuts.

564
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,560
They also make occasional excursions

565
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,640
into San Francisco Bay.

566
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,160
They have things they don't need to do

567
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,640
that we do.

568
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,880
Well, they're very ancient.

569
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,540
They've been unchanged

570
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,260
in their physiological structure

571
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,760
for a lot longer than a lot of animals.

572
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,860
Great white sharks do come

573
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,320
into San Francisco Bay.

574
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,300
And if you jump off a boat,

575
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,380
you might attract one.

576
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,700
Like them little cycads.

577
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,220
I used to stare at them on drugs.

578
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,900
That jumping off boat

579
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,920
really attracts sharks.

580
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,380
The boat itself attracts sharks.

581
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,940
The boat looks like something

582
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,180
interesting and unusual

583
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,580
hanging in the sky.

584
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,640
They'd be improved.

585
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,880
Often other fish are hanging out

586
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,700
under the boat.

587
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,000
So there's even more reason

588
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,160
for the shark to be there.

589
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,000
And if suddenly somebody

590
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,540
jumps off the boat

591
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,920
and comes jackknifing

592
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,880
down into the water,

593
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,840
well, you can't blame a shark

594
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,900
for taking a nibble.

595
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,040
Are you tired of your

596
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,560
less advanced amoeba?

597
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,620
New advanced amoebas.

598
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,780
Advanced little amoebas?

599
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,200
Nope, and there they go

600
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,820
right off the table.

601
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,540
For your amoeba-enjoying pleasure.

602
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,420
1939, a great white shark,

603
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,300
21 feet long and weighing

604
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,600
7,300 pounds, was cooked.

605
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,060
How would you feel to be stripped,

606
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,440
turned loose like a wild beast,

607
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,620
and hunted?

608
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,460
All right.

609
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,920
Like an animal.

610
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,220
A manhunt of indescribable terror

611
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,720
and screaming suspense.

612
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,480
But that is a description

613
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,800
of my life right now.

614
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,040
All right.

615
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,840
Keep going, Hal.

616
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
That's what I was talking about.

617
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,300
The Dr. Hal Show.

618
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,660
On the run.

619
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,400
They're after you.

620
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,640
It's really an adaptation

621
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,460
of The Fugitive,

622
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,380
but he has to draw.

623
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,560
The naked brain.

624
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,360


625
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
There's no chance to draw

626
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,420
a brain.

627
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,820
Dr. Hal.

628
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,940
He has to draw just to make

629
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,120
enough money to go on the barn.

630
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,100
Yeah, I have to draw.

631
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,940
To hide out at the show

632
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,640
until the next.

633
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,320
White himself.

634
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,420
And then without clothing,

635
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,180
I have no pockets

636
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,980
to put my things in.

637
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,860
So try it yourself.

638
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,080
So most of the show really

639
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,560
is just shots of Hal running.

640
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,480
In slow-mo.

641
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,840
Dodging bullet after bullet.

642
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,260
It's kind of like, you know,

643
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,120
Corn Hill Wild,

644
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,520
The Naked Crane.

645
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,220
Right, right.

646
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,600
19, hmm, I don't know.

647
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:35,820
66.

648
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,560
Two blocks of buildings

649
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:37,860
fell down.

650
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,860
There was a 1966.

651
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,100
Yeah, at the same year

652
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,560
that Born Free came out.

653
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,440
Oh, the big winner.

654
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,020
As free as the wind blows.

655
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,880
Yeah, I recently saw.

656
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,500
But both of them

657
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:49,960
were in Africa.

658
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:50,880
That was the important thing.

659
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,400
I saw a really elaborate movie

660
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,600
edit and some young person,

661
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,580
very young person,

662
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,820
said, what is this?

663
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:56,820


664
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:56,820


665
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:56,820


666
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:56,820


667
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:56,820


668
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:56,820


669
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:56,820


670
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:56,820


671
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,900
what's that music at the beginning?

672
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,960
It's so beautiful.

673
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,880
And it was so weird

674
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,020
to be old enough,

675
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,980
I guess, to type in.

676
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,360
That's a theme from Born Free.

677
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,880
Come on, everybody knows that.

678
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,320
I was told,

679
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,780
I don't know if this is true,

680
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,480
that the theme from Star Wars

681
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,680
is the same melody

682
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,120
as Born Free.

683
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,640
Oh, yeah.

684
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,100
Flipped.

685
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,840
Reverse.

686
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,200
Absolutely.

687
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,160
The same notes in reverse.

688
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,200
Yeah, it's the same notes.

689
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,120
I heard that cadence before.

690
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,480
Born Free, beautiful.

691
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:26,800
Born Free, beautiful.

692
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:26,800


693
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:26,800


694
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:26,800


695
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:26,800


696
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:26,800


697
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:26,800


698
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:26,800


699
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:26,800


700
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,760
Born Free.

701
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,780
Now, the mighty Joe Young

702
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,200
was Born Free.

703
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,140
First time for everything.

704
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,080
Yes, mighty Joe Young.

705
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,780
But this was definitely

706
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:34,920
a first for me.

707
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,980
Then he joined the Church

708
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,080
of the Subgenius

709
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,080
and became one of the steeple people.

710
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,120
Exterior Tatooine Desert

711
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,140
last homestead afternoon.

712
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,340
When the hands start throwing

713
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:41,800
in the toilet

714
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,700
was rather early in the morning.

715
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,380
Throw your money.

716
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,020
Not as early as the producer

717
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,640
who shall be nameless had wanted,

718
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,200
since fairly unscripted dramas,

719
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,240
Or throw your money.

720
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,220
gold suits not working,

721
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,640
et cetera,

722
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,220
had caused a few delays.

723
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,320
But I'd finally made it

724
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,920
into the lineup

725
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,740
of assorted junk

726
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,800
outside the Sand Cruiser

727
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:56,800


728
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:56,800


729
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:56,800


730
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,580
and the

731
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,260
I tried to look around,

732
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,720
but decided I had enough

733
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,360
on my plate and round my body

734
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,320
to concentrate on what

735
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,820
I was doing.

736
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,260
Is that Opie John Canopy?

737
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,440
Star Wars.

738
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,760
We are on the radio.

739
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,760
Star Wars.

740
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,480
Wonderful Star Wars.

741
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,600
No, sing it in the tune

742
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,540
of Born Free, though.

743
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,500
I was named

744
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,380
Fran Howard as

745
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,400
Opie John Canopy.

746
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,000
Opie John Canopy.

747
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,720
Yeah, that's it.

748
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,580
It's hard.

749
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,280
Those ones.

750
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,560
Star Wars.

751
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,920
Yeah, in that version,

752
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,980
the Alec Guinness part

753
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,600
is played by

754
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:26,800
his wife.

755
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:26,800


756
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:26,800


757
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:26,800


758
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:26,800


759
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:26,800


760
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,040
That's Opie John Canopy dad

761
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,800
from Mayberry.

762
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,000
Star Wars to follow your mom.

763
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,680
And he's going,

764
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,980
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

765
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,640
Dear Star Wars.

766
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,840
And those wonderful Star Wars.

767
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,220
Puzzling evidence

768
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,960
show is a mean dinosaur.

769
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,600
Mean, mean.

770
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,260
It's hard to ride that one.

771
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,440
Those swinging-est Star Wars.

772
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,840
Some dinosaurs were mean

773
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,300
because they spent

774
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,260
their every minute

775
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,520
in excruciating agony.

776
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,740
Not a problem.

777
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,660
They had health problems

778
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,500
and twisted limbs.

779
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,140
Got some stuff in your wall.

780
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,960
They couldn't conceive

781
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,280
of their own TV channel

782
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,300
that was just coming up

783
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,780
around them

784
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,800
in the blink of an eye.

785
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,060
That would make him

786
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,100
so ferocious.

787
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,320
Did anybody see?

788
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,820
A manhunt of indescribable

789
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,520
terror and suspense.

790
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,300
They found Richard

791
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,420
the Third's skeleton,

792
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,480
did you see that?

793
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,220
Yeah, I saw that.

794
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,940
That was awesome.

795
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,160
I couldn't believe it.

796
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,320
And he was a nice guy

797
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,700
and he was all kissable.

798
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,400
He wasn't nice at all.

799
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,680
That's what they were saying

800
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,180
at the review.

801
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,440
He was just a slender,

802
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,120
skinny, frail man.

803
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,640
They're talking about

804
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,360
how nice he looked

805
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,720
and how he was.

806
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,520
They always say

807
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,380
and it's not true.

808
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,240
In fact, they also said,

809
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,720
oh, he was a hunchback

810
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,340
or a crooked back.

811
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,000
That was just

812
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,940
Tudor propaganda.

813
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:37,680
Nope.

814
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,560
All that Richard

815
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,480
crookback stuff.

816
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,280
And look at the skeleton.

817
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,960
All movie crap.

818
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,320
There's a picture in the...

819
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,300
Osteoporosis.

820
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,880
He was incredibly crooked.

821
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,820
He was so crooked

822
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,660
you could hardly believe

823
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:46,840
he lived.

824
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,360
What another movie?

825
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:47,820
Geez.

826
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,100
Palmer Breedies

827
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,860
told me today

828
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,920
that that skeleton

829
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,300
was found with a knife

830
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,600
in the keister.

831
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,260
Reef, reef, reef.

832
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:56,700
Yeah.

833
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,860
Like, what a way to go.

834
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,580
Well, it's better

835
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,160
than the way

836
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,380
Edward...

837
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,480
Remember what Palmer's name

838
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,320
is, by the way?

839
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,200
Breedies?

840
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,280
Yeah, no, his name.

841
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:06,900
Lies?

842
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,560
Okay, thank you.

843
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,000
Remember lies?

844
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,660
Just checking.

845
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,360
Just to make sure.

846
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,160
Edward II

847
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
was assassinated

848
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,020
in a particularly

849
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,500
horrible way

850
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,240
that could leave

851
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,000
no mark on the skeleton

852
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,920
or on the exterior

853
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,800
of the body.

854
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,340
They went the way

855
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,860
of Enron.

856
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,560
Read Charles Dickens'

857
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,420
Child's History of England.

858
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,460
Just as profitable, too.

859
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,500
And you'll be amazed

860
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,500
that that episode

861
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,520
made it into the book.

862
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,080
I'm not sure.

863
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,060
Awesome.

864
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,320
Yeah, I can't be more

865
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,520
explicit about this station.

866
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:32,860
Yes, of course.

867
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,980
It would be bad to...

868
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,360
Yeah, we are, of course,

869
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:35,940
the night people.

870
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,420
The steeple people

871
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,040
of the Church of the Subgenius.

872
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
It's about time for you...

873
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,860
We are the...

874
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,420
...to get up

875
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:41,920
and go to work.

876
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,800
More church

877
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,760
and less air.

878
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,440
The backside...

879
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,160
Go to work.

880
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,600
...of the audience.

881
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,820
We're talking about

882
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,080
operating from what we call

883
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,820
the backside of the brain.

884
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,360
The buttocks

885
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,580
of the cerebral hemisphere.

886
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,580
The backside of the brain.

887
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,520
It looks just like that

888
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:56,700
like a little bit.

889
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:56,700


890
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:56,700


891
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:56,700


892
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:56,700


893
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,360
It may be made out

894
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,680
of toothpaste.

895
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,120
This is the corpus callosum...

896
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,340
Reality.

897
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,080
...or cerebral taint...

898
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,440
Reality.

899
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,840
...which divides the two

900
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,580
spheres of the posterior...

901
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,060
Have a cup.

902
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,420
...cerebral...

903
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,640
The reality.

904
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,440
The anterior frontal...

905
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,360
I can't help it, man.

906
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,060
...brought to me

907
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,140
the seat of emotion.

908
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,260
I've got some steep...

909
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,380
Just play a piano solo.

910
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:16,860
...memory.

911
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,780
This show is the brain's

912
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,820
bumper sticker.

913
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,160
...a seat itself.

914
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,320
And the buttocks

915
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,140
of the brain...

916
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,820
And it's about time

917
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,720
to peel it off.

918
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,460
...the rest of the organs...

919
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,480
Maybe the hind legs.

920
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:26,700
...and the brain.

921
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:26,700


922
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:26,780
...trauma...

923
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,220
It hurts.

924
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,520
...and impact...

925
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,120
Ew!

926
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,140
...generally cushioned

927
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,300
by the...

928
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:31,960
Help me, somebody.

929
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,200
...layers of dura

930
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,600
and pia matter.

931
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,540
And so, this jelly-like organ, safe in the confines...

932
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,740
The show wants to be free.

933
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,120
...of the sky.

934
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,540
...wishes to escape

935
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,300
and be free.

936
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:44,600
Yeah.

937
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,640
Yes, the brain wants to

938
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,080
caper and dance and leap outside the body's confining...

939
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,880
Actually, I just want to go

940
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,820
on Playboy after dark.

941
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,180
I like it when you talk dirty like that, Hal.

942
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,200
...and who knows, the brain might be...

943
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,420
Kinky.

944
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,400
...in Las Vegas...

945
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,580
Baby.

946
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,860
...for a fantastic weekend.

947
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,680
Free, free from the trammels of the body.

948
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,620
Naked, baby.

949
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:12,700
Why, if the soul can fling the dust aside and naked on the air of heaven rise...

950
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,340
Put some clothes on that thing!

951
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,500
...were it not a shame for him in this plane...

952
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,340
Oh, my lord!

953
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,280
...to put your pants back on.

954
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,660
...tripled to a bite.

955
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,160
We gotta make some soup.

956
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,680
The show's running around with its pants on.

957
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:26,680


958
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:26,680


959
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,960
Oh, my God.

960
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,320
Somebody, somebody cover that thing.

961
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,160
We're making a...

962
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,080
The show's getting stinky.

963
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,580
...a soup in the back.

964
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,140
Not my pants.

965
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,580
Come on, ma'am.

966
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,520
Trust your pants.

967
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,680
All right.

968
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,860
You need a lot of pants tonight.

969
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,760
Okay, I had them on backwards.

970
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,020
All right, don't make a federal case out of it.

971
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,080
We'll have your pants washed out in just a little while.

972
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,300
All right.

973
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,840
I thought this was the front.

974
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,060
What?

975
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,340
Okay.

976
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,380
All right, let's talk about something else.

977
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,100
Everyone has problems with pants every now and then.

978
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,400
So we're not gonna talk about pants?

979
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:53,820
No.

980
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
What are show pants?

981
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,060
Just trust your pants.

982
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,160
I asked.

983
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,540
Trust your pants.

984
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:56,660
I asked.

985
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:56,660


986
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:56,660


987
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:06,480
Who wears the pairs of dead man's pants they dance in the darkness of the sun?

988
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,440
Showy, showy, show pants.

989
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,660
Showy, showy, showy, show.

990
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,220
Immaculate.

991
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,200
Showy, showy, show pants.

992
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,820
What are show pants?

993
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,240
Dead man's pants dance.

994
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,120
So dead man's pants dance.

995
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,480
I'm dancing with a pair of dead man's pants.

996
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,500
It says it.

997
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,300
Yes.

998
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:26,620
Right?

999
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:39,460
It says right here that Alice and Fred will be at church supper tonight with a big pot of broccoli casserole.

1000
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,480
You don't mean that rabbit supper, Vinnie?

1001
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,880
Give me a reference.

1002
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,320
Why do y'all keep calling me?

1003
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,240
You're bothering me.

1004
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,440
I sure would like to rub your little rabbit.

1005
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,500
I don't know your brother.

1006
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,080
Went national back in 1984.

1007
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,260
Go to hell!

1008
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,340
The idea started as a business decision.

1009
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,380
Shut up and do to y'all more.

1010
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,040
Now airs on more than 500 public radio stations.

1011
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,300
North America boasts an audience of more than 1.7 million.

1012
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,780
Hey, we tell you about it, but you know, you know, you know.

1013
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,400
We have no advertising or publicity budget.

1014
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,600
What happened to that you know, you know, but you never know, you never know?

1015
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,280
I don't know, I meant to call him.

1016
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,420
On KPFN.

1017
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,600
Hey, and if we would, we would.

1018
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,020
He would be here, you know, in a way.

1019
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,260
So he can wake up in the middle of the night.

1020
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,160
It takes a talent that you cultivate over years.

1021
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,080
You're not supposed to play the CDs on track.

1022
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,940
Yeah, what's it on track where I can, for track record?

1023
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,240
It's cool, man.

1024
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,900
I'm only sleeping.

1025
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,040
He's cool.

1026
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,840
He's cool.

1027
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,680
All right.

1028
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,240
Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's job?

1029
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,740
The guy that was cooking all those pants that are missing.

1030
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,920
They were making some chowder and soup.

1031
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,640
Yeah.

1032
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,000
It wasn't the guy.

1033
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,380
It was Mrs. Murphy herself.

1034
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,320
She forgot that she was doing the pants and then she put in the chowder.

1035
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,340
Oh, my gosh.

1036
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,820
Oh, no, now they're chowder.

1037
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,680
But now we've got the pants chowder soup souffle.

1038
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,160
Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder?

1039
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,200
Nobody answered, so he shouted even louder.

1040
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,280
It's an Irish trick that's true.

1041
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,280
I can lick the micklet through.

1042
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,860
The overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder.

1043
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,600
I can't stand that pants flavor.

1044
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,980
There's too much show in this pants soup.

1045
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,400
I'll never get my Twinkies.

1046
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:49,320
I can't get these little pubic hairs out of my teeth that come with this show chowder.

1047
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,600
What's the deal with that?

1048
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,020
Don't you ever floss, man?

1049
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,240
What about those pants?

1050
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,420
Those pants should have been...

1051
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,220
They should have been at least shaken out a little bit before we put them in the chowder.

1052
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,460
And the entire crowd was disgusted with what happened to her trousers.

1053
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Rabble trousers.

1054
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,440
Rabble trouser-rousers.

1055
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:14,300
I'd like to fly away with a pair of Mrs. Murphy's pants.

1056
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,840
Sure, and Mrs. Murphy forgot.

1057
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,440
Mrs. Murphy, what is here?

1058
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,080
The pants.

1059
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,120
It was Kiefer Sutherland in Dark City.

1060
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,080
Mrs. Murphy went and visited Japan.

1061
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,880
And was groped on a streetcar.

1062
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,940
I can help you find new pants.

1063
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,860
You must do what I say.

1064
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,260
Simmer down.

1065
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,800
If I was into Mrs. Murphy's pants...

1066
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,280
Too late.

1067
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,780
It's all past praying for now.

1068
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,880
There's only room for one of us in here.

1069
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,440
Get out!

1070
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,840
Now, boys.

1071
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,100
Mrs. Murphy became a radio bitch.

1072
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,920
But Mrs. Murphy...

1073
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,420
Bitch.

1074
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,900
I'm sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

1075
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,640
I just thought that there was plenty of room for two of us.

1076
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,200
I didn't mean to burst out with such an intemperate...

1077
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,420
Bitch.

1078
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:56,680
I'm sorry.

1079
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,500
I think we just ought to go to where the Naboo live...

1080
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,360
The Naboo?

1081
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,300
...and cut down the tree.

1082
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,820
Then we can get all those Navis in on it.

1083
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,060
And then they can have...

1084
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,240
That's not real, Jack.

1085
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,900
And then I can go over to the end of the show with the girl Navis.

1086
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,980
The end of the show, as we know it.

1087
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,400
I like the gnat Navis.

1088
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,440
The gnat Navis.

1089
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:18,720
You do.

1090
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,380
You're like the little bug in the jungle Navis.

1091
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,680
You'll say that backwards.

1092
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,340
Gnat Navis Rebellion.

1093
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:24,820
Wait.

1094
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,280
Come on.

1095
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,040
Reap.

1096
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,360
Spell that backwards.

1097
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,020
Gnat Navis.

1098
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:29,820
River Navi.

1099
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,500
River Reap.

1100
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,580
That's a clue.

1101
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,520
I just want a girl Navi.

1102
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,800
And a friendly flop house nearby.

1103
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,120
I want a girl just like the girl who married dear old dad.

1104
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,340
If I could flop...

1105
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,120
Don't worry, son.

1106
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,780
We'll get you that girl Navi.

1107
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,740
And a flop house of my pleasure.

1108
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,200
Either that or a Johnny Reb Cannon.

1109
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,460
As long as we can flop, we have to flop.

1110
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,620
A Johnny Eagle Army Gun.

1111
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,640
Johnny Eagle Army Gun.

1112
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,220
Yeah.

1113
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:55,960
Yeah.

1114
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,980
A whole army comes out of it when you shoot it.

1115
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,040
Hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi.

1116
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,760
Oh, jeez.

1117
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,380
Yeah, but the army's all 2D.

1118
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,520
You know, if you look at them this way, they look like army guns.

1119
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,440
But if you look at them this way, they're just like little drops of plastic.

1120
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,580
There's 99 cents for, what was it, battleship engagement.

1121
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,960
Those were a rip-off.

1122
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,440
You mean those little army men that were advertising them after comic books?

1123
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,380
Yeah, I got the comic books.

1124
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,660
You thought it was a great deal.

1125
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,640
You know, a million army men for a dollar.

1126
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,700
And they had those lists.

1127
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,920
Like four generals, five sharpshooters, three admirals.

1128
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,440
Yes, and they were all flat.

1129
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,120
And they were all little flat guys that burned up with a match real good.

1130
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:33,560
Flat guys.

1131
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,400
When your disappointment took over and you couldn't handle it anymore.

1132
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,840
Well, that's the way Russian toy soldiers wear their silhouettes.

1133
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,140
True, yeah.

1134
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,160
They look pretty good as silhouettes, but they're flat.

1135
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,560
Yes.

1136
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,200
If you go up to the Petaluma Military Museum, they have some of those things still.

1137
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,000
They're slowly being sold off as the old guys who owned them die.

1138
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,160
Oh, in the basement area, yeah.

1139
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,940
Yeah, in the basement area.

1140
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,340
And their kids sell off the cool old...

1141
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,680
Hitler ashtrays.

1142
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,120
Here's what you get in one giant footlocker.

1143
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,060
Yeah, footlocker.

1144
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,160
Eight battleships, six support groups, twelve destroyers.

1145
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,620
Three toupees, five guns.

1146
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,180
Yeah, all this stuff.

1147
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,300
And they came and they were like...

1148
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,000
Little slappy towers, sea engines.

1149
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:10,800
MREs.

1150
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,740
They didn't have MREs.

1151
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,320
Somebody's here.

1152
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,720
They would be doing...

1153
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,020
And they had revolutionary soldiers.

1154
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,500
They don't get any food at all.

1155
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,160
It's kind of...

1156
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,020
There's always a toy code.

1157
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,320
Like in the original Marx Brothers Civil War set.

1158
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,760
The Union guys only got...

1159
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,200
They got wounded.

1160
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,160
They had a couple of Union...

1161
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,360
But they're still alive, obviously.

1162
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,320
The rebel guys, they get dead.

1163
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:38,960
Well, yeah, the Fort Apache set, you got one cavalry man with an arrow in his gut,

1164
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,120
which was really cool.

1165
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,060
I want that action.

1166
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,760
I remember that one.

1167
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,620
That one used to get...

1168
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,480
That arrow used to get bitten off early.

1169
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,420
Yeah.

1170
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,660
But there were a couple of Indians who were down on their knees

1171
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,240
looking like they'd just been shot.

1172
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,040
Oh, yeah, I remember.

1173
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,320
Yeah, yeah.

1174
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,020
I remember those, too.

1175
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,220
Yeah, I had, for many years, the Confederate guys in the Marx system

1176
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,820
had a guy who was like a little...

1177
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:03,900
Who's that?

1178
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,040
That camera, the sculptor.

1179
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,660
But he's rolling.

1180
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,440
The horse is rolling forward, and he's going over, and he's like...

1181
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,400
Action death scenes.

1182
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,380
Yeah, and I had him on my desk for years.

1183
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,220
Our kids nowadays get toy dinosaurs that are biting into each other

1184
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,080
and ripping flesh.

1185
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,840
Yeah, but do you remember those cheap kind we used to buy

1186
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,600
where you could get...

1187
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,980
Like dino damage.

1188
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,000
A 30-piece.

1189
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,380
A 70-piece set.

1190
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,440
An 80-piece set.

1191
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,740
A 120-piece set.

1192
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,000
And then there was like a 700-piece set that was like,

1193
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,900
Oh, my God!

1194
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,100
I grew up thinking that all dinosaurs had their name

1195
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,640
and their length engraved on their bodies.

1196
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,240
On their tails or on the ventral stamp.

1197
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,500
Yeah, that's so when they were fighting the dinosaur

1198
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,760
and the dinosaur was going,

1199
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,860
I'm about to die.

1200
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,960
I wonder who's killing me.

1201
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,420
He could roll, you know, over on the ground and look up.

1202
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,780
Allosaurus, 30 feet.

1203
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,420
Oh, cool.

1204
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,000
Marx.

1205
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,680
Kenner.

1206
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,540
China.

1207
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:53,760
China.

1208
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,000
China.

1209
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,200


1210
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,220
China.

1211
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,220


1212
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,220


1213
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,220


1214
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,220


1215
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,220


1216
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,220


1217
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,220


1218
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,220


1219
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,220


1220
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,520
I would know who their god was.

1221
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,060
It's ideal.

1222
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,080
Yeah, ideal made me thump and then he died.

1223
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,420
It's Kenner.

1224
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,180
It's fun.

1225
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,720
Except the dinosaurs in El Bello Durmiente

1226
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,060
who were hand-sewn by Chichagos.

1227
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,820
Those were quite incredible.

1228
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,060
You can tell a group of people are about 10 years,

1229
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,520
20 years from death's door

1230
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,760
when they're talking about old plastic toys from the 1950s.

1231
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,460
And then there was this cool thing that blew up.

1232
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,920
Those are highly collectible.

1233
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,980
Philo and I found ourselves looking up the American...

1234
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,980
American Plastic Brick Company.

1235
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,240
Oh, I love that.

1236
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,000
Do you have any of those things?

1237
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,980
Well, I used to have them.

1238
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,420
You can find them.

1239
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,000
What are the...

1240
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,160
On any building at some point.

1241
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,760
And the Gerger and Panels set.

1242
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,800
I loved those.

1243
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,840
American Plastic Bricks were great.

1244
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,320
Absolutely great.

1245
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,660
They were much better than Legos.

1246
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,300
Incredibly better than Legos.

1247
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,960
But Legos made a greater market penetration

1248
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,380
and forced them out of business.

1249
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,020
Now Legos are like a fact of life.

1250
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,700
They're everywhere.

1251
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,520
American Brick is like a fetish.

1252
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,600
I don't remember them.

1253
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,600
Collector's Society.

1254
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,620
They weren't there.

1255
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,700
Yeah, there's an American Brick Pointer.

1256
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,740
I'll show you a picture of them and you'll remember them.

1257
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,260
The thing that they could do was

1258
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,740
you could actually architecturally build houses,

1259
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,360
like colonial houses with windows and doors and so on.

1260
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,020
You could create them so that they...

1261
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,860
You could build recessed windows and walls.

1262
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,180
Then you could crash your Tonka Tor trucks into it.

1263
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,120
And they crashed.

1264
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,920
Set them on fire.

1265
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
There was no border.

1266
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,820
All the bricks would fly apart.

1267
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,420
With a 10-millimeter camera.

1268
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:23,900
Yeah.

1269
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,000
Toy dinosaurs could crash into it.

1270
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,640
Which you paid 50 cents for a roll of film.

1271
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,060
And knocked down the wall realistically.

1272
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,860
And there were chimneys and roofs and finial windows

1273
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,300
and philasters and so forth.

1274
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,720
Who can even say that stuff anymore?

1275
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,920
Who cares about those old guy buildings?

1276
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,600
But they look neat when you made them.

1277
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,000
They still sell Lincoln Logs, but they're not wood.

1278
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,160
They're plastic.

1279
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,700
Oh, I know.

1280
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,540
They're useless.

1281
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,940
How about Tinker Toys?

1282
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,800
They're Plinkin' Logs.

1283
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,220
You can't even tinker with them.

1284
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,560
You can't even tinker with them anymore.

1285
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,420
So stupid.

1286
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,040
It's like plastic Lincoln Logs.

1287
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:58,720
I want a girl Navi.

1288
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,120
That's why I always go back to, I want a girl Navi.

1289
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:03,740
Yeah.

1290
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,940
I mean, that would pretty much set me up.

1291
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,620
You know, if I could...

1292
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:11,040
I want a girl Navi and I want to run through the trees really fast like that.

1293
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,640
And then have to go up the rocks to get my own dragon.

1294
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,360
All I got was a girl Ivan.

1295
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,160
I don't think these are the ones, though.

1296
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,840
Oh, I can see why you'd be disappointed.

1297
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,160
These.

1298
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,780
This is the one.

1299
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,160
The Halsem and Elgo.

1300
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,520
Different companies made them.

1301
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,220
This is the one.

1302
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:24,220


1303
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:24,220


1304
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:24,220


1305
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:24,220


1306
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:24,220


1307
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,580
This is the set.

1308
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,280
They were called New American Plastic Bricks.

1309
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,500
See the garage door in the middle there?

1310
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,840
These are window frames in the air.

1311
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,040
Those were nifty.

1312
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:40,900
And if you could buy several cans, you could make incredibly large, elaborate, and realistically

1313
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,160
proportioned structures.

1314
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,120
Castles with turrets and all that stuff.

1315
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:51,600
Just as Charles Foster Kane went to his death mumbling about his toy sled from childhood,

1316
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,220
so the puzzling evidence showed...

1317
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,980
Oh, they're little garage.

1318
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,020
...Halsem Garage.

1319
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:01,740
...fellows will mumble away about Mark's plastic dinosaur sets and Aurora monster model kits.

1320
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,420
And Disney kids' figurines.

1321
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,900
And Mark's moon comics.

1322
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,880
And Mark's Civil War.

1323
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,360
And Mark's radio show set.

1324
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,040
Bye-bye.

1325
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,020
Yeah, the little plastic radio station.

1326
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,260
Yeah, the little plastic arms that hold the mics.

1327
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:21,320
Most of the Mark's dinosaur set was based on the Rudolph Zellinger dinosaur mural at Yale.

1328
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,540
Some of it.

1329
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:22,940
Helios.

1330
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,340
Helios.

1331
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:23,660
Helios.

1332
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:23,920
Helios.

1333
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,220
Helios.

1334
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,220


1335
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,220


1336
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,220


1337
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,220


1338
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,220


1339
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,220


1340
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,220


1341
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,220


1342
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,480
And the cavemen were based on Charles...

1343
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:25,580
Okay, yeah.

1344
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,040
Any questions?

1345
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:27,820
Slip your questions.

1346
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,460
Oh, yeah, okay.

1347
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,840
My question is...

1348
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,520
Cavemen of the Neanderthal race.

1349
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:33,780
Exactly.

1350
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,420
Right.

1351
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:34,700
Yeah.

1352
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,100
The sculpture of those figures was marvelous.

1353
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,840
Just stab it in there.

1354
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,240
Go ahead.

1355
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:38,900
Throw it in there.

1356
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,100
Yeah.

1357
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,280
It has never been equaled by any subsequent set.

1358
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:41,800
Just toss it like a...

1359
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:41,800


1360
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,720
Toss it like a salad.

1361
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,520
Toss it in there over and over again until we hear it.

1362
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,700
I still have one of my little cavemen, Dr. Hal.

1363
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:53,960
The one that was napping Flint is sitting in a window box with a bunch of pretty,

1364
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,440
pretty rocks in our bathroom.

1365
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,060
So the little caveman is surrounded by his...

1366
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,120
The Flint napper, huh?

1367
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,600
Yeah.

1368
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,420
Napping away.

1369
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,820
Was he chewed by a kitty cat somewhere along the line?

1370
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,620
A little bit.

1371
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,420
You know, I had a great...

1372
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,200
It's hard to get a word in edgewise, but if you keep trying, you can.

1373
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,200
Brontosaurus from the British Museum.

1374
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,140
Might take a few years, but...

1375
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,260
A cat chewed his head.

1376
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:14,860
Over the edge.

1377
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,640
Roll it in there.

1378
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,980
Why do cats chew these prehistoric reconstructions?

1379
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,780
Over the puzzling edge of evidence.

1380
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,380
Of course, once I put this...

1381
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,260
Later on, when I listen to this back, I will be able to hear your question.

1382
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,380
I won't be able to answer it.

1383
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,360
Listen to find the answer.

1384
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,440
And move it forward in time.

1385
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,080
Yeah.

1386
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:34,940
Yeah?

1387
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,480
That's it?

1388
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:35,740
Yeah.

1389
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,900
Well, my question is, were you guys talking about Audrey Murphy, the Irish girl...

1390
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,940
The Twin Peaks Audrey.

1391
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,680
Mrs. Murphy's drawers.

1392
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,000
Right.

1393
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,300
Mrs. Murphy's pants.

1394
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,340
Her huge, huge...

1395
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,680
But what's this about playful little Audrey?

1396
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,960
We were in her pants.

1397
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,660
Earlier tonight.

1398
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Apparently, she lived in the 18th century, and she could come up with a tale about the

1399
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:01,840
life of the 18th century.

1400
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,400
Little Audrey.

1401
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,580
And the...

1402
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,060
But she's in, you know, 1935 Ireland or something.

1403
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,300
You mean Bridie Murphy.

1404
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,320
Bridie Murphy.

1405
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:18,180
I'm sorry to have to tell you that that person, like many others who have claimed to live

1406
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,340
past lives, was exposed as a fraud.

1407
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,020
No!

1408
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:21,920
No!

1409
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:22,840
No!

1410
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,780
If...

1411
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,160
If...

1412
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,260
If that's a lie, then everything's a lie.

1413
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,060
Even astrology.

1414
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,100
My God.

1415
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,460
I'm sorry, but your cherished illusions must be exploded.

1416
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,320
That was the last hope of a future life for me.

1417
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,140
I'm not.

1418
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,940
Oh, I know.

1419
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,860
This is my one plan.

1420
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,660
Oh, Bridie.

1421
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,200
Actually, Bridie herself might have been celebrated for her cleverness had she not employed it

1422
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,400
in a fraudulent manner.

1423
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:53,980
Yes.

1424
00:43:54,080 --> 00:44:00,940
In creating imaginary languages and elaborate histories, like many other fraudsters through

1425
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,360
history.

1426
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:09,900
Well, the great Ponzi, of course, an Italian-Canadian who invented the speed and made machines and

1427
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,720
made millions.

1428
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,820
Well, listen, are you going to the Davy Normal thing tomorrow?

1429
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,040
Oh, my God, yes.

1430
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,240
It's the event of the century.

1431
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,460
And I just want to stay in...

1432
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,380
Stay in the world.

1433
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:23,380


1434
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:23,380


1435
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:23,380


1436
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:29,020
I want to say, I want to say to Noah that it's totally unusual that anything interesting

1437
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,180
actually happens around here.

1438
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,180
And so don't think this is a normal weekend.

1439
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,020
It will recharge the performance space in general.

1440
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,860
I just keep saying normal.

1441
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,020
No one turned away for inability to pay.

1442
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,320
Everyone keeps saying normal, normal, normal.

1443
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,920
It's Michael Pepe?

1444
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,960
Yes, of course.

1445
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,220
Princess Wee.

1446
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,140
I've been worshipping you this evening.

1447
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:52,660
No.

1448
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,700
I'm sorry.

1449
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,200
I'm sorry.

1450
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,660
Michael, you'll be pleased to know that this week's Hour of Slack rerun features you.

1451
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,280
Oh, good.

1452
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,720
Yeah, it's a Pepe...

1453
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,180
I think I called it a Pepe-palooza.

1454
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,460
Oh, good.

1455
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,840
A Pepe-palooza special, and it has several clips from your ancient tapes.

1456
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,560
Well, anyway, we were able to get to the depth of what...

1457
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,860
Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder tonight.

1458
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,360
Did you find out who?

1459
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,260
I told you it was Mrs. Murphy herself.

1460
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:22,640
Yes.

1461
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,220
She...

1462
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,380
It was Mrs. Murphy herself.

1463
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,340
I can't see.

1464
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:26,720
It's fine.

1465
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,860
It was Mrs. Murphy and Michael Pepe in the drawing room with the muscle.

1466
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,260
Oh, Mrs. Murphy.

1467
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,020
McGinty, though, was...

1468
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,660
You know, we never know for sure if it was McGinty's pants.

1469
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,700
I blame Mrs. Murphy.

1470
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:39,580
No.

1471
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:44,820
But you gotta tell them to send me money, you know, when you claim to show.

1472
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,480
Oh, I always did.

1473
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,340
Completely unethical and non-allowable.

1474
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:49,900
I say quit.

1475
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,740
Send money to Michael Pepe.

1476
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,380
Otherwise...

1477
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:52,640
Yeah.

1478
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,640


1479
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,640


1480
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,640


1481
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,640


1482
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,640


1483
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,640


1484
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,640


1485
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,640


1486
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,640


1487
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,640


1488
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,640


1489
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,640


1490
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,140
I'd be asking for money myself.

1491
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,200
She put him into wash that day.

1492
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,720
Michael, you do live at Post Office Box 14...

1493
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,060
What is it?

1494
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:04,400
What is it?

1495
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,380
Post Office Box 1411.

1496
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,100
You can download the Bing and Gross B-

1497
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:09,480
181417.

1498
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,380
Michael Pepe at P.O.

1499
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,820
Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1500
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,440
Sure.

1501
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,240
And you guys take your time to send me the rest.

1502
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,080
Subgenius.com.

1503
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,620
Yeah.

1504
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:30,080
You know, we've got the proceeds, but you have the secret CIA proof Post Office Box.

1505
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,740
Your reality.

1506
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,340
Teenage subgenius.

1507
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,360
I can't believe you forgot it.

1508
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,000
You're very old.

1509
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,920
Dad, you forgot the number?

1510
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,280
Geez.

1511
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,100
Talk about old.

1512
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,960
Do you dare to see the Pepe off the I-10?

1513
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,500
No, we were talking about the thing that really-

1514
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,860
Just off, just past Wilcox, Arizona.

1515
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,660
The thing.

1516
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,620
Can you take it?

1517
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,260
The Pepe.

1518
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,700
I don't want to stop this car.

1519
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,220
No, but we got to see it.

1520
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,780
Steve Wilcox, Arizona.

1521
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,340
I don't want to stop this car.

1522
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,460
No, but we got to see it.

1523
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,300
And then we get stuck in a loop.

1524
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,300
We don't have time.

1525
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:00,800
Yes.

1526
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,280
We can't-

1527
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:01,560
I know.

1528
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:01,760
Anyway.

1529
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,040
Am I going to be the-

1530
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:03,680
All right.

1531
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,040
We got to see it guy or do you want to be the-

1532
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,880
It doesn't matter because we're just stuck in a loop.

1533
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,160
I'm going to say it back.

1534
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,400
Stuck in a loop.

1535
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,620
I have a question.

1536
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,100
You never got to hear my question.

1537
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:15,820
That's true.

1538
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,620
Okay, go.

1539
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,500
Go, go, quick, quick.

1540
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,220
Well, the thing-

1541
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:20,180
Yes?

1542
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,180
Now, say your question now.

1543
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,020
It's a beautiful day.

1544
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,060


1545
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,140
I'm going to say it and then-

1546
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,140


1547
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,560
No, no, no.

1548
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,000
Will you be my friend?

1549
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:24,940
No, go ahead.

1550
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,180
Really.

1551
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,260
Okay.

1552
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:26,660
Okay.

1553
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,420
Take a deep breath and go.

1554
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:29,680
Okay.

1555
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,560
We got five minutes left, so it's almost enough time to ingest your question.

1556
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:41,100
The thing is an ancient German barbarian festival in which people-

1557
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,240
You got to say your question while Michael Pepe is talking.

1558
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,020
No, the thing is-

1559
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:45,740
The thing is-

1560
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,040
It's like the original German Jeep.

1561
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,280
Hitler loves the thing.

1562
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,400
He wanted people to get back-

1563
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:51,640
He did.

1564
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:51,980
And he wanted people to get back.

1565
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:51,980


1566
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:51,980


1567
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:51,980


1568
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:51,980


1569
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:51,980


1570
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,040
And he wanted people to get back.

1571
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,040


1572
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:56,200
And he wanted to go to Virginia and go see the thing in Loudoun County.

1573
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,900
I think that was the question.

1574
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,740
I want to show my thing, but I'm prevented from that by law.

1575
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,840
The thing that you mentioned was a Viking festival, I believe.

1576
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,040
Put that thing back in Mrs. Murphy's pants.

1577
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,320
I think it was-

1578
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,360
See, that's the thing.

1579
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,620
Oh, okay.

1580
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,160
She's-

1581
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,620
Okay, I think you said that-

1582
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:16,980
I know.

1583
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,960
That's the thing.

1584
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,180
Okay.

1585
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,020
I think you said that-

1586
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,020


1587
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,020


1588
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,020


1589
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,020


1590
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,020


1591
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,020


1592
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,020


1593
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,020


1594
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,020


1595
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,020


1596
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,020


1597
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,020


1598
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,160
Okay, here's the thing.

1599
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:23,560
Oh my God.

1600
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,020
Yeah.

1601
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,900
Okay, let's wrap up all the themes of tonight's show.

1602
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:27,480
Okay.

1603
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:27,860
I think-

1604
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:28,340
Things.

1605
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:28,980
Pants.

1606
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,580
I think that was it.

1607
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,320
Cracks.

1608
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:32,800
Holes.

1609
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,160
Plastic dinosaurs.

1610
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,280
The Kraken.

1611
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:35,560
Holes.

1612
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,420
The American Brick Company.

1613
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,920
American plastic brick.

1614
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,280
Cool plastic guys in Mark's set.

1615
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,160
Witches on the side of the road.

1616
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,260
And don't forget-

1617
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:44,360
Giants.

1618
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:51,560
The Marks set had an exploding bunker and it had a southern house plantation.

1619
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:51,580
Yeah.

1620
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:51,940
And it had a southern house plantation.

1621
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,000
Yeah.

1622
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,000


1623
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,000


1624
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,000


1625
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:56,240
And it had little Lincoln and a little Davis and a little Lee.

1626
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:56,820
Oh, little Lincoln.

1627
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,200
Little Lincoln.

1628
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,520
And we had a bunch of secret clues in this week's show.

1629
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,240
Little Lincoln.

1630
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:01,420
Yeah.

1631
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,260
Little Lincoln.

1632
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:02,920
A bunch of them.

1633
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,360
Little Lincoln.

1634
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,420
Not a bucket.

1635
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,840
Not a universe, but a bunch.

1636
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,080
And we're trying to get to this question from the caller.

1637
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:09,720
A sticky bunch.

1638
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,460
But her phone doesn't seem to cut through.

1639
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,640
I'll have this sticky bunch.

1640
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,440
This caller just doesn't cut the mustard.

1641
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,160
I'm wondering if she's on a wireless, a handheld-

1642
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,120
She's on something.

1643
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:21,440
A wireless telephone.

1644
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:21,940
She's on something.

1645
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:21,960
She's on something.

1646
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:21,960


1647
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:21,960


1648
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:21,960


1649
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:24,780
Yeah.

1650
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,980
The connection's not good.

1651
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,420
And also the physical-

1652
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,480
I was always well connected myself.

1653
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,020
It's funny how a wireless phone at the current-

1654
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,980
Once I got plugged in, I could really dominate a wireless phone on that connection over there.

1655
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:38,780
Always be doing.

1656
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,340
Can you hear me?

1657
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,200
I can barely hear you.

1658
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,060
State short question, please.

1659
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,420
Well, perfect.

1660
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,700
Wouldn't it be done?

1661
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,380
And, you know, wireless is the same, too.

1662
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,540
All right.

1663
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:51,860
Stop.

1664
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,000
I'm sorry.

1665
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1666
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1667
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1668
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1669
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1670
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1671
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1672
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1673
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1674
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1675
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1676
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1677
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1678
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000


1679
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,300
I'm going to call the police.

1680
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:52,300


1681
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:52,300


1682
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:52,300


1683
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:52,300


1684
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:52,300


1685
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:52,300


1686
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:52,300


1687
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,480
Yabbering about technology.

1688
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,360
You need to tighten the string between those tin cans.

1689
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:56,760
Ask the question.

1690
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,320
Pull the string.

1691
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,540
Pull the string.

1692
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,660
The string must be tight.

1693
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,440
It must be taut, I say.

1694
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,800
It's all about reception.

1695
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,560
It must be mounted on a tripod.

1696
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:11,500
It's about the technical quality of the phone today.

1697
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,660
Pull the string and this whole thing's coming down.

1698
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,380
I hope.

1699
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,720
I hope.

1700
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,120
Celio, if geniuses were perfect, wouldn't they be God?

1701
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,000
There's something wrong with the way we talk, Celio.

1702
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,000


1703
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,700
the string. God is within you.

1704
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,320
Geniuses were perfect.

1705
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:27,960
Geniuses are like a little

1706
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:29,520
sub

1707
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,140
branch of the whole thing.

1708
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,380
It's just one of the many little parts.

1709
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,840
Geniuses are just little meat.

1710
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,520
They're made of meat.

1711
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,940
And they come up with some answers.

1712
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,540
Everybody's God.

1713
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,620
Yeah, exactly. My God's bigger

1714
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,880
than your God. And everybody's

1715
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,500
a ham and cheese croissant.

1716
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,760
A ham and cheese croissant

1717
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,560
radio operator.

1718
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,980
A five-day thing.

1719
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,540
And what about that fried chicken?

1720
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,900
And they're restoring the Burlington Hotel in Port Costa.

1721
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,440
And I think that's totally hot.

1722
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,060
Home cooking.

1723
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,320
Yep.

1724
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,500
The question you have to ask yourself is this week and next week

1725
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,880
and the weeks following, what's on your radio?

1726
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,260
Will Reverend Stang be back?

1727
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,260
Yeah.

1728
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,000
Bye, guys.

1729
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,980
Well, darn it.

1730
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,180
That puzzling evidence show from

1731
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,280
February 8th or whatever

1732
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,600
ended eight minutes

1733
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,840
early for Hour of Slack.

1734
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,160
But I found

1735
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,000
exactly eight minutes

1736
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,360
of very old Hour of Slack

1737
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,180
from 1990.

1738
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,960
We'll end the show

1739
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,260
with the beginning of

1740
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,640
an ancient, ancient show

1741
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,720
from the year of 1990 or so.

1742
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,680
But this show's already starting off rough.

1743
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,600
Thank you for not smoking.

1744
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,440
Don't be afraid of that which makes you abnormal.

1745
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:07,540
Don't be afraid of that thing that made the teacher say,

1746
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,920
wipe that smile off your face.

1747
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,680
Don't be afraid of that which makes you different.

1748
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:19,960
Take that which is different in you and exploit it to its fullest extent.

1749
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,860
And don't disagree because that is the only way

1750
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,060
that you will find true happiness.

1751
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,680
But forget the old Hour of Slack

1752
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,280
because we're now presenting the new and improved Hour of Flack,

1753
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:33,740
dear friends.

1754
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,620
You are under arrest.

1755
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,000
Stop or I'll shoot.

1756
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,380
Stop or I'll shoot.

1757
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,500
Oh, well.

1758
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,860
Back to the drawing.

1759
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:49,940


1760
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:50,180
I'm bored.

1761
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,920
And they've been presenting the new Hour of Snacks.

1762
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:58,880
That's right.

1763
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,800
This time we'll make lots of money with the new Hour of...

1764
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,820
Sorry, Bob.

1765
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,460
We're trying.

1766
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,300
Oh, my.

1767
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,800
She is still alive, Master.

1768
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,340
Yes.

1769
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,520
You must remember that the space you're putting your hand through

1770
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:19,920
is to this.

1771
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,640
This is today's space.

1772
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,840
You can't put your hand into the space of tomorrow.

1773
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
Oh, the space is space.

1774
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,320
It doesn't change.

1775
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:31,580
The same space that's here now should be here in a hundred or even a thousand years from now.

1776
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:32,220
No, Philip.

1777
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,140
Time changes space.

1778
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:35,300
Oh.

1779
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:42,540
Look, this flat ground we're standing on could have been at the bottom of the sea a million years ago.

1780
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,000
And a million years from now, it could be the interior of a huge mountain.

1781
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:48,980
All right.

1782
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,220
All right.

1783
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,720
Suppose what you say is true.

1784
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,960
What do you expect us to do with such a contraption?

1785
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,180
Contraption?

1786
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,900
For my part, I intend taking a journey into the future.

1787
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,940
Well, of course I may be crazy.

1788
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,940
The following events took place in the outskirts of London towards the close of the year 1918.

1789
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,220
They began on the night of October the 15th.

1790
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,860
A particularly gloomy, foggy night.

1791
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:22,340
But it was well suited for a visitation by the supernatural.

1792
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,260
Ah, yes.

1793
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,380
And just look over there at that coffin.

1794
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:29,980
Look.

1795
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,960
It's rocking back and forth.

1796
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,260
It's got a speaker on it.

1797
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,280
A little microphone.

1798
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:39,300
It's the subgenius radio ministry.

1799
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,680
Hour of slack.

1800
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,220
Crawling out into your living room and car with your host.

1801
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,220
Reverend Ivan Stagg.

1802
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:51,940
Oh, no, no.

1803
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,600
Don't run away.

1804
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,760
I'm only a preacher.

1805
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,840
A man of Bob.

1806
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:01,280
I've preached to many people without...

1807
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,900
And the preacher got up.

1808
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,280
Man, he's a loser.

1809
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,380
He looked like good guy Lee and had a northern accent and he couldn't talk right.

1810
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,880
And he cut food.

1811
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,240
Nothing serious.

1812
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,160
Man, I've been to church.

1813
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,200
People act like they had sense.

1814
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,100
This guy gets up and on and on and on.

1815
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:18,200
And he's a preacher.

1816
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,200


1817
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,200


1818
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,200


1819
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,200


1820
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,200


1821
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,200


1822
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,200


1823
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,200


1824
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,200


1825
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,200


1826
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,200


1827
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,200


1828
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,100
But, man, I could tell you word for word everything he said.

1829
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,740
And I thought he was really cute.

1830
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:29,200
And he had this dark suit on and this slick back hairdo, you know, and this northern accent.

1831
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:35,820
And he was talking so fast that I didn't want to listen, but I had to listen because I didn't

1832
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,620
want to miss anything.

1833
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,660
It was so unique.

1834
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,740
I'd never heard anybody with an approach like this.

1835
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,460
He went on like that, you know.

1836
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,320
A lot of humor in it, but a lot of truth, too, when you listen.

1837
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,740
And he looked out and he said, now, who's fooling you?

1838
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,180
And, man, that's funny.

1839
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,180
He slapped me right in the face.

1840
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:52,080
I knew right then who's fool I'd been all my life.

1841
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:52,920
See, I didn't drink.

1842
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,460
I didn't smoke.

1843
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,000
I didn't know what drugs were.

1844
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,720
I wasn't a down and outer.

1845
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,520
I was nothing outer.

1846
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,760
I was so good, I'd get to nothing going straight to hell.

1847
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:03,940
Boy, I'll tell you what.

1848
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,360
I realized then what kind of fool he'd really been talking about because I was that fool.

1849
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:13,960
I was so controlled by what other people thought about me that I couldn't really be myself.

1850
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:18,160
I was so controlled by vanity and pride, by looking at myself.

1851
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,160


1852
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:22,000
I was so controlled by books and all these things that I was just nothing but an imbecile and a moron.

1853
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,340
Are you that imbecile?

1854
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,180
Are you that moron, dear friend?

1855
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,700
Well, of course I may, but crazy.

1856
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,220
Repent!

1857
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,240
Quit your job!

1858
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,380
Slack off!

1859
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,160
And praise Bob!

1860
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,820
Church of the Subgenius, eternal salvation, or triple your money back.

1861
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,160
Will you guys knock it off back there?

1862
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,240
God, did you bring these?

1863
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:47,720
The...

1864
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:53,100
Reverend 3.0's never been in the station during a pledge drive before and he's just having a big party back there.

1865
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,640
Breaking windows, looting.

1866
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,820
Oh, those aren't your records!

1867
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,500
There's bodies washing up all over the...

1868
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,240
Actually, friends, you know, we...

1869
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,420
Some of you probably are out there thinking, saying to yourselves, these subgeniuses, they...

1870
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,720
They just think it's all a game.

1871
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,640
They see the news, the horrible news, and they...

1872
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,940
They just, oh, they're gonna make jokes about it.

1873
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,800
But, like I said earlier, I'm a nervous wreck.

1874
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,600
With this noise going on in the background.

1875
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,300
Jesus!

1876
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,300
Oh, pardon my language.

1877
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:27,500
Um, I've been paying bills, editing this video, the making of video all weekend.

1878
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,080
And the news has been so horrible, but with the...

1879
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,360
All these people going into mass graves and wars every...

1880
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,360
Right here inside the station.

1881
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:44,700
Uh, it seems like every other country out there's got a hundred thousand dead people and a million sick.

1882
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,340
There's earthquakes everywhere.

1883
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:51,760
Hideous industrial accidents with toxic waste splashed all over the place.

1884
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,740
Plane crashes and riots.

1885
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,560
Repressive regimes cracking down everywhere.

1886
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:06,360
Why, in some countries, dear friends, heard in the background, radio stations can't even play material that might be construed as critical of the status quo.

1887
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:12,380
And in the rest, that kind of unauthorized material can't be played unless the listeners pay for it.

1888
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:12,880
That's right.

1889
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,280
There is not a...

1890
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:14,620
Oh.

1891
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:18,600
Unless that poor little kid back there doesn't even have the hour of slack anymore.

1892
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,420
Oh.

1893
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,080
There's, um...

1894
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,060
Uh, there are stations that do play...

1895
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,040
Um, really anti-authoritarian stations.

1896
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:34,500
Not a single commercial station in this country does that.

1897
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,060
But there are a few like this one that do.

1898
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,260
But they're all poor.

1899
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,380
Poor stations.

1900
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,800
And there's only a few of them.

1901
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:43,380
And half of them don't last very long.

1902
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,600
Because their listeners don't pay for it.

1903
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,780
And they don't support them with donations.

1904
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:52,680
And so that, my friends, is the state of freedom of speech in America today.

1905
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,640
You can have freedom of speech if you don't play cuss words.

1906
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,340
And if all members of your audience each chip in a little bit of money.

1907
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:10,240
In other words, freedom of the press and speech in America is in real big trouble today.

1908
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,840
It's hanging by a thread, friends.

1909
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,740
And that's what this show is about tonight.

1910
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,480
Censorship.

1911
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,640
But it's also a show...

1912
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:33,940
A show that is dedicated to those people who have actually gone out of their ways to get off of their butts to do something in the fight for our freedom of speech.

1913
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:39,660
Dedicated, in other words, to those who in the past have supported their station with this money.

1914
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,240
This show is for them.

1915
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,700
Post office box 18.

1916
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,060

1918
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:55,560
But you know, he can work his way up at the 7-Eleven.

1919
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,160
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1920
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:06,460
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1921
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,560
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1922
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,820
But if you don't...

1923
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:18,740
Truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you...

1924
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:26,020
You should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages.

1925
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:29,420
And help out financially as best you can.

1926
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:37,420
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1927
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,360
But some of you still have jobs.

1928
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,680
Even five bucks makes a big difference.

1929
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,280
Even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1930
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,680
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1931
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:58,460
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1932
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,940
We also take checks and money orders to subgenius foundation.

01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:21,620
Thanks for anything you can do to help Let There Be Slack.
