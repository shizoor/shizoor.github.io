00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
When I started to learn how to walk, you said, don't keep trying, give up.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,760
When I got frustrated because I couldn't tie my shoes, you said, don't keep trying, give up.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,320
When I didn't make the baseball team, you said, don't keep trying, give up.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,820
And now, I say to you, keep trying, marijuana.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,900
You can get free drugs.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,720
To learn how, call 788-A-MESSAGE from ONDCP and the Partnership for a Free Drug America.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,100
This is the Institute for Motivational Research.

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,600
A place devoted to the intriguing business of finding out why people ticked her.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,960
Why should we fear anything?

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,300
That's right, there are four stages in a butterfly's life.

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,640
Egg, the caterpillar, the chrysalis.

Bob Bob Bob

56
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,760
The Hour

57
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,940
of Slack

58
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,920
The Hour

59
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,080
of Slack

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well my friend, listen.

61
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,920
The Spirit of God

62
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,020
make you all

63
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,220
a straight line.

64
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,500
Not a line,

65
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,260
straight line.

66
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,480
Straight line,

67
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:12,640
line,

68
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,640
straight line,

69
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:13,840
line,

70
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,880
straight line,

71
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,280

74
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:16,600


75
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,140
life,

76
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,560
spiritual,

77
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,020
man,

78
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,560
spirit,

79
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,340
guaranteed.

80
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,620
This is

81
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,440
a very important statement.

82
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,300
I want you to hear it.

83
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,400
The internet

84
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,600
made me so goofy

85
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,420
and lethargic

86
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,400
where I couldn't think,

87
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,080
I couldn't study,

88
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,200
I couldn't control anything.

89
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,720
I was just like,

90
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,360
marriage,

91
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,880
bad news.

92
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,940
If you were in here

93
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,380
this morning

94
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,160
and you're dealing

95
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,860
with the internet

96
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,040
and you're hiding it

97
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,860
and you think you're doing

98
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,800
a good job of hiding it,

99
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,400
you're not hiding it

100
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,780
from the Lord.

101
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,200
And it's corrupting you.

102
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,480
Well no,

103
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,440
I've got it under control.

104
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,120
Because Jesus said,

105
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
this is how you deal with it.

106
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,060
Fornication

107
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,860
and pornography.

108
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:51,920
Yes.

109
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,080
Uncleanness

110
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,600
and lack of

111
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,300
licentiousness.

112
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,060
Yes.

113
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,420
Gushing

114
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,260
and there's

115
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,020
sexual pus

116
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,820
and junk

117
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,820
all coming out of it.

118
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
That's his desire.

119
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,240
To be sexually

120
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,780
oozing

121
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,320
24 hours a day,

122
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720
7 days a week.

123
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,600
Licentiousness.

124
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,700
Just unbridled,

125
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,220
uncontrolled

126
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,500
sexual excesses.

127
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,180
That was something

128
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,740
he invented.

129
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,420
Next is

130
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,880
worshipping

131
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,400
oozing

132
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,800
sexual excesses.

133
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,880
Can you worship

134
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,460
your brand new

135
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,600
shiny sexual pus?

136
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,160
You bet.

137
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,220
Can you worship

138
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,760
fornication?

139
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,420
Yes.

140
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,960
And in our society,

141
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,700
how easy it is

142
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,480
to worship pornography?

143
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,440
So much.

144
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,660
What do you think

145
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,620
will psychiatry help?

146
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,700
Yes, it's an emergency.

147
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,240
.

148
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,240


149
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,440
Download some

150
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,940
rock bitch videos, folks.

151
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,320
Go to your,

152
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,940
go to whatever file sharing

153
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,920
you're doing before

154
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,700
they make it illegal.

155
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,320
.

156
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,160

162
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,400

165
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,460

166
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:08,540

167

168

00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,520


171
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,520


172
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,520


173
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,520


174
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,520


175
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,520


176
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,900
.

177
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,640
I mean description

178
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,400
can be found

179
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:19,800
that you can

180
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,420
make up your own

181
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:20,660
description.

182
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,660
It's mouse over

183
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,660
and windows pop up

184
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,300
to tell you exactly

185
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,840
what you're about

186
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,120
to do.

187
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,960
download and everything.

188
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,380
It's very handy, I think.

189
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,940
Just think how you've archaicized our language

190
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,880
with what you just said.

191
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,260
I am seduced by the UI of it all.

192
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,140
See, once again, your parlance

193
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,120
is like 21st century, Daddy-O.

194
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,000
I can't hip to that.

195
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,020
Did you hear what he just said?

196
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,820
What he's saying is that the artists shouldn't get any

197
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,000
recompense for their work, but that we

198
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,860
should all get everything for free

199
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,860
while we can, which is certainly what I'm doing.

200
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,740
I have downloaded

201
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,680
everything. I could

202
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,860
possibly even see

203
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,800
to download, whether I wanted it, whether

204
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,600
I cared about it, just because

205
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,480
I could. Just to keep my computer

206
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,080
busy and to feel like I was getting my money's worth

207
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,900
for that DSLR.

208
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,860
I don't care if it's child pornography.

209
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,660
Well, actually, I wouldn't. I would not

210
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,880
knowingly download child pornography

211
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,720
because if you have ever

212
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,020
had it on your machine, he will come

213
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,000
and

214
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,760
puff and puff and blow your door down.

215
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,020
How about let's

216
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,600
take a little trip over to the door

217
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,400
here where it says,

218
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,040
Arbacht Marked Fry, or something like that.

219
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,680
Arbacht Marked Fry.

220
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,020
It's funny, the subgeniuses were asking,

221
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,200
how do I permanently erase stuff

222
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,280
from my hard drive? I mean, I know that just

223
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,240
throwing it in the trash and hitting delete

224
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,960
doesn't really do it.

225
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,560
And in fact, you have to overwrite

226
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,400
that thing two or three times

227
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,420
if you want to hide something.

228
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,420
Now, I'm just

229
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,180
the opposite. It's like, I wish

230
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,400
somebody would pay attention to the

231
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,040
cool stuff on my hard drive.

232
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,420
And that is the problem. No one is

233
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,160
interested. And that is

234
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,360
the sour slope we've slipped down

235
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,580
from the orchard heights. The only way you can get that

236
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,420
child porn off your web

237
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,340
your computer is blow up your

238
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,460
hard drive. Now you take the hard drive

239
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,500
out and have it installed

240
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,920
as one of the heat shield

241
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,800
tiles on the shuttle.

242
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,240
Next to the sock drive. And when it comes back

243
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,280
in through, it finally gets erased.

244
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,860
And they come back through the atmosphere.

245
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,460
But that's only during the touch-up

246
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,440
cycle. That's what Pee Wee should have,

247
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,460
done. Yeah. Twice. That's what he should have

248
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,520
done twice. And what did he do the first time?

249
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,080
Nobody knows that. The whole space shuttle,

250
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,280
all those tiles are really hard drives

251
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,220
of people trying to get rid of their porn.

252
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,420
That is probably

253
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,100
true. Because now

254
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,560
Big Brother can stick his snoot right up

255
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,360
your snoot. They're going to make a big old

256
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,220
bonfire out of it. A huge

257
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,420
Arbite mixed fry bonfire

258
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,340
where there'll be a lot of galopping and goose dumping.

259
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,520
That means work shall make us free, right?

260
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,360
Doesn't it? And isn't that true, though?

261
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,380
Doesn't work really make you free? Especially if you're

262
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,280
slaving away for some jackbooted

263
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,220
swine. Yeah, like Bob

264
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,180
Dobbs. That's who I've been

265
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,720
slaving away for all week.

266
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,060
I kind of dig it, actually.

267
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,280
It's not a bad job. Doesn't pay anything

268
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,080
at all. You have to pay them, but

269
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,400
it's kind of cool.

270
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,320
Sure, man.

271
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,720
I love you.

272
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,520
Put them down now.

273
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,900
What am I doing?

274
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,100
I'm in a

275
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,740
trash.

276
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,080
Pick them right away.

277
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,360
Trash.

278
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,160
Pick them right away.

279
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,820
Pick them right away.

280
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,220
I will

281
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,960
kill you.

282
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,420
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this edition

283
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,060
of the 700 Club. I'm ready

284
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,700
to pull the trigger.

285
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,520
So that's what we're looking at.

286
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,360
A lot of blood being spilt all

287
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,240
over the place.

288
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,440
And I think that this is going to be

289
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,840
nasty.

290
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,240
With us today is a man who is just a

291
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,840
sleaze.

292
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,480
And he's going to

293
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:53,640
be a real pain in the ass.

294
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,680
And the reason they wouldn't kill him

295
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,120
was because he had the checkbook.

296
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,760
Before we get into that, let's see what's

297
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,480
in the news today.

298
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,780
Here's a French elf.

299
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,660
Thank you, Pat.

300
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,940
Most Americans say they're looking to

301
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,580
invade Iraq within a month.

302
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,760
But the French elf had to come over and

303
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,860
over and over again.

304
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,600
Up close and personal.

305
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,940
And that would be pleasant.

306
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,580
Photos of Iraqi officials moving in and out,

307
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,220
in and out, in and out, in and out.

308
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,440
Uh...

309
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,040
Uh...

310
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,140
Uh...

311
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,660
Uh...

312
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,940
Come to have plenty of partners.

313
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,640
It's the way it is.

314
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,120
Which offers these words of praise.

315
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
This is a disgrace.

316
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,280
In and out.

317
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,480
Uh...

318
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:37,960
Uh...

319
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,340
Come.

320
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,500
And then I will kill myself.

321
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,080
Uh...

322
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,140
Oh, yes, baby.

323
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,680
A little bit of ESO.

324
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,120
Swamp radio from WCSB Cleveland.

325
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:59,540
And before and after that, the great Fernanda Nande-Liemer,

326
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,120
who did the Bob song there and the cut-ups.

327
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,920
All those cut-ups.

328
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,440
Well, except for the El Queso title song.

329
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,040
We love the El Quesos, friends.

330
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:20,120
And welcome to Hour of Slack 879 of a sexy theme.

331
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,100
Generally the same.

332
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,640
Last time, friends.

333
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,420
Very generally.

334
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,420
And coming up, lots of sexy-liemer.

335
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,880
Chop, chop, chop.

336
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,660
Sexy, fat, hairy white.

337
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,640
Some cuts from the good Reverend Cheatham in Australia.

338
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,220
And...

339
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,720
And...

340
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,140
Bug porn.

341
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,960
Yes, bug porn and some wild rice butt will also be on the schedule.

342
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,100
Uh...

343
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,740
Uh...

344
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,220
Uh...

345
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,820
Nevertheless,

346
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,140
there are no weapons of mass white rice butt.

347
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,100
That information will make its way to President Ashley.

348
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,460
Okay, Chris, okay.

349
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,800
You would say buttocks.

350
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,800
I think that's buttocks.

351
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,400
Um...

352
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,940
Buttocks.

353
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,300
Buttocks.

354
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,140
Butt.

355
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,580
And, oh, by the way,

356
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,000
it's God that gives you money.

357
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,220
Or that new automobile that you need

358
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,620
if you call

359
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,860
in the next 15 minutes.

360
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,240
I only have the golden medallion.

361
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,020
It will remind you of the scripture.

362
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,620
Thou shall remember.

363
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,440
It's God that gives you wealth.

364
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,780
Or he gives you money to get wealth.

365
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,040
And now, make that call.

366
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,360
Hallelujah.

367
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,680
Prayer.

368
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,420
Prayer.

369
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,380
Prayer.

370
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:52,380


371
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:52,380


372
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:52,380


373
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,000
Make that call.

374
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,900
Hallelujah.

375
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,520
All right.

376
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,520
Like that.

377
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,440
Yeah.

378
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,640
Now.

379
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,180
Thanks a lot, dude.

380
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,180


381
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,180


382
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,160
You're the best.

383
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,100
Thanks a lot, Tony.

384
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,100


385
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,560
Take care all the way.

386
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,820
All right, all right.

387
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,420
All right.

388
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,320
Don't miss your next video.

389
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,460
I'll see you all then.

390
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,200
Bye, everybody.

391
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,200


392
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,360
Bye.

393
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,680
Bye!

394
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:15,780
Bye, everybody.

395
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,560
Bye, everybody.

396
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:16,700
Bye, everybody.

397
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:16,880
Bye, everybody.

398
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,000
Stretch, two, three, four

399
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,320
And pull, two, three, four

400
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
Step it up, and three, four

401
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,000
Feel the burn, two, three, four

402
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,300
No pain, no gain, and three, four

403
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,640
And touch those toes, and three, four

404
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,120
I'm working out

405
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,500
I'm working out for my lady

406
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,320
Oh yeah

407
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,380
I'm working out

408
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,340
I'm working out for love

409
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,640
Hey, talking about working out, you know, I like to keep my body in shape

410
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,760
You know, the shape of a barrage balloon

411
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,000
That's how all my very sexy lady friends like it

412
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,960
You know, big and firm, with plenty to grab hold of

413
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,040
Anyway, to get myself an even better knee

414
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,540
You know, I got in with one of the experienced weight trainers down at the gym

415
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,580
You know, private tuition

416
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,100
Greg, his name is

417
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,960
Big muscle-bound bloke with blonde hair

418
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,920
When I first saw him in the changing room, I was gobsmacked

419
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,480
I don't think I'd ever seen such a big member in there before

420
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,900
And you're talking about a membership of 600, you know, he's massive

421
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,160
His very sexy lady friend, Debbie, used to train there too

422
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,720
Now, she happens to be a very keen weightlifter

423
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,920
Likes nothing more than to show off her weightlifting techniques with the barbells

424
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,900
I tell you what, I've never seen a woman jerk one like it in all my life

425
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,600
Mind you, her snatch was very disappointing

426
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,440
And personally speaking, I thought it looked a bit messy

427
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,500
Now, fortunately for her, Greg was always at hand to sort her out

428
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,480
He'd usually stand in front of her and make sure she got a firm grip of it when she went down, you know

429
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,880
Great to watch, he was

430
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,540
Particularly when she'd puff her cheeks out and, you know, push it up as far as it would go

431
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,740
Well, Greg was a great trainer

432
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,480
Really keen to get stuck in, you know, get on the job

433
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,380
He was a very hard man, you know, but he was behind me all the way

434
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,540
Getting stuck in

435
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,040
And that's what I like

436
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,340
Because, you see, I've always been keen on that

437
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,360
I had a job at a sports centre once, did I tell you?

438
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,640
That's where I met Geraldine, right?

439
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,980
We were both working there

440
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,140
She was a very sexy young lady friend of mine

441
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,080
Both working at the sports centre

442
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,020
And I was moving some of the Fiverside football equipment

443
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,560
When I accidentally emptied my ball bag in the corridor just outside her office

444
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,620
Well, she heard the commotion and caved straight away

445
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,100
You know, to give me a hand

446
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,400
Now, after that, I didn't see her for ages

447
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,600
Because I spent quite a time working at the Firkin Fudge Company

448
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,760
Where I got on really well with my fellow fudge packers

449
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,240
Hey, the laughs we had filling each other's boxes

450
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,980
You know, with rubbish and all that

451
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,760
So often, the box had to be cleaned out

452
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,020
Before you could start all over again, you know

453
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,020
Great days

454
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,420
Anyway, from there, I went to Jessop's, the grocer's

455
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,760
And that's where I bumped into Geraldine again

456
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,100
I was just packing the fridge full of margarine

457
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,780
When she walked up to me, tapped me on the shoulder

458
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,100
And asked me if I'd give her the stalk that I had in my hand

459
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,560
Well, she said she usually had flora

460
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,080
But thought she'd try a different brand of it

461
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,080


462
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,080


463
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,620
And for a change

464
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,860
So, stalk margarine it was

465
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,840
Well, after that chance encounter

466
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,480
We started courting

467
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,440
And nine months later, we decided to get engaged

468
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,700
Hey, I tell you what

469
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,440
I just couldn't wait to get down to the jeweller's

470
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,300
You know, to get something special for her

471
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,520
To slip onto the third finger of her left hand

472
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,040
I tell you what

473
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,540
When I went home and gave it to her that night in bed

474
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,540
She was absolutely ecstatic

475
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,020
The thing was

476
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,800
She said she'd never expected me

477
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,080
To present her with such a sparkling ring

478
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,580
Then, after pushing her finger towards it

479
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,140
She wriggled it in slowly

480
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,480
Until it would go no further

481
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,920
I'll never forget the look on her face

482
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,660
When she smiled at me and said

483
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,040
It fitted like a glove

484
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,660
Well, unfortunately, the relationship didn't work out

485
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,940
You know, but that's life

486
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,160
And, you know, you win some, you lose some

487
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,120
The way I look at it

488
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,120
There's always another very sexy lady friend around the corner

489
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,780
If you keep yourself in shape

490
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,300
And that's why I'm working out

491
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,540
Yes, working out

492
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,480
Working out

493
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,820
I'm working out for my lady

494
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,980
I'm working out

495
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,480
A fat, hairy white, dear friends

496
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,680
The great, fat, hairy white

497
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,020
And now

498
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,420
Le-le-le-le-le-mil

499
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,000
But why do squirrels need to survive in the wild?

500
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,640
They need to starve

501
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,100
In the wild, they're nuts

502
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,060
And that requires a lot of effort

503
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,060


504
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,460
And that requires a lot of effort

505
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:44,920
And that requires a lot of effort

506
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,320
So where's the best adorable, ravenous rodents?

507
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,660
How about Squirrel City?

508
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,640
Sneaky squirrels also show their cities all over our world

509
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,900
She learned to run this assault course by trial and error

510
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,740
She's only thirteen

511
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,520
But it took her a few days

512
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,440
This certainly did fail the thinking test

513
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,180
As we'll see, the squirrels is a free lunch

514
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,880
So the arms man began as Evermore to try to stop them from stealing birds

515
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,220
Some people, they

516
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:11,860
Some people, they

517
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,000
Some people, they

518
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,780
As the distance of time

519
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:15,780


520
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,840
And they may try to

521
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,620
To stop them

522
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:20,940
Baby

523
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,540
These little guys

524
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:22,720
They're

525
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:22,860
Mary

526
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,440
And Justice

527
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,440


528
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,440


529
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,440


530
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,620
This boy

531
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,280
We'll never

532
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,420
Get

533
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:30,420


534
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:30,420


535
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:30,420


536
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:30,420


537
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,960
Have

538
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,960
Moری

539
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,560
Cheese Jr.

540
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,940
Oh, oh, yeah.

541
00:16:46,440 --> 00:17:07,720
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

542
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,180
I understand.

543
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,160
I understand.

544
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,000
My breasts expand.

545
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,240
And I've had that syndrome for like 25 years now.

546
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:24,580
Wow.

547
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,280
Expanding breasts.

548
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:32,280
I'll be perhaps in the laboratory working on my works or my later obara, as they call them.

549
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,060
Or I'll be bowling.

550
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,220
Or just like trying on a pretty skirt with a poodle on it.

551
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,820
And the next thing you know, my breasts will start expanding as big as the sun.

552
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,380
Is that what that huge shadow was that covered it?

553
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:45,700
Yeah.

554
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,340
I can do more than cast a shadow.

555
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,120
It wouldn't take quarters.

556
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,000
I can hire one if they know what to say.

557
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,800
I wanted, that's all I wanted was chocolate.

558
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,240
Casting is easy.

559
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,260
I just wanted some hot chocolate.

560
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,460
You just look at their faces.

561
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,320
You look at their feet.

562
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,700
You see if they're right for the part.

563
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,260
I've been very naughty.

564
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,940
I've been very naughty.

565
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,500
I've been very naughty.

566
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,200
I've been very naughty.

567
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,840
I've been very naughty.

568
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,340
You know our love was special.

569
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,180
Yeah.

570
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,520
Oh, yeah.

571
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,460
Like a million suns.

572
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,480
I said I'd buy you a sailboat, baby.

573
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,620
Then we could see the world again.

574
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,360
Just you and me.

575
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,640
We had a love we said would never die.

576
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,360
But now it's time to say goodbye.

577
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,720
We had a love that grew its wings to fly.

578
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,600
Now you have to dry your crying eyes.

579
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,380
Try your crying eyes.

580
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,100
Try your crying eyes.

581
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,580
How many eyes are gonna cry tonight when I say goodbye to my potato?

582
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,480
Oh, oh, oh.

583
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,020
Oh, oh, oh.

584
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,760
Oh, oh, oh.

585
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:33,760


586
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,260
Oh, oh, oh.

587
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,320
Oh, oh, oh.

588
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:36,660


589
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,100
Oh, oh, oh.

590
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,340
Oh, oh, oh.

591
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:42,820
Oh, oh.

592
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,760
Oh, oh, oh.

593
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:43,760


594
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,220
Tell me what you want me to.

595
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,300
Tell me what you like.

596
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,940
Tell me what you need me to.

597
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,760
How many eyes are gonna cry tonight when I say goodbye to my potato?

598
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:04,460
More than one brown eye is gonna cry tonight when I say goodbye to my potato.

599
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,480
Yeah.

600
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,520
Oh, oh, oh.

601
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,740
I treat you like a queen, you meant more than the world

602
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,500
Take you to the finest shop, stress you like a girl

603
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,040
And peel your panties off, yeah, we can do it like that

604
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,120
Baby, feels like all night, so tight, dynamite

605
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,160
But then I had to push you out and things wasn't the same

606
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,600
Your love was wild, now it's tame, baby

607
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,680
I don't want to see you cry

608
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,860
So I have to let my colon say goodbye

609
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,140
P. Diddy loves his potato dearly

610
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,080
That ain't a worship, most sincerely, baby

611
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,920
Come on, yeah, you know it feels so right

612
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,980
But I love you more than anything

613
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,460
Now I know I don't feel so right

614
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,520
And the seagull stole my toupee

615
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,080
The day I decided I would have to say goodbye

616
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,840
I don't want to see you cry

617
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,060
And I lied when I cried, it was not for you

618
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,940
But out of fear that I had disrespected my rectum

619
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,320
And that's not hip-hop

620
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,500
How many eyes are gonna cry tonight

621
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,840
When I say goodbye to my potato?

622
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,140
More than one brown eye is gonna cry tonight

623
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,780
When I say goodbye to my potato

624
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,160
Potato

625
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,680
Potato

626
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:30,840
Potato

627
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,840


628
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,840


629
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,840


630
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,840


631
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,840


632
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,840


633
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,840


634
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,840


635
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,840


636
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,840


637
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,100
Potato

638
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,100


639
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,100


640
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,100


641
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,100


642
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,100


643
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,100


644
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,100


645
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,100


646
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,100


647
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,100


648
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,100


649
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,100


650
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,800
How many eyes are gonna cry tonight

651
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,560
When I say goodbye to my potato?

652
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,860
That sweet potato

653
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,080
Potato

654
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,420
How many eyes

655
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:46,600
How many eyes

656
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:58,180
How many eyes

657
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,980
by the LK

658
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,840
So don't stand up

659
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:00,840


660
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,440
All-Stars, dear friends, the greatest of all the new school subgenius bands.

661
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:19,920
And you can download more El Queso All-Stars under the other name of Interbulator at station.mp3.com

662
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:28,980
slash interbulator, that's spelled E-N-T-U-R-bulator.

663
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,820
And now, our how-to department.

664
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:39,500
Really, the only way to get rid of child pornography is to fill your computer up with adult pornography

665
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,800
all the way until it's completely maxed out.

666
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,280
It won't take anything else.

667
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,300
Erase all that, then fill it up again with adult pornography, and you're clean.

668
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,900
You're fine.

669
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,720
Everything's cool.

670
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,320
Animal sex.

671
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,160
You know, you're like Hooters.

672
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,040
Bug porn.

673
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,840
Or late night TV.

674
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,960
Bug porn.

675
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,740
I have mine loaded with bug porn.

676
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,600
Wouldn't that creep out like a cop if he came into your house and seized your computer

677
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,920
and found out you just had millions and millions of pictures of bug porn?

678
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,340
Well.

679
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,920
And they were all the same one?

680
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,640
That freaked him out the last time.

681
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,960
Bug porn, one dollar.

682
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,780
And ten.

683
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,060
Bug porn.

684
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:18,580
One dollar.

685
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,380
Bug porn.

686
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,240
Bug porn.

687
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,040
Bug porn.

688
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,720
Bug porn.

689
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,240
How hard it is to escape the constant clamoring of insect pornography commercials.

690
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,340
Yet.

691
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:34,580
To those who see through different eyes, the world is not what it appears to those less attentive.

692
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:42,760
To some few discerning ones, even God's tiniest creatures can be seen to indulge ceaselessly

693
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:50,220
in mindless microcosmic reiterations of man's eternal battles and his passions.

694
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:57,640
Between viruses, bacteria, and our own immune systems, as above is so below.

695
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:05,380
And some see below the belt of the allowable, deep beneath the underclothing of the forbidden.

696
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:13,200
Some see into the microconspiracy behind the macroconspiracy.

697
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,860
And some like what they see.

698
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,780
But just as in our so-called human world, the winner takes all.

699
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,700
For only the winner's genes are passed on to future generations.

700
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,600
Yes.

701
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,620
The conspiracy rules is the rule of the universe.

702
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:27,620


703
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:27,620


704
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:27,620


705
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:27,620


706
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:27,620


707
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,920
The world is now a place where the unknown is the world.

708
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,960
The world is now a place where the unknown is the world.

709
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,180
Now, maintained in artificial wounds, aided by technology only guessed at by earth science,

710
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,760
what might have remained the errant seed of harmless bug porn enthusiasm, grows instead

711
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,420
into the all too familiar larval stage, then to a pupa, and finally into a perfect clone

712
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,200
simulacrum of your child.

713
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,560
Your neighbor.

714
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,700
Your boss.

715
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,740
Your spouse.

716
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,940
All those people shopping at the mall.

717
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:08,180
From the tiniest, most seemingly harmless conspiracy, to bigger conspiracies, to the

718
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,700
final conspiracy.

719
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:11,920
Dobbs Co.

720
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,720
Bringing slack to the slackless, and life to the lifeless.

721
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,720
And the Bible says your body is the temple.

722
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,980
He lives, the Holy Spirit lives, in your body.

723
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,420
God can get the glory out of your body when your body is the temple.

724
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,740
Well, isn't that special?

725
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,280
Oh, oh, oh, God.

726
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,100
Oh, yes.

727
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,520
Well, isn't that special?

728
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,720
Oh, oh, oh, God.

729
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:56,720


730
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:56,720


731
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:56,720


732
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:56,720


733
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:56,720


734
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:56,720


735
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:56,720


736
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,840
Yes, it is!

737
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,240
Listen to this song.

738
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,260
Years of this candidates

739
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,440
haftly day to day talk beefed up in direction, there's only hope in god restore our situation.

740
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:24,720
What prophet would do?

741
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,200
Hells crease.

742
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,140
Where are youНАЯ usted?

743
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,700
Who's check?

744
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:26,700


745
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,880
And I am well pleased.

746
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,120
If God didn't want us to play with these rats, why didn't he make them savage men?

747
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,140
The female body is the most beautiful thing in the world.

748
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,620
I've been having bad thoughts.

749
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,680
Really bad thoughts.

750
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,220
Most people confuse evil with their own trivial lusts and perversions.

751
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,860
Two-legged devils, you own your way to hell.

752
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,320
Two-legged devils, you own your way to hell.

753
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,380
Well, two-legged devils, sinners can get themselves an awful mess.

754
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,760
Every Christian is sinless.

755
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,360
Are you a saint or a geron?

756
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,120
Could it be Satan?

757
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,420
The only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do is what we ought to be doing all the time.

758
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,600
Holy cow!

759
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,060
Holy cow!

760
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,780
Holy cow!

761
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,300
Holy cow!

762
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,300


763
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,260
Holy cow!

764
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,040
Oh!

765
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,300
Oh!

766
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,140
Oh, God!

767
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:34,700
Oh!

768
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,580
Oh, God!

769
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,080
Oh!

770
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,060
Oh, God!

771
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,260
Wow!

772
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,660
We're just a little buttercup, aren't we?

773
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,160
Every Christian is sinless.

774
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,620
Two-legged devils, you own your way to hell.

775
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,300
Two-legged devils, you own your way to hell.

776
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,300


777
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,300


778
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,340
Two-legged devils, you own your way to therefore.

779
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,440
Whoa!

780
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:01,440


781
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,840
Two-legged devils, you own your way to hell!

782
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,220
Two-legged devils, you own your way to hell.

783
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,640
Two-legged devils, you own your way to hell.

784
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:10,940
Two-legged devils, you own your way to hell.

785
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,160
Two-legged devils, you own your way to hell.

786
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,180
Two-legged devils, you know your way to hell.

787
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,660
He lives!

788
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,540
The Holy Spirit lives in your body!

789
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,680
the Holy Spirit who lives in your body.

790
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,800
Here's a cheap%

791
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,060
each like water crane Com some people

792
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,120
よ الل daを

793
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,880
Your body is the temple!

794
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Are you a sinner, God?

795
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,000
Every Christian is sinless.

796
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,980
Every Christian is sinless.

797
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,220
Every Christian is sinless.

798
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,180
The only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do

799
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,800
is what we ought to be doing all the time.

800
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
The Holy Spirit, the what?

801
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,700
I'm going to put it in one hole and then in the other.

802
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,600
I'm going to do it really fast.

803
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:07,560
Who Sins of the Flock by Reverend Ed Fred.

804
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:14,380
And now, some ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland.

805
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,980
He loved her butt.

806
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,320
He hated her cooking.

807
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,560
He hated her cooking.

808
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,140
He hated her cooking.

809
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,180
He hated her cooking.

810
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:35,280
He hated her cooking.

811
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,780
He hated her cooking.

812
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,380
He hated her cooking.

813
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,220
Do you feel different?

814
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,640
We have placed some leaves and pieces of newspaper under your seat,

815
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,780
Mr. Goss.

816
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,580
Gus Grissom.

817
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,700
Ready to blow off?

818
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,780
We will begin counting you now.

819
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,800
One.

820
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
Backwards from ten.

821
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,500
Ten.

822
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,220
Nine.

823
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,500
No, I'm afraid we're about to ignite you.

824
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,440
You can't get out.

825
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,200
No, no chance.

826
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,020
It's New Year's Eve and you're going bye-bye.

827
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,180
Where?

828
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,820
Did they?

829
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,000
Did they go to the...

830
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,080
Did they go to the moon or did the moon come to us?

831
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,380
Did you see that moon?

832
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,440
Go away.

833
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,620
Go away.

834
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,420
Go away.

835
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,220
Go away.

836
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,680
Nobody ever walked on the moon.

837
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,920
They ran around in circles, ate dog treats and...

838
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,400
changed phone numbers.

839
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:01,040
But no one ever walked on this moon or any moon you know about.

840
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,620
Blow up!

841
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,020
You see, as artists, we just need to express ourselves.

842
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:07,620
Mm-hmm.

843
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,600
Go, Wyatt.

844
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,860
You're so funny.

845
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,240
Whoa, Davey.

846
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,360
Hello there.

847
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,960
I'm George Putnam.

848
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,720
I'd like to begin with a fact.

849
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,080
It is this.

850
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,340
Obscene literature is a $2 billion a year business.

851
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,080
That's $2 billion.

852
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,560
For 800 distributors.

853
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,900
It is big business.

854
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,620
This traffic continues to increase and flourish.

855
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,200
It is profitable business.

856
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,480
Through this material, today's youth can be stimulated

857
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,860
to enter the world of homosexuals, lesbians, sadists,

858
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,140
masochists.

859
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,380
Big business.

860
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,440
It's smart.

861
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,460
It's thrilling.

862
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,760
It provides kicks.

863
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,720
It encourages children to use the library.

864
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,900
It's an illustrated, detailed course in perversion.

865
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,480
It can be obtained by writing to Perversion for Profits.

866
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,640
Box 12, Cincinnati, Ohio.

867
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,020
You got here the ladies' stockings, panties, bras, that stuff?

868
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,560
I'm away.

869
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:17,860
Okay.

870
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,420
We start on pictures?

871
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,440
All yours.

872
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,500
You shall be put to death.

873
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,540
You want to try it, Poki?

874
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,180
We're sorry.

875
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:42,080
Love me tender, love me sweet.

876
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,400
Mmm!

877
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,880
Never let me go.

878
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,960
Sorry.

879
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,900
You have made my life better.

880
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,440
I'm alive, please.

881
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,500
I'm dying to love you so.

882
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,560
Visit the SAC bar now.

883
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,140
Love me tender, love me true.

884
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,400
Now.

885
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,940
All my dreams fulfilled.

886
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,680
No employees.

887
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,720
Follow my darling.

888
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,460
I love you.

889
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,900
No inventory.

890
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,880
I'm dying to love you.

891
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,800
I always will.

892
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,980
And no selling.

893
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,180
I'm dying.

894
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,540
I always will.

895
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,020
Your call cannot be completed and dialed.

896
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,160
No, thanks.

897
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,420
I prefer grass.

898
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,580
At San Quentin.

899
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,760
The A&P!

900
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,860
A friend of yours always travels with him to the A&P.

901
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,160
My church's bus is snowing!

902
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,340
No need for sightseeing!

903
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,540
And me with Iverson.

904
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,520
If anything I ate will burn?

905
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,560
Nope.

906
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,560


907
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,780
Fuck!

908
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,360
I've had enough of your fucking left wing elbowing!

909
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,580
Stop the fucking 하지만in'!

910
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,860
Bis Castle got the joker!

911
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:21,860


912
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:21,860


913
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,720
She shows she's alright by fighting off the crane mechanism.

914
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,000
Nope! That's wonderful!

915
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,460
This lecture was presented on June 1st, 1962.

916
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,960
By Fernanda Nande-Lemore.

917
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:58,880
The

918
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:58,880


919
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:58,880


920
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:58,880


921
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:58,920
The

922
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:58,960
The

923
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,840
The

924
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,340
The

925
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,340


926
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,980
The

927
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,160
The

928
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,500
The

929
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:55,520
The

930
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:55,520


931
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:34,280
Patti versus the mere Humes is the name of that musical composition by Heart Ignition.

932
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:40,800
Yes, the same Heart Ignition who does that incredible artwork on Alt.Binary Slack.

933
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,780
And now, Michael Pepe.

934
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,320
Did you know that the Boston Strangler used to chase Michael Pepe around the park?

935
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,160
Well, that's true.

936
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,660
When he was a kid.

937
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,740
I was surprised.

938
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,900
You know, he strangled everyone but me.

939
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,320
And I was going to speak out.

940
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,020
Really?

941
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,620
What happened?

942
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,700
What happened to the caller?

943
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,340
Did the caller leave?

944
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:04,720
And also, Michael Pepe did a sex show as a teenager to make money and didn't know that you weren't supposed to actually do sex.

945
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,940
This now can be said.

946
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,040
My parents are my last son.

947
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,220
And so, yeah.

948
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,160
I guess the guest caller.

949
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,740
I was good, but it was very cheap.

950
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,420
And how much money did you make?

951
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,800
You had to be there 11 hours a day and you got like $100 or something.

952
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,520
It wasn't...

953
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
That's pretty good money for those days.

954
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,200
1978.

955
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah.

956
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,600
Just...

957
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:24,600


958
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,400
Just before you moved out here.

959
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,260
Sorry, 70...

960
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,480
I'm sorry.

961
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,020
$100.

962
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,480
Early 70s.

963
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,360
It was about $6 back then.

964
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:29,620
Yeah.

965
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,740
It was actually $75, $76.

966
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,300
And...

967
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,880
Yeah, $100 back then.

968
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,780
Make a cheer, man.

969
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,940
$100 back then was worth about $5 now.

970
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,100
And listen to maniacs.

971
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,800
It cost $5.

972
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:39,900
Yeah.

973
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,980
It cost $5.

974
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,360
This is when I went insane.

975
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,380
To be on the show in America today.

976
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:44,820
$100 today is worth about $20 tomorrow.

977
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,040
I realize it.

978
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,540
It's a hangout at donut shops.

979
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,040
$20 now is worth about...

980
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,140
It's only worth about 3 cents a hundred years from now.

981
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:49,600
$40.

982
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,180
I'm worried about people writing down what you say.

983
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,900
Now, didn't Pee Wee Herman also do that for a living at one point?

984
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,400
Yeah, he kind of came down as well.

985
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,820
There you go.

986
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,140
That's right.

987
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,040
We're waiting for you, boy.

988
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,640
But now, the real Wild Young Gypsy Girl is about to start.

989
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:10,660
It is unlikely that a Wild Young Gypsy Girl like this will ever be made again.

990
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,600
But this is the Wild Young Gypsy Girl who will film it now.

991
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,380
The real drivers are in the Wild Young Gypsy Girls.

992
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,980
And the command force of Wild Young Gypsy Girls.

993
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,480
Records every second of the action from the Wild Young Gypsy Girl.

994
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,660
But now, it is unlikely that a Wild Young Gypsy Girl like this will film it.

995
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:42,580
Now, the camera's roll as the actual Wild Young Gypsy Girl is not the same unique Wild Young Gypsy Girl as the repeated Wild Young Gypsy Girl.

996
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,860
All the excitement of the same Wild Young Gypsy Girl.

997
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,780
The spectacle.

998
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,660
The grand adventure.

999
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,440
The real Wild Young Gypsy Girl.

1000
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,800
But now.

1001
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:12,160
Can you imagine an entire opera being built around Mary Magdalene?

1002
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:20,500
Can you imagine an entire opera being built around Mary Magdalene?

1003
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,160
Viel près de María Magdalena.

1004
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,120
Núως.

1005
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,120
Goen by El這 Beispiel Anto Audience Come by El antonino if you like

1006
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,780
Awwivido por el sueño

1007
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,100
Is a prostitute?

1008
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,560
Fast forward

1009
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:39,980
A time when God loves theHow do you get from heaven to hell?

1010
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:51,160
How do you get from heaven to hell? fatherrucking death life? coming back to earth

1011
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:06,400
It adds so much more excitement to bring in a street-walking prostitute and have her say

1012
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,700
as she does in Superstar.

1013
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,640
That feels nice.

1014
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,780
I don't know how to love him.

1015
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,620
He's a man.

1016
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,660
He's just a man.

1017
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,920
And I've had so many men before.

1018
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:27,800
Really?

1019
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,920
Mary Magdalene.

1020
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,900
Mary Magdalene.

1021
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,700
Mary Magdalene.

1022
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,500
Mary Magdalene.

1023
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,040
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

1024
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,880
Should I bring him down?

1025
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,880
Should I?

1026
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,520
Should I speak of love, let my feelings out?

1027
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,720
I want him so.

1028
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,240
Really?

1029
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,120
Let me try to cool down your face again.

1030
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,620
I'm sorry.

1031
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:09,620


1032
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:09,620


1033
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:20,460
I'm built too few problems I can't answer or touch and yet you insist on my总裁 to

1034
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:20,460


1035
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,280
Do you agree?

1036
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:22,280


1037
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:22,280


1038
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:22,280


1039
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,700
Mary Magdalene.

1040
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,760
Mary Magdalene.

1041
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,280
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

1042
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,820
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

1043
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,400
Should I bring him down?

1044
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,440
Should I speak of love, let my feelings out?

1045
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,960
I want him so.

1046
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,540
Let me try to cool down your face a bit.

1047
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,040
That feels nice.

1048
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
So nice.

1049
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,340
Mary, that's good.

1050
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,680
Mary Magdalene.

1051
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,140
Mary Magdalene.

1052
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,400
Mary Magdalene.

1053
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,800
Mary Magdalene.

1054
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:05,900
Mary Magdalene.

1055
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,740
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

1056
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,680
Really?

1057
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,720
Really?

1058
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:51,380
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.

1059
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,000
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

1060
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,820
I don't know how to love him.

1061
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,720
He's a man.

1062
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,660
He's just a man.

1063
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:24,980
I don't know how to love him.

1064
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:24,980


1065
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:24,980


1066
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,100
That feels nice.

1067
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,420
Mary Magdalene by the Jelly Eaters.

1068
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,820
What are you going to teach me first, Master Kwan?

1069
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,080
Inspirational music that is absolutely riveting.

1070
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,260
See for yourself.

1071
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:54,640
An angel appeared to Mary on a glittery cloud of angel wings.

1072
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,960
This angel brought fair Mary news.

1073
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,880
You'll give birth to the King of Kings.

1074
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,500
Well, Mary gasped and Mary stared.

1075
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,120
She'd never seen an angel and she was scared.

1076
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,140
The angel said, my virgin maid, there's no reason to be afraid.

1077
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,700
The angel smiled.

1078
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,720
My virgin child, you've been touched by the Holy Ghost.

1079
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,220
Above all women, you've been blessed.

1080
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:23,920
Be a nut.

1081
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,620
Be a nut.

1082
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:24,620


1083
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:24,620


1084
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:24,980
Be a nut.

1085
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,320
Be a nut.

1086
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,540
Be a nut.

1087
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,500
Be a nut.

1088
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:36,140
And now, friends, you're hearing in the background the amino acids who played in our Akron revival.

1089
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,380
You can hear more of them at TheAminoAcids.com.

1090
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,380
That's www.TheAminoAcids.com.

1091
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,320
That's the amino acid.

1096
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:11,180


1097
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:11,180


1098
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:11,180

1102
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:54,620


1103
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,840
Betty, I'm afraid I can't make this living, eh?

1104
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,160
Ask them later anyway.

1105
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,160
Got a dozen diamonds in the paper.

1106
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,900
Oh, gosh, what a bunch of...

1107
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,580
I have a list of folks to interview.

1108
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,800
Say they saw you flying saucer last night.

1109
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,740
That's when the mic's all dead?

1110
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,600
The Amino Acids.

1111
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,520
Now, Dave, you've converted to the Church of the Subgenius, is that correct?

1112
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,600
Oh, well, there's no...

1113
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,680
There's no conversion table involved.

1114
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,900
You just take one cup of metric water...

1115
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,260
Right.

1116
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,620
...and place it in some boiling pans...

1117
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,460
Okay.

1118
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,840
...add three pounds of metric salt...

1119
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,220
I see.

1120
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,060
...and there's your conversion table right there.

1121
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,580
Well, that's pretty amazing.

1122
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,680
I didn't think it was that easy.

1123
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,860
Well, you...

1124
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,440
Actually, you also have to spend 30 bucks.

1125
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,460
Now, Reverend...

1126
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,640
You have to be born that way and spend 30 bucks both.

1127
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,380
You can just spend the 30 bucks.

1128
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,500
Now, I'm more interested in that loophole.

1129
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,320
The one loophole...

1130
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:23,320


1131
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,360
...that you're actually having...

1132
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,980
...having sex at 7 a.m. on July 5th.

1133
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,400
You don't have to pay the 30 bucks.

1134
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:30,840
What?

1135
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,480
I think you said that.

1136
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,560
I found that in an old tape.

1137
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,880
I think that loophole had hair around it.

1138
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,500
That's how he found it.

1139
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,740
No, I was listening to some old tapes, and out of your very mouth, you said...

1140
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,140
Hello, my name is Natalie.

1141
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,300
...the only way around the $30...

1142
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,480
...or having your card...

1143
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,160
...the only way you don't have to have your card at 7 a.m. is if you're actually having sex.

1144
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,340
Well, if I said that, then pick up...

1145
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:54,980
...on it, man.

1146
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:58,520
Now, is the party going to stop by and see if we're carrying our card?

1147
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:58,900
No, I'm saying.

1148
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,440
No, I'm saying.

1149
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:00,780
Or is old W...

1150
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:00,900
No, you're saying.

1151
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,520
No, you're saying.

1152
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,920
Is the party going to check your card?

1153
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,900
Who's checking the cards?

1154
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,320
I need to know.

1155
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,900
It's a genetic thing.

1156
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,380
They check.

1157
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,440
It's a scanner that's hardly even physical.

1158
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,520
Just call it magic.

1159
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,660
It's not even physical.

1160
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,780
It's just kind of a scrambler that kind of exists more in the metaphysical plane.

1161
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,600
Oh, it exists all right.

1162
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,260
They can tell.

1163
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,240
They can tell who's in the book of life.

1164
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:27,680
And who's in the subgenius foundation database.

1165
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,680
Well, they can tell all they want, but I'm keeping it a secret.

1166
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,180
You know what I'm saying?

1167
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,580
And they're going to tell Mr. Cheney tomorrow, and I'm going to get a great big fat check.

1168
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,060
And you might go to jail.

1169
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,040
I think Cheney's a hot-looking dude, man.

1170
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:41,980
I like Cheney.

1171
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,100
I like the way he kind of like grins out of the side of his mouth, man.

1172
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,420
That is so freaking hot.

1173
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,940
And the way he had to wear the fishhooks in his nose to play Phantom of the Opera.

1174
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,280
He is.

1175
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:53,300
I mean, I'm not generally like a gay dude or anything.

1176
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,300
But, man, I see Dick.

1177
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,500
Cheney and I start getting a woody, man.

1178
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:56,760
Oh, Dick Cheney.

1179
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,200
Cute guy.

1180
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,060
I thought you were talking about Lon Cheney Sr.

1181
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,580
Okay, so.

1182
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,740
Now, he was hot.

1183
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,400
People call me.

1184
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,620
The hunchback of Notre Dame.

1185
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,860
Imagine that 80-pound hump of rubber strapped to his back.

1186
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,400
He knew how to.

1187
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,100
It was real suffering in those days.

1188
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:12,740
In the days of stunt.

1189
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,380
Oh, those toothpicks weren't enough to cause a scar on a rep.

1190
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,580
Those bags of water weren't stunt bags.

1191
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,200
Those were the real actors being tortured and mangled and brutalized.

1192
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:23,760
Brutalized.

1193
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,240
They weren't stunt bags.

1194
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,540
You're saying they're real bags.

1195
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,180
On Mexican land, I've been gone.

1196
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,060
Stunt bags of water with sticks.

1197
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,440
Well, are you listening on the internet, then, Johnny?

1198
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,100
Well, I'm trying my best.

1199
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,460
It's breaking up quite a bit.

1200
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:34,740
Is it?

1201
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:39,540
This is actually the only way I could listen to the show was to make a long-distance phone call and sit on the phone.

1202
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,120
Well, if you're on unlimited minutes, you can just sit there.

1203
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:44,980
I'll lock you on.

1204
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,660
Well, I'll tell you what.

1205
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:50,640
We've got forehead paste on all three of us, and we're sort of sticking together right now.

1206
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,460
What do we got here?

1207
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,460
Oh, we're almost out of time.

1208
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,320
Well, you know, when you stay on the phone like that.

1209
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,720
For a long time, it also serves as a colonoscopy.

1210
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,700
Have you talked to the people at A3 and 3?

1211
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,580
I've tried to several times, but they only speak Yiddish now.

1212
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,180
Well, they're still psychic.

1213
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,500
Don't forget that part.

1214
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,320
They still are psychic, especially if you're using it as a colonoscopy.

1215
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:16,440
Well, we're all wondering how we can get our hands on some of that delicious ESO music as well as some WCSB paraphernalia.

1216
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,040
We've never had any in all the years we've called the show.

1217
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,080
We have no paraphernalia.

1218
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,280
How about some good old CSB paranoia?

1219
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,300
Well, you send me an email.

1220
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,960
I can hook you up with ESO.

1221
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,300
That's right.

1222
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,160
Chaz at subgenius.com as well as subgenius.com catalog.

1223
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,300
You'll find ESO information.

1224
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,260
There you go.

1225
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,280
Give it to me.

1226
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,000
Give it to me.

1227
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,680
Give it to me.

1228
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,400
Give it to me.

1229
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,120
Give it to me.

1230
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:02,800
Give it to me.

1231
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:06,460
Give it to me.

1232
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,520
Very impressive.

1233
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,300
Amazing!

1234
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,160
Yeah, that was the kicker.

1235
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,800
Listen to the sounds of hell and take a trip into a prison of nightmares.

1236
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,300
It's worse than a prison here.

1237
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,940
Chain gang women.

1238
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,720
A world where men and women live like animals.

1239
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,160
Emotion danger is shocking as it is true.

1240
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,040
Don't miss chain gang women when you live like an animal.

1241
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,280
Anything goes.

1242
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,780
When you leave, take me with you.

1243
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,960
A crown of the nation.

1244
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,560
The slut invertebrate nuns of Dobstown.

1245
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,360
Oh.

1246
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:47,600
The invertebrate flatworm slut nuns of Dobstown.

1247
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,800
They're soft.

1248
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,140
Do you like soft women?

1249
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,160
I like them.

1250
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,720
Only $40 you come in.

1251
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,660
We have no bones.

1252
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,300
I like them.

1253
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,380
I like them like a portabello.

1254
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:55,440
Oh, boneless women.

1255
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,040
Boneless.

1256
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,220
Jello jelly girls.

1257
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,480
Do they put them in the can?

1258
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,080
Female fillet.

1259
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:04,620
She crawls on her belly like a snail without a shell.

1260
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,860
And you can do that to make like a consommé.

1261
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,840
What a trail she'll leave for you, buddy.

1262
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,080
Only $40.

1263
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,140
Come on in.

1264
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,620
You don't want to miss this show.

1265
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,720
What are you?

1266
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,840
Some kind of a wuss?

1267
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,820
Come on in here.

1268
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,800
Only $40.

1269
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,340
Best show in Amsterdam.

1270
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,060
I could go for a mollusk.

1271
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:24,800
Mama?

1272
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,420
Live on stage right in front of your face.

1273
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,600
They do it with bugs and snails.

1274
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,740
Subgenius Hardcore.

1275
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,660
He's like the, uh...

1276
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:40,620
Subgenius Eyes bring you the hottest subgenius adult videos and DVDs.

1277
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,820
Yes, it's true.

1278
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,300
Those horrible porn banners on the sub site that Stang deliberately cultivates.

1279
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:51,300
He whines and complains that they are needed to make money for the site.

1280
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,220
But, uh...

1281
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,080
Satisfy every twisted...

1282
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,860
We could advertise...

1283
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,540
...their incredible collection...

1284
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:56,700
...miniature...

1285
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,780
Now, now, now, what are you talking about, Reverend Hale?

1286
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,960
...of rare subgenius footage?

1287
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,340
When you go to the sub site, uh...

1288
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:01,580
Yeah?

1289
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,280
...site, you know?

1290
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,180
Find Bondi...

1291
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,540
...have these porno, uh, things there...

1292
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:05,800
...very...

1293
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,500
...which, uh, help pay for the site.

1294
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,340
Are you talking about some kind of art excuse or real, just straight pornos?

1295
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,000
No, those banners.

1296
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:11,440
Oh, okay.

1297
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,640
Those banner ads in the sub site.

1298
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,180
Yeah, I have not actually ever looked at it.

1299
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:16,440
Never.

1300
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,560
Well, maybe they got rid of them.

1301
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,280
I don't know if you...

1302
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,400
You haven't seen them, have you?

1303
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,300
No, they got rid of them.

1304
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,200
I just must have, uh, hallucinated it, that's all.

1305
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,400
Yeah, it was a dream.

1306
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:25,720
Yeah.

1307
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,260
Because...

1308
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,760
Even Stang couldn't stand it anymore.

1309
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,560
Even Stang wouldn't stoop so low.

1310
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,420
And you two are dreaming about...

1311
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,580
No, Stang wouldn't stoop that low, but he just wouldn't stay there very long.

1312
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,480
Okay, let's watch a little Stang puppet stoop now.

1313
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,680
There, and then he stands up, now he's doing a bow.

1314
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,460
Now he's walking off stage.

1315
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,740
Now, what we've done is we've reached a little tiny puppet subgenius show...

1316
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,300
...right at intermission.

1317
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:47,560
We did.

1318
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,120
It's, uh, it's really entertaining.

1319
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:49,640
Intermission?

1320
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,200
Really cute.

1321
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:50,680
Yeah, it's good.

1322
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,660
I'm not sure I understand it.

1323
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,200
And then, well, now you go out for miniature coffee and donuts in the miniature, um...

1324
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,800
In the miniature golf course miniature restaurant.

1325
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,540
That's right.

1326
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,500
And then you come back in 12 minutes later and the show starts again.

1327
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,740
It's really cool.

1328
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,340
That's it exactly.

1329
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,440
It's a 4-inch video.

1330
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:11,160
Subgenius Media is a fabulous collection of subgenius women from all over the world.

1331
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,440
Good luck to our departing travelers in traveling over possibly interdicted bridges and snow.

1332
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,520
Some of the hairiest subgenius girls on video see those stinky, sweaty subgenius women.

1333
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,280
...shut down.

1334
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,860
...and they're tired of close...

1335
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,840
...only coming your way is the stinky road of...

1336
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,400
...contact with the fashion models.

1337
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,120
...the stinky road of...

1338
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,680
...so are we.

1339
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:26,800
...transports.

1340
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,140
If you're tired of that, then you need to call right now at April 4th, April 425.

1341
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,620
We've had enough of that ourselves.

1342
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,020
We're actually in our own...

1343
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,040
What's that area called?

1344
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,600
You know, they've, um...

1345
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,080
...where'd you go to sleep?

1346
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,460
...exotic land.

1347
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,640
...now the boffins have developed an onion that doesn't make you cry when you cut into

1348
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:38,880
it.

1349
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,360
I know.

1350
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,800
What will science produce next?

1351
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:45,080
Okay, all you driving around town pot smokers, call us right now, April 4th, April 425.

1352
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:45,620
Up to now...

1353
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,320
...and all you guys in red Camaros with mullet haircuts...

1354
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:59,580
Oh yes, dear friends, some KPFA sub-show from KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Howl-Puzzling-Evidence,

1355
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:06,040
Dr. Philodrumon, and before that, some chief-em-thieves.

1356
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,040
Well, there will be a woman at the head of every nation in the world.

1357
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,780
...but models are no less reserved...

1358
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,240
How do you get to be a head of a nation?

1359
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,000
...and now, please...

1360
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,980
Be a woman.

1361
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:20,700
...as you are a nation, too.

1362
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,020
Huh.

1363
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,780
...it's gonna be a lot of work.

1364
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,560
I get it.

1365
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:29,520
I...

1366
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,580
It seems like it would...

1367
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,560
Well, I'd make a terrible woman.

1368
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,020
...the same...

1369
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:34,740
You don't know about that, now?

1370
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,160
...you got the right hair for it.

1371
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,560
...which nothing can better be contrasted.

1372
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,800
Well, the hair on his chin, but it's in the wrong place.

1373
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,240
...if he would know that.

1374
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:44,120
It would be great womanly hair, but it's just all...

1375
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:44,960
...hear on his regular hair.

1376
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,360
...It's arranged wrong.

1377
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,700
...it's gone gray, too.

1378
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,060
I like the hair on his ears.

1379
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,280
...the rest of his skin that we can see is the thickness of the naked eye.

1380
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:50,280


1381
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:50,280


1382
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,640
Well, the hair around his ears will bleed if you cut it.

1383
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,220
That's not just hair.

1384
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:55,420
Oh.

1385
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,840
Those are his forgotten appendages.

1386
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,440
Oh, the undiscovered appendages.

1387
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,400
I remember my forgotten appendages.

1388
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,560
Poor crazy Bonnie.

1389
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,320
She just couldn't stop lunatic room.

1390
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:21,880
The ghost of excesslessness must pass.

1391
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,480
Returns to haunt us.

1392
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:30,720
In these horrible recordings from Doc Stock 1 in 1983.

1393
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:37,740
The saddest, sorriest, most disease-ridden festival of the arts.

1394
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,100
A young woman named Lori's birthday party.

1395
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:40,400
The umbrella.

1396
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:41,120
Oh.

1397
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,720
But you know, the other one that...

1398
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,260
Was here.

1399
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,500
The Hour of Slack.

1400
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,560
From the Church of the Subgenius.

1401
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,220
For more information on the Church of the Subgenius,

1402
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:58,640

1403
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:06,380
Or you can send tapes and things, CDs, whatever, to me, stang, at subgenius.com,

1404
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,640
by email, or...

1405
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:20,980
to post office box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1406
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,620
And friends, this music in the background is the amino acid.

1407
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,180
It's a...

1408
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:26,580
Ugh!

1409
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,960
Tinkerbell, where'd you...

1410
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,120
I am Captain Hook.

1411
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,020
I am your father, Peter Pan.

1412
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:55,620
Come to me.

1413
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,820
Come and sit upon my pegged lap.

1414
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,220
I will tell you the stories of seven legs deep.

1415
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:02,780
That would...

1416
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,000
Ugh!

1417
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,020
Ugh!

1418
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:07,360


1419
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:08,060
Ugh!

1420
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:08,460
Ugh!

1421
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:08,620
Ugh!

1422
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:08,620


1423
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:08,620


1424
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:08,620


1425
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:08,620


1426
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:08,620


1427
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:08,620


1428
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:08,620


1429
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,240
Ugh!

1430
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,100
Ugh!

1431
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,140
parfois?

1432
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:38,320
Sometimes?

1433
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:38,620
Sometimes?

1434
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,640
Problems.

1435
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,140
Symptoms.

1436
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:40,980
Problems.

1437
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:41,880
Finances.

1438
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:42,660
Marriage.

1439
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:43,300
Children.

1440
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,260
Cancer.

1441
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,600
Their disease.

1442
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:46,620
Their disease.

1443
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160

1446
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,280
Ears.

1447
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:52,800
Sickness.

1448
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,440

1449
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,060
Infections.

1450
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,120
Again, painful gallbladder surgery.

1451
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,060
Gallbladder.

1452
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:58,800

1453
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,020

1454
00:58:59,180 --> 00:58:59,560

1455
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,100

1456
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:00,840
Pop.

1457
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:01,940
The Achilles tendon.

1458
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:02,600
Pain.

1459
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:02,980

Fungus infections.

1462

1463
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:06,540
Gone.

1464
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,000
Gone.

1465
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,120
Gone.

1466
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,720
Diagnosis.

1467
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,300
Cancer.

1468
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,400
Damage to the femur.

1469
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:10,920

1470
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,620
Chronic condition in your sinuses.

1471

1482
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:22,500

1486
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,280
Not in her ear.

1487
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,880
Ear.

1488
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:26,780
