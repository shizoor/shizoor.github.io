1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Bring him here!

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,520
Come here!

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,340
I want to talk to you!

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,520
Hey, punk.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,560
When I get out of here, I'm gonna tell you a new one.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,640
I'd like a receipt for that.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,100
Yeah, me too.

8
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,980
I'd like a receipt for that.

9
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:29,960
I'd like a receipt for that.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,760
The stage, it seemed, was the only area of my life in which I was willing to accept something less than perfection.

11
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,720
The show is Trump, and it has sold out performances everywhere.

12
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,400
Perhaps I shouldn't campaign at all.

13
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,100
I'll just, you know, I'll ride it right into the White House.

14
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,540
I'm intelligent.

15
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,460
Some people would say I'm very, very, very intelligent.

16
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,680
I get up.

17
00:01:59,680 --> 00:01:59,980
I take a shower.

18
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,560
I take a shower and wash my hair.

20
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,840
Then I read the newspapers and watch the news on television.

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,780
Slowly, the hair dries.

22
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,280
It takes about an hour.

23
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,140
I don't even use the blow dryer.

24
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Once it's dry, I comb it.

25
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,500
Once I have it the way I like it, even though nobody else likes it,

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,100
I spray it, and it's good for the day.

27
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,980
And did you know, my name is in more black songs than any other name in hip-hop.

28
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,640
Like five of them lately.

29
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,380
Oh.

30
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,480
All of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me, consciously or unconsciously.

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,760
That's to be expected.

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,740
Every guy in the country wants to go out with my daughter.

33
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,420
Oh.

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,340
I'll shake hands.

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,040
I shake hands with people.

36
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,980
But it's not something I like.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,260
Look, I'm not a huge fan of Japan.

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,860
But I love their custom.

39
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,160
Oh.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,440
You know, you hear lots of people say that a great deal is when both sides win.

41
00:02:59,560 --> 00:02:59,980
I'm not.

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,700
That is a bunch of crap.

43
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,480
Ugh.

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,980
My net worth fluctuates.

45
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,160
It goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings.

46
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,840
Even my own feelings.

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,340
Ugh.

48
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,700
I have a great relationship with the blacks.

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,340
Ugh.

50
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,720
Must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees.

51
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,980
You.

52
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,320
Bing bing, bong bong, bing bing bing.

53
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,220
Oh.

54
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,660
I will be the greatest jobs president God ever created.

55
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,880
How stupid are the people of Iowa?

56
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,880
I will be so good at the military your head will spin.

57
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,140
I've had some beautiful pictures taken in which I had a big smile on my face.

58
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,440
I look like a very nice person, which in theory I am.

59
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,140
Ugh.

60
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,580
I went to Harvard.

61
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,640
I know words.

62
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,940
I have the best words.

63
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,180
I have the best.

64
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,600
But there is no better word than stupid.

65
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,720
Ugh.

66
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,680
Always be around unsuccessful people because everybody will respect you.

67
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,180
We're not going to be the stupid people anymore.

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,060
We're going to be the really, really smart people.

69
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:16,980
Ugh.

70
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,740
I love babies.

71
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,140
I hear that baby cry.

72
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,340
I like it.

73
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,100
Actually, I was only kidding.

74
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,120
You can get that baby out of here.

75
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,640
Eh.

76
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,140
Eh.

77
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,460
If we have nuclear weapons, why can't we use them?

78
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,320
Ugh.

79
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,960
Obama is the founder of ISIS.

80
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,180
Like and subscribe for more videos.

81
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,180

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,180


83
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,540
Bye.

84
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,940
Give me the slack, walk and lean

85
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,100
Give me the slack, walk and lean

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,980
Lift me, kick and choke, over your own eyes

Relax and save me of your own tensions

88
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,520
Lift me, kick and choke, over your own eyes

89
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:44,520

Relax and save me of your own tensions

91
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:58,560
Lift me, kick and choke, over your own eyes

92
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:05,140

Give me slack, or kill me

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,060


114
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,300
If you think you can chuck a hook over me over your own eyes

115
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,240
I'd rather be lucky than good any day

116
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,860
I'd rather be a fucking ghost than a shit

117

Give me slack, or kill me

If you have no pipe I will give you

If you have no pipe I will give you

128
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,860
Your men will get caught in and you'll have to sneak a secure car

129
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,880
If you have no pipe I will take it away from you

There's always better than not

Too much is always better than not

You have your pain but then you still think

I can't stop giving them money, Doug.

165
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,420
I'm addicted to the scrub.

166
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,180
You're Doug's thing.

167
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,660
Everybody.

168
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,180
That is the Doug's thing.

169
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,500
I'm a Doug.

170
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,080
I can Doug any Doug I want.

171
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,100
That's unusual.

172
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,820
How dare you say that?

173
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,500
You can call me a Doug.

174
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,640
You can come to my house, call me a Doug to my face.

175
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,400
What's the matter, Julie?

176
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,740
Wait, we are outside.

177
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,660
Only cops get that, Doug.

178
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,820
This is a Doug's free zone, sir.

179
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,480
We've made the top right space.

180
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,460
What the fuck are you doing here, Doug?

181
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,980
Well, that's the dog calling the kettle Doug.

182
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,320
That's the dog calling the duck, Doug.

183
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,340
That's the one.

184

Down on the couch like a CEO.

186
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,900
Get the work done.

187
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,200
Give Doug a beat, please.

188
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,920
I don't care.

189
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,840
Them chai pills are going to make you lose all your hair.

190
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,240
Oh, baby.

191
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,900
Hey, you're lucky I'm still here.

192
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,200
Look, I realize they're called Little White.

193
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,420
But you know they're guilty every time I try to hip, huh?

194
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:13,920
Hello?

195
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,720
Hello?

196
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,160
Is anybody on?

197
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,800
Hello?

198
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,480
Hello?

199
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:16,680
Hello?

200
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,040
Are you there?

201
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,500
Hello?

202
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,660
Hello?

203
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:18,800


204
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:18,960
Hello?

205
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,920
This pod crest has been disconnected due to lack of funds.

206
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,920
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,960
I can't hear you.

208
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,880
Just let the pod crest, like, you know, just...

209
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:26,880


210
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,580
Can you hear me?

211
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,040
Hello?

212
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,680
Hello?

213
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, someone turned me up, I think.

214
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,520
Now I feel, like, overwhelmed by the sound of my own voice.

215
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,060
Who's that, Doug, there?

216
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,880
Get the signal.

217
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,080
What?

218
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,240
Why is Reverend Doug?

219
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,400
No, no, no, no, no, no.

220
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,440
I think you're in a dead zone and you're bored.

221
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,340
No, I was just talking.

222
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:40,800
Come here.

223
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,840
I'm talking in the background.

224
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,500
You're not supposed to look at me.

225
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,540
I'm just talking in the background.

226
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,160
No, no, no.

227
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,940
You don't sound like you're in the background.

228
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,500
Definitely, I just...

229
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,340
Jesus, is that you?

230
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:55,900
If I go a little closer this way, I feel like I'm not understanding the nature of your...

231
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,340
Hi, Jesus, it's me, Shagun.

232
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,440
I am stuck in that...

233
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,140
Uh...

234
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,060
Jesus, why do I get boners in my sleep?

235
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,700
Uh...

236
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:03,680
Butters?

237
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,900
So glad you could chime in.

238
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,560
Well, it's because he...

239
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,040
Maybe I'll stay.

240
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,540
Way too many, uh, looking for you.

241
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,300
Yeah, I don't...

242
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm just...

243
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm just trying to be in the background.

244
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,700
I wish other people would chime in right now.

245
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,100
Did you send a link to people?

246
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,600
Well, you know, I believe that Scrum will make this country great again.

247
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,280
Oh!

248
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,380
Thank you.

249
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,200
A beautiful testimony from a real believer, a conspicuous consumer of Scrum, Incorporated,

250
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,060
LLC.stamps is the main product there.

251
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,000
We all hope so much.

252
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,220
Visit us on our geostar.

253
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,640
Completely legal for now.

254
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,540
Write your...

255
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:35,860
Your senator.

256
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,380
Tell him to vote against...

257
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,760
Scrum?

258
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,980
Prop 513-013...

259
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,900
You have a problem getting Scrum in here right now.

260
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,280
...which would ban the sale of Scrum after the hours of 14 minutes.

261
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,060
Only $34...

262
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,160
...is still available.

263
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,860
...if you become a Scrum genius.

264
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,440
$34?

265
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:50,960
That's a dollar...

266
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,160
$34?

267
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,760
...a dollar cheaper than the competition.

268
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,020
Yeah, but then you...

269
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,060
It's very...

270
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,100
That dollar is the difference between getting on the saucer and...

271
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,460
But honestly, for that $34.99...

272
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,800
But for a dollar, think of what you could buy.

273
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,380
I mean, you get to see the saucer.

274
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,420
You could buy four packs of Scrum.

275
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,420


276
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,540
You could buy four packs of Scrum.

277
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,560
Four packs of Bubblegum.

278
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,160
It's absolutely worth it.

279
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,580
What are we talking here?

280
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,440
New York City...

281
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,360
You could buy...

282
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,940
$35 for...

283
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,360
Two phone calls at a payphone.

284
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,380
Wow.

285
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,520
What's that?

286
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:17,920
Wait.

287
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:18,980
What?

288
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,440
How...

289
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,960
Care to elaborate on that word you just used?

290
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,760
Payphone?

291
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,500
Everybody that was born after 1990, raise your hands.

292
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,260
Well, this is 1998, and I've never seen one of those.

293
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,440
I cut my hands off.

294
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,120
I can't...

295
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,860
I don't know.

296
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,500
I cut my hands off so I couldn't...

297
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,540
I cut my hands off every day.

298
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,200
And it's really difficult when you get down to the one hand.

299
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,720
Well, that's how you know you're a lizard person, animal.

300
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,200
You've got the other hand off with just a nub.

301
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,420
Your fucking limbs, they just keep growing back.

302
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
And it's great, because we always have spare limbs.

303
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,160
It's true.

304
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,660
It's true.

305
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,200
And that's why I'm planning a membership.

306
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,540
Spare limbs are really bad.

307
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,220
Planning a membership in the podcrest that gets you a vial of animal's blood.

308
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,100
You can shoot it up and maybe it'll give you regenerating limbs.

309
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,760
Maybe it won't.

310
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,920
Yeah, can't we maybe not offer that anymore?

311
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,480
Because I'm feeling a little bit...

312
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,480


313
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,480


314
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,480


315
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,480


316
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,340
Well, you need to stay more hydrated.

317
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,560
I try to, but they only get me so much beard and ring.

318
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,900
Have you tried that Soylent shit?

319
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,620
I hear that that's pretty good for regaining...

320
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,460
I have actually, and it just makes me feel more complacent.

321
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,680
Soylent shit is made out of shit.

322
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,960
That's correct.

323
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Actually, it's made out of jism, not cum.

324
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,480
This is a little sexy song.

325
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,820
A demented kind of sexy.

326
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:34,780
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

327
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,080
I'm just trying to get it out of my head.

328
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,080


329
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,080


330
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,080


331
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,080


332
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,080


333
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:50,140
She needed a steamy meeting of flesh to sink her teeth in.

334
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:57,540
She needed to meet his back into her bed.

335
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,060
Her kind-eyed smiles were all I could see.

336
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,060


337
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,060


338
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:16,720
Were useful to her plan to lure him in with her dirty aching hands.

339
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:25,440
When please, stars, cover your eyes.

340
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:34,200
And see through your own disguise.

341
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

342
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,760
I'm just proactive.

343
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,260
But it really is like I ever much wanted me to impart.

344
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,260


345
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:54,660
I bet if you could You'd think that her sugar-coated organs

346
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:54,660


347
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:54,660


348
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,740
Xen makes his fucking video shit.

349
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,220
CHORUS

350
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,640
Her misshapen pillow's still full of

351
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,620
Disillusioned dreams are her covers

352
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,920
Still covering things everyone sees

353
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,200
Shielding, wielding, folding up a meandering

354
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,500
Midnight fever, it is insatiable

355
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,340
She is a slave to her own needs

356
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:48,680
White, clean stars covering your eyes

357
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,980
And see through your own disguise

358
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,180
And see through your own disguise

359
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,180


360
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,220
Don't fight it

361
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,400
Might as well like it

362
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,420
It's natural

363
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,380
It's natural to me

364
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,420
Thanks.

365
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,880
Thanks.

366
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,980
What did I tell you?

367
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,060
I told you it wasn't going to die.

368
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,940
I told you that it was going to come back.

369
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,480
Yeah, you thought that the song that refused to die really was dead.

370
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,720
Well, guess what you're hearing right now?

371
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,740
The guy.

372
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,520
The song that refused to die.

373
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,480
It's going on and on and on.

374
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,980
The Sinfaltimus is just encouraging.

375
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,780
Oh, he likes the song that refused to die.

376
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,860
Or at least he thinks he does.

377
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,340
Lots of people think they do for the first hundred years.

378
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,720
Oh yeah, you thought it was dead.

379
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,180
But you forgot about reincarnation.

380
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:40,320
The song that refused to die is perpetually being reincarnated as an uglier and uglier song.

381
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,460
Well, sometimes it appears as a pretty song.

382
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,240
You never know.

383
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,660
You gotta give it credit for creativity, if not any intelligence at all.

384
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:59,180
But as Princess Wee once said, everything comes apart one way or another.

385
00:20:59,180 --> 00:20:59,180


386
00:20:59,180 --> 00:20:59,180


387
00:20:59,180 --> 00:20:59,180


388
00:20:59,180 --> 00:20:59,180


389
00:20:59,180 --> 00:20:59,180


390
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,040
Some ways are fun.

391
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:13,960
And as Tater said, Bob loves the sin, but hates the sinner.

392
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:22,440
For you see, my friends, your rights end where Bob's fists begin.

393
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,180
And as Dr. Laguerre said,

394
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,640
Slack is like fucking.

395
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,740
The more you put in, the more you pull out.

396
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,040
But friends, we have to learn to focus.

397
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,200
That's it.

398
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,160
We keep losing our focus.

399
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:50,860
We must, we must focus if we can't take a joke.

400
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:08,920
And I'm afraid that in the case of the joke called the song that refused to die, we're

401
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,600
the joke.

402
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,920
Yeah, it's laughing at us, the song is.

403
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,960
I can hear its ugly laughter now, at least in my left ear.

404
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,180
It's got an evil sense of humor, sort of like Jehovah One.

405
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,160
The song is called, Jehovah One.

406
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,640
The song that refused to die has an ironic and cruel sense of humor.

407
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:37,500
Much like God, the song that refused to die refuses to die.

408
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,880
The song that refused to die is a motherfucker, my friends.

409
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,140
The song that refused to die is a Sunday, the spread of the sun.

410
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,140
One thing the song that refused to die is a Sunday, the spread of the sun.

411
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,460
I wrap my head around and I say, Philip, the song that refused to die, we set out

412
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,680
a means of communication.

413
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,340
The same as the famous change that happened inligatory in the Blitzkrieg period.

414
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,280
Isn't that pretty cool?

415
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:26,120
They 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 002 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 008 008 007 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 00 Pax referring 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 009 0010 0010 0010 0010 0010 0020 00�ed obligation to focus.

416
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,140
or sneakier and sneakier and sneakier.

417
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,860
Bob probably loves the song Refuse to Die.

418
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,100
And that's probably why it's so immortal.

419
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,300
The song that Refuse to Die is going to live a lot longer than you, my friend.

420
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,900
The song that Refuse to Die is going to live longer than Methuselah.

421
00:23:53,900 --> 00:24:00,360
The song that Refuse to Die is going to live as long as J.R. Bob Dobbs has his pipe lit.

422
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,380
And there's no sign of that thing going out.

423
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,420
No sir, no sir, ma'am.

424
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,080
It's a rough situation these days.

425
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:16,500
You don't know what's the song that Refuse to Die, what's a car honking at you.

426
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,500
God damn it, but it's a dreamlike how you can go.

427
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,400
And then when you go, somebody runs right into you, you see?

428
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,100
Because it's just like the song that Refuse to Die.

429
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,780
And it's not dissimilar to Bob himself.

430
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:45,480
I hate to say it, but you might as well lay back and try to enjoy it, or at least ignore it.

431
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,040
Well, that's impossible.

432
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,900
Oh, if only.

433
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,400
If only we could just ignore it.

434
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,560
If we could just forget it.

435
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:03,320
If we could just get somewhere far, far away from it.

436
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,780
But, you see, that's the thing of it.

437
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,560
The thing of it is you just can't get away from it.

438
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,820
That's why they call it it.

439
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,960
If the thing that time forgot.

440
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,160
If only.

441
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,460
If the thing from beyond time.

442
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,160
Oh, we wish.

443
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,080
If the Facebook page followed it.

444
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,800
In the same place.

445
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,460
Well, yeah, that's true.

446
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,300
That's not true.

447
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,440
Okay, that's true.

448
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,800
If I know that song Refuse to Die.

449
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,060
Nobody will be able to hear anything I've said for the last 15 minutes.

450
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,480
But you never know.

451
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,700
Maybe it'll surprise me.

452
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,240
Maybe since it's about the song Refuse to Die and he let it through.

453
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,600
That would just figure.

454
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,240
What ironic, isn't it?

455
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,740
No, not ironic.

456
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,740
Just sad.

457
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:28,140
Because, dear friends, the church of the subgenius is the touchstone of the untouchable.

458
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,200
We are caustically optimistic.

459
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,780
In this world, you are the peer or the penis.

460
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:46,780


461
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:46,780


462
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,180
And you are part of our peer group.

463
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:16,780
While the conspiracy will fill your soul with doubt, we are soulmates.

464
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:16,780


465
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:16,780


466
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:16,780


467
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,520
The world out of soul value.

468
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,660
This is the 21st century.

469
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:46,780
This is the 21st century.

470
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:46,780


471
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:46,780


472
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,060
This is the 21st century.

473
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,080
This is the 21st century.

474
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,080


475
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,960
We're the very Laffinity group you've been looking for.

476
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:58,720
And we're busted loose to bust the ass of the wingelantis who tamper our cause.

477
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,380
So join the loiterati.

478
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,060
Join the church of the subgenius.

479
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,820
Ah, yes.

480
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,800
Praise God!

481
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
The Lord is with you.

482
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,840
And you too.

483
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,760
Praise God.

484
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:16,760


485
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:16,760


486
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:16,780
Praise God.

487
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:16,780


488
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:16,780


489
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:16,780


490
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:16,780


491
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:16,780


492
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Praise Adonay National Spotifyone.

493
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,020
DJ Bad Rebel�무 열손 трав기해�camp 조건조

494
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,800
הי join the choir.

495
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Hylken Levi.

496
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:58,020
I can feel the Bob energy building up.

497
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:11,660
The Bob energy is coming up from the center of the earth like a great big lava volcano

498
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,080
pustule.

499
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,100
Like a zit on mother earth that's about to bust.

500
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,700
Here comes the spirit of Bob.

501
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:21,760
Bob.

502
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,600
Bob.

503
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:22,860
Bob.

504
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,220
Bob.

505
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,580
Bob.

506
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,060
Bob.

507
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,460
Bob.

508
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,320
I can smell it.

509
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,920
It's smells kinda like the song refused to die unfortunately.

510
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:46,300
Oh, yes, Dear friends.

511
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,000
Oh, yes, dear friends.

512
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,000


513
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,660
friends.

514
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,100
I think maybe I tried to make

515
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,540
too many shows today.

516
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,600
I'll have to

517
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,180
I'll have to ask

518
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,840
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

519
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,640
about that.

520
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,120
Well, just go right on ahead and ask me then

521
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,160
because I'm a man of a thousand answers.

522
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,720
A miniscule

523
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,300
plate and a number of

524
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,020
faces.

525
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,580
Faces.

526
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,380
We have had a bunch of faces

527
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,360
on the show.

528
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,660
The music in the background

529
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,580
is Reverend Jimmy Ryan.

530
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,580
The song that refused to die was

531
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,620
mixed up with some lines written

532
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,480
by other subgeniuses such as

533
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,420
Titor and Onan

534
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,720
Canabite and others.

535
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,420
That pretty song we heard was

536
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,240
Reverend Amy.

537
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,400
The ugly dugs we heard

538
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,580
were Thorazine Urine Pod Crust

539
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,220
and that song

540
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,980
that sent with the guy

541
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,520
saying give me slack or kill me

542
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,380
that was

543
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,180
Reverend Experimental

544
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,320
Please. And we heard

545
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,280
Billy West as Sat Brannigan as

546
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,460
Donald Trump. And the little

547
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,280
bit from Bobby School by

548
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,140
Reverend Watt

549
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,740
Default.

550
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,500
I missed the trumpeter

551
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,620
the takeoff.

552
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,820
It was his

553
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,700
his exact words.

554
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,740
It's just that they were being

555
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,340
read by Billy West,

556
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,320
the cartoon voice guy

557
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,680
in the voice of

558
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,720
Sat Brannigan Futurama.

559
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,660
Yeah, I see.

560
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:39,920
I see.

561
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,240
I see.

562
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:40,740
I see.

563
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:40,900
I see.

564
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,780
I'm glad to hear that happened

565
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,760
because we would have been

566
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,460
some desperate pick and snot

567
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,760
had that not occurred.

568
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,980
You see what's going on from east

569
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,660
to west and changing the horizon

570
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,040
level.

571
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,100
What?

572
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,840
You know, well, that's bad news

573
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,600
for me, man.

574
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,400
Yeah, it is.

575
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,160
By the way, I just wanted to

576
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,140
mention the fact that I'm

577
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,680
extremely jealous because you're

578
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,320
going to Texas.

579
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,040
I want to go someplace warm.

580
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,860
I'm not ready for warmth to be

581
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,580
over entirely.

582
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,960
You know how they do it around

583
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,280
here.

584
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,740
Oh, yeah.

585
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,920
Yeah, that's true.

586
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,100
Oh, well, I'm just

587
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,960
trying to avoid having to

588
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,720
shovel snow on my driveway

589
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,700
because the driveway there is like

590
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,800
a half a mile long.

591
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,620
It's dirt road with rocks all

592
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,080
over it.

593
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,260
It's pretty hard to shovel.

594
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,520
You'd have to have some pretty

595
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,120
big feet, too, to cover all that

596
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,040
turf, especially if it was like

597
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,500
an eye patch or something like

598
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:33,760
that.

599
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,680
That's the way, you know, that's

600
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,860
the way we want to raise them

601
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,180
nowadays.

602
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,660
We want to make them strong and

603
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,140
firm and ready for the

604
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,920
militarism.

605
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,740
Ready to be subsorbed.

606
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,960
Well, Dave, you must have all

607
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,420
your nice long underwear lined

608
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,540
up and ready to go so you can put

609
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,540
on many layers of clothing and

610
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,720
remain warm throughout the cold

611
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,620
winter months.

612
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,660
I don't want to look forward to

613
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,740
even, you know, well, oh, you can

614
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,180
put on layers of clothing.

615
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,660
Yes.

616
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,540
I don't care.

617
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,620
I don't want to wear layers of

618
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,000
clothing.

619
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,900
I'm sure you don't.

620
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,200
I want to be in a warm place,

621
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,220
period, you know.

622
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,820
Especially not some place where

623
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,400
they declare winter on the day

624
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,020
after fall begins.

625
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,780
I'm sure you don't.

626
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:21,780


627
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:21,780


628
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:21,780


629
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,860
Well, you know, sometimes

630
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,140
somebody has to die before you

631
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,000
can live in Texas.

632
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,660
That's what happens to us.

633
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,520
And then they kill you when you

634
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,000
get there.

635
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,560
That's why I got to get a gun.

636
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,660
Well, I didn't necessarily mean

637
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,260
Texas where I'd have to get a

638
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:42,520
gun.

639
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,200
But any place, well, I suppose

640
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,120
any place like Alabama or

641
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,580
Mississippi or Florida Panhandle

642
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,920
or Georgia or any place like

643
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,180
that.

644
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,420
Where it's nice and summery most

645
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,620
of the year, I'd have to get a

646
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,420
gun with a tie.

647
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,720
Well, the thing is, though,

648
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,160
Dave, that it gets to be kind of

649
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,940
hot down there in a way that

650
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,280
we're not used to up here.

651
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,500
I lost my used to itfulness.

652
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,020
In the summer.

653
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,820
And they grow bugs bigger

654
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,480
there, too.

655
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,020
And in the spring, too, yeah.

656
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,420
Bugs and snakes are quite

657
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:14,900
frightening.

658
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,180
And spiders have a different

659
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:17,620
dimension.

660
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,360
They're like, you know, blah,

661
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,600
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

662
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:20,720
blah, blah, blah.

663
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:20,720


664
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,040
just like my sisters, going in

665
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,140
my house, you know?

666
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,020
Yeah.

667
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,960
And snakes.

668
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,780
They own the pad.

669
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,480
The snakes there are like

670
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,860
the song that refused to die.

671
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,180
You have to beat them to death

672
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,480
with a shovel and they still

673
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,200
won't die.

674
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
Yes, even an hour later,

675
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,820
they're still opening their

676
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,460
mouths slowly and hissing at

677
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:38,700
you.

678
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,280
You know, I wouldn't be

679
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,720
surprised if that song doesn't

680
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,640
come back before this shows

681
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:44,940
everywhere.

682
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,700
I wouldn't be at all

683
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,200
surprised.

684
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,080
Probably I bet you in the last

685
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,760
Yes, three minutes it's going to take advantage of the situation and come back.

686
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,820
It'd be a song surge.

687
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,920
Yeah, Dave was lucky he missed the song that refused to die.

688
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,660
Well, I didn't miss the hissing part.

689
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,860
And they said that, what's his name, the guy who predicted the future said that Hister would be in 1947.

690
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,840
Nostradamus, that's right.

691
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,740
He predicted an evil doer named Hister.

692
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,980
Hister would be hissing in the 40s and 20s and 30s and stuff.

693
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:23,400
And Nostradamus also said, Dave, that the world would end on July 5th, 1999.

694
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,840
So obviously he wasn't perfect.

695
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,420
Because we know it's 1998.

696
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,740
Edgar Cayce agreed with us on that.

697
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,720
Agreed with Bob.

698
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,700
Yes, sir.

699
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,240
I'm sorry to sound so ignoramus, but Edgar Cayce did agree with Bob?

700
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,560
Yeah, that the world would end in 1998.

701
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,940
Yep, 1998.

702
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,900
When that year comes, that's it.

703
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,700
That's when the great rupture will happen.

704
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,600
Obviously we're not there yet.

705
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,760
So, um...

706
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,200
Obviously it must not be, but there must have been some sort of misdingling of some disinformation somehow.

707
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,020
I passed through the passage.

708
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:09,220
The conspiracy will do anything to prevent J.R. Bob Dobbs from being president.

709
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:09,780
Anything!

710
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,860
Even changing calendars a thousand years in advance.

711
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:23,320
Just to embarrass his sacred scribe on the day we thought was July 5th, 1998.

712
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,100
Oh, well.

713
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,860
Let's not dwell on that.

714
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,200
Let's think about the future.

715
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,880
Oh, wait, no.

716
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,480
Let's not.

717
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,180
Let's not do that either.

718
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,300
Let's hide in some escapism and slack.

719
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,060
Yeah, that's it.

720
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,380
Slack.

721
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:44,000
I've actually, Dave, this is the third show I've put together today.

722
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:54,280
And it's showing because we are having to go to Stang Ranch in Stangsville, Texas, in Stang County.

723
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,960
I had to get some shows done in advance.

724
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,200
And so there's a couple of X-Day shows.

725
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,820
In fact, there's going to be a bunch of X-Day shows.

726
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:14,480
But once we get to Texas, I'm going to try to set up a situation whereby you, and only you, as usual, can call in to my Radio Shack mixer.

727
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,140
And we hopefully still do shows.

728
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,800
They won't be live, live shows.

729
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,880
And it's just not the same.

730
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,280
When you know it's just being recorded, it's just not the same.

731
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:35,220
Well, you can pretend it's a live audience in your mind knowing that it will be indeed someday.

732
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:42,620
No, because you know you can still edit it so that the red light panic isn't taking hold of you

733
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,900
and making you do your very, very, very, very.

734
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,000
Except when you get flustered, nervous, and then you do your work.

735
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,480
Yeah, sometimes it makes you pee.

736
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,760
It makes you ordinary, too.

737
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,800
Red light panic is not.

738
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,260
It's desirable in some fashion and way and certainty.

739
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,540
But in other ways, it is not.

740
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,720
This show sounds different.

741
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,580
My voice sounds different.

742
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,900
And you sound different.

743
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,900
Yeah, you sound like you used to sound about 20 years ago.

744
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,140
Well.

745
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:14,960
You don't sound like you used to.

746
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,480
You sound like the elderly staying with Come to Know and Despise.

747
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,640
And you sound like the young Spain.

748
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,080
We needed to come and despise.

749
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:29,140
But that must be a side effect that they didn't tell me about on these new hearing aids I got.

750
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,500
That's right.

751
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:37,160
Finally, after 20 years of increasing deafness, I've got my right ear completely back.

752
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,600
And my left ear is all trimmed and got a new haircut.

753
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,860
And it made my voice sound 20 years younger.

754
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,720
Just because I can hear 20 years ago.

755
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,060
That is it.

756
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,440
The hearing aid made you.

757
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,520
It did it.

758
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,800
Because you do sound like you used to sound when you were.

759
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:01,440
And you subconsciously remember, of course, how to sound like you used to sound a couple thousand years ago.

760
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,100
Yes.

761
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,820
And your hearing aid reproduces that sound in your head.

762
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,760
And you match right up.

763
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,000
And the waveforms come into perfect.

764
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,880
You know, they match up perfectly.

765
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:13,820
Yes.

766
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,240
And there you go.

767
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,960
He's got a special.

768
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,020
He's got a special spring in his voice now.

769
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:22,160
Well, I also discovered that I have a crack in my elbow that's actually pretty loud every now and then.

770
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,960
And my knees make noises I didn't know about.

771
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,500
And our house is creaky and spooky.

772
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,780
And my keyboard is really loud.

773
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,620
The things that I didn't know made any sound at all.

774
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,280
It turns out they're pretty noisy.

775
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:42,780
Now I'm embarrassed about what the neighbors have probably overheard for years and years.

776
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,780
Did you know that you're a neighbor?

777
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,960
All stood against you at the final hour, pointing to a guy where they knew what was next and you did not.

778
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,500
Do you remember now, Mr. Stan, may I call you Mr. Reverend Iron Stan?

779
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,540
No.

780
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,900
How did you know that?

781
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,440
How did you know that?

782
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,700
No one was supposed to know that.

783
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,260
No one was supposed to know that.

784
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,880
We all know.

785
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,820
We all see.

786
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,480
That's the problem.

787
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,520
All of us have no.

788
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,220
I'm scared.

789
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:28,300
Hey, speaking of big brotherly stuff, I read the, well, actually it was a YouTube thing I saw that Reverend Susie the Flusie drew our attention to.

790
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:47,840
In China, they've come up with a fiendishly clever combination of government spying and Facebook, where all of the citizens now, whether they want to or not, are playing the good citizen game.

791
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:56,780
It's called a sesame something, because the Alibaba company is involved and the government is involved.

792
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,160
Right.

793
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,280
Right.

794
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,280


795
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,280


796
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,280


797
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,280


798
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,280


799
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,280


800
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,280


801
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,280


802
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,280


803
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,280


804
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:03,100
That's like the biggest games company and so forth and totally all interconnected.

805
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,400
And get this.

806
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:16,800
You play the game by being a good citizen and all of your purchases are counted as credits, extra credits or demerits.

807
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:28,280
For instance, if you have been Googling or talking about Tiananmen Square, let's say, on Chinese Facebook, your score goes down.

808
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,160
And you can't spend, your money isn't as good.

809
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,240
And you can't get as good an internet connection.

810
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,960
Your citizen score goes down, down, down.

811
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:49,960
Whereas if you play by all the rules and buy the right things and turn in the right citizens for not doing the right things, your score goes up.

812
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,700
Now, someone pointed out that this could create a cobra effect.

813
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,500
Like when the British.

814
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:05,360
Which offered the people of India a reward for bringing in dead cobras.

815
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,480
What happened was the people of India started cobra farms so they could bring in lots and lots of dead cobras.

816
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,060
But it ended up ultimately making more cobras.

817
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,680
So, who knows?

818
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,320
Maybe this thing will backfire on the Chinese.

819
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:27,600
But on the other hand, what will probably happen is it will really work to control the populace.

820
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,000
And then they'll do it here.

821
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,020
Right.

822
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,840
On TrumpNet.

823
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,300
TrumpNet.

824
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:31,300


825
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,080
They're going to imitate it.

826
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:33,640
TrumpBook.

827
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,620
Face Trump.

828
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,380
If you have enough Trump points, then you can own a gun.

829
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:46,180
And if you don't have enough Trump points, then you can't even own a, you can't, your rent goes up.

830
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,900
If they'll, if anyone will rent to you.

831
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:57,320
In some way, they've already got, if you have a FROP card, in many states, the feds are trying to push that you may not own a gun.

832
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,940
Oh, right, right, yeah.

833
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,240
If you have a medical card.

834
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,980
Right, because that means you have a low, low, low score on the game of good citizenry.

835
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:06,640
Yeah.

836
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,680
If you're sick and need a certain kind of medicine, then the government can treat you like a bad citizen.

837
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:13,880
Mm-hmm.

838
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,380
Oy.

839
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Isn't that interesting?

840
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:25,960
How many clever little things you can do with the internet and credit and guns and propaganda.

841
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:36,860
I personally think that the internet was a control mechanism devised by these many, uh, rancid heroes of the, uh, lexic, lexicoms.

842
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:46,560
I think that the, it was invented by the military and it was meant to make people wanna stare at the palms of their heads at all times.

843
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,840
Oh, I don't think anyone, I don't think anyone knew that was coming.

844
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:57,580
I think, well, I think when the military was doing that, they really thought it was, you know, when computers were invented, they've, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the computer was invented.

845
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:57,580


846
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,220
Experts thought that there would only need to be five of them in the whole world because who else?

847
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,500
You know, there's only five people who'd know what to use them for that knew enough math.

848
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,900
The idea of pornography on computers never occurred to anybody.

849
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,000
And now look at the Internet.

850
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,940
If you can stomach it.

851
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:19,760
I can.

852
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,000
I certainly can.

853
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,260
I think it's well worth it.

854
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,860
Yeah, the porno is great.

855
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,840
Right, but they demote you.

856
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,840
You get a demerit.

857
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,560
They give you, what will they call the bad porn points?

858
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:35,820
Clintons.

859
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,720
You'll get 10 Clintons if you watch too much porn.

860
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:48,000
But if you watch just the right amount of porn and pay for it, then you get trumps for the leader.

861
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,860
That proves that you love the leader if you're paying for your pornography.

862
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,840
Whereas if you're just...

863
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:58,820
You know, if you're one of those clever Internet pirates that just turns on the free porn faucet.

864
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,060
Well, that's cheating.

865
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,940
And whips himself up a whole gallon of porn tea.

866
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:13,880
And you turn on the spigot and you fill up the teapot and you drink all night to your own merriment.

867
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,580
And occlusions as well.

868
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,880
Some people have massive occlusions after taking on Internet porn tea.

869
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,380
Oh, that's what they say.

870
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
That's all up in the air.

871
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,720
It's like violence in video games.

872
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,680
What they say sometimes is true.

873
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,440
What they say is true sometimes.

874
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,540
Well, but there actually is not that much connection.

875
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,860
It just...

876
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:46,520
For people who love the feeling of righteous indignation, pornography on the Internet is terrible and causes crimes.

877
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,760
And one quarter of all college girls will be raped.

878
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,820
But those things are actually not...

879
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,420
Not true.

880
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,380
And vaccines don't cause autism.

881
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,620
Video games don't cause more violence.

882
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,940
Obama did not invent ISIS.

883
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,160
Oh, tomorrow is the big circus show.

884
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,160
Well, tomorrow in our time frame.

885
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:10,960
Oh, yeah, the circus show.

886
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,340
Yeah.

887
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:17,720
By the time the other stations get the CD of this show, there'll be a second circus show coming on.

888
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,460
Yeah, the circus...

889
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,400
The elephants will have already shat.

890
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,220
Right.

891
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,580
Oh.

892
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:31,860
I've hit the delay dump button more times this show than almost ever in my life.

893
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,940
I think I brought the wrong CD in.

894
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,540
The Internet listeners and the other station listeners won't hear that delay dump.

895
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,100
But the folks in Cleveland had to hear it a couple of times.

896
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,160
But I think that you can say that because it's past tense.

897
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,800
They're going to change it to Trillay Trump.

898
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:49,620
Trillay?

899
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,040
Yeah, Trillay Trump instead of delay dump.

900
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,380
That's the censor button.

901
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,880
In this station, when you push it, you hear the guy say,

902
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,240
Inappropriate!

903
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,000
After a long guitar riff.

904
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,980
A long guitar riff.

905
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:08,460
Well, you have to have a long guitar riff because it has to be able to cover a jabbering ninny.

906
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:14,120
Or a tape that you failed to use the right file.

907
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,940
Or a woman with a spoon balled in her head.

908
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:17,600
Right.

909
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,660
What you see, G?

910
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,700
Well, sir, I don't know what I see.

911
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,600
A snail.

912
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:30,040
The nexus of pi has been re-regurgitated from your cerebral cortex.

913
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:38,040
Your pineal gland has turned into a mist, which you can vaporize and drink slowly on a Saturday afternoon if you feel like it.

914
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:46,160
That stage has taken everybody's minds and thrown them out in the driveway and jumped up and down on them and spat on them and stuff.

915
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,020
Yeah.

916
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,120
And standed on them for long periods of time.

917
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,200
And now it makes me want to cry.

918
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,360
I feel like Annie Oakley.

919
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,540
I feel like Annie Oakley in the rain without a gun.

920
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,900
Not being able to shoot nothing.

921
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,480
You know how I feel.

922
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,180
Oh, impotent.

923
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,760
Not able to shoot nothing.

924
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,560
Terrible.

925
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,500
Yeah.

926
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,880
So frustrating.

927
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:11,580
A snail crawling along the edge of a straight razor.

928
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,320
Oh.

929
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:19,780
A snail crawling along the edge of a straight razor.

930
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,540
Nothing for me.

931
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,120
Oh, this.

932
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:22,640
Oh.

933
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:23,920
A horror.

934
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,240
A horror.

935
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,500
Oh, I thought you were trying to do Frank Sinatra in the groove tube.

936
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,380
That's right.

937
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:31,760
Yeah.

938
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,700
I had to hold my mouth in a really funny position to do that.

939
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,140
I can't unhear that.

940
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:45,400
There's actually quoting Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now for you non-movie fans.

941
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,600
Just because it's fun to talk like Marlon Brando.

942
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,160
He makes a funny face.

943
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,080
He does it too.

944
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,460
You're going to need to adjust your hearing aid a little bit if you want to talk like Marlon Brando.

945
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,220
But if you want to talk like an early Marlon Brando, you can't do them right now.

946
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,240
It was the old bald, fat Marlon Brando.

947
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:20,260
Weemaw Maw, that's Princess Weez Maw, believes that she talked to Marlon Brando on shortwave when he lived in Tahiti.

948
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,880
She used to be a shortwave buff.

949
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,360
Yeah.

950
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:23,360


951
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:23,360


952
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:23,360


953
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,200
She just sat and scanned those airwaves.

954
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,980
And one evening, she got in a conversation with somebody.

955
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:35,720
And after a while, she realized it was probably Marlon Brando in his little island place that he had.

956
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:41,820
Not the same one that is in that movie, Island of Dr. Moreau, although that would be pretty cool.

957
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:45,140
Or the same one featured in the Meet Me on the Bounty.

958
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,220
Oh, yeah.

959
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,540
Right.

960
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,480
That was near Tahiti and was Tahati.

961
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,220
Tahati.

962
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:53,340
Tahati.

963
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,280
There's a lot of Tahatis in Tahiti.

964
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:00,220
I can think of another rhyme, but I can't do it on WCSB before 10 o'clock.

965
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,300
There's Tukulis, too.

966
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:03,880
Tukulis?

967
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,560
Mm-hmm.

968
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:11,260
You mean the indigent laborers who carry people's rickshaws around and argue with the denizens?

969
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,500
Jays.

970
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,380
Oh, well, then in that case, all's forgiven.

971
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,640
You can go back home now.

972
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,200
Everybody stand clear of the windows.

973
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,320
We're doing a shock.

974
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,240
We're doing a shock reading, and it should only take a few seconds.

975
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:37,820
So in Mutiny on the Bounty, when the ship pulls up to the island and the natives run out, the ladies all had tops on.

976
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:45,040
But in the movie Hawaii, they pull up to Hawaii for the first time, and all the ladies run out topless.

977
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,560
That was in a Hollywood movie from the early 70s, I think.

978
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,760
Mm-hmm.

979
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:49,780
Mm-hmm.

980
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,120
Mm-hmm.

981
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:50,420
Mm-hmm.

982
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:50,420


983
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:50,440
Mm-hmm.

984
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:50,440


985
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:50,460
Mm-hmm.

986
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:50,460


987
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:50,460


988
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,160
Why was it that it was okay for them to be topless?

989
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,080
Because they were brown.

990
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,880
That's what I think.

991
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:57,320
Mm-hmm.

992
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,720
It's like that show Roots.

993
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:05,440
It was okay to show naked breasts if they were slave breasts because, you know, that's the way things really were.

994
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,220
Well, somehow—

995
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,140
They're not really people.

996
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:07,980
If it was—

997
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,900
Yeah.

998
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:09,740
Yeah.

999
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,800
That's one of those double standards.

1000
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,980
It's like, to the average—

1001
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:17,740
There were some great standards on that one girl, speaking of double standards.

1002
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,180
Man.

1003
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:18,640
Yeah.

1004
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,320
When you just think of the great—

1005
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:20,560
Yeah.

1006
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:20,560


1007
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:27,560
You think of them, they think of such people as like animals would be the same as showing a dog's breast.

1008
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,500
I don't want to be with a dog kitty.

1009
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,780
Well, that was the Hollywood thought at the time, I guess.

1010
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,060
You know, it was—

1011
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:50,300
Well, you know, back in the day, it was legal to show breastages in documentaries, and hence there were a whole lot of National Enquirer talks about breastfeeding.

1012
00:51:50,300 --> 00:52:01,540
This kind of appeared to me like kind of Notre Dame type documentary movies, Mondo, Connie, and so forth, because, well, we're just showing the way these primitive people, these tribal people, live with their boobs hanging out.

1013
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,120
I know it's shameful.

1014
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:10,720
No one really wants to see this, but that's the way the world really is, out there in some uncivilized places.

1015
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,840
And then you have a kiff-s voll.

1016
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:17,840
A what?

1017
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,500
Kiff-s voll.

1018
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,960
A sigh like Kif does.

1019
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:33,960
She's quoting that character on the cartoon show Futurama, which we heard a lot of Kif sighs at the beginning of the show after the Trump-Branigan.

1020
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,600
So, yeah.

1021
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:50,500
Well, tomorrow night, in the future, in another network, on another planet, there is then a vast debate between the contrarians.

1022
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,800
There's Greenstein.

1023
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,320
No, there's no Greenstein.

1024
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,940
They kept Greenstein out of there.

1025
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,360
Greenstein's not allowed to speak because Greenstein didn't get enough votes.

1026
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,220
Greenstein had to go back to the laboratory and be disassembled.

1027
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,240
And did the Libertarian also have to go to the laboratory?

1028
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:10,700
Both.

1029
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,760
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

1030
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,360
Both Greenstein and Steingreen.

1031
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,360
Both had to.

1032
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,200
They didn't get enough numbers.

1033
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,500
They don't get to talk.

1034
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,420
Well, when they do talk, they tend to say kind of dumb things.

1035
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,840
Like Aleppo.

1036
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,480
What's that?

1037
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,120
And what was the one today?

1038
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:35,940
Oh, they do?

1039
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:36,820
Yeah.

1040
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,260
One.

1041
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:37,580
Oh, yeah.

1042
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:37,580


1043
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,940
It was like, well, climate change.

1044
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,420
What do you think about that, Mr. Johnson?

1045
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,020
And it was, he goes, well, we need to get off this planet.

1046
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,360
That's why we have to go to outer space, because climate change.

1047
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,480
Well, nothing about fixing things.

1048
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,340
It was all, oh, well, let's just use this planet up and go to the next one.

1049
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,900
That's a great Libertarian science idea.

1050
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,360
So, what are you going to do?

1051
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,460
It's monsters everywhere you look.

1052
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,040
Clintonsteins, Greensteins, Steingreens.

1053
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,820
And President Johnson.

1054
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,720
And, oh.

1055
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,420
Rumpelstiltskin.

1056
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,200
Oh, yeah.

1057
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,080
I didn't know that that was a twirl.

1058
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,980
Yeah, Rumpelstiltskin.

1059
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,800
They're all over the place.

1060
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,640
I'm the golden stare.

1061
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:29,460
That's what Rumpelstiltskin used to say to the maiden in the tower.

1062
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,760
She would ask her to roll down her hair.

1063
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,980
And then we could vote for an independent.

1064
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:36,580
Independent candidate.

1065
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:45,240
Well, when we get to Texas, I'm going to get to work on my new phase of my career.

1066
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:52,160
One new phase is to spend fewer than two whole days on this weekly show,

1067
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,620
so I can get some other things done.

1068
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,360
I've got all these videos.

1069
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,900
Your book, Neighbor World, has to get published by the Subgenius Foundation.

1070
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,900
So, friends, stay tuned.

1071
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,360
We'll see more of that.

1072
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,120
But for now, believe it or not, Dave,

1073
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,860
it's just about the end of the show.

1074
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,300
I can't believe it's gone so quickly.

1075
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,860
Well, it's because the song that refuses to die refuses to die.

1076
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,900
And it's about to come back.

1077
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,460
I can smell it coming.

1078
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,200
I can smell it, too.

1079
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,480
I can smell it all the way here.

1080
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,440
Here, I'll leave you on, okay?

1081
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,880
I'll leave you on.

1082
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,380
We'll try to kill it.

1083
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,300
Let's try to kill it, okay?

1084
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,160
Oh, no.

1085
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,440
There it is.

1086
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:33,920
There it is.

1087
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:34,420
There it is.

1088
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:34,800
There it is.

1089
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,460
There it is.

1090
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,700
There it is.

1091
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,920
There it is.

1092
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,500
There it is.

1093
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,880
There it is.

1094
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,360
Let's see.

1095
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,620
Oh, man.

1096
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:11,240
I hated putting shovels, I hated putting shovels in the shovels.

1097
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,620
So gross!

1098
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,080
I hated doing that.

1099
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:24,820
I hated fucking up that, that shovel and I, I, I felt, I felt sorry for it.

1100
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,400
It never had a set off and it kept sinking!

1101
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,200
It would not die!

1102
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,540
It still would die!

1103
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,460
Look at it!

1104
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,020
It's disgusting!

1105
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,040
It's just driving the world in pain!

1106
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,720
But it's still a song!

1107
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,140
A painful song, yes.

1108
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,180
An unseemly song.

1109
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,600
And an immortal song!

1110
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,620
That's the whole song from now on!

1111
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,060
What a moment!

1112
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,920
It's still not dead.

1113
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,360
You thought it was dead.

1114
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,320
They tried to kill it so hard and it wouldn't die.

1115
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,780
Like that, that's the nature of it.

1116
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,700
I don't know about it.

1117
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,440
It's like it was dead.

1118
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,380
This song that never ended must have been.

1119
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:30,600
It's the end.

1120
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:35,160
A song that refused to die has to die.

1121
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,320
It's still one.

1122
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,040
But only for a second!

1123
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,560
And then it'll just keep on surging on.

1124
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,840
We know it will.

1125
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,000
That's what songs do.

1126
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,780
They just keep on throbbing on.

1127
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,140
So...

1128
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,220
I know it will!

1129
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,380
I have a flabbery and moist.

1130
00:57:55,580 --> 00:58:00,380
It's just, every, every blood vessel in my nurturing hectic park is just,

1131
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:00,380


1132
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,540
come undone.

1133
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,300
Oh no.

1134
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,520
I wish this song would just dry up and croak.

1135
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,980
Everybody wishes that.

1136
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:13,900
It's caused enough consternation over the last four weeks to wish I could just kill it with my own hands.

1137
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:14,880
But how could I?

1138
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,060
Because it's only a recording.

1139
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,640
Well, that's what, no, well, yes and no.

1140
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,440
The song that refuses to die is everywhere.

1141
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:26,440
It is.

1142
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,360
Sometimes it mimics, uh, a car, the sound of a car crash.

1143
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:34,140
Or a drawer full of silverware hitting the floor.

1144
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,660
Or the whiter dropping the plates.

1145
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,860
Those are the songs that refuse to die also.

1146
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,340
A box of mice causes consternation among the elderly as well.

1147
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,580
Or four or five people breaking wind simultaneously.

1148
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,260
That's a nasty song, man.

1149
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:58,860
Especially if they're trying to make, you know, great, great, great sailing ships move quickly.

1150
00:58:59,020 --> 00:58:59,600
Yes.

1151
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:00,920
Yes.

1152
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:01,480
Yes.

1153
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,400
That's a heckle way to make a sailing boat go, though.

1154
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,180
This is the part I always liked, though.

1155
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,260
With poofterism.

1156
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,260
White poofterism?

1157
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,660
Yes, with poofterism.

1158
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,860
There's also blue poofterism, too, which is very dangerous.

1159
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,920
Yes, I know, I know.

1160
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,820
Cosmos plug by balls.

1161
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,800
You can't see where you're going.

1162
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,340
Unless you've already been born.

1163
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:30,920
I've never been there before.

1164
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:39,080

Praise Bob!
