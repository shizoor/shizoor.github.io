1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,060
1, 2, 3, 4

2
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,120
I look mad

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,040
I look mad

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,580
And then the evening goes

5
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,140
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,040
You know what I am?

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,280
I'm a dog chasing cars.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,680
I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it.

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,400
You know, I just do things.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,940
I'm not a schemer.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,380
I try to show the schemers how pathetic

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,920
their attempts to control things really are.

13
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,840
He'd use the computer room

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,220
as if it were an amusement gallery.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,300
And a fully clothed man frozen to death in a shower.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,400
If the image wasn't so ugly, it'd be laughable.

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,080
Definitely not drugs or intoxication.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,940
The bioanalysis on the tapes proved that conclusively.

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,940
Could be some form of space madness we've never heard of.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,300
But I suspect I can no longer turn my back on Cadet Stinty.

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,860
The rigors of space travel have somehow twisted his mind.

22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,340
He's gone crazy.

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,820
He's gone crazy.

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:29,820


25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:29,820


26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,680
He's gone crazy.

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,540
Space madness.

28
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,840
Oh, my beloved ice cream bar.

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,440
How I love to lick your creamy center.

30
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,140
Ow.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,040
Ow.

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,600
Ow.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,060
And your oh-so-nutty chocolate covering.

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,460
You're not like the others.

35
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,800
You're like the...

36
00:01:59,800 --> 00:01:59,820
You're like the...

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,740
You're like the same things I do.

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,340
The crack papers.

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,880
The four-inch football leather.

40
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,100
The dog bread.

41
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,260
We're not hitchhiking anymore.

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,440
We're riding.

43
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,760
Stop it.

44
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,700
You're talking crazy.

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,220
It feels like your skin is being torn right off you

46
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,800
and then you ache all over and get sick and you can't breathe.

47
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,400
Your nose runs and you have a high fever and then you pass out.

48
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,640
But when you wake up, it starts all over again.

49
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,580
Under theיהw civilization.

50
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:30,580


51
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,780
The power of research.

52
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,700
Such a stupid, ghastly, tragic mistake.

53
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,860
All right, you listen to me.

54
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,360
Don't pay any attention to him.

55
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,700
He's drunk.

56
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,420
You sure?

57
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,620
Well, gymsh evet can cause a man to have visions.

58
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,780
It fits, too.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,220
What I can't figure out is how.

60
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,420
You, you, the tongue of death.

61
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,800
What? Why not?

62
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,800
What? Why not?

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:02:59,800


64
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:10,580
die you die fine yes you are the red guys died that's go anything else no hey oh you can see

65
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,420
the difference between a real cigarette and marijuana and there'd be no mistaking the

66
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:22,220
texture or contents if you were to handle them the darker one has been rolled in wheat straw paper

67
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:30,120
in most of the reefers a double thickness of paper is used now in the language the addicts

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:38,260
use among themselves marijuana is referred to as Mary Jane pot weed or tea they never say to

69
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:45,420
each other let's smoke a marijuana cigarette they say let's turn on or let's blast the joint

70

103
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,180


104
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,180


105
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,640

106
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,420

107
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,240
it's a hell of a battle

108
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,300
a little trouble

109
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,320
money

110
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,120
no

111
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,160
we face a little STEVE

112
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,160


113
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,160


114
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,160


115
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,020
Topic in the traffic

116
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,700
Open up the car, open up the car

117
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,060
Topic in the traffic

118
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,940
Low and near retake and bass crazy kickin' it

119
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,360
Open up the car, open up the car

120
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,980
Looking for a star like mine, you can't find it

121
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,360
Looking for a star like mine, you've been blinded

122
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,660
Looking for a star like mine, you can't find it

123
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:28,040
Looking for a star like mine, you've been blinded

124
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,220
Open up your morning light

125
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,820
And sing a little prayer for us

126
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,420
You know that if we all just stay alive

127
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,900
And see the peace that I feel

128
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,900
I grew up on the crime side, the New York time side

129
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,840
Stayin' alive was no job, had second hands

130
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,580
Moms bounced on old men

131
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,340
So they're all gonna be like me

132
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,800
Then we moved to Shaolin land

133
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,060
A young youth, you're rockin' the go-to

134
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,720
Low goose, only way I begin to G-York was drug loop

135
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,600
And let's start it like this, son

136
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,660
Rollin' with this one and that one

137
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,140
Pullin' out gats for fun

138
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,260
But it was just a dream for the team

139
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,140
Who was a fiend, started smokin' booze at 16

140
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,580
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits by eye stakes

141
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,660
Makin' my way off fire escapes

142
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,620
No question I was speed for cracks and weed

143
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,980
The combination made my eyes bleed

144
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,320
No question I was speed for cracks and weed

145
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,280
No question I was flow off and tried to get the girl off

146
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,460
Chicken up like boys on board boy

147
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,380
Forever, forever, forever, ever, forever, ever

148
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,440
You went to school to learn girls

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,520
Things you never, never do before

150
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,940
Why I ain't I for E except F for C

151
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,640
And Y2 plus 2 makes 4, na-na-na

152
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,300
I'm gonna teach you

153
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,760
All about love, yeah

154
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,120
Sit yourself down, take a seat

155
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,800
All you gotta do is repeat after me

156
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,860
Come on, come on, come on, let me show you what it's all about

157
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,240
Boy, that was a fun

158
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,660
devival we had in Amsterdam

159
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,040
with the Scandahoovians and the

160
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,660
other Euro-foreigners.

161
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,060
I loved

162
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,600
Dr. Howell in Seattle. I

163
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
was so glad that he was there.

164
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,720
It was fun to be there at that strange

165
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,140
devival.

166
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,840
Well, you're becoming quite the world traveler

167
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,920
now. Well, I have to

168
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,440
admit, whenever the

169
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,740
normal creepy bobbies

170
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,640
came up, I would go and stand

171
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,940
and say hello to Howell.

172
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,720
They were just so scared of Howell's impressive

173
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,600
intelligence that they would go away.

174
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,880
Oh, they are like

175
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,600
moths fluttering around

176
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,960
subgenius luminosity.

177
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,360
Yours as much as mine.

178
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,840
You know how I deal with the creepy bobbies?

179
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,420
Howell, get them off!

180
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,760
Get them off! Get them off! I lift up my video

181
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,360
camera and point it at them.

182
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,260
And suddenly the roles are reversed.

183
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:14,740
And they're like,

184
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,860
Oh, what are you doing?

185
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,140
I lift up my video cam from which

186
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,300
cometh my strength. But what are worse

187
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,160
are the ones that fall in love in front of

188
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,020
that camera? The ones that you point

189
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,540
making them go away and they go

190
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,100
boing, boing, boing.

191
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, am I going to be a YouTube

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,940
star? Yes.

193
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,320
I guess so.

194
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,540
Hey man, I'm going to put a cigarette

195
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,220
in my eye and do it in my ear and I'm

196
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,280
going to drink another beer.

197
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,100
There's a big fad

198
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,200
on YouTube of

199
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,120
youths doing

200
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,140
heavy drugs, especially

201
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,540
salvia lately, and filming themselves.

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,440
That occurs to me that they're not really

203
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,720
very forward-thinking youths.

204
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,580
They must not be planning to run for

205
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,500
president or get a job. They're feeling their

206
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,160
ways along, but it's true.

207
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,640
They do, they're so compromised

208
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,480
that maybe they're doing the good work

209
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,260
of when everyone is compromised,

210
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,580
no one can be compromised. When everybody is shown

211
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,180
on YouTube vomiting

212
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,020
salvia. Yeah, only a few.

213
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,180
Two sour, old, uptight

214
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,460
Jesuits will be the only ones

215
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,500
who haven't degraded themselves in front of

216
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,340
the entire world.

217
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,300
Then who was going to care

218
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,580
about propriety?

219
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,160
It was?

220
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,120
You know, the frop in Amsterdam was so

221
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,580
good that I forgot

222
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,620
to take videos. I still haven't come down.

223
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,420
The frop in Amsterdam was so good

224
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,460
that Ratnar has forgotten that he's not

225
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,500
in Amsterdam anymore and hasn't been

226
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,580
for months. Right, and I end up

227
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,180
having these bizarre dreams where I'm not going to be able to do anything.

228
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,120
Our Amsterdam kind of mixes

229
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,300
with Kentucky. Now that is

230
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,340
a curious analogy.

231
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,880
I'm getting back to KFC, the parlor.

232
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,720
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

233
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,400
That's a funny cigarette

234
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,520
they just handed me.

235
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,220
In Contuxter-dam?

236
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,920
In Contuxter-dam?

237
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,800
Or is it

238
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,700
Amsterdam-y?

239
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,180
A marijuana cigarette was found

240
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,920
on the floor of one of your classrooms.

241
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:11,900
And another

242
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,440
was found in the girls' gym.

243
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,120
And that's enough to start

244
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,740
a big crusade in Sanibel High?

245
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,060
Mr. Burroughs, please understand

246
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,180
Miss Williams, like many of us,

247
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,340
believes in the progressive theory

248
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,120
that there is no such thing

249
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,180
as a bad boy or girl.

250
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:29,820
Well,

251
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,240
there's a high school in Indiana.

252
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,260
I don't know whether they

253
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,120
followed your progressive theories or not.

254
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,860
They had no problem

255
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,860
three years ago.

256
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,060
But out of a total enrollment of

257
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,140
1,200 students,

258
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,480
285 were found to be using

259
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,700
marijuana or heroin.

260
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,240
And this dreadful condition

261
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,120
was only uncovered

262
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,640
through a horrible accident.

263
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,920
One student, desperate for money

264
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,840
to pay for his habit,

265
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,760
sold bennies for quarters and dimes

266
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,320
to kids in elementary school.

267
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,740
It was the death

268
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,260
of a 13-year-old

269
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,360
who had been addicted to marijuana

270
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,780
and then to heroin

271
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,020
that exposed the ugly facts.

272
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,760
But by that time,

273
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,640
it was too late for 41 teenagers

274
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,600
who were addicted.

275
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,620
It can happen here.

276
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,400
Oh!

277
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,120
Hey, what's going on around here?

278
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:24,960
Whoa!

279
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,200
And Bob Frown went around all big

280
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,800
and said,

281
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,540
they can be

282
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,580
So he puffed and he puffed

283
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,640
until he choked.

284
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,380
And he choked and he choked

285
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,740
until he puffed.

286
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,540
And he bobbed up his joke.

287
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,180
A lonesome character,

288
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,720
Cowboy Dave.

289
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,500
They're all mangled up by

290
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,880
Lean Murr, who also did our titles.

291
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,200
And this is our annual

292
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,600
educational space madness

293
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,680
drug war show.

294
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,820
Before the lesson there,

295
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,400
we heard some radio synesthesia

296
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,960
from WCSB Cleveland

297
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,820
with host Dr. Sinister,

298
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,500
callers Priestess Pisces,

299
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

300
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,320
Dr. Howe, Governor Rocknar,

301
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,040
Nomany Mark, and yours truly

302
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,000
on WCSB,

303
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,480
Cleveland.

304
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,600
I'll say that word again.

305
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,340
WCSB Cleveland.

306
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,700
Prior to that,

307
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,920
that great mashup is by Girl Talk.

308
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,720
See MySpace slash Girl Talk Music

309
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,500
for more on that amazing individual.

310
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,460
That's actually one person cutting up

311
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,940
millions of other people.

312
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,880
Lee Murr and I collaged the opening

313
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,380
to the show, you might say,

314
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,720
opening the ears, eye.

315
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,800
Uh,

316
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,040
but it is the psycho skeletons

317
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,020
who perform this homage called

318
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,400
I Love You Special K.

319
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,220
Yes, certainly.

320
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,080
You might understand exactly how I feel

321
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,360
But you don't care, I know

322
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,280
That's what I'd love you to do

323
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,060
Special K, Special K,

324
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,420
Special K,

325
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,020
Special K gives you half of what you deserve

326
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,460
All those minerals and vitamins

327
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,820
is the great test

328
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,680
Would you also like some strips

329
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,900
of bacon and fruit to finish it off

330
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,180
Or perhaps you'd like a medium cup of coffee

331
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,180
Special K, Special K,

332
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,740
Special K gives you half of what you deserve

333
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,280
All those minerals and vitamins

334
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,160
Is the greatest

335
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,460
Would you also like some taste

336
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,620
Would you also like some strong

337
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,000
Or perhaps you'd like a medium cup of coffee

338
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,240
Citizen of the mutually assured revolution

339
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,000
Be nine and be kind

340
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,180
You went too far and forgot where you parked your car

341
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,940
Pain, disease, slavery, war

342
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,480
You say you wanna eat your Special K

343
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,240
Right this way

344
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,960
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup

345
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,160
Special K, Special K, Special K

346
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,880
They say it's women's food but will it make you gay

347
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,600
No

348
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,200
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup

349
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,160
Hup

350
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,180
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup

351
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,620
Hup

352
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,660
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup

353
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,080
Special, Special K

354
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,640
Thank you.

355
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,120
Thank you.

356
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,440
Thank you.

357
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,560
Thank you.

358
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,300
Thank you.

359
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,540
Thank you.

360
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,940
Thank you.

361
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,680
Thank you.

362
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,840
Thank you.

363
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,240
Thank you.

364
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:19,980
Thank you.

365
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,060
Thank you.

366
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,680
Thank you.

367
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,120
Thank you.

368
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,800
Thank you.

369
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,200
I'm sorry.

370
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,140
I'm sorry.

371
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,680
I'm sorry.

372
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,100
I'm sorry.

373
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,840
I'm sorry.

374
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,660
From PR News in Washington.

375
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,840
I am Iron Man.

376
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,360
I am Iron Man.

377
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,640
I am Iron Man.

378
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,760
I am Iron Man.

379
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,160
I am Iron Man.

380
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,720
I first dropped acid when I was 18.

381
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,780
I was over at these people's house one night.

382
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,580
This guy I went to school with was over there and asked me if I wanted to try some acid.

383
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,180
I had read about it in the newspapers and heard a few friends talk about it, so I was curious.

384
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,120
I was pretty jacked up on marijuana, so I decided to try it.

385
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,200
And I dropped it.

386
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,540
I don't know what I was waiting for, a flash or a rush or whatever,

387
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,420
but I kept sitting there waiting and waiting and nothing was happening.

388
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:13,900
So I got up and then went to the dresser and put on a pair of pink capris and a green and brown blouse.

389
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,780
I thought the colors were beautiful.

390
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:21,440
So we tripped down to Market Street and I decided to buy a hot dog.

391
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,740
I was very hungry.

392
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,240
And I had put mustard and ketchup and relish in the usual.

393
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,700
And I put the hot dog up to my mouth and somebody started screaming.

394
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,020
I didn't know what was happening, so I looked up at my friend Terry and said,

395
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,140
Did you hear that?

396
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,580
Didn't you hear someone scream?

397
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,960
He said no.

398
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,220
I got the hot dog up to my mouth again and I was ready to bite.

399
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,340
And the scream got louder and it hit me.

400
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,760
No, it couldn't be.

401
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,500
And I looked down at the hot dog and there was a face on him.

402
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,600
Eyes, nose, a mouth.

403
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,420
I had put the ketchup to where it looked like his hair.

404
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,040
And he started telling me that I couldn't eat him,

405
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,780
that he had a wife and seven kids at home to support.

406
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,400
And I stood there with this hot dog and asked Terry,

407
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,760
Do you know this hot dog is talking to me?

408
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,780
And he says,

409
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,280
Nah, let's get out of here.

410
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,820
He thought I was just faking.

411
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,800
And I told him,

412
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,420
Look at the thing, he's got a face.

413
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,540
And he's screaming.

414
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,060
And the guy finally looked over and he got on the same trip that I was on.

415
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,140
And we sat there carrying on a conversation with that hot dog.

416
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,560
Finally, I decided I was just hallucinating,

417
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,480
so I put it in my mouth and bit down.

418
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,720
It screamed so loud that you could hear it all over town.

419
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,280
So I had to throw it on the ground and step on it.

420
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,300
And I was jumping on this hot dog in the middle of Market Street.

421
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,400
I realized that I had murdered it.

422
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,260
And I took off screaming down the street, scared.

423
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:25,020
I was reallyquaossed.

424
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,400
..

425
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:25,760
So my wife calls me.

426
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:25,780
My mom tells my dad something.

427
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:25,780


428
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:25,780


429
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:25,860
I got away with it, so six guys struck me all the time.

430
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,180
And me and my wife?

431
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,960
We beyond heart were told to結 agriculture

432
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,220
Where's AP?

433
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,880
C'day.

434
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,620
commaggio

435
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,740
intelligence

436
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:06,740


437
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,760
resources

438
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,760
就是

439
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,000
Thank you.

440
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,540
Thank you.

441
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,080
Thank you.

442
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,720
Thank you.

443
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,960
Thank you.

444
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,140
Thank you.

445
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,460
a corporate state.

446
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,660
Blogs, I always wanted to just call...

447
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,240
You can flog your blog,

448
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,180
but they're more fun to write

449
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,360
than they are to read, generally.

450
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,400
Oh, yeah.

451
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,040
There aren't enough hours in the day

452
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,200
to read such an enormous teetering tower

453
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,580
of bitching and whining.

454
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,900
Oh, absolutely.

455
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,900
But it is...

456
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,920
The nice thing about reading

457
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,560
other people's blogs a lot of times

458
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,140
is that their trifles

459
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,760
are so much more interesting

460
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,440
than your own.

461
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,540
And when you read about their discontent,

462
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,120
you feel strangely comfortable.

463
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,580
You feel comfortable yourself.

464
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:07,960
Exactly.

465
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,280
Sometimes you find out

466
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,440
that there are powerful beings

467
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,560
from another dimension

468
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,500
that are secretly controlling your mind.

469
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,780
That's really screwed up.

470
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,520
I'd hate to think

471
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,260
what they pay for their internet connection.

472
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,540
Oh, yeah.

473
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,620
What makes you think they pay?

474
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,580
I think we pay.

475
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,680
I think we're all being mind-controlled

476
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,400
by existential aliens

477
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,180
from you-know-where.

478
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,920
Well, here's the thing.

479
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,620
With the mind-control state,

480
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,760
the key is really to fill your mind

481
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,100
with misguidedness

482
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,620
and misleading garbage.

483
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,520
So let your mind wander

484
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,720
through misleading things

485
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,700
and then the mind-control

486
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,040
sort of short-circuit.

487
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,880
Well, all roads lead to Rome.

488
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,260
You can wander through thickets of error,

489
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,940
but as long as you keep a-moving,

490
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,340
you'll eventually find your way

491
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,720
out of the labyrinth

492
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,760
and be better than before

493
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,620
for the journey.

494
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
Well, all trails...

495
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,440
Except for all those thorn punctures.

496
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,500
The misleading things

497
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,620
all lead to Bob.

498
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,100
All roads lead to Dobbs, too.

499
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,100
Do you think Bob tried...

500
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,940
No, Bob simply succeeds.

501
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,480
I think that Bob should be represented

502
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,340
on the door

503
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,480
that it's leading to him

504
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,380
where you go there

505
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,940
with, like, little bones underneath

506
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,560
and his head is like the skull

507
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,180
in that one.

508
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,580
Ooh, this is getting spooky.

509
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,700
That's a scary door.

510
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,720
I don't know whether I want to go through that door.

511
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,640
No, the road has gone through you

512
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,500
in many more ways than you can think of.

513
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,980
At least in this parallel world.

514
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,140
Some of them are...

515
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,200
What's the opposite of parallel?

516
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,420
Parallels are weird.

517
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,020
I prefer, um...

518
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,200
Usually, the parallelogram, for example,

519
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,680
kind of freaks me out.

520
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,660
I hate being in parallel hell

521
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,740
and not even know it.

522
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,900
Then there's the perpendiculargrams.

523
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,700
Oh, man, those guys really suck.

524
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,780
I think they should not let them go to school

525
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,580
or to have jobs.

526
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,580
But who was in control of the school on the jobs?

527
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,640
Those perpendicular dickheads.

528
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,500
No yeti left behind.

529
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,400
It sure ain't Bob.

530
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,620
It's the perpendicular dickheads.

531
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,180
They've been perps for years

532
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,400
and now it's about time...

533
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,640
It's time for them to do the perp walk.

534
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:06,840
Yeah.

535
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,140
Backward.

536
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,560
I'm supposed to give a message to Sinister

537
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,320
from...

538
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,020
Oh, let's have it.

539
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,020
Oh, yeah?

540
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
...that he has...

541
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,940
is releasing another...

542
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,020
Another what?

543
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:18,760
Excellent.

544
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,680
He's releasing another conflict.

545
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,140
He's releasing a...

546
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,120
It's a conflict.

547
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,400
...cloud of unknowing.

548
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,460
It's very conflicted, yes.

549
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,680
I would say conflicted.

550
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,340
But then, if you know two beans, basically,

551
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,220
there is a conflict there,

552
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,500
a conflict of worlds.

553
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,060
Maybe...

554
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,400
Maybe those parallelograms...

555
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,820
Those parallelograms are affecting him.

556
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,300
I should probably keep an eye out

557
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,860
for any parallel...

558
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,220
Watch out for the trapezoids, too.

559
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:41,960
...things going on in my household.

560
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,600
Priestess Pisces

561
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,760
on Radio Synesthesia WCSB

562
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,840
with host Dr. Sinister,

563
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,860
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

564
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,260
Governor Rocknar,

565
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,880
Dr. Hal Robbins,

566
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,960
Nomany Mark,

567
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,100
and others.

568
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,500
And before that...

569
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,120
What?

570
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,740
Oh!

571
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,600
A little clip from Schizopolis.

572
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,280
And before that,

573
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,560
a sorry blues there,

574
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,320
warped by Lee Murr.

575
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,860
And the voices,

576
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,220
the weird, weird, weird, weird voices

577
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,560
that made you think, like,

578
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,980
you took too much or heard too much,

579
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,820
that was also by Ogo Dis,

580
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,140
or Dice, or whatever.

581
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,560
Um...

582
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,460
But now, we're going to go back to X-Day,

583
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,760
and where they holler for Philo's head.

584
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,400
Bring us Philo's head.

585
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,320
We may launch it, they say.

586
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,940
Bring us Philo's head,

587
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,960
so we may launch it.

588
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,840
That's old subgenius stuff.

589
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,720
We don't do that head-launching stuff anymore.

590
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,040
I was wondering if we could kneecap launch.

591
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,340
No, we're not going to stop anybody

592
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,720
from launching a head.

593
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,680
It just doesn't have our imprimatur anymore.

594
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:54,900
Right.

595
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,120
Well, the, um...

596
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:57,780
Uh...

597
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,700
The apostate, Jane or Hypercleets,

598
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,380
really is the only person

599
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,700
who should be launching Arnold Palmer heads.

600
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,400
And...

601
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,540
And so he does.

602
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,060
Right.

603
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,640
But not where I...

604
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,740
Not under my watch, no.

605
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,320
No.

606
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,080
Let's leave that to right where it's laying.

607
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,820
Many are called, but few are chosen.

608
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,080
And some fall by the wayside,

609
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,900
and some of the chaff is burned in the furnace

610
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,540
after the tares are gathered.

611
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,380
Yeah.

612
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:26,740
Cool.

613
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,940
clean Fuckin' O O W Wrangles

614
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,980
F Önőty

615
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:51,980


616
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:51,980


617
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,560
It was학교

618
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,920
I haven't heard you talk for like 20 minutes.

619
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,880
Pick a song ut you can't handle it.

620
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,260
a record

621
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,420
Somebody

622
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,320
call a lawyer

623
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,440
I need to

624
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,920
find it

625
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:14,980
Somebody's

626
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,840
whiplash

627
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,400
blindsided

628
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,920
rear-ended

629
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,540
Somebody

630
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,460
call a priest

631
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:23,980
I'm the

632
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,340
lost wise man

633
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,560
from the east

634
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,480
and I got

635
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,080
to town

636
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,980
long after

637
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,620
the party

638
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,020
ended

639
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,860
Somebody

640
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,380
call a

641
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:35,720
wrecker

642
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,220
Somebody

643
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,780
call a wrecker

644
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:11,900
Somebody

645
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,940
call a wrecker

646
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,180
Somebody

647
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,320
call a junk man

648
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,200
Never lived in my heart

649
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,240
but a tin can

650
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,820
And it's banging

651
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,540
like a string

652
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,400
going leaking

653
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,100
like a city

654
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,720
It'll be a miracle

655
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:33,820
It'll be a miracle

656
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:33,820


657
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,960
if I live

658
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,340
Somebody

659
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,200
call a wrecker

660
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,100
Somebody

661
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,320
call a wrecker

662
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,360
Somebody

663
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,440
call a wrecker

664
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,360
Call a wrecker

665
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,860
Bob Walkenhorst

666

667
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,480
called The Beginner

668
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,260

671
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,580
See, madness,

672
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,400
as you know,

673
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,760
is like gravity.

674
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,780
All it takes

675
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,260
is a little push.

676
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,040
Ha ha ha ha ha

677
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,560
Ha ha ha ha ha

678
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,080
Oh

Ha ha ha ha ha

681
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,080
Ha ha ha ha ha

682
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,100
Ha ha ha ha ha

683
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,720
Ha ha ha ha ha

684
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,680
Ah ha ha ha a

685
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,400
Take Scooby,

686
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:41,920
I did it

687
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:41,980
Oh do I

688
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:41,980


689
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:41,980


690
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:41,980


691
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,640
Just like

692
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:42,960
Just like

693
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:42,960


694
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,440
On my

695
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,280
All the fucking

696
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,860
My friends

697
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,460
the one who

698
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:49,740
fucking

699
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,300
right here

700
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:50,480
They

701
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:50,720
gotta

702
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,360
remember

703
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,760
There

704
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:51,900
where

705
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:51,900


706
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,200
be

707
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,840
Closer

708
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:53,840


709
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:53,840


710
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,200
TV hard

711
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,480
I'm taking the time to fuck

712
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,620
Take a touch with my soul

713
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,140
I'm taking the time to fuck

714
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,360
I'm taking the fucking human

715
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,580
I'm getting ready to bring myself

716
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,860
I'm getting ready to be human

717
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,160
To be human

718
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,220
To be human

719
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,540
To be human

720
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,600
To be human

721
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:55,600
I'm taking the time to fuck

722
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,260
Take a touch with my soul

723
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:56,260


724
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:56,260


725
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:56,260


726
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,360
OKDES, channeling the amino acids

727
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,780
There

728
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,180
OKDES, channeling the amino acids

729
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,680
it seems like, for a second.

730
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,840
A song called

731
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,040
Navel Sounds Like Whales

732
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,960
Clubbing Baby Cigarettes

733
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,900
in Kabul.

734
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,920
Has anybody seen the new

735
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,880
Jack T. Chick movie that both

736
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,260
Stang and I are in?

737
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,000
I have not. I was actually going to mention

738
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,800
Jack Chick, though, because on one of my

739
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,200
recent road trips to

740
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,680
pretty much banjo country

741
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,900
Virginia, I stopped at

742
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,800
a rest stop because I got

743
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,920
distracted because somebody was doing a Civil War

744
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,660
reenactment and kind of threw me off.

745
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,960
That can be distracting

746
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,600
when those mini balls come whistling.

747
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,740
Yeah, and so I pulled off

748
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,900
into this rest area and I noticed

749
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,500
in the map holder

750
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,520
there was a Chick track, and so then I looked

751
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,660
and in the other map holder on the other side there was

752
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,740
another, and it was like an Easter egg

753
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,720
on a Chick track. A beloved soul winner

754
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,420
Easter egg. I want to go on a

755
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,380
big tour of the South leaving

756
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,960
the Cthulhu

757
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,620
Chick track everywhere. Chicks are

758
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,860
attracted to Chick tracks.

759
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,880
That's right. Chick tracks

760
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,520
get red.

761
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,960
Cthulhu's attracted to graveyards and heavy

762
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,100
scents. But seriously, there's

763
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,220
a long documentary

764
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,260
about the life and works

765
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,080
of Jack Chick and his associates,

766
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,120
the artists and

767
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,020
flim-flam

768
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,060
men, rapists that he associated

769
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,400
with. Yes, these creationists

770
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,100
the guy who talks

771
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,780
about how there were only 30 dinosaurs

772
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,080
and they were all on Noah's Ark.

773
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,720
That guy turns out to be

774
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,780
well dipping his wick

775
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,520
where society doesn't sanction.

776
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,700
So is he now on one of the late

777
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,620
night slumber psychic

778
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,700
parties and stuff where each one of them

779
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,020
have to remove their masks at different times?

780
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:43,240
He's dead.

781
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,360
What is the title of this film?

782
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,160
Well, it's called God's Cartoonist.

783
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,680
And then the subtitle is

784
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,480
well, I've got it in my bag.

785
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,520
That would be Michelangelo, wouldn't it?

786
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,920
He sent me a copy of it two weeks ago

787
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,120
and I still haven't seen it.

788
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,460
I figured I'll watch it on my

789
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,800
escape vessel when I've

790
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,680
got more time.

791
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,400
Have you ever seen Michelangelo's Underground Porn?

792
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,160
You'd have plenty of time for that, boy.

793
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,480
Oh, all of that stuff was porn.

794
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,380
Now, are we featured in the new

795
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,760
Bill Maher movie, Religious?

796
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,400
What?

797
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,140
Well, we're

798
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,000
featured on the Religious website

799
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,140
that Bill Maher has.

800
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,140
Get off of here, or don't.

801
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,600
Well, we're featured

802
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,740
under Miscellaneous Other Religions

803
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,160
right next to the

804
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,440
Flying Spaghetti Monster.

805
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,700
Oh, my God.

806
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,740
Has it come to this?

807
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,080
Do we have to declare war?

808
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,700
And we don't have any meatballs.

809
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,880
But we still got the big cheese.

810
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,400
I have one.

811
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,740
Well, I thought you were the big cheese

812
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,060
and we're going to say something about it.

813
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,120
That Flying Spaghetti Monster is kind of

814
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,340
Cthulhoid in appearance.

815
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,900
It gives me a feeling of unease.

816
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,880
People are laughing and joking

817
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,920
and yawking it up.

818
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,040
They won't laugh on that side of their mouth

819
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,420
when they feel those pasta tendrils

820
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,320
creepily sliding around their necks.

821
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,480
They won't even have that

822
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,260
I've been touched inappropriately

823
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,280
by his noodley appendage.

824
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,660
Anyway, the Chick movie is called

825
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,140
God's Cartoonist, The Comic Crusade

826
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,280
of Jack Chick.

827
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,380
Directed by

828
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,360
Papa Joe Mama.

829
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,320
Which name should we use?

830
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,420
Papa Joe Mama.

831
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,120
Jack Chick doesn't know that

832
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,920
the Papa Joe Mama of the subgenius

833
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,060
was that nice, polite young man

834
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,080
who interviewed him, I don't think.

835
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,320
Until this moment.

836
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,140
Maybe Jack doesn't know.

837
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,340
Because I know Jack listens to Radio Synesthesia.

838
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,400
Oh, he does?

839
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,120
With his tongue in his cheek while the rest of his mouth

840
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,280
was being removed when he was talking to the chicken?

841
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,280
If you ask Bernie, you'd think...

842
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,800
I should be upset that I've parodied his tracks

843
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,620
many times.

844
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,340
Those tracks are a great format.

845
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,320
New parodies come out all the time.

846
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,860
Droppings are better than actual tracks

847
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,180
because you can smell them.

848
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,980
But we're all headed the same direction.

849
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,860
Well, those are his digestive tracks.

850
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,200
It's different.

851
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,440
From the religious ones.

852
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,100
I would imagine that digesting

853
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,600
the Chick track would be difficult.

854
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,400
You may want to add, maybe soak it in some

855
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:08,680
vinegar.

856
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,620
They need to make a digested edition

857
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,900
of the Chick tracks, actually.

858
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:13,800
There's a story that

859
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,520
cartoonist Dan Klaus

860
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,420
took LSD and he sat on his bed

861
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,440
reading a huge pile of Chick tracks

862
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,540
and by morning he was ready

863
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,060
to convert.

864
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,900
Fortunately, he came down.

865
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,480
I've been there.

866
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,200
I mean, a good Jimmy Swaggart

867
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,300
rant will almost turn you.

868
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,860
It's so internally consistent

869
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,700
that you've got to watch out, you know.

870
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,360
Except for these bogus religions.

871
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,140
Some of those preachers

872
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,660
know who's listening.

873
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,720
Swaggart would often go,

874
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,660
you but television, watching for fun,

875
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,180
smoking on that joint.

876
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,360
You think this is funny.

877
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,580
And I'm going, oh my God.

878
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,220
He's in the spirit.

879
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,780
He knows it's me.

880
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,920
He can see.

881
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,380
You're not going to think

882
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,200
it's so funny when the flames

883
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,020
of hell are looking at your behind.

884
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,980
Sure we will, because they'll only

885
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,680
be speeding us on our way up

886
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,700
into the welcoming blackness

887
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,540
of outer space.

888
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,320
I would welcome any flame

889
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,860
were licking my behind right now.

890
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,520
Now let's keep it clean.

891
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,820
Is it that cold outside?

892
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,280
It's going to be tonight.

893
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,500
It's going to drop down

894
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,640
to the freezing cold of outer space.

895
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,240
Now see, that proves it ain't

896
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,340
global warming.

897
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,020
That's a hoax.

898
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,740
It was cold today.

899
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,900
But what about global warming?

900
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,420
We're all going to be stuck

901
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,800
in a vacuum just like that

902
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,920
Colombian coffee can.

903
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,040
We'll have air for a while.

904
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,680
It's not going to be good air, though.

905
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,060
Church air, one soul per breath.

906
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,960
You don't need that soul, friend.

907
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,800
And I should add that the

908
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,720
Jack Chick movie, God's Cartoonist,

909
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,260
is in fact great.

910
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,340
I saw it, and it is a

911
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,680
laugh-out-loud gut blowout

912
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,260
directed by Kurt Kirsteiner.

913
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:57,880
I saw it, and it is a

914
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,880
For more information on that DVD,

915
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,420
see monsterwax.com.

916
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,700
That's monsterwax.com.

917
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,700
The music in the background, by the way,

918
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,660
is Einstein's Secret Orchestra

919
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,860
from Witch Disco.

920
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,560
Out of print.

921
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,320
And now, Lonesome Cowboy Dave

922
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,240
shows off his double-mean baby head

923
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,240
to the video camera.

924
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,940
I'm growing a double-mean baby head.

925
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:25,820
Huh?

926
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,540
I'm growing a double-mean,

927
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,500
baby head.

928
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,100
It's still there.

929
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,040
The mean baby head is still there?

930
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,200
Yeah, it's growing out the back of my neck.

931
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,780
Yeah, I don't blame you for keeping it.

932
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,960
It's coming out the side, right here.

933
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,320
Keep that hood on.

934
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,900
That's what I wanted to...

935
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,440
I was trying to look outside,

936
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,320
underneath my ear.

937
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,640
I thought I heard it mumbling.

938
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,260
No, that was me.

939
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,160
It bothered me still,

940
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,940
because people are trying to use the right words.

941
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,540
Trying to say the right thing,

942
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,160
and I don't see the word.

943
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,060
You know,

944
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,700
you know,

945
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,300
you didn't place like an emergency room right here?

946
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,720
Sherman Fire Department.

947
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,540
There's a drool stain on the...

948
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,200
There's a lot of drool stains on the back of the hood

949
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,300
where it's been...

950
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:11,700
Sherman.

951
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,880
It's trying to...

952
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,800
It was trying to chew its way through the back.

953
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,680
Yeah, I could tell.

954
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,040
It looks...

955
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,600
I could feel it moving around

956
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,800
and telling it down.

957
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,140
Down on this side.

958
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:22,720
See?

959
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,900
Now I make my...

960
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,620
This kind of motion.

961
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,740
Do you have a history of this?

962
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,480
In your family?

963
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,560
No, no, no.

964
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,700
I ain't got no family.

965
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,760
You're the only one.

966
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,880
Yeah, I'm the only one.

967
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:33,380
Probably.

968
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,120
I got a pretty long history of it.

969
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,120
For the best.

970
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,320
Go back to...

971
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:37,960
No.

972
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:38,960
I don't know.

973
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:39,700
Go to your...

974
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,160
Mm-hmm.

975
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,520
Huh.

976
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:44,800
Huh.

977
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,060

wasted and everybody's drinking on the job. The garbage man got trashed. The janitor got messy.

986
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:53,720
The taxi driver got smashed and the waitress, she got tipsy. In Kansas City, New York City,

987
00:52:53,720 --> 00:53:03,700
great big city, itty bitty city now. Everybody's drunk and everybody's wasted

988
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:08,880
and everybody's drinking on the job.

989
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:22,060
Well, there's a whole lot of places that I ain't been, a whole lot of things that I ain't seen,

990
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,700
a whole lot of things that I ain't seen.

991
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:32,380
There's a whole lot of things I'll never be. The generation that would change the world is still looking for its car keys.

992
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:19,200
The terrorists got bombed. The president got hit. Security was tight. Yeah, the Secret Service got lit.

993
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:23,040
The FBI, CIA.

994
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,500
The DWI, USA.

995
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:36,920
Everybody's drunk and everybody's wasted and everybody's stoned.

996
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,840
And there's nothing that's gonna change it.

997
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:52,800
Cause everybody's drunk and everybody's wasted and everybody's drinking on the job.

998
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,560
And there's nothing that's gonna change it.

999
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,320
The Rainmakers. Everybody's drunk and everybody's listening to this show, The Hour of Slack.

1000
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:38,200
For more information on everything, especially J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius and archives of this show,

1001
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,680
see subgenius.com.

1002
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,560
And what's left is...

1003
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,660
Leemurg and Bob on the loose at X-Day.

1004
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:58,640
A councilman from Dearborn, Michigan is outraged over a 911 call.

1005
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:06,260
He wants to know why no charges have been filed against a police officer who admits to confiscating marijuana from suspects and then baking it in brownies.

1006
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,160
And once he and his wife were full and high, they thought they'd overdosed and called 911.

1007
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,100
I think I'm having an overdose at a school with my wife.

1008
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,360
Overdose of what?

1009
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:20,120
Marijuana. But I don't know if it had something in it. Can you please send rescue?

1010
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,900
Do you guys have fever or anything?

1011
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,700
No, I'm just... I think I'm having a fever.

1012
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,300
I think we're dying.

1013
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,380
How much did you guys have?

1014
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,240
I don't know. We made brownies. And I think we're dead.

1015
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,800
Time is going by really, really, really, really slow.

1016
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,360
Well, instead of being charged...

1017
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,000
Perla.

1018
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:38,700
Sorry.

1019
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,140
Instead of being charged, the police department let the officer resign.

1020
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:47,000
His wife was not charged either. So far, police officials have not commented on the case.

1021
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,700
Oh, I didn't hear nothing.

1022
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,180
Listen.

1023
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:49,780
Now listen.

1024
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,560
Just listen.

1025
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,000
Well?

1026
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:53,680
The thing for us to do is to...

1027
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,680
We're going to barricade ourselves in this room.

1028
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:55,680
Sure. Suits me.

1029
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,120
Hey.

1030
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,900
Stand to the right of the door. Stand to the left of the door. Stand directly in front.

1031
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:02,840
Then open the door.

1032
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,400
Yes?

1033
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,080
Wait a minute.

1034
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:08,940
Oh, no.

1035
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,420
Any of you smell anything?

1036
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,900
You mean that funny smell?

1037
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,840
What? We smell just like an... an animal?

1038
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,300
That's it.

1039
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,380
I know what that signifies.

1040
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,140
So do you.

1041
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,660
Odor of predatory animals.

1042
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,380
Exactly.

1043
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,000
Well, what are the physical characteristics?

1044
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,500
Oh, I...

1045
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:23,680
You know, I...

1046
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:23,680


1047
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:23,680


1048
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:23,680


1049
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:23,680


1050
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:23,680


1051
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:23,680


1052
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,500
Long, slender, pointed fingers.

1053
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:25,720
Oh?

1054
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:26,280
What else?

1055
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,540
Eyebrows meeting across the nose.

1056
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,040
Oh.

1057
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,320
Sharp, pointed, elongated front teeth.

1058
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,040
Like mine?

1059
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,400
Tendency towards an airy body.

1060
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:35,940
Oh.

1061
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:36,640
You...

1062
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,640
You mean...

1063
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,500
Wheating cheese and a tough kind of curly hair.

1064
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,280
Oh, please. Please.

1065
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,760
Go on, Professor.

1066
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:50,300
Stupid black fangs and smelling foully of tobacco smoke and stale beer.

1067
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:50,900
Oh.

1068
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,440
I'm glad.

1069
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,600
Undo me in the back.

1070
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,080
I'll have to take my dress off.

1071
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,380
Well, I...

1072
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,960
I just got out of fresh underskirt.

1073
00:57:59,020 --> 00:57:59,600
Yeah, take it off.

1074
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,180
Yes.

1075
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:00,900
All right.

1076
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:02,380
What...

1077
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,340
Would that do?

1078
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,320
Here, let me see.

1079
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:04,920
Hmm.

1080
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,040
That needs immediate attention.

1081
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,780
Unbutton the flap and get vile.

1082
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:10,640
Hmm.

1083
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:18,200
And I believe that concludes this two and a half hours or so of slack.

1084
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,820
And please, look at your arms right now.

1085
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,420
All right, hold your arms.

1086
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1087
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1088
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1089
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1090
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1091
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1092
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1093
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1094
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1095
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1096
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1097
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1098
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,420


1099
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,180
Hold your arms above your head, everyone, please.

1100
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,960
Look around you in the...

1101
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,940
In the group.

1102
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,780
Anyone you see without a wristband on...

1103
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,560
Kill them.

1104
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:38,520
They have to be right here next to Princess We right now and get them there.

1105
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,880
Will you please shut down the system?

1106
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,120
Okay.

1107
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,360
Okay.

1108
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,240
Okay.

1109
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:49,780


1110
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:50,320


1111
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,120
All right.
