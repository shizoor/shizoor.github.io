1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,640
And it comes down the street like a garbage wagon.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,320
Okay.

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,020
So their brains may live on forever.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,100
Or has he created another?

5
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,760
We know now that in the early years of the 20th century,

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,140
this world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man.

7
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,840
The U.S. Navy

8
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,960
has recently reported unknown aircraft

9
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,100
performing impossible maneuvers

10
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,620
at impossible speeds.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,820
And being controlled by unknown actors.

12
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,020
The Wicked Truth.

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,500
That is the Wicked Truth.

14
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,100
The Wicked Truth.

15
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,720
Unknown aircraft.

16
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,580
The Wicked Truth.

17
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:29,980
The Wicked Truth.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,340
Being controlled by unknown actors.

19
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,420
Impossible maneuvers at impossible speeds.

20
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,280
These objects display abilities far beyond any technology known to man.

21
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,340
Inclusion between the elevators on both приises.

22
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,360
Then all devices control themselves.

23
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:13,400
Misdreavus possible advantage.

24
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,820
Incompatibility.

25
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,360
パンフラム, the lines on theoba's frame.

26
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,360


27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Therefore.

28
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,000
The United States Navy

29
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,520
has recently reported unknown aircraft

30
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,900
performing impossible maneuvers at impossible speeds,

31
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,040
being controlled by unknown actors.

32
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,620
That is the wicked truth.

33
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,440
Ah, yes, dear friends.

34
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,980
And that was the band called Super Hornets.

35
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Which includes our friend, Reverend Joseph Gutarski,

36
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,260
who has had other songs on this show,

37
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,920
but credited to his human street name.

38
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,880
And this show is Hour of Slack number 1746.

39
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,840
This one being produced in Cleveland,

40
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,440
but not at WCSB because, well,

41
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,800
another couple of little setbacks

42
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,900
set our final move to Texas back.

43
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:54,820
Another.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,580
After two weeks.

45
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,960
And I keep injuring myself.

46
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,040
I'm sitting in a neck brace again,

47
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,260
recording myself in a nearly emptied office

48
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,180
on a mini recorder.

49
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,540
And my back hurts.

50
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,320
Luckily, we have hours of as-yet-unplayed radio

51
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,980
recorded from last X-Day drill

52
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,040
and also from the X-Day drill of 2017,

53
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,520
which is what we'll be hearing next.

54
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,720
This particular one being mostly,

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,720
the redoubtable Dr. Hal,

56
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,180
the insurmountable Reverend Dr. Uncle,

57
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,840
Onan Canabite,

58
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,740
and the indefinable Reverend Fanboy.

59
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,480
Man, you're pirates.

60
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
Your shanty song was great.

61
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,040
Thank you, sir.

62
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,980
That was so much fun.

63
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,040
Wonderful.

64
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,460
I'm glad it was appreciated.

65
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,320
Well, and you had a good crowd,

66
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,340
and two cameras shot that.

67
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,020
Fantastic.

68
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,220
Not that I'll necessarily ever get copies of any of it.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,420
The tradition has been,

70
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,660
when documentary crews come out here and shoot X-Day

71
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,900
and decide to make a movie,

72
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,300
we never see them again.

73
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,540
That's happened twice.

74
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,880
I don't think that's going to happen this time.

75
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,940
Well, why don't you get it?

76
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,160
Because I know where they live.

77
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,000
I know exactly where they live.

78
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,940
Get it in a contract that you get a copy of the footage.

79
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,860
Iron-ribbed, rock-bottom claim to ownership.

80
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,180
Well, that was certainly my contract

81
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,400
with the Subgenius Foundation this year.

82
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,120
Hey, they made you sign the thing, right?

83
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,540
Yeah.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,940
I thought we all did.

85
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,860
In blood.

86
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,500
That was what was required before I got my paycheck.

87
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,260
Yeah.

88
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,500
Paycheck?

89
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,640
Take this job and shove it.

90
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,660
How come everybody but me got paycheck?

91
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,020
Johnny Paycheck.

92
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,460
I can't afford to take time off work for this

93
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,220
unless I'm well compensated, sir.

94
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,120
Yes.

95
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,660
That's what I need to start saying.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,160
One should never be...

97
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,440
Well, wait a minute.

98
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,300
I am at work.

99
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,000
A sick man.

100
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,840
But one can be a well man.

101
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,380
Yeah.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,760
There is only one well man.

103
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,520
I know.

104
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,780
It's a...

105
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,900
The cure for well men.

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,760
Ideals.

107
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,260
That was a big movie this last year.

108
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,780
We don't reach them,

109
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,940
but we can always move toward them, you see.

110
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:02,860
You know,

111
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,220
Puzzling Evidence's front teeth

112
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,020
were auctioned off at X-Day one fine year.

113
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,080
I know that well.

114
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,700
For only about 25 bucks.

115
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,500
I did it.

116
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,840
Yes, they bought his teeth.

117
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:14,900
Yeah.

118
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,900
The teeth past which all that wind blew

119
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,360
for years and years.

120
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,320
Front teeth.

121
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,480
Those radio shows.

122
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,380
Had to pass those insights.

123
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,500
Where are they at now?

124
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,000
Someone bought them at X-Day.

125
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,400
Someone bought them at the Bulldada auction.

126
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,260
Because, you see, the Bulldada auction

127
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,660
does have genuinely esoteric items for sale.

128
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,000
Well, I remember doing it.

129
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,800
I don't remember who it was who actually purchased it.

130
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,080
But there was a lively bidding war on these choppers,

131
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,880
the incisors of Commander Puzzling Evidence.

132
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,740
The...

133
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,160
The...

134
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,340
The Nasal Septim of G. Gordon Gordon was auctioned.

135
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,440
Actually, a young stripper got it

136
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,260
by giving him a lap dance.

137
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,240
The Nasal Septim of G. Gordon Gordon

138
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,100
after too much Bolivian marching powder usage

139
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,520
actually fell out one day

140
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,240
onto the kitchen table.

141
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,720
And it was sold also at the Bulldada auction.

142
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,020
But before that,

143
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,040
a painting of it,

144
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,000
an exquisite painting on black velvet,

145
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,760
was executed.

146
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,280
By Paul Mavridis of San Francisco.

147
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,740
And you knew that, didn't you, Stey?

148
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,080
Oh, yeah.

149
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,320
I know that because Gordon's been griping bitterly

150
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,360
about how Paul's never sent it to him

151
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,340
even though he was paid for it.

152
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,980
Paul just can't let go of it.

153
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,380
He likes it too much.

154
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,140
Well, that's a sore point.

155
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,800
And a sore nose, no doubt.

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,200
He has a little plastic thing in there instead.

157
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,660
Plasto Sept.

158
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,200
But he's not in Bolivia anymore.

159
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:54,760
He's in Bolivia.

160
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:54,760


161
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,860
He's in Portugal drinking port.

162
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,460
He's getting ready to...

163
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,080
He's figured out a way to sail to the new world, I think.

164
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,360
But he needs three ships.

165
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,100
I'm trying to trick those film ladies

166
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,680
into sending me there to interview him.

167
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,480
That would be great.

168
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,240
On three ships.

169
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,280
Can you imagine just sitting out there on the veranda

170
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,980
with the blazing blue of the Mediterranean

171
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,180
and drinking all cool ones

172
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,220
with G. Gordon Gordon?

173
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:21,800
That's the idea.

174
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,760
As he parks in your ear.

175
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,520
That's why I bought that little camera.

176
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:24,880
It's over there.

177
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,140
It shoots full HD.

178
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,600
I met G. Gordon Gordon for the first time

179
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,200
in October of 1985.

180
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,720
I'd never heard of him.

181
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,860
I hadn't happened to have received a cassette

182
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,120
with his voice on it.

183
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,020
But I was at the Subgenius Foundation

184
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,680
in an earlier office.

185
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,860
The door flew open,

186
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,940
perhaps even kicked open.

187
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,580
This man stomped in

188
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,180
wearing a fully white suit,

189
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,000
threw his suitcases on the floor and said...

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,640
Tropical experience.

191
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,460
What does a guy have to do

192
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,840
to get some service around here?

193
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,260
That's him.

194
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,540
That was my introduction.

195
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,880
Well, it's funny because...

196
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,080
Well, of course, back then

197
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,540
we thought he was so old.

198
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,000
He was about 15 years younger

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,340
than you at that time, probably.

200
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,020
That is correct.

201
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,400
But he did.

202
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,540
He dressed in a suit

203
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,120
and he had a conservative haircut

204
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,160
and his wife was dressed nicely.

205
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,500
Twice.

206
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,580
Twice I've seen this happen

207
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,980
where they walk into a subcon

208
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,900
and some young hipsters

209
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,380
all dressed in black

210
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,560
would go,

211
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,080
oh, I guess they're letting pinks in here now.

212
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,580
Of course, we never saw

213
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,960
the young hipsters dressed in black again.

214
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,940
And G. Gordon Gordon, on the other hand,

215
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,620
has a right-hand seat next to Bob.

216
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,540
He's been one of the few people

217
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,740
to successfully allow Bob to get shot.

218
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,740
And he's been one of the few people

219
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,680
acting as a terrible bodyguard.

220
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,300
He let Bob's dream of being shot come true.

221
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,220
So Bob really loves him.

222
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,240
It's interesting to hear the spin

223
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,160
that the years have erected

224
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,040
around these incidents.

225
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,160
And, of course, I will gladly participate

226
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,380
in promulgating this version of events.

227
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,960
Yeah, if I said that,

228
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,460
then you better pick up on it.

229
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,200
Damn straight.

230
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,580
To quote Jimi Hendrix.

231
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,200
Is there a beer?

232
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,260
Pick up, pick in, flick off.

233
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,840
No, there's no beer here, my dear.

234
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,980
I'm looking for a beer cap.

235
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,880
I was going to do a magic trick.

236
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,400
Oh, that's a sort of a cap.

237
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,860
Yeah, this was Jimi Hendrix's magic trick.

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,720
A magic trick.

239
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,760
See that top?

240
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,140
Flop.

241
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,120
Ta-da!

242
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,260
Boy, I said that wrong.

243
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,000
Ta-da!

244
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,320
Does that sound better?

245
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,300
Ta-da!

246
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm a clown.

247
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,120
A junior scientist clown.

248
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,160
David Apocalypse wasn't on my list

249
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,380
of old-timers for the ladies to interview,

250
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,740
but they wanted him.

251
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,080
Did they?

252
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:10,880
Oh, yeah.

253
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,340
They wanted to get that voice

254
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,920
and that attitude, I guess.

255
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,140
And some of the tattoos, I'm sure.

256
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,060
I was excused from sleep

257
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,560
for nearly two nights by clowns

258
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,000
and clown apologists.

259
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,380
Oh, yeah, that's right.

260
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,480
That was supposed to be the quiet area.

261
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,900
Thanks, Ivan Stang.

262
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,000
Forget it, old man.

263
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,320
This is clown.

264
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,680
Thanks for the life lesson

265
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,780
and the secret insight initiation.

266
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,880
I feel enlightened.

267
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,340
That wasn't my idea.

268
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,940
Usually it's Sinfaltimus

269
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,240
that makes everybody leave,

270
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,140
but he's been just the quietest,

271
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,580
most polite young fellow.

272
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,480
Well, he does.

273
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,660
He does do the drumming,

274
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,020
the onstage drumming.

275
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,680
Yeah, and he's got an offspring

276
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,920
that's even louder.

277
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,080
And are they around?

278
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,280
He plays guitar a lot better than his dad.

279
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,100
Oh, that's pretty cool.

280
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,280
Yeah, Lord Rock God

281
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,900
and Reverend Angry Larry

282
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,200
have done some fabulous dueling guitar jams

283
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,340
right here in this place.

284
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:23,820
That's all right.

285
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,460
That's one year.

286
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:24,860
That's a long time ago.

287
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,400
Yeah, I love it.

288
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,120
I missed the show last night

289
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,480
because I decided it was more important

290
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,900
to have FaceTime

291
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,460
with subgeniuses who were here

292
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,800
because there was a lot of folks

293
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,720
I hadn't talked to.

294
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,220
Not really.

295
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,840
You know, I end up so busy.

296
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,400
I'm running around doing all this crap

297
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,400
and hardly ever get to just hang out.

298
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,820
In fact,

299
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,880
as I keep saying,

300
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,320
if anybody else wants to sit up here,

301
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,600
you're welcome to it.

302
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,360
I'll sit over there.

303
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,000
This recorder will run forever

304
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,280
and I have confidence.

305
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,260
So seriously.

306
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,360
There's two of them.

307
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,620
All right.

308
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,940
Let them fight it out among themselves.

309
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,460
Alan Bernard.

310
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,840
Reverend Bernard,

311
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,880
who's never been on the Hour of Slack.

312
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,360
All right, let's give him a royal welcome.

313
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,980
No, no, no.

314
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,460
Own in.

315
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:21,960
Own in.

316
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,740
You should stay here.

317
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,860
Own in.

318
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,400
I'll get out.

319
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,340
And Reverend Bernard will get on the end.

320
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,340
Ladies and gentlemen.

321
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,980
There's no music in the background right now.

322
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,960
Why don't you play the music, white boy.

323
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,220
Oh, there we go.

324
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,940
Okay, well, for a moment.

325
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,880
Ladies and gentlemen.

326
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,680
Yes.

327
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,140
You laughed at him.

328
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,580
You mocked at him.

329
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,360
He did not ask to be brought into this world,

330
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,420
but into this world he came.

331
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,800
His code is a law untoward.

332
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,460
To itself.

333
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,280
Offend him, and you offend us all.

334
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,220
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll turn the mic over now

335
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,380
to Reverend Fanboy.

336
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,040
Reverend Fanboy, thank you very much.

337
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,760
Reverend Owen N.

338
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,120
You have to lean in pretty close.

339
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,700
Yes, make sure your lips almost brush the microphone.

340
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,800
That sounds like fun.

341
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,440
Yep.

342
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,260
And then you will be so audible.

343
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,240
You'll be the envy of all.

344
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,800
You can put the odd, but you'll be the envy of all.

345
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:22,800


346
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,400
I'm not inaudible.

347
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,600
And what about X Day?

348
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,420
How is that shaping up for you on this special occasion?

349
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,260
Beyond my wildest expectations, and that is not a cliche.

350
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,060
That's the truth.

351
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,380
So many kind people, so many people to talk to.

352
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,720
An embarrassment of riches of just cool stuff to do.

353
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,200
Embarrass-imo.

354
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,120
Yes, right.

355
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,840
An embarrassment of riches and such rich embarrassment.

356
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,880
That's right, as well.

357
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,800
Right.

358
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,520
I was thanking Reverend Pease yesterday down at the Rock

359
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,960
Circle for triggering every single bit of my mom and dad are fighting reflex.

360
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,820
Thanks a lot.

361
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,840
Triggering, eh?

362
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,520
I was triggered.

363
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,080
Yeah.

364
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,980
But in a good way.

365
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,720
We are known for doing that, apparently.

366
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,300
So I've heard.

367
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:04,800
Yeah.

368
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,040
So, you know, apparently it comes with the territory these days.

369
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,680
No extra added charge.

370
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:20,680
The rehearsals we have for our traumas and inconveniences come complete with the package.

371
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,420
There's no extra charge.

372
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,340
There's no extra charge for not being able to sleep, bug bites, athlete's foot in the

373
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:27,780
showers.

374
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,720
It all comes complete in the single package purchase, which you have already made.

375
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,860
No ups, no extras.

376
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,300
Yes, and the bugs bite the athletes, thus preventing them from sleeping, too.

377
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,400
Thus the circle of agony is made complete.

378
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,080
I just hope that guy found his dad, because he was looking for him pretty hard.

379
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,400
Oh, that was a sad, wistful moment of teary-eyed service.

380
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:52,400


381
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:52,400


382
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:52,400


383
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,460
Searching and seeking for the familiar missing fraternal parent.

384
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,580
There isn't a 3 AM megaphone loud enough to find his dad, I bet.

385
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,200
Well, he needs to wake up the world to the necessity of understanding the seriousness

386
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,340
of his missing dad.

387
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,580
But you're right.

388
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,560
There's challenges, but the kind of challenges, when overcome, make one stronger, or at least

389
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,760
make one care less.

390
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,640
Challengers of the unknown.

391
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,220
There's that.

392
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,520
There's dad, and there's that guy, and there are probably some more challenges of the unknown.

393
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,080
Anything that does not kill you makes me sorry.

394
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:45,320
It's only natural to have such thoughts, like when they deliberately overbred mice

395
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,120
for population density experiments.

396
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,900
Mice got up to atrocities.

397
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,300
But of course, they would.

398
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,720
There are too many of them.

399
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,980
Mice-ka-moos-ka-trocity.

400
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:05,640
The mice went through a whole range of human pathologies in their overcrowded terrariums

401
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,900
in this famous experiment.

402
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:15,940
And you can't blame them for it, because anything a prisoner does is not considered to be the

403
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,960
way this individual would naturally behave.

404
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,120
If freedom were not taken.

405
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,500
If freedom were not taken away.

406
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,420
A tiger in the zoo is not vicious.

407
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,500
It's justifiably mad because it can't get out of its cage.

408
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,920
At any rate, this is the view I hold.

409
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:40,560
It's generally agreed upon that the extremes are not the base of a moral, but the norms,

410
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,200
as it were.

411
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,240
But one must ask, Dr. Howell, these mice that were gone through this experiment and exhibited

412
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,520
the human pathologies.

413
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,100
Did they retain those pathologies after the experiment?

414
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,440
And therefore become slightly more human?

415
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,220
They are long dead, because this happened a long time ago.

416
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:07,160
But there is, of course, some question if they developed complex behavior patterns as

417
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,060
a result of the stresses of their artificially induced genesis and situation.

418
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,980
Well, that is a byproduct that they wouldn't have had otherwise.

419
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,480
That's for sure.

420
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,280
Therefore, unnecessary.

421
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,080
Thank you.

422
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,540
That's a byproduct.

423
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,560
Therefore, if they took up the ways of the human, these ways must be somewhat necessary

424
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,380
to those in the human predicament.

425
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,780
It was in the 1930s that an African explorer.

426
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,780
Captain Spalding.

427
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,400
Indeed.

428
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:46,880
Traveling through a previously uncharted region, heard a sound up ahead that sounded uncannily

429
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,940
like human voices, in a place where he knew no humans could be.

430
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,080
No.

431
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:57,120
He walked forward slowly and ever more slowly until, peeking through the reeds and the grass

432
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,100
and the vines and the trees, saw a troop of great apes.

433
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,320
Uh-oh.

434
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:11,080
These apes were standing upright, walking, gesturing to each other, greeting each other

435
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,580
as friend.

436
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,900
They were speaking to one another, speaking with human voices, and even speaking in a

437
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,580
human tongue.

438
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,000
They were speaking the king's English.

439
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,080
And the man recognized him.

440
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,840
They were talking about art and philosophy and science and the day's events and wasn't

441
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,660
that a pretty bird we saw by the river.

442
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:36,580
He was so flabbergasted by all this that he fell forward into the brush.

443
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,400
The apes looked forward.

444
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,260
They saw him.

445
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:46,300
They met his eye and as one, dropped to all fours, grunted and hooted and flooped, dunked,

446
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,780
pooed each other and behaved as the apes that he had been familiar with.

447
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,320
But he said, guys, guys, I saw you.

448
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,440
I saw you talking.

449
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,940
I saw you being happy and human and upright.

450
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,200
Why do you keep this a secret?

451
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,460
One shyly looked at the other and they looked at each other and one came forward and said,

452
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,640
because you would make us work.

453
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,720
That is the curse of employment.

454
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,160
There's no I in employment.

455
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,440
It rhymes with limp for a reason.

456
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,720
Work.

457
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,220
Work, the scourge of the drinking class.

458
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:29,260
Work, the thing that keeps us most from slack, even at its most rewarding.

459
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,820
Work is the anti-subgenius.

460
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:40,220
Therefore all the more sympathy to our own Ivan Stang, whose work is subgenius.

461
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,200
Well, work on your side of the ledger might even be slackful.

462
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,260
It all depends on what you prefer to do and what you feel the circumstances.

463
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,560
IE the conspiracy compels you to do.

464
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:05,040
Meaningless drudgery, meaningless toil to produce objects to purchase an imaginary and meaningless

465
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,560
leisure.

466
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,160
Perhaps you've hit upon it, Dr. Howell.

467
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,620
It's the compulsion component that is so objectionable.

468
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,520
Yes.

469
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:20,240
Somebody, Dickens, somebody who said there are men who would pay six pounds a day for

470
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,240


471
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,240


472
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,620
a horse to drive a team of horses from here to there.

473
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:31,660
But if you paid them for it, they would turn their noses up in indignation and refuse to

474
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,000
do it.

475
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,040
Drive the horse from here to there or turn your nose up in the air.

476
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,280
Well, they're riding on the coach.

477
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,760
You know, it looks easy to be the driver.

478
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,240
It ain't so easy.

479
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,660
These lessons that you're talking about, I try to carry on.

480
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,660
to my kids. Yes, no one

481
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,400
needs to know that anymore, I understand.

482
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,540
But, you know, they might

483
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,940
figure it out.

484
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,620
Well, I just tell them very simply, when it

485
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,140
doesn't feel like work, that's slack.

486
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,320
And just to look for that.

487
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,580
That's the sweet spot. Yes, well

488
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,180
when your interest is driving

489
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,140
the activity, the

490
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,320
slack will fall as a

491
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,560
sweet and consumable

492
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,140
byproduct.

493
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,960
How

494
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,280
And if you would like to buy product,

495
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,260
please consult

496
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,760
subgenius.com

497
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,220
Oh, I thought you were going to say, please

498
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,420
consult eggplant.

499
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,420
Nobody seemed to want to buy much

500
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,060
of product this year.

501
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,400
At any rate,

502
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,600
this is not about buying and selling,

503
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,480
getting and spending

504
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,540
in which we lay waste

505
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,660
our powers. Little we see in

506
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,800
nature that is ours.

507
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,700
It's time to get our ducks in a row

508
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,180
if we have them

509
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,860
and prepare for tomorrow's

510
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,360
apocalypse.

511
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,020
When the great

512
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,240
silver saucers descend,

513
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,140
the great sky

514
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,300
fathers come down, banging and shooting

515
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,580
and so forth.

516
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,880
All that we have prepared

517
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,560
for.

518
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,480
The toast

519
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,340
riders in disguise.

520
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,680
There may be toast, for example.

521
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,800
Those of us who get on

522
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,160
early in the morning, the beginning

523
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,980
of a stream of delightful

524
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,540
amenities and courtesies

525
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,080
offered by the unbearably

526
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,200
attractive, tight, space

527
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,020
suited space goddesses

528
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,060
who will conduct each of us to

529
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,700
our individual stateroom.

530
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,200
As the story goes.

531
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,160
Part out

532
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
starboard home,

533
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,920
as it were.

534
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,220
I'll miss the earth, but not that much.

535
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,680
I'll probably have to make one.

536
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,280
Celestial north will have to be our

537
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,860
the center of our

538
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,880
new directive

539
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,260
sense. The north star

540
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,200
along to align with.

541
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,360
And you got the plane

542
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,400
of the solar system too.

543
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,340
Not everybody goes along

544
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,180
with it. There are bodies

545
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,540
that don't orbit in that particular

546
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,780
plane, but they're there.

547
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,540
In our own family of planets.

548
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,000
It's all changed to super

549
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,400
giant snooper scopes in the sky

550
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,420
have shown us there are all sorts

551
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,000
of impossible worlds hovering

552
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,080
very near us.

553
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,060
For example, the planet Biden

554
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,080
named after Joseph Biden,

555
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,300
vice president of the United States.

556
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,980
Few people have caught on to the fact

557
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,780
that that is now known to be there.

558
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,480
The planet Sedna, the planet Quail are.

559
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,340
All are there.

560
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,640
And other things.

561
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,200
The objects known as centaur objects,

562
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,680
which orbit irregularly outside the orbit

563
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,740
of Jupiter and in the extreme

564
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,980
remoteness beyond the dwarf planet Pluto.

565
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,980
And speaking of whammo world,

566
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,340
who would have thought Pluto was so gorgeous

567
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,420
and had an atmosphere and was warmer

568
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,400
than it should be.

569
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,460
It has been.

570
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,460


571
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,460


572
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,460


573
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,460


574
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,460


575
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,460


576
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,460


577
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,460


578
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,460


579
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,460


580
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,580
It has the wonderfully named

581
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,620
Cthulhu Regio and of course the tomb

582
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,800
ball Regio named after the original

583
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,380
discoverer of Pluto, Clyde Tombaugh.

584
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,080
But some of us know it as the planet.

585
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,560
Yoga, of course.

586
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,240
For that one you have to do your homework.

587
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,020
We've just been handed a directive.

588
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,640
That questions to expect and questions

589
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,520
to ask.

590
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,180
On what occasion?

591
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,640
Oh, it's a question for me.

592
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,900
It's an ask Dr. Hal question.

593
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,220
It's for an ask Dr. Hal.

594
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,320
Well, we weren't asked.

595
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,900
Shocker.

596
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,300
Going to do, I mean, I'm not in my,

597
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,540
I'm not on duty, but here we do have a donation

598
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,060
from Dr. Delphius and he says, what's all this business?

599
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,020
But is he referring to this comic book that's inside

600
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,640
an original Dope and Dan comic?

601
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,620
That's sweet.

602
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,360
Yeah.

603
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,620
Yeah.

604
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


605
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


606
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


607
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


608
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


609
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


610
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


611
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


612
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


613
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


614
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


615
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


616
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


617
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,140
And boy, I highly approve of this turn of events.

618
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:23,340
What's interesting to me is the logo on it is not a rip-off press logo.

619
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,520
So perhaps Ted Richards had a later printing of this comic.

620
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,860
Dr. Hal is now conducting scientific analysis of this particular text.

621
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,460
I just have to open the package and see if I can't just examine the...

622
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,380
Your question will be answered but sincerely.

623
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:42,740
I'm doing it.

624
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,840
There's no...

625
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,960
There's no hurry.

626
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,120
There's no rush.

627
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:51,520
There's no specification that I answer within five seconds in my own nightclub act.

628
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,600
We do have the speed round where I have to answer a bunch all at the same time, but this

629
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,340
is not that.

630
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:06,900
So it's, send extra orders to Last Gasp.

631
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,480
My goodness.

632
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,460
So they took over a rip-off press character, but why should I be surprised?

633
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:14,920
Yeah.

634
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:23,340
I must restrain myself from criticizing rip-offs, lamentable business strategy, even from this

635
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,140
remove.

636
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:31,400
When you consider that we had some of the best cartoonists and a great comic book factory

637
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,060
to produce them, we didn't do all that well, I thought.

638
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,900
Anyway.

639
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,800
Anyway, that was Water Under the Bridge.

640
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,000
Of course, we don't just watch those waters.

641
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,040
We watch them.

642
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,040
We watch them.

643
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,940
I'm not a fan of those.

644
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,040
I'm a fan of the

645
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,040


646
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,040


647
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,040


648
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,040


649
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,040


650
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,040


651
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,040


652
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,040


653
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,040


654
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,040


655
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,040


656
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,040


657
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,100
the

658
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,720
I think the

659
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:15,960
I was

660
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,260
watching the

661
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:19,300
latest hit.

662
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:25,800
I'd be on a bike there.

663
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:32,180
Again with the background music.

664
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:38,860
originist, Sergeant Frag, in here, and other characters created by Ted Richards. His wife,

665
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:47,400
Terry Richards, also created comics that were popular at this time of a miniskirted shark

666
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:53,320
girl of ruthless temperament who goes out to parties and makes everyone cry.

667
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,420
Did that title have a title?

668
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:03,160
You'll just have to Google Terry Richards and I'll bet those images will float up.

669
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,900
T-E-R-R-E Richards, as in Ted Richards. They were, at that time, a couple.

670
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,620
Fantastic.

671
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,960
So here you see life at Fort Frag with the buddies sitting around. All the little loops

672
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:24,220
and blinks and bumps drawn near Dan's face indicate that he's always stoned. Lighting

673
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,400
up as he parachutes into animation.

674
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:37,140
Enemy territory. And the whole base is stoned under one sweet blanket of smoke. And that,

675
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,880
too, is sort of a documentary approach to what happened in those days.

676
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,780
It looks like on the cover he's out of uniform and going AWOL five miles away from Fort Frag

677
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:56,280
and five miles away from Fatalburg. But that must be an interior story.

678
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:03,600
Which the reader of the comic will get to read. Is this for me? Or just for me to comment

679
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,540
on? I could be that reader.

680
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,100
Why not both?

681
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,200
Well, the thing is, don't you want to take it back?

682
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,580
I've had it for years.

683
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:17,840
And don't you want to continue to have it for years? For further years? It's in plastic

684
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:25,000
bags. I used to disdain people who had comics in plastic bags. Now I know it is necessary

685
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,060
because they're so...

686
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:32,080
fragile. But the whole idea of treating them like they were the Magna Carta was always

687
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,320
slightly vexing. I didn't mean to take up all the space, but...

688
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,060
I'm sure that the question has been answered to the satisfaction of the inquirant.

689
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:53,700
I hope it is. And I would like to ask how many are familiar with the underground comics

690
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,140
here?

691
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,560
They were very important to...

692
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,660
Several hands arose.

693
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,320
Yeah. They were important to the history of comics themselves. Mainly because from then

694
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:11,100
on, the cartoonist was the owner of the work. And before that, what you draw, you have to

695
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:18,040
give up to the company. And they own it forever, no matter how great or classic a cartoonist

696
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:24,100
you were. And this did change things around. It's not responsible for that.

697
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,660
It's responsible for the bad aspects of the modern cartoon and comic book era.

698
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:34,160
I've been long fascinated by the cartoonist as that person who has the singular vision,

699
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,960
and is the only one who's going to bend over and do all of those hours of scratching and

700
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,560
learning anatomy and all of that. It's not something I can do, but I can appreciate it

701
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,640
and collect it. And yeah, that's part of the...

702
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,040
Well, practice makes perfect. And then all cartoonists have used what are known in the

703
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,500
trade as swipes.

704
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:53,620
Swipes.

705
00:32:53,620 --> 00:33:00,320
Where you're in a hurry and you copy somebody else's layout or panel design, because you've

706
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,880
just got to get the story out and the page turned in. And this is universally done. Some

707
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,920
elegant variations in what others have drawn, others crude, naked borrowings. And it's obvious

708
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,200
where they come from.

709
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,460
What's exciting in the history of the comic book as an object and as a thing you sell

710
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,000
and make, whenever there's a jump in the technology...

711
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,200
There's a great flourishing of creativity to fill the new market created by it. So,

712
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,960
four-color printing in the 30s, easily obtained newsprint on rolls. So, all of a sudden, the

713
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,120
world's awash in stories.

714
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:43,020
And also, they had stories left over from being printed in the paper, which were bound

715
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,500
into the first comic books. Newspaper comics comprised them.

716
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,260
And then during the underground period, that...

717
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:57,320
Another jump in technology made it smaller and simpler, easier to access, especially

718
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,800
if you're printing black and white. And then every 50-year-old, I'm convinced, every 50-year-old

719
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,120
man has the same 150 comic books from 1988 from the black and white explosion in boxes

720
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,020
in their basement.

721
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,700
Well, some would think that the 80s were too late, that you were getting not the cream,

722
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:21,260
but the scum of the self-created comics industry. And there was indeed a culling, which came

723
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:28,870
along. But there were, to be fair, some great and independent creators working at that

724
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:35,650
time, too. I always thought that Richard Corbin got a raw deal from critics and fans alike

725
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,190
Very much so.

726
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:44,630
when he's so insanely skilled and inventive. And the stuff that Jan Sternad wrote and he

727
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,510
drew is pretty damn good, too.

728
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,330
Anyway, then, in the late 80s...

729
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:51,330


730
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:57,630
Later on, he had to censor his early vigorous comics, which were...

731
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,270
Corbin?

732
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:04,750
Yeah, Rich Corbin, definitely. And I'm not claiming I've been able to keep up with it.

733
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,530
I'm sure he's doing good stuff, but I haven't seen it lately.

734
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:15,070
He is still being published. And also, this year, I saw the movie Den that he made...

735
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,930
I saw it, yeah.

736
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:16,910
...quite some time ago.

737
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,670
It's hard to make a movie.

738
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,150
It certainly is.

739
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:20,510
Mm-hmm.

740
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,130
Not that short movie that he made. The short film?

741
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:28,950
That's the one.

742
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:29,490
That's the one? Okay.

743
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,730
Yes, I have seen that.

744
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,410
Yeah, because Den was partly in the heavy metal movie.

745
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,250
Yes, yes.

746
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:42,190
But that was unfortunately... Your creations get away from you, and then they go to seed.

747
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:42,890
Yes.

748
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,850
Don't look the way they ought to.

749
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:50,270
One minute, you're talking with your friends about a funny pipe-smoking salesman, and then...

750
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:56,470
The next minute, it's almost a half century later. Utter strangers have taken the stage.

751
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,850
A leap forward, but not necessarily upward.

752
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:09,410
Once the stables were cleaned, the effluvia that flowed from them was not vanished.

753
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,050
Hercules just moved the problem down.

754
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:12,310
Well, it washed away.

755
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,370
Hercules moved the problem downstream.

756
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,410
Dilution is not the solution for pollution.

757
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:26,670
One could assume, though, that the Aegean stables, despite their huge and horrible nature, were not of limitless extent.

758
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:39,830
Still, the people downstream had no reason to appreciate what the son of Zeus had done by diverting their water source through the stinkiest stables in the known world.

759
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,550
When Hercules was finally slain,

760
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,230
was his...

761
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,270
Uh...

762
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:57,150
cloak of the lion's skin robbed of its protective powers, or did it endure after his time?

763
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:03,050
It couldn't have endured if he had it on, because he was burned, but...

764
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,410
I think that he was...

765
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:17,470
I don't know if he wore it when he assumed the cloak that Deinara gave him,

766
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:20,810
that had been given by him by the centaur Nessus.

767
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,550
The record is unclear.

768
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,010
But it is true that Nessus knew very well what he was doing.

769
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,430
Hercules abused Nessus.

770
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:34,630
Nessus knew that the moment he put on this cloak, it would burn like fire.

771
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,450
It'd burn him to the bone and be impossible to wrench off.

772
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:43,390
So the only way to get out of his misery was to jump on the giant bonfire,

773
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,310
and thus the evil cloak of Nessus was destroyed.

774
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:55,670
Hercules' own lion skin, if that was on, it was an unnecessary object to add to the mix.

775
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:00,710
Of course, Hercules himself single-handedly slew the Nemean lion,

776
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:04,910
just as Tarzan of the Apes did on more than one occasion.

777
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,050
The first Popeye, I think of him.

778
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,410
Well, he wasn't that mentally swift.

779
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,890
But he...

780
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,010
Uh...

781
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,830
And he was superhumanly strong.

782
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:23,610
He didn't have to eat spinach to go into clobberin' time mode.

783
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,290
It was always a possibility.

784
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:31,250
And several times he accidentally killed people, simply by being too strong.

785
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,550
He had penitential periods where he had to abase himself.

786
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,490
And the story is, dressed like a woman,

787
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:44,330
in order to make up for the involuntary destruction

788
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:47,330
caused by his superhuman musculature.

789
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:48,470
Indeed.

790
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:53,890
His first act as a tiny baby was to strangle some venomous snakes,

791
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:59,910
which Hera had thoughtfully sent to slither into his crib,

792
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:07,130
which he was easily able to do, as in the famous Renaissance sculpture of Sáim.

793
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,770
That period of time where he was disguised as a mere mortal,

794
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,030
suggests again that he was an early superhero.

795
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,770
What we would come to know as a superhero...

796
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,330
He had a secret identity, didn't he?

797
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,070
Yes, he did.

798
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:28,010
But, like Superman, the secret identity was not something that you put on,

799
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,170
but it was who he actually was.

800
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,890
Hercules, the son of Zeus.

801
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,010
You know, like if you say Captain Marvel,

802
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:40,470
well, Captain Marvel is really crippled newsboy Billy Batson,

803
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,010
who has to say the word Shazam.

804
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:46,350
To transform into Captain Marvel.

805
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,990
But Superman was always really Superman,

806
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,890
and pretending to be Clark Kent.

807
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:59,010
Playing the sick game with Lois, just to amuse himself.

808
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,790
No doubt that Lois pursues Superman,

809
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:07,090
but turns down Clark, who pursues Lois.

810
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,310
And thus everything is kept in a demented equilibrium.

811
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:18,750
One might consider that just as what wrestling is to violence

812
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,890
and what pornography is to sex,

813
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,610
the Church of the Subgenius is to religion.

814
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,970
When you join in, you assume a new name, a new identity, new rules,

815
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,070
new swaths of humanity to hate.

816
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,850
But is it done for one's own benefit?

817
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,430
Not always. It's done for the greater cause.

818
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,290
And our ability to be human.

819
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,510
Our ability to incorporate infinite doctrinal expansion

820
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,910
is terrifying to the standard religions,

821
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:52,810
who of necessity must limit what they demand that their participants believe in.

822
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,110
With us, there is no limit.

823
00:40:55,470 --> 00:41:00,270
A grand achievement of the Church is the establishment of great reach at very little cost.

824
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:05,010
It's been a powerful mission and a powerful ministry.

825
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,870
And the face of Bob itself has given amusement

826
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:12,430
to Asian people whenever they have seen it.

827
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,790
And I understand from child psychologists

828
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:20,470
that it helps toilet training at the toddler stage.

829
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,110
If you just put a picture of Bob by the Johnny,

830
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,070
a junior has no problem in letting go.

831
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,050
This has been reliably reported numerous times, so it must be so.

832
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,870
That's often why you'll see, especially in Europe,

833
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,110
a Dobbs head on the back of the urinal.

834
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,650
Now, I haven't seen that, but I can, uh,

835
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:43,410
that would seem to generate hostile impulses

836
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:47,710
from those who might better cultivate fraternal feelings

837
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,390
in their inmost being.

838
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,590
We aim to please, so please aim.

839
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:57,010
Right. At least that'll keep them from, uh,

840
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,750
wreaking havoc in all directions.

841
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,550
There's no you in our pool.

842
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,030
Let's keep it that way.

843
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,870
But there is a you in Mule. Have you thought of that?

844
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,050
Yeah, there is, indeed.

845
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,710
Uh, because that's what you get when incompatible types

846
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,770
get together for hanky-panky.

847
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,890
The hanky, the panky, the hugger, the mugger,

848
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,490
and the hullabaloo.

849
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,770
Yeah. The facehugger and the chestbuster.

850
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,230
And all the panoply of sad things.

851
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,370
Psychic agitation.

852
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,930
You were speaking earlier of the, uh,

853
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:42,570
the Superman foisted upon us by the Comics Code Authority,

854
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,230
but then we got past that.

855
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,370
Do you have an affinity, or do you see,

856
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,670
do you care more about the post-code Superman

857
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,910
who fights intergalactic baddies?

858
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,910
My prejudice was ever against superheroes.

859
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,630
I didn't like them, but they were there,

860
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:02,470
and so I read Superman comics, particularly the Silver Age ones,

861
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,010
where, no matter how much I read, I was always, like,

862
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,490
how far you go in the universe,

863
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,450
everybody looks like a Republican businessman,

864
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:09,570
even aliens.

865
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:12,890
You know, that was a weird one,

866
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:17,010
but okay, for the sake of the story, I'll accept that.

867
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,710
They've got space monsters, too,

868
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,770
a little further out, I guess.

869
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:26,910
But I seemed to get the idea that since Superman

870
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,470
was able to travel at a hyper speed,

871
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,990
thus divorce himself from Superman,

872
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:34,350
he could have a little bit of a chance

873
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,870
to get the physics of our own time

874
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,830
and our own Newtonian system,

875
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:43,750
that really the isolation of Superman is complete,

876
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,990
and there's nobody around, you know.

877
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:49,290
If he wasn't super,

878
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,670
which creates all the problems and solves them,

879
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:55,230
he would be certifiably insane.

880
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,970
But he has a fortress of solitude

881
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,390
where he revels in his solitude,

882
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,770
and he pulls his punches.

883
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,110
Because if he actually punched the Joker in the face

884
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,590
or somebody like that, there would be no head, you know.

885
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,970
So everything he does is inhibited,

886
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,510
including all his relations with humans.

887
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:23,710
And then comes the baroque and odd disturbing mystery

888
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:28,370
where there's a phalanx of life-like Clark Kent robots

889
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:30,610
standing behind the sliding door

890
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,690
in the closet of Clark's home.

891
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,610
It can be instantly activated.

892
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,330
It can walk out, fool everybody into thinking

893
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:40,510
that Clark and Superman are in the same place.

894
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:43,730
These undetectable robots that never move

895
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:46,230
but just stand there in silence.

896
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:50,130
That is eerie, Kryptonian science.

897
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,970
And it's a part of the genuine danger

898
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,750
that an actual Superman would be.

899
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,330
It would be a problem that,

900
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,310
when an advanced culture reveals that it exists,

901
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:05,230
it destroys the culture that perceives it,

902
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:09,510
as has been seen by humans anthropologically again and again.

903
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,910
Many have disliked the superhero idea

904
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:18,490
and seen it as a groping toward the fascist ideal

905
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:22,150
because it involves the superior man.

906
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,990
It involves one who is a vigilante

907
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:29,290
and takes on trouble with his own brute strength,

908
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,290
as Davy Crockett supposedly would have done

909
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,650
if he had been a man.

910
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:37,310
But what if you're not right?

911
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,210
Superman can make it better.

912
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,810
Most people couldn't.

913
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:44,910
Chuck Jones didn't like the idea of the superhero.

914
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:49,150
And he has in the Bugs Bunny superhero cartoon

915
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,490
where he eats an irradiated carrot and becomes powerful.

916
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:55,470
The villains also eat them and become powerful.

917
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,870
And it's shown that it's simply the ideal of the will to power.

918
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,290
So, I'm not sure.

919
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,690
Once that's shown, Bugs Bunny goes off

920
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:07,650
and joins the Marines at the end of that one.

921
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:13,050
Anyway, I probably veered from your question.

922
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,030
No, that's okay.

923
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,270
That really is the point of my question,

924
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:17,330
so you could veer from it.

925
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,510
But the kind of superheroes that I like

926
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:24,070
are the ones like Jaime Hernandez draws in Love and Rockets.

927
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:26,650
They're all different shapes, all different sizes.

928
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,230
They are conflicted.

929
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:31,970
But some of them do have superhero suits, right?

930
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,650
Superhero costumes?

931
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:37,830
There's sub-universes in the Jaime Hernandez universe.

932
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,630
They're easy to draw.

933
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:42,390
Because these costumes are skin-tight,

934
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:47,150
like the costumes actually worn by young people these days.

935
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:54,690
So, it's a short step from there to full superhero equipage.

936
00:46:54,950 --> 00:47:01,050
I enjoyed some cartoon heroes who didn't have superhero suits,

937
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,430
but eventually they got them.

938
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:05,270
Like, for example, if you may recall,

939
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,150
Dr. Solar, Man of the Atom.

940
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,770
Ever read those?

941
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:10,730
Yes, indeed, sir.

942
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,450
He's a glowing, greenish scientist.

943
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:18,410
He got too near the nucleotides.

944
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,450
But it gave him special powers,

945
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,370
and he can hover and see through things,

946
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:24,550
though highly radioactive.

947
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:27,930
So, I thought it was cool that he'd be hovering there

948
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,430
in his lab coat, you know.

949
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,970
Isn't that all the superhero outfit you need?

950
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:39,070
The lab coat itself serves as a priestly, hieratic garment.

951
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:42,090
But, no, after a while the readers demanded

952
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:46,150
that he be in the skin-tight space suit sort of thing.

953
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:51,270
And then there was the most contrarian superhero of all,

954
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:52,730
Herbie Popnecker.

955
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,450
You must remember Herbie Popnecker.

956
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:57,010
That I do.

957
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:57,510
Yeah.

958
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:01,330
Well, he, for a long time, had no superhero suit,

959
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,890
but obese and phlegmatic,

960
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,550
trudged rather than flew through the air,

961
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,770
wearing blue pants, a white shirt,

962
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,890
and a small tie that barely covered a third of his stomach.

963
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:18,910
Bobole haircut, glasses, drooping eyes.

964
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,070
Lollipop.

965
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,370
Always a lollipop.

966
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,090
These lollipops enabled him to travel through time,

967
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,890
meet with angels and demons,

968
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,450
and endure the constant complaining of his dad,

969
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:34,070
who looked just like J.R. Bob Dobbs,

970
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:38,910
and who constantly berated him for being a fat little nothing.

971
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,030
Or a little fat nothing.

972
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,350
His mother would defend him weakly and say,

973
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,790
now you know he's not little.

974
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,910
So, that, but then after a while,

975
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,670
he was put into a superhero suit too.

976
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:54,950
Oh, now you're pointing.

977
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,030
You're gesticulating.

978
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:00,370
Oh, the, ah, what do we got going here?

979
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,170
I spoke with Reverend Singh.

980
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:05,550
He says that the recorder and yourself will likewise run forever.

981
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:06,770
Forever.

982
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:10,310
Will you please enjoy some libation?

983
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,170
I will, please.

984
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,610
Discus tea from Dr. Delvers.

985
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:16,110
All right, charge it up with super juice, please.

986
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:17,950
Full strength.

987
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:22,590
Sure, just make it as powerful as,

988
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,050
oh, you want me to drink it, not pour it into the,

989
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:25,790
okay, all right.

990
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,470
X-Day Public Service announcement,

991
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,250
eat something, lie down once in a while.

992
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:33,570
Thank you.

993
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:34,370
Drink something.

994
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,170
Drink a lot of liquid.

995
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:37,230
Drink a lot.

996
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,310
There's a strong, strong alcohol in that.

997
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,010
Lot of liquid, some of them without alcohol.

998
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:42,790
Isn't there?

999
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,490
Yeah, really, really strong.

1000
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:45,070
Love, Mom.

1001
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:45,770
But that's okay.

1002
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:47,230
Mm.

1003
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:49,490
Delicious.

1004
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,030
Thank you, Dr. Howell, Uncle Onan, Reverend Singh,

1005
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:55,030


1006
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:59,110
Reverend Fanboy, and all bringers of drinks and repasts.

1007
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:05,410
And now, an old Andrew the Impaled song from the new Liberty Tubes

1008
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,510
called The Happy Stick.

1009
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:36,290
Thank you.

1010
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:45,150
It's awesome.

1011
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:45,410
R desc prayer

1012
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,530
Don't yok me, drink it up, zero it, drink it up, don't wahtek,

1013
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:47,530


1014
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:50,570
Oh, no, if it cook it that way, don't open the lid,

1015
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:51,530
You've drunk yours.

1016
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:54,710
Yeah, pop it in the kitchen.

1017
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:01,130
Everywhere I go it seems exceedingly easy to find

1018
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:04,730
Some poor old fool who's miserable and prisoned his own mind

1019
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:07,930
And it's always kind of pissed me off because there's no excuse

1020
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:11,670
Now that I've developed and tested a hell of a treatment for the blues

1021
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:19,090
Every now and then I meet some sad sack that I'd like to beat

1022
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:22,590
With a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick

1023
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:33,050
It came to me within a dream on cold and restless night

1024
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:36,570
Ten thousand souls in a deep dark hole and I possessed the light

1025
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:39,650
And one by one they climbed on up a parade of misery

1026
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:43,750
I had this big stick and each one I hit fell laughing to their knees

1027
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:51,110
My purpose here was subtly clear to walk through your earth with a spreading cheer

1028
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,570
With a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick

1029
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:08,430
Now when I woke the dawn on me the stick was already mine

1030
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,830
I got it at a yard sale about a mile down in 59

1031
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:15,590
And it must have been the stick that day when I smacked poor old Vince

1032
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:19,090
He cracked a smile the first in a while but happy ever since

1033
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:19,850
Hey Vince!

1034
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:22,570
I'm happy to be here, I'm happy to be here

1035
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:22,570


1036
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:22,570


1037
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:22,570


1038
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:26,650
He used to be a mopey kid but that'll change when he got hit

1039
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,130
With a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick

1040
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,990
Now a family man and a CEO betrothed it all

1041
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:37,510
A different blow from the happy stick, from the happy stick, from the happy stick, from the happy stick

1042
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:41,130
Hey!

1043
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:44,710
You!

1044
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:48,190
Come here!

1045
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:56,470
And every share is mine

1046
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:07,630
Every share is starting to weigh me down

1047
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,070
And I really decided that it's time to go

1048
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:09,990
I put my stuff back in the truck

1049
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,030
I bought me an rhinestone and a rock

1050
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:10,030


1051
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:10,050
My own true feelings grow aente

1052
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:10,070
Happy Christmas!

1053
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:10,110
Happyetesцев Mr. Cameramen's Family well…

1054
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:10,110


1055
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:32,110
Lately I have noticed that the spring in your ship is gone

1056
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:35,730
You chucked your beam and are often screaming naked on the lawn

1057
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:39,070
Well I got a better answer friend, you can put the bottle down

1058
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:42,570
Watch your nose as you close your eyes and turn around

1059
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:43,070
Ha!

1060
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:50,330
It's all the rage and this is why I told you your lies with the blink of an eye

1061
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:53,770
With a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick, yeah

1062
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:57,250
I'll make the world a better place, I'll smack the frown right on your face

1063
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,950
With a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick

1064
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:04,490
Hey

1065
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:07,470
You

1066
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:11,730
Come here

1067
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,430
Ouch!

1068
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:20,350
Okay, well I guess I needed that.

1069
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,070
From the Liberty Tubes.

1070
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:27,590
More on all these morons at subgenius.com

1071
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:31,390
That's subgenius.com

1072
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:35,130
Where you can also get stuff.

1073
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,390
You might be surprised.

1074
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:44,650
And now we'll close with a rather heavy piece by a new contributor, Fat Little Bastard.

1075
00:54:45,270 --> 00:55:00,710
This is a subgenius specific song from the Fat Little Bastard EP called A Slight Case of D.S.I. Ray, which is on Bandcamp, much like the subgenius music albums.

1076
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:06,570
This one is called I Praise Bob As I Dream of X Day.

1077
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:23,690
Yep, obviate.

1078
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:24,410
� Retro and analogy for fucking crazy.

1079
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:24,570
What will S disagree with me?

1080
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:24,690
B So?

1081
