1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
This is the subgenre of radio ministry.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,300
Power of slack on KNON 90.9 in the left excess.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,420
Praise God.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,180
To be a good man.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,120
Turn on the machine.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,900
This is Radio Yerevan.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,740
My name is Hans Ivanovich Hagen.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,720
And this is the news.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,640
We got puppet boy.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,260
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,440
I'm in a bug nugget.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,420
No trouble.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,880
Just get set and get going.

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,540
You hear me?

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,020
Recording.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,200
Everything's going fine.

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,080
No trouble.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,240
Welcome.

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,780
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,540
Bob?

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,860
And now, the subgenius.

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,260
Power of slack.

23
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:24,580
Power of slack.

24
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:37,300
The subgenius, power of slack, that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station KNON.

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,160
And only in the city of Dallas, Texas.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:54,360
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show, the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,720
Small animals or other children becoming...

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:04,360
exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies constantly scanned throughout our program should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,120
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that micro-releases, but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

30
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,680
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,280
Here's your host...

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,600
Reverend Ivan Stang.

33
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,340
Ho ho ho ho ho ho.

34
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,520
Praise Bob.

35
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,460
Hoo!

36
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,380
Oh yes.

37
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,580
And... and what?

38
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,120
What what what what?

39
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:30,820
What?

40
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,220
What?

41
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,920
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

42
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:47,240
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

43
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,140
The subgenius hour of...

44
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,980
SWAT!

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,360
H minutos

46
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,900
Well, folks, we've got way too many guests tonight.

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,940
Oh, so many, and yet so, so many.

48
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,460
We've got with us, once again, finally, I know y'all have been waiting for it,

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,040
the Reverend Chastity Bell.

50
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,940
Now, say, hoo, Chastity.

51
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,060
Hoo, baby.

52
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,560
Yeah, there we go.

53
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,480
And not only the mighty and sexiful Chastity Bell,

54
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,580
but also the evil Court Holland, the other subgenius video guy,

55
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,480
along with me, and direct from Toronto, Canada,

56
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:14,620
the fantabulous, and I don't know exactly what, Bob McCaffrey.

57
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,200
Y'all got a crowd in around the microphone there.

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,340
Because you never know when I'm going to just cut you completely off the air.

59
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,420
Yeah, it could happen any second now.

60
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,620
I'll bring this background noise down.

61
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,740
Turn up my monitor so I know what's going on.

62
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,740
And, yes, folks, don't worry.

63
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,140
Whenever it gets dull, we'll just go to a tape.

64
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,720
Listen, it's so nice to hear a female voice on the hour of slack for a change.

65
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,180
God.

66
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,920
Connie has, I don't know, I don't know.

67
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,000
Her sweet message has not been carried enough upon this radio station.

68
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,680
That's, well, what do you mean Connie's message hasn't been carried enough?

69
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,280
Who is Connie, and why do we give a hoot, Reverend Bell?

70
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,000
The only time we give a hoot is when we don't pollute these days.

71
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:19,260
I think that Connie's message is both similar and different from Bob's.

72
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,500
It's multifaceted.

73
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,660
It's feminine yet perverted.

74
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,700
It's friendly yet aggressive.

75
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,740
It's the message we've been waiting to hear.

76
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,100
It's like Bob's name.

77
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,920
It's got a B on either side and a mighty hole in the middle.

78
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,720
And through that hole you can see the future and the past.

79
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,820
Oh, she loves it.

80
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,480
Yeah, well, Connie Dobbs, for those of you who have just tuned in,

81
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,900
this is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

82
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,940
On KNO and 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,160
And we're talking about Connie Dobbs, the wife of our guru.

84
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,460
Praise Bob.

85
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,360
Praise Bob.

86
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,100
Praise Bob.

87
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,800
Our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

88
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,980
The one true slack master on this plane.

89
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:19,240
And, well, we've got, as I said, Reverend Chastity Belt here to talk.

90
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,460
We've got Reverend Chastity Belt here to preach on the slipping, sliding word of Bob.

91
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:31,880
We've got Bob McCaffrey to preach on the cold, northern, long-nighted Canadian word of Bob.

92
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,260
Hey, and once again, it's another Bob.

93
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,320
Now, Bob, yeah, yeah.

94
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:48,280
Now, as I understand it, the Toronto Canadian subgeniuses have been increasing in number.

95
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:48,940
Oh.

96
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,060
Real fast.

97
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,140
Real fast.

98
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,860
We've been bobbing the media, bobbing the government,

99
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,900
and bobbing everything that holds still long enough to bob them.

100
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,920
And these are generally a perverted bunch of subgeniuses,

101
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,520
as the impression I've gotten from talking to the Pope of Toronto, Carl Trella.

102
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,740
Well, he's actually the ex-Pope.

103
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,600
What?

104
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,220
Yeah.

105
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,220
You're kidding.

106
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,200
No, he tossed it over to me for a while,

107
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,500
and I became the other Pope,

108
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
and I tossed it off.

109
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,920
Well, back to Carl again.

110
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,840
Hey, friends.

111
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,100
So I've become the Grand Inquisitioner of the church.

112
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,520
Oh, right.

113
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,440
It's a lot more fun.

114
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,360
More torture.

115
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,560
Oh, sex hurt.

116
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,480
Lots of sex hurt.

117
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,580
Yeah, yeah.

118
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,980
Oh, we could get to know each other better.

119
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,960
Oh, I knew it.

120
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,560
I knew it.

121
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,380
I knew we had a match made in hell here tonight, friends.

122
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,960
Sort of sounds like Jim and Tammy.

123
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,860
Yeah, yeah.

124
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,160
I usually only hear from the ex-Pope Trella,

125
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,340
and I've always gotten the impression that the Canadian subgenius,

126
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:54,900
Clenches, were heavy, heavy into that secret doctrine of the church of sex hurt.

127
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,380
Well, between that and science.

128
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,500
Weird science.

129
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,060
Plenty of that.

130
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,920
They're both, in a way, in some ways, they're both the same.

131
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,480
You know, it's the ultimate science.

132
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,440
It's the goal of all true science.

133
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,500
Is it not?

134
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,040
Eh?

135
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,720
Well, sex hurt, dear friends.

136
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,900
Just to clarify.

137
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,540
So you don't get the wrong idea.

138
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,640
This isn't a sadomasochistic church all the time, necessarily.

139
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:33,500
We've got, the sex hurt doctrine doesn't mean tying them up and injuring them or anything like that.

140
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,780
It's more like until it hurts.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,240
Until it hurts.

142
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,000
Until something hurts so much you just can't keep going.

143
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,020
And that's when you keep going, dear friends.

144
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,540
They're coming and going.

145
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:55,680
And so many, so few know truly whether they are coming or going in this day and age.

146
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,840
You know, that's an issue we need to address, I think, tonight.

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,680
You know, are these poor pinks and the noble subgenuses, are they coming or are they going?

148
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,340
And is Bob going to come again?

149
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,620
Or did he ever stop?

150
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,600
That's the other question.

151
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,820
And also, we've got here tonight.

152
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:28,680
We've got here tonight, direct from San Francisco, by way originally of Dallas itself, the mighty, mighty Reverend Port Holland.

153
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,440
Well, actually, Doug, I'm not direct from San Francisco.

154
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,920
I just got back from Dobstown, as a matter of fact, where I've been directing the upcoming motion picture, Arise.

155
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,180
That's right, friends.

156
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:47,800
With a cast of many, many enthusiastic subgeniuses who've been in Dobstown now as many as seven or eight years.

157
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:57,380
Well, how are some of the older, I mean, you know, there's some of these people started out as like 18-year-old kids that signed up.

158
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,360
They went to Dobstown back in like 79.

159
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,720
And how are those people doing?

160
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,920
Let me just put it this way, you know, their friends probably would not recognize them anymore.

161
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,740
The change is quite dramatic.

162
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,460
Praise Bob.

163
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,700
Man, you have to die.

164
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,200
You have to die to everything you were in your previous life.

165
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,640
Or at least wish you were dead.

166
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,020
Yeah, exactly.

167
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,820
And it's the same thing, friends, which is why you don't need to go ahead and kill yourselves.

168
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,760
There's no reason to.

169
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,580
Just wishing you were dead is the same damn thing.

170
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,540
That's not funny.

171
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,440
It's not funny at all.

172
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,360
It's true.

173
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,180
Words have never been etched on a fortune cookie paper.

174
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,480
Speaking of fortune cookies, I bet you've had some pretty telling fortune cookie.

175
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,280
Have you?

176
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:45,920
Well.

177
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:55,320
Well, I hate to kiss and tell in fortune cookies, but it's sort of like sex hurt in Chinese food.

178
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,980
You're wanting more an hour later.

179
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,140
Anything good to eat is fun to wear.

180
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,600
Well, friends, on that.

181
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,420
Well, this is going to be a nasty hour of slack, I can tell.

182
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,860
I'm disgusted already.

183
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,640
Let's get going.

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,740
Praise Bob.

185
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:15,860
Praise Bob.

186
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,860
We'll, we'll, uh, first, first, let's hear what Reverend Hal Robbins has to say about Connie here.

187
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,380
Oh, wait a minute, I can't cut off that music.

188
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,640
You all can't hear that background music.

189
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,400
This is Bob's theme song, friends.

190
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,960
Hi, this is Charlie Daniels.

191
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,280
Hey, look, there's Connie.

192
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,460
This is one of her early filming appearances.

193
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,720
Now, let's run this by again in slow motion.

194
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,120
And I want you to watch what happens at the bottom of the frame.

195
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,140
Look, that little white light, you see it?

196
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,060
This is a case of early Bobism.

197
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,040
She had a slight halo showing right in the back of her head.

198
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,580
And they had to, the directors had to arrange the lighting very specially to hide the halo.

199
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,840
Yes, everyone thought it was a cheap lighting effect.

200
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:15,320
And Bob himself was heard to observe, say, honey, it's probably just some cheap publicity.

201
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,980
Satant.

202
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,100
Satant.

203
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,980
The evil, but what about Satant?

204
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,240
We forgot to worship Satant.

205
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,540
That was Yog Satant.

206
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,560
It's something you'll never forget.

207
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,240
Something I have tried all my life to forget.

208
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,840
It wasn't Bob, it wasn't the bleeding head, it was Satant.

209
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,680
It wasn't even Wol Wol.

210
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,980
Yogum Shototum.

211
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,160
It was Satant all the time.

212
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,580
It was Satant.

213
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:38,580


214
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,200
We received ourselves.

215
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,140
I had the money, I had the tapes, I had the map, and the girl, and the diamonds.

216
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,300
And the gun.

217
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,520
The rumor became reality.

218
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,840
Another satanic cult.

219
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,040
Yes, just another evil cult that was supposed to be a good one.

220
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,280
This is how the war gets on the radio.

221
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,200
I think a lot of subgeniuses originally believed they were doing something good by joining the church.

222
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,920
That wheel and chain set up makes the sound of moving artillery.

223
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,640
Sounds like a real battle.

224
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,720
Well, it's nothing compared to what it takes to move this show.

225
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,860
Don't be alarmed.

226
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,740
It's a lot more work than saving souls, believe me.

227
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,080
That punch didn't connect.

228
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,780
The sound was faked.

229
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,480
Although, Stang suffered a real blow from an infuriated Gabofran.

230
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,740
Oh, that was a great blow.

231
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,400
Yes, the mallet on a grapefruit gave the sound of that blow.

232
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,060
Curiously refreshing.

233
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,360
It was a lot of fun, too.

234
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,620
But here they come.

235
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,940
There, the guard is forming to march the guilty offender away.

236
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,300
Yes, those who believed the wrong lies in the Book of the Subterranean.

237
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:52,580
The subgenius taken into the stadium near Dobstown and all the Malaysians pour into the little wooden seats.

238
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,620
For the clumsy child with the hard to fit shoe size,

239
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:01,700
Cap Bigfoot, our 31st season, boys and girls 6 to 18, 10D to 15, EEEEEE.

240
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,120
Our patient understanding staff has had outstanding success with the clumsy, uncoordinated child.

241
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:13,080
Our unique patented method starts your child from scratch, from crawling to early walking,

242
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,080
to full walking, trotting and running.

243
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,160
Until he is actually strutting, dancing and doing gymnastics.

244
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,800
Many of our graduates are now prominent in ballet and jazz tap.

245
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,180
Write to George Trefeld, Camp Bigfoot, Peppermill, Oregon 65201.

246
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,440
We like you and should ignore you.

247
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,340
But instead, we out!

248
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,220
Oh!

249
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,540
Oh my goodness!

250
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,240
Oh, oh, are you alright, doctor?

251
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,020
No, no, not alright at all. Forget it.

252
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,460
Oh, friends, it's getting tougher and tougher.

253
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,060
Trying to keep up.

254
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,520
Which city you're in anymore?

255
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,500
In subgenius land?

256
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:55,240
But, uh, but, you know, if it's hard for us, think how hard it is for Jim and Tammy Baker.

257
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,020
Yeah, you knew we'd have to talk about that.

258
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,540
You knew we'd get around to it sooner or later.

259
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,980
Praise Jim and Tammy.

260
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,700
They finally came through.

261
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:15,060
They, yeah, Tammy's pill, what pills did Tammy have that we weren't allowed, that Bob didn't

262
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,760
give us?

263
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,340
Big numbers.

264
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,300
Whew.

265
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,380
So, so, now what were you saying, Cord, about Jim and Tammy?

266
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,860
There was some rumor going around, I understand.

267
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,340
Me, telling rumors about Jim and Tammy?

268
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:27,920
Yeah.

269
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,280
Well.

270
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,040
Yeah, I think so.

271
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,100
Well, it's about in the theme park, actually, Doug.

272
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,000
Um.

273
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,880
Heritage USA.

274
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,020
Excuse me?

275
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,920
Heritage USA.

276
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,500
Yes, that's right, Heritage USA.

277
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:44,780
I was just there recently, and I actually saw some signs of maybe some kind of alien

278
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,680
penetration.

279
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,680
Alien penetration?

280
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,700
But, but, uh.

281
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,380
So this is it.

282
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:51,960
But Tammy, Tammy denied.

283
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,000
Jim and Tammy's theme park.

284
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,240
Tammy denied it.

285
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,300
Tammy denied it, but look what happened.

286
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,020
They always deny it.

287
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,260
Yeah, but look what happened.

288
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,520
What did happen?

289
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,600
She told a fib.

290
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,200
And she had to go to the Betty Ford Clinic.

291
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:05,820
That's right.

292
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,640
And her husband had to pay blackmail money because he was too much of a Christian to

293
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,020
admit to his people.

294
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,040


295
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,040


296
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,040


297
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,040


298
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,780
That he had a girlfriend on the side.

299
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,620
Praise Fawn.

300
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,480
Praise Fawn.

301
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,500
Is that her name?

302
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,060
Hawn.

303
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,660
Hawn.

304
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,540
Hawn and Fawn.

305
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,300
Jessica.

306
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,840
Jessica, that vile, disgusting harlot, Hawn.

307
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,420
That aggressive young lady.

308
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,060
Now see.

309
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,980
I can't wait to see the article in the book.

310
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,640
The woman who knew all the tricks and all the moves, according to poor Jim.

311
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:42,720
He was, yea, verily he was, taken off the path of righteousness by this vile, disgusting

312
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,940
church secretary.

313
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,500
I saw pictures of her.

314
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,880
Truly, this is a woman who was born to type.

315
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,040
Obscene genes.

316
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,140
Obscene genes, yes.

317
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,600
I was shocked.

318
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:52,960
Tight.

319
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,200
Tight, obscene genes.

320
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,920
And friends, I mean, you're not going to let your genes mingle with those of some pitiful

321
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,400
human like that and then be blackmailed about it, are you?

322
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:10,680
In the subgenius church, I mean, if you're having an affair with another woman, the audience

323
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,920
members pay you to talk about it.

324
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,200
They ain't paid me enough yet.

325
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,140
I'm waiting for offers.

326
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,940
Well, you can call 823-7490.

327
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,940
Talk to the Will of Dobbs.

328
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,980
He's always here and ready to answer your questions about just why.

329
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,280
Why?

330
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,900
I guess that's the ultimate question.

331
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,940
For $115,000, that was why.

332
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,280
Yea, 100,000.

333
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,020
This guy.

334
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,360
Boy, I tell you, you know, I hate to bother your reverence, Thang, but when you realize

335
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,960
that they brought in $129 million tax-free dollars last year and they paid that dumb

336
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:00,040
bimbo $115,000, well, when you break that down percentage-wise, she really did get the

337
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,420
hmm out of her, I'll tell you.

338
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,120
What is the equivalent of the $5 fornication?

339
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,280
She, yeah, really, she could have gotten a lot more.

340
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:07,980
Low-budget love.

341
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,320
Yep.

342
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,000
Of course, you'd have to pay me more than $115,000.

343
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
$15,000 to consider fornicating with Jim Baker.

344
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:16,840
Eeeeee.

345
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,760
Here now, let's not get slanderous on the air.

346
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,080
I mean, Jim is a handsome, clean man.

347
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,960
You can tell by looking at his pictures.

348
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,900
He's very clean.

349
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,000
He's certainly not the kind of person who would be involved in...

350
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,860
Only Ms. Hahn can answer that question.

351
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,760
Yeah, I get it.

352
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,040
That's right.

353
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,480
I guess Ms. Hahn could probably answer all those questions about Jim.

354
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:47,220
Well, you know, but it's Jimmy Swaggart that's trying to take away his air wave, not us.

355
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,060
We don't need, I don't think that we need the PTL club.

356
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,680
Nay.

357
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:05,440
Our clubs are much, much, much stronger and larger than those of these rival cults.

358
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,620
What's his name?

359
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:06,600
Jimmy.

360
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,580
That guy.

361
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,280
Yeah.

362
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,400
Well, I wish Jimmy Swaggart would take over.

363
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,060
He's my favorite man.

364
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,540
He really is.

365
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,240
I think Swaggart's king.

366
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,980
He certainly plays a good, main piano.

367
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,220
He does. He does.

368
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,160
He's one of, Jimmy Swaggart is the number one gospel singer.

369
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,240
He's the number one album seller as far as gospel singers go in the entire world.

370
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,680
Now, dear friends, what are you going to do about making Cleve Duncan the new one?

371
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,080
Huh?

372
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,860
When are you going to buy Cleve's albums, huh?

373
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,720
Probably when they're on sale.

374
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,500
Okay, fine.

375
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,460
I can accept that.

376
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,860
Well, in the meantime, we'll move down to this beautiful commercial.

377
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,840
Has this ever happened to you?

378
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,440
Why, it should have been there, Ted.

379
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,260
It was great.

380
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,540
There was free booze, great music, one of the best plays I ever went to.

381
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,140
Where were you that night?

382
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,280
Oh, I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

383
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,240
I guess I should have gone, huh?

384
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,820
Didn't you feel stupid?

385
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,060
Didn't you wish you could go home?

386
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,720
I wish I could go back to that night, that party.

387
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,120
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.

388
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,300
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

389
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,820
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time, slow down, and make time run backwards.

390
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,700
Thank the learns.

391
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,940
But most importantly, you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

392
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
How, you may ask?

393
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,580
Well, just ask this man here, an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

394
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,100
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.

395
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,880
Blango.

396
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,120
My dog was dead.

397
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,980
Was I sad till I met Bob?

398
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:48,760
Bob showed me how I could go back, get the registration number for the car, do a slip job on the brakes, and wouldn't you know it, that truck went off into a ditch and burst into flames just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger.

399
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,520
Ain't that right, fella?

400
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:57,140
Yes, just imagine the horrible things that could be undone tomorrow if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.

401
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,240
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.

402
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,560
Just right, Bob's School of Time Control, the universe.

403
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,980
Bob's School of Time Control, a division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

404
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,880
And now a few words about underwriting your favorite shows on KNON.

405
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,220
KNON is a non-profit, non-commercial radio station.

406
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,540
We cannot have commercials or advertisements going out over our airwaves.

407
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:33,980
However, if a business or individual would like to help KNON by financially sponsoring segments of programming, we are allowed to thank the underwriter and say a few things about that person's business.

408
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,460
First, let's discuss costs.

409
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:42,420
The cost of underwriting is only $15 per mention, with a minimum of 3 mentions.

410
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,540
This is tax deductible.

411
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:55,180
The payment for the first underwriting announcement and the signed underwriting contract must be presented to the KNON staff a minimum of 5 days before it is aired.

412
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,020
Now let's talk about what can and cannot be said during an underwriting announcement.

413
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:06,440
We can mention the name of the person and or business, the address, phone number, or the address of the person.

414
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,440


415
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,440


416
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,360
hours and days of operation, what the business is or does, and a motto or slogan.

417
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,960
We may not, however, mention prices or discounts or any money amounts.

418
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,580
We may not make what is legally known as an inducement to buy.

419
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,020
An inducement to buy is something like,

420
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,840
for the first 50 people to come in, you get a free oven, or ladies drink free.

421
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,960
We may not make comparative statements either, such as,

422
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:43,160
The announcements are no more than 30 seconds in length and may be made up to three times in one hour,

423
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,180
though the minimum of three does not require all of your announcements to be made in the same hour.

424
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,380
The underwriting announcement will be written out or taped under the supervision of the KNON staff

425
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,220
to make sure it falls within the legal guidelines,

426
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,800
and then it will be scheduled on the PSA log during the segments that are to be sponsored.

427
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,240
For more information on underwriting,

428
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:04,940
please visit the KNOF website at www.knof.org.

429
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:04,940


430
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:12,760
Please contact the KNON staff between 9 and 5, Monday through Friday, at 828-9500.

431
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,400
That's 828-9500.

432
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,560
So please consider the benefits of underwriting programs on KNON.

433
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,780
You expose your business to the segment of the community you are serving,

434
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,640
and you support KNON, the voice of the people.

435
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:04,940
If you are interested in more information, please visit the KNOF website at www.knof.org.

436
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,620
Thank you.

437
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,080
Thank you.

438
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:35,900
Thank you.

439
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,400
Thanks a lot, Akon.

440
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,240
What was the...

441
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:46,400
You went out and did some location shooting that I wasn't able to go out on in Malaysia, I understand,

442
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,380
with Reverend Howell, Dr. Howell.

443
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,120
Yeah, we did.

444
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:56,840
We took a boat up the Amazonian estuary towards Dobbs Town.

445
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,240
We were attacked by Indians, however, on the way,

446
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,660
and had to ditch the boat and make the rest of the way on foot.

447
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:04,700
The...

448
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,440
The Dred Ukabalaponga Indians, who are well known for shrinking their victims' heads and then killing them.

449
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,940
It was quite dangerous, and we made our way through the jungle.

450
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,320
Fortunately, the lights of Dobbs Town can be seen for many miles away,

451
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,740
so we were able to find our way by following a pillar of light.

452
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,760
You were guided by that star of Dobbs Town.

453
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,100
Friends, for those of you who are unfamiliar with the church,

454
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,480
and the subgenius inner secrets,

455
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:42,780
Dobbs Town is that jungle stronghold that every cult should have,

456
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,400
but only a few are lucky enough to actually keep,

457
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,340
where those who have spent enough time studying the word of Dobbs

458
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,800
and moving up in the ranks finally are able to go and get the operations,

459
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,640
the glandscaping, the acubating, and the...

460
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,060
You've heard about all that stuff, you know,

461
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,400
where you...

462
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,080
Where you become an apprentice over man.

463
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,800
You actually become ready to join our brothers from Planet X on that glorious day.

464
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,640
One of the most fascinating things happening at Dobbs Town now,

465
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,920
which I'm not sure you're aware of,

466
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,800
is the creation of the world's largest slack generator.

467
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,260
Oh, the accelerator?

468
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,560
The molecular...

469
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,040
The atomic accelerator?

470
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,980
Well, they've harnessed the power of the atomic accelerator now,

471
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,780
and the scientists have devised a...

472
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,360
What they claim...

473
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,280
The team will be the largest slack generator,

474
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,700
possibly in this section of the cosmos.

475
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,020
I can feel that slack building up, friends.

476
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,820
It takes a lot of money to run that slack generator.

477
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,540
That's right, friends.

478
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,880
It takes a lot of money, and I want you all to think about that.

479
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,260
The film is over budget again.

480
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,360
But, boy, is it going to be worth it.

481
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,860
Will it ever.

482
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:01,260
Well, I mean, you know, what's 10 million in feature film production nowadays?

483
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,600
Friends, we're talking about...

484
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,220
That's the...

485
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,960
The caterer's bill, by the way, 10 million.

486
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,660
We're talking about Arise, the subgenius video, the movie, which is still...

487
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,280
Oh, the subgenius movie, the video.

488
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,320
Is it?

489
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,060
Slash the video.

490
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,280
Yeah.

491
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,640
Anyway, it's multimedia, folks, and it's still in production,

492
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,220
but it's getting closer and closer all the time.

493
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,760
And we're going to show it in three days in Boston,

494
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,520
so it better be ready by then.

495
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,780
But, yes, and you can write for information.

496
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,880
We're going to talk about these things.

497
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,640
And you can also call here at the station, either one.

498
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:46,440
Call at the station at 823-7490 or write Bob, the one and only Bob, dear friends,

499
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:58,080
at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

500
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,740
And don't forget, Bob is spelled B-O-B,

501
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,340
B, frontwards or backwards.

502
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,880
That's right, friends.

503
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,620
You can scream it out backwards, and it still comes out the same way.

504
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,160
Slack.

505
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,020
Slack.

506
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,020
Slack.

507
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,400
Little realized even by leading scientists,

508
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,120
there are really only two races,

509
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,720
actually two distinct species of so-called...

510
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,840
human beings.

511
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,640
If you gaze upon any given street,

512
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:40,580
normally you might never suspect that only some of these people are true humans.

513
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,880
Outside appearances offer no clue that among this ordinary looking crowd,

514
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,740
on an ordinary day,

515
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:54,980
a certain number of these people are actually subgeniuses.

516
00:28:55,060 --> 00:29:00,520
We would have to creep inside their heads to know whether this person or that...

517
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,200
is the rare subgenius gene.

518
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,640
But once inside those heads,

519
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,620
we would discover a vast new universe,

520
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,260
a new dimension,

521
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:17,180
coexisting not always in harmony alongside the mundane workaday world of the common human.

522
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,680
Another world that until now has been forced into hiding.

523
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:27,080
Now, at this very moment, the veils of secrecy can be torn aside.

524
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,720
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise...

525
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,940
our heads high and declare,

526
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,300
behold us, for we are the subgeniuses.

527
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,680
But what is a subgenius?

528
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,880
How can they, we, differ so much from the humans,

529
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,980
whose nonsensical laws and customs we have been forced to obey?

530
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,860
Why have so many of us been kept in ignorance of our true heritage?

531
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,680
Examine this seemingly docile crowd,

532
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,680
and know that in some few,

533
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,080
simmering beneath a placid surface,

534
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,180
there broils a veritable cauldron of repressed subgenius awareness,

535
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,380
ready at any moment to explode outwardly,

536
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,140
often with catastrophic results.

537
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,780
Look at the word subgenius.

538
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,540
It doesn't simply mean just below a genius.

539
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,380
The intelligence...

540
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:35,180
level of subgeniuses can range far, far below genius. It's not the so-called intelligence

541
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:41,380
that really matters after all, but how it is used. The subgenius does not pretend to

542
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:48,460
super-knowledge, but to sub-knowledge, knowledge of the underthings, the horror-worth from

543
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:55,520
whose darkness issue the Nazi hell-creatures and other demons of the abyss. It is in contemplation

544
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:02,640
of these underthings, the underwear lurking just below the clothing of existence, that

545
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:09,080
the subgene eye display what genius they have. The study of this substratum, the foundation

546
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:16,320
garment underlying reality, is the subgenius's strength, for it is from this source that

547
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:23,040
he or she taps the infinite resources of a force that is completely incomprehensible

548
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,060
to humans. The force...

549
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
of slack.

550
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,080
All right, here is some of the sickest.

551
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:45,820
Oh, how nice of you to come visit me. I do not often have visitors here. We are so isolated

552
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:55,060
here, you know. Oh, sit down, sit down. Please do forgive me for being impolite. I'm sorry,

553
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:07,780
I'm just about to have my evening meal, and I'm very hungry. Oh, you look surprised. You do not see anything on the table?

554
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,340
Well, wait until I get the box.

555
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:22,060
Here it is. Yes, here it is. Here it is.

556
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:42,440
It... it is in this box that my meal is waiting. It is a... how do you Americans say it? A packaged dinner? Now, if you will forgive me, I will begin.

557
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,700
There we are.

558
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:54,380
But why do you gasp? It's just the head of a young girl. A pretty young girl.

559
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:12,080
This saw? Again you are surprised. But it is... it is my very special saw. I have to work for my meals. Cutting through the bone is not easy. Forgive me, I must begin.

560
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:25,180
Oh, I know what you're thinking. You think I am psychotic. I'm not psychotic. I'm just hungry.

561
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,160
I like to eat brains.

562
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:44,080
Oh my God, it feels so good.

563
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,660
Oh, doesn't it feel so good, dear friends?

564
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,080
Yes.

565
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,360
Yeah.

566
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,200
Yeah.

567
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,880
Baby, yeah.

568
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,260
Yeah.

569
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,380
Do it.

570
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,220
Doesn't it feel good, Chastity?

571
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,500
It was good for me. Was it good for you?

572
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:01,300
Hey, it's always good for me, no matter what happens. I know that sounds sick, but...

573
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,540
Oh my God.

574
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:13,960
Well, you know, back to the subject the listeners are most interested in. Sex hurt. You know, what... speaking of sex hurt, Reverend Belt...

575
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,500
Yes.

576
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:21,800
What brought you to Bob in the first place? What was your first experience with... that brought you into the church?

577
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,740
Well, I was searching for a church home.

578
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:35,320
And as you know, it is difficult to be in the ministry and to be both a hard worker and a woman, because there is a lot of efforts to keep women out of the ministry.

579
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:43,800
But Bob opened... Bob opened the door to me. I went to one of the absolute first church services of the Church of the Subgenius.

580
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:52,300
And I think you remember our being there, because that was when the Reverend Buck Naked was there with his dog. I believe he was telecommunicating with the dog at the time.

581
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,720
That was when Buck grew the hair all the time.

582
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,780
And he was talking about the strange parts of his body that they shouldn't have been on.

583
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:11,180
I think I remember that afternoon. It was a miracle. But the thing that brought it home for me was when I heard him playing the auto harp and singing about festering on the carcass of life.

584
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,780
And I knew I found the religion for me. Truly, it was a blessing to my soul.

585
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:23,020
So what about personal experiences with our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs himself?

586
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,500
Well...

587
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:32,820
I feel complete in Bob for the first time. My skin glows, my hair grows, my toenails are shiny.

588
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:41,860
I feel complete because Bob has touched me in a way that very few have accomplished or even tried without tongs.

589
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:51,840
Oh, friends, Bob can fill you up. He can fill your life to the hilt. All the way. All the way.

590
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,700
Well, Bob, Reverend Bob Dobbs.

591
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


592
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,200
I'm Bob McCaffrey.

593
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,900
How about your first experience with Bob? And how long have the headaches lasted?

594
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,900
Oh, a few years now. A few years. It's been quite an experience.

595
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:10,200
I picked up the book of the subgenius way back there and opened it up and it said,

596
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,940
Give your money to Bob. And I knew I had found the right religion for me.

597
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,280
That was a very astute observation.

598
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,700
Friends, I want you to listen to that. You know, you hear what he says.

599
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:24,700


600
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:29,540
He heard the word, give your money to Bob, and he did so.

601
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,960
As a matter of fact, if I remember correctly, wasn't it you that sent not Canadian dollars, praise Bob,

602
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:43,340
damn the Canadian dollars that we get so many of lately, but you sent sterling silver, right?

603
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,960
Fine silver, actually. Silver ingots.

604
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,720
Yeah, right. The 999 series of silver ingots.

605
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:49,960
That's the ones.

606
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,460
I believe...

607
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,320
Are you sure that wasn't the 666 series?

608
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,420
No, no. Nay, nay.

609
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,640
Nay, nay.

610
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:54,960
Nay, nay.

611
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,700
These were the number of Bob. 999, dear friends.

612
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,680
We were paid for a membership in silver ingots from Canada.

613
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,060
And that's the way to do it. That's the way to do it.

614
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,260
Forget those Federal Reserve notes. You call that money?

615
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,540
Puh, puh.

616
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,320
Puh, puh.

617
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,400
That stuff's gonna... You're gonna be sleeping on that.

618
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,940
That's gonna be stuffing your mattresses in the end times.

619
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,440
Wallpaper.

620
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,800
That's gonna be firewood in the end times, friends.

621
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,740
You're gonna be buying and selling with subgenius pamphlets.

622
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,280
Oh, but you don't believe me. You think that's a...

623
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,640
You think that's gotta be some sort of funny joke, don't you?

624
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,640
Well, how about, uh, court?

625
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,820
What was... I... I... I don't know if I was there or not.

626
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,140
You never heard the story?

627
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,420
No, I never did hear the story about when you're...

628
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,360
Well, it actually happened on the golf course.

629
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,560
It did?

630
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,120
Yes, it happened on the golf course.

631
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:50,440
Well, I don't... I never really saw Bob, but a golf ball, which seemed to come out of nowhere, struck me in the head, and I was knocked unconscious.

632
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,740
And during the period I was unconscious...

633
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,880
There was a man with a pipe.

634
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,400
This is all I remember.

635
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:02,000
And, uh, when I woke up, uh, there was a sack of cash on the front seat of my golf cart.

636
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,760
He gave you money?

637
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,860
I think... Yeah, I think I might be one of the first.

638
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,120
Maybe one of the only ones.

639
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,840
But of course I used to...

640
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,160
I mean, that's not supposed to be...

641
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:22,720
Well, I understood what the money was for immediately, and I... I quickly went... started raising funds, more funds, to produce the, uh...

642
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,220
motion picture.

643
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,380
Soon to be a videotape.

644
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,140
That's right. That's it, friends.

645
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,160
And you're gonna be... you're gonna be able to buy that thing in stores.

646
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,920
But, oh, you don't believe me. No, it don't... you don't matter to you. Nay, nay.

647
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,060
...back that was inherited from that collage.

648
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,980
Truly first-rate sleazy art, or tenth-rate high art, that contains the cheapness necessary to help you maintain faith

649
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,640
throughout subgenius depression or alienation from blessed mania in these times.

650
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,860
A time of no style, when no one has the guts to put their bloody hearts in the line without fear of being called a weirdo.

651
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,220
A time when people laugh at the things that aren't funny and don't laugh at the ones that are.

652
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,800
They, being the normals, laugh only when there is a laugh track.

653
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:12,000
Because they don't... because they rather they want to be accepted, and they don't want to step out of line.

654
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:20,000
It's gone so far, I've actually heard sobbing at a movie theater when the expensive cars, the Mercedes-Benz and such, get totaled in a car chase.

655
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,060
Confusion abounds.

656
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:27,880
And the only thing we can keep our precious insanity is by letting go of the oppressive concrete weights around our necks

657
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,940
that pull us down to the bottom of the pool of normalcy, float up to the surface where the breathing is easy.

658
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,760
Come up to freshness.

659
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,580
Try Menthol Bob.

660
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,620
He's that refreshing voice in the back of your head that all of the nuns in Catholic training and psychic torturing centers

661
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:48,460
told you was the voice of the devil or one of his minions, urging you to step away from the flock.

662
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,040
The herd instinct is the real diabolical force.

663
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,360
The moral notion that organized religion teaches?

664
00:39:53,580 --> 00:40:00,060
Dump those graven images down the drain before you dump your will in a ditch for them.

665
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,380
Ah, yes. The harvest.

666
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,020
The harvest.

667
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,020


668
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,020


669
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,020


670
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,540
The harvest.

671
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,620
The harvest.

672
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,260
The harvest.

673
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,960
You've got a good beginning.

674
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,040
The harvest.

675
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,240
The harvest.

676
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,380
And this, in trial and error, it just depends again on breaking the records over radio.

677
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,760
Rock music blares!

678
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
Door slam!

679
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,120
People yell!

680
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
Children scream!

681
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,760
Sirens whine!

682
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,020
Tracks rumble and now a yay day!

683
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,020


684
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,660
Roar!

685
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,700
And rock music blares!

686
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,560
Blares! Blares! Blares!

687
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,220
Is there any escape?

688
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,440
From noise?

689
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,240
Is there any escape?

690
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,580
From noise?

691
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,960
Is there any escape?

692
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,800
From noise?

693
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,080
Is there any escape?

694
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,820
From noise?

695
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,720
Now you take all that noise

696
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,700
and let it bounce off of one building

697
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,960
to another building

698
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,600
and then up to the pavement where you're walking

699
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,560
and it's no wonder you're exhausted after a day of shopping

700
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,700
No wonder you feel as if you can't finish the day on the job

701
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,220
You're tired

702
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,680
You're beaten down

703
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,180
You're irritable

704
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,780
Your mental and physical health

705
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,580
are so low!

706
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,020
You're suffering!

707
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,640
Is there any escape?

708
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,300
Is there any escape?

709
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,400
From noise?

710
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,760
Is there any escape?

711
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,100
From noise?

712
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,180
Is there any escape?

713
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,860
From noise?

714
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,760
Yes!

715
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,340
Yes!

716
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:44,780
Yeah!

717
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,800
Is there any escape?

718
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:46,880
There is!

719
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,600
There's no...

720
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,220
No!

721
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:48,960
There is no...

722
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,820
no!

723
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,360
There...

724
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,240
There is!

725
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,240


726
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:54,300


727
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,660
Yeah!

728
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,300
Sega!

729
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:15,320
an orgasm, when all of a sudden, wham, the horrible noise comes in and completely destroys

730
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:28,520
your orgasm on the Playboy channel. There it goes again, that awful interference wrecking

731
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:40,380
your orgasm on the Playboy channel. You've called the cable TV company six times. And

732
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:47,540
it still didn't do any good, because, friends, we just weren't allowed to keep playing that

733
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:56,160
song, because we don't know what might happen. Well, there's a lot of, even more aliens in

734
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,600
the room now than there were before.

735
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:07,380
You can hear them in the background there. Oh, the party stopped. Great. What about those,

736
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:15,340
I mean, what has the conspiracy done to prevent the fullness of slack, Reverend Belt, when

737
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:24,080
you, you know, in the midst of the eternal battle of the sexes, say, with your chosen

738
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,660
partner or thing of the moment?

739
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,580
Where do you find the conspiracy really stepping in?

740
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:39,300
I think the obvious conspiracy these days is not against slack, but against the ministries

741
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:46,260
in general. Not just Bob's ministry, but all ministries. Our tax-exempt status is seriously

742
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:53,060
threatened by naysayers and media types who suggested that Oral Roberts is not waiting

743
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:57,060
with a knife over his head for that great eternal con.

744
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:57,720
Well, I guess that's just the way I am. I'm not sure if I can convince you that Oral Roberts

745
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:57,720


746
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:57,720


747
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:57,720


748
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:57,720


749
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,060
But, you know, in the midst of all these, you know, these kind of comeuppance, he is

750
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:04,840
not waiting to be raptured into heaven for screwing up big for the big payoff.

751
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,300
You don't think that Oral Roberts is actually going to be taken home if he doesn't raise

752
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,140
his money, which I thought he already raised?

753
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,300
Well, yes, he has already raised this money, but there's never enough.

754
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,360
There's never enough

755
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,160
Too much is always better

756
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,580
It's sort of like sex hurt

757
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,620
There's never enough

758
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,120
You just are always wanting more

759
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,780
But I do feel complete

760
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,720
In knowing that

761
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,120
Oral Roberts has recently accepted

762
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,340
1.3 million tax free dollars

763
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,860
You lucky devil you

764
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,120
From a man who raises dogs

765
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,000
For a living

766
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,340
Sort of similar to

767
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,840
Mr. Roberts own ministry

768
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,240
Just going round and round in circles

769
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,000
Chasing that little bunny tail

770
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,040
And God spilled backwards his dog

771
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,000
Let's not forget

772
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,200
God spilled backwards his dog

773
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,280
I never heard that

774
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,320
Wow man that's heavy

775
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,300
Well the light of heaven is built out of cash

776
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:02,960
Yes

777
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,640
And the things have been so

778
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,360
Praise dog

779
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,900
Praise dog

780
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,740
Woof woof

781
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,980
I heard a message from on high and it went woof

782
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,560
My biggest

783
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,360
Concern is

784
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,560
Is you know we are

785
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,940
We are seeing a minister's attack

786
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,440
Not only Bob

787
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,480
Not only this ministry here

788
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,620
But ministries all over the country

789
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,400
Like our dear dear friend

790
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,620
Pat Robertson's chance for eternal

791
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,620
World domination is being

792
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,840
Questioned

793
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,540
Because he happens to be a minister of

794
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,320
Not necessarily Bob

795
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,340
But of a big source of power

796
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,060
Well I

797
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,780
I've had to die

798
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,280
Two or three times on this show

799
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,040
Trying to raise

800
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,740
Seven hundred bucks

801
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,280
Much less one point three million

802
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,760
I heard you died on this show

803
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,600
And you didn't even have money involved

804
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,260
Yeah well that's not

805
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,900
That's show biz talk now

806
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,040
But I don't know

807
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,420
It's a big concern

808
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,140
It sort of reminds me of this

809
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,980
Wall street takeover

810
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,640
You know this

811
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,880
This Jimmy Swaggert's turned into a regular

812
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,540
Ivan Boesky of the Bible Belt

813
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,260
I'm kind of surprised that he's not a part of this show

814
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:14,840
I'm kind of concerned

815
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,220
Definitely concerned

816
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,460
Well I mean this is a free country

817
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,440
You know we have freedom of superstition

818
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,940
Freedom of degeneracy

819
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,520
Uh vindictive hatefulness

820
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,460
But not when it cuts into our profit level

821
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,160
You know every dollar that you send to Jimmy

822
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,520
Is one that Bob can't be using

823
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,020
Oh not necessarily

824
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,940
You never know who Bob's friends may be

825
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,640
You know uh

826
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,440
What are the chances of Bob and Jimmy doing a revival

827
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,420
Now this would be

828
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,980
This would be a tearjerker that would bring that house down

829
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,900
Hey just have your tickets ready for 1998 dear friends

830
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,240
You know what just occurred to me

831
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,360
I have to read a public service announcement here

832
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,540
At some point

833
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,620
But but

834
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,180
At the same time

835
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,500
At the same time

836
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,200
What about

837
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,540
I mean you know if if uh

838
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,920
If if

839
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,780
If a preacher nowadays can't have an affair

840
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,900
Uh you know on the side

841
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,620
A little assignation

842
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:17,960
What kind of

843
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,020
What what is this

844
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:19,600
What is this

845
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:19,860
What

846
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,340
They call this freedom of religion

847
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,360
What do we become preachers for

848
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,340
Yeah really

849
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,420
I mean that's what

850
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,040
That's what most subgenius preachers get into it for

851
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,400
They hear about the

852
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,600
The Good Sex for Mutants dating service

853
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,860

885

That's why

886
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,680
Double cheese and Kool-Aid

00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,680
You're gonna be buying and dying together dear friends

891
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,920
That's all there is to it

892
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,640
And we'll be laughing and choking

893
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,080
Oh we'll be riding the motherships into the sky

894
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,300
We'll be going off into space

895
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,040
While y'all are down there on the earth

896
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,040
On the pathetic planet

897
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,040


898
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,200
On the pathetic earth plane

899
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,800
Bubbling like a fondue

900
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,800
Yeah with tufts of hair blowing away in the wind

901
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,060
In the radioactive nuclear winter wind

902
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,180
It blesses my heart to think about

903
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,060
All our listeners dying in horrible pain

904
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:38,760
While we fly away in happiness and sex hurt

905
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,860
Well somebody's gotta do it

906
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,800
That's right

907
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,100
It's a dirty ministry but somebody's got to do it

908
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:50,680
You know and where would any religion be without enemies and people to hate

909
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,540
You know

910
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,740
There wouldn't be in us

911
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,280
It'd be just a regular social club to heck with that

912
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,860
That's right it'd be some place

913
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,340
Well it's like the little kid across the street

914
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,460
She looks forward to Easter

915
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,760
Because on Easter her mother buys her a new dress

916
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,760
To go to church in

917
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,800
Cause God only looks at ya

918
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,100
On Easter and Christmas

919
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,940
So you better look good

920
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,900
You know if you don't look like you're well off

921
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,140
Then he may not let you into heaven I suppose

922
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,960
I suppose it's a very

923
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,020
There is a dress code in heaven

924
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,040
I thought I would tell you that

925
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,200
And we have had this proved to us

926
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,060
Years and years of proof

927
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,600
From Tammy Faye Baker

928
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,780
She has told you if you can't look your best for Jesus

929
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,580
You won't walk in the doors of the pearly gates

930
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,760
And you don't deserve to friends

931
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,740
This is true

932
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,260
Why should you

933
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:42,980
Why should you

934
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,060
If you can't afford a decent set of clothes

935
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:50,440
Why should you be allowed in with the nice folks in heaven huh

936
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:57,180
I think we ought to go to Buck's record

937
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,800
Buck's 45

938
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,760
This is Drinking Bud watching Bob friends

939
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,820
But this isn't the version we usually play

940
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,900
This is the version that Buck did

941
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,060
You know

942
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,860
With

943
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,860
Well it's on a 45 record

944
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,020
You can go down to some of the hippie record stores around here

945
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,340
And actually buy this thing

946
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:20,840
And of course this is the closing music for the subgenius video

947
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,980
Arise the movie 2

948
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,900
Which we will of course be advertising much more heavily when it's finished

949
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,320
And we love you friends

950
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,860
Drinking Bud Wilds

951
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,600
Watching Bob on TV

952
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,600
Swallowing red van

953
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
The day my clue dog died

954
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,360
Reading the pamphlet

955
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,360
Over and over again

956
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:06,540
I was drinking Budweiser

957
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,780
And Bob was on TV

958
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:19,360
The day that Uncle got kicked by a mule

959
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,660
I was with Cousin Junior

960
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:28,260
The DNA backfired

961
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,560
I was drunk

962
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,960
I was lonely

963
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,480
I was wild

964
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,340
I was drinking Budweiser

965
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:46,080
And Bob was on TV

966
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,480
Drinking Budweiser

967
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,040
Watching Bob on TV

968
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,940
Swallowing red wine

969
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,640
They mocked me down

970
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,820
Down

971
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,800
Down

972
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,420
Down

973
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:07,660
Down

974
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:07,660


975
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:07,660


976
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:07,660


977
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:07,680
Or would a şur Evan

978
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:07,780
Street Unlocked

979
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:07,780


980
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:07,780


981
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,860
We ended up happening

982
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,960
Over and over again

983
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,980
I was drinking Budweiser

984
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,580
And Bob was on TV

985
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,960
I was drinking Budweiser

986
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,460
And Bob was on TV

987
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:31,460
I was drinking Budweiser

988
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:31,460


989
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,700
And Bob was on TV

990
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,280
Did you have to wait till doomsday to say I love you?

991
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:58,320
Did you have to wait till the missiles were in the air?

992
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,640
Now that the world's on red alert and we've all hit the dirt

993
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,380
Now you tell me that you care

994
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:14,960
For ten long years we've been a-courting

995
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,840
For ten years there's been only you

996
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:26,480
I've whined you and dined you and I've tried to incline you

997
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,120
Towards telling the preacher I do

998
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,200
But tonight while we were dancing

999
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:34,620
I heard a voice in the air

1000
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,980
And an air-raid siren

1001
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,660
Made five thousand waltzers hit the floor

1002
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:47,040
And while everyone else was saying their prayers

1003
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,720
You turned to me and said

1004
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,180
Darling, I'm yours

1005
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:56,160
Did you have to wait till doomsday to say I love you?

1006
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:01,220
Did you have to wait till the missiles were in the air?

1007
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,620
Now that the world's on red alert and we've all hit the dirt

1008
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,180
Now you tell me that you care

1009
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,160
Come let me put my arm around your shoulder

1010
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:23,480
And tell me that you love me again

1011
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:28,020
And let's hurry and find us a preacher, darling

1012
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,700
Or my best man will be

1013
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,940
I see him

1014
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:38,480
Well, did you have to wait till doomsday to say I love you?

1015
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:43,520
Did you have to wait till the missiles were in the air?

1016
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:49,780
Now that the world's on red alert and we've all hit the dirt

1017
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,500
Now you tell me that you care

1018
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:00,220
So let these words be our epitaph

1019
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:03,920
To be certain that our minds are not at war with the world

1020
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,800
And that our marriage will last

1021
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,940
Until death do us part

1022
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,540
Don't open your heart

1023
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:15,200
Till just before an H-bomb blast

1024
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,720
Ah, did you have to wait till doomsday to say I love you?

1025
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,680
Did you have to wait till the missiles were in the air?

1026
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,240
Now that the world's on red alert

1027
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,040
And we've all hit the dirt

1028
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,560
Now you tell me

1029
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,720
That you care

1030
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,120
Are you sure it took your sweet time?

1031
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,540
Better too late than never

1032
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,640
Oh, yes, what a purty, purty song, friends

1033
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,420
A pretty song

1034
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,180
Yes, it'll be very pretty in those end times

1035
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,820
Well, we're gonna have to say goodbye

1036
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:03,140
Once again, unfortunately, not a permanent goodbye like in that song

1037
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,440
But, uh, Reverend Chastity Bell, thank you so much for coming by

1038
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,720
It was worth the trip

1039
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,880
And, well, Bob McCaffrey, I hope it was worth the trip all the way down from Toronto

1040
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,980
To speak on the air for ten minutes

1041
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,380
Oh, lots of fun

1042
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,680
People like to get a hold of us

1043
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,520
Give us a ride at the Cider Spasmodic Conception up in MTO

1044
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
That's right, friends

1045
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,620
Yeah, just ride to Bob at P.O. Box 1436 Dallas, Texas 75214

1046
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,540
And find out all you need to know about the show and the show itself

1047
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:33,540


1048
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,660
And, you know, and Court, Court Holland

1049
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,700
It was a pleasure, I'll be back again and again

1050
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:43,160
Yes, yes, Court grew up in this godforsaken town

1051
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,820
And didn't you go to school with John Hinckley?

1052
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:47,680
Yes

1053
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,580
That's right

1054
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,740
Yeah, he sat in front of me in my history class

1055
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,780
Two great Americans, I might want to add, right there

1056
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,140
And you whispered in his ear

1057
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,700
Well, well

1058
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,480
Yeah, weren't you the one who inspired those

1059
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,520
Give Hinckley and the Cider Spasmodic Conception?

1060
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,820
Another chance at the presidency

1061
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,980
Another shot at the presidency

1062
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,640
Bumper stickers

1063
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,640
Yeah, I like that

1064
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,160
Well, friends, this is the hour of slack going off

1065
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,500
Once again, hang on for Ron Lindsey and Down Memory Lane

1066
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,880
And, oh, praise Bob

1067
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:59,860
We'll be right back

1068
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,100
Yeah

1069
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,880
Giving up all around me

1070
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,400
Pace is full of pain

1071
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,300
I try to play my music

1072
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,200
This day my music's too loud

1073
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,360
I try talking about it

1074
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,000
I got the big run around

1075
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,120
And when I roll with the punches

1076
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,000
I got knocked on the ground

1077
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,940
By all this bullshit going down

1078
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:28,800
Hey

1079
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,960
Time is truly wasted

1080
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,780
There's no guarantee

1081
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,720
Smilers in the main

1082
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,660
We gotta fight the problems that be

1083
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,880
I don't understand that

1084
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,320
People wanna say

1085
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,440
Those that got the answers

1086
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,480
Red tape in the way

1087
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,000
I could take you at easy

1088
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,340
Hey

1089
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,040
That's just half the fun

1090
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,400
All we know

1091
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,620
Singing about satisfaction

1092
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,460
Keeps me on the run

1093
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,340
I try to play my music

1094
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,180
This day my music's too loud

1095
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,360
I try talking about it

1096
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,080
I got the big run around

1097
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,200
And when I roll with the punches

1098
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,060
I got knocked on the ground

1099
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:30,100
By all this bullshit going down

1100
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:30,580
Hey

1101
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,020
Time is truly wasted

1102
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,980
I got the big run around

1103
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,140
I got knocked on the ground

1104
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,580
Smilers in the main

1105
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,180
Smilers in the main

1106
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:43,180


1107
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,580
Smilers in the main
