1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Being played on a digital audio system.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,720
A flash, a flash, a flash.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,100
What's wrong with this thing? Come on, man, tune in.

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,140
Tune in for...

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,560
I'd like to buy the world of...

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,180
And tonight the stars will be out.

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,220
Don't you know that goddess Pooh Bear?

8
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:38,880
Goddess Pooh Bear?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,800
Goddess Pooh Bear?

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,360
That's what we people call ourselves.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,680
Idiots.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,100
Yeah.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,440
This is the end of the society.

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,720
The Slinkys, the Slinkys.

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,340
Ah!

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:58,840
Ah!

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,520
Ah!

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,980
Ah!

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,360
Little mÃ¡s goko's again.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,700
It's a ride.

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,300
That's a efendim.

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:29,640
about. If you touch me, try to stop me, I'll throw the switch. How long is it? That's a rather...

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,420
How long is it? How long is it? Why, it's... The Self-Genius Hour of Slack.

24
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,560
Are you one of the frightened? Science is but an organized system of ignorance.

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,780
Nothing's accomplished by this. Nothing that makes sense.

26
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,420
You realize there's a government directive stating that there is no such thing as a flying saucer.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,140
Friends.

28
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,260
Friendly people getting to know one another.

29
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,300
I'm gonna lay right down here in the grass.

30
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,340
Is there someone else up there we could talk to?

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,780
As you sow evil, so shall you reap evil.

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Praise God.

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,840
Nobody will stop me, because I am the true underground messiah.

34
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,080
When you come to my show, you're going to a war.

35
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,280
And I'm out for violence, chaos, lawlessness, all the way.

36
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,100
I don't care about anybody or anything except for myself and my mission.

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,360
And your kids out there, if you've got kids out there, they're gonna be my kids.

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,620
I'm gonna own those kids. They're gonna do anything that I say.

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,580
I'm the king, and they can identify with me, because the real true nonconformist children in this country

40
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,600
are sick and tired of their parents, their schools, their people force-feeding them what to do.

41
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,060
I am the answer. When they listen to my lyrics, and they listen to my words, they're gonna be the king.

42
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,860
They're gonna listen to my songs. They're listening to the way that it really should be.

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,320
And you know that, and I know that. So don't bring...

44
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,800
You know...

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,480
Get a ball. Go! Go, man!

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,520
Keeping him out could make him worse. After all, he is crazy.

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,460
You know... and... and you can't get through to him, because...

48
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:25,700
Thank you.

49
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:33,480
We trust, my listening and viewing friend, that today's broadcast has brought comfort as well as conviction.

50
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,040
Maybe you have a prayer request that you...

51
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,360
would like to give to our church, and we can pray for you as a church body during our Wednesday night prayer service.

52
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:41,960
Please...

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:48,100
Yes, dear friends, we'll... we'll pray for your church body.

54
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,960
And, uh... where's my... there's that volume control... here's this volume control, and everything's fine!

55
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,940
And we're back to... normal, I guess.

56
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,220
Uh...

57
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,720
And I've got lots of radio...

58
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,960
tapes from my trip out to New York and Cleveland.

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,980
W...

60
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,940
MUF and Reverend Ed Strange's show.

61
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,560
And WCSB and the Einstein Secret Orchestra show.

62
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,820
Yes, and... and also these Media Barrage tapes, friends.

63
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,800
I forgot to give credits last time.

64
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:35,480
The Media Barrage, or Audio Collage, you might say, material that we just heard just a second ago,

65
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,620
was by, uh, our new Reverend Felicia, or Felacia, I like to say.

66
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:49,040
Um... and, uh... I... I've been looking for the other tape that Reverend Felacia sent

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,080
that was just the laughter and rutting sounds of a yeti.

68
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:04,640
Um... Felacia is a... is a yetinsen of, uh... of... of a... of a gender that is in transit, apparently.

69
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,460
We'll see.

70
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,660
I... you know...

71
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,860
Friends... takes all kinds to make up this old church.

72
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,940
Oh, and the other Media Barrage Audio Collage that I've been playing is, uh, by...

73
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,320
of Chaz Smith of Einstein Secret Orchestra.

74
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,660
Friends at WSFMU, listeners probably are... have heard that some.

75
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,320
And, uh... oh, it's a beautiful barrage.

76
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:35,460
He... Chaz got himself one of those old-fashioned-y tape decks that has the spring-loading, uh...

77
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:35,460


78
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,120
sound-coded pause edit button.

79
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,300
So hard to find in today's, uh, gimmick-obsessed world.

80
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,960
But I don't wanna, uh, get lost in the dogma, griping and bitching, as usual, about some technical thing.

81
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,160
Friends! Uh... uh... uh... we've been really busy here at the church,

82
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,320
uh... mainly, uh, producing artwork for this new Steve Jackson game that's getting sort of wrapped up now.

83
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,440
And, uh, I'm fixin' to go to, uh, uh, De Vival in Austin, uh, this weekend, but, uh... by the time you hear about it, it won't be done.

84
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:05,440


85
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,880
nothing but a bunch of tapes and it's just wonderful it's so wonderful living in the realm

86
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,420
of the church of the subgenius yes it is

87
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:29,520
anyway um i'm not sure where we go from here friends but i know that subgenius hell

88
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,140
is uh not really all that bad of a fate you know just in case you decide that that eternal

89
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:42,260
salvation wasn't all it was cracked up to be you'll probably kind of dig the hell part too

90
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,300
anyway enough enough

91
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:51,520
and there'll be no smoking in the gas chamber

92
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,540
and that's right jimmy and also i have to correct my credits i just gave uh

93
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,340
friends

94
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:10,600
reverend strange is not on wmuf he's on wmuh in lovely allentown pennsylvania this show uh

95
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:18,280
that'll be coming up features uh dr legume and myself as well as a lot of music that he picked

96
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:27,300
that's great and um chaz uh chaz's media barrage would not be familiar to listeners of wfmu

97
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,140
albeit that is a noble

98
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,500
statement

99
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,080
indeed uh but rather wcsb which is the home of einstein's secret orchestra and the swamp

100
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:45,280
radio of chaz and uh the guests a special guest of which on that show with lonesome cowboy dave

101
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,480
and chaz are myself and princess we are though and uh thank you this in the background is hate

102
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,260
for a pink planet from aram check

103
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,520
in there

104
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,500
yes

105
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,440
so

106
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,660
is

107
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,160
so

108
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,720
in the

109
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,440
allowing

110
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,500
f liv well anyway

111
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,400
Oh, three years in it.

112
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,580
And they put themselves in boxes, and that's not the right way of living.

113
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,560
Because younger people, their minds are a little more keener,

114
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,580
and they can figure this out.

115
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,240
So therefore, since they can't get release and respect from the older people,

116
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,640
then they go into these other things.

117
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,240
And then music gets louder, and it gets rebellious,

118
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,320
because it's starting to form a religion, you know.

119
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,900
Because you're not going to find it in church.

120
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,020
A lot of kids, you know, don't find nothing in church.

121
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,300
I remember when I got thrown out of church

122
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,380
because I had the improper clothes on.

123
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,940
I had tennis shoes and a suit, and they said, well, that's not proper.

124
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,120
So we don't have no money to get anything else.

125
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,280
So I just got thrown out of church anyway,

126
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,440
and it's nothing but an institution, so they don't have to find nothing there.

127
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,080
Well, stick around, have an open mind, listen.

128
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,080
You may hear things you've never heard before.

129
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,100
Germany was having trouble, what a sad, sad story.

130
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,620
It needed a new leader to restore its former glory.

131
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,460
Where, oh, where was he?

132
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,720
Where could that man be?

133
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,380
We looked around, and then we found

134
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,120
The man for you and me.

135
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,300
And now it's

136
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,880
Springtime for Hitler and Germany.

137
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,460
Deutschland is happy and gay.

138
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,340
We're marching to a faster pace.

139
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,180
Look out, here comes the master race.

140
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,300
Springtime for Hitler and Germany.

141
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,360
Winter for Poland and France.

142
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,280
Winter for Poland and France.

143
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,280


144
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,280


145
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,540
Springtime for Hitler and Germany.

146
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,680
Come on, Germans, go into your dance.

147
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,200
I was born in Dusseldorf, and that is why they call me Rolf.

148
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,900
Don't be stupid, be a smarty.

149
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,360
Come and join the Nazi party.

150
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,480
In short.

151
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,220
Your leaders are

152
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,220


153
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,220


154
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,220


155
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,220


156
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,360
Â¶Â¶

157
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:42,800
Â¶ Springtime for Hitler and Germany Â¶Â¶

158
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Â¶ Two steps, a new step today Â¶Â¶

159
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:57,140
Â¶ Bombs falling from the skies again Â¶Â¶

160
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:04,900
Â¶ When the land is on the rise again Â¶Â¶

161
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:11,720
Â¶ Springtime for Hitler and Germany Â¶Â¶

162
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:20,200
Â¶ New boats are sailing once more Â¶Â¶

163
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:27,820
Â¶ Springtime for Hitler and Germany Â¶Â¶

164
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,160
Â¶ Means that soon we'll be going Â¶Â¶

165
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,220
Â¶ We've got to be going Â¶Â¶

166
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,420
Â¶ We know we'll be going to war Â¶Â¶

167
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,840
Â¶ Vroom! Â¶Â¶

168
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,800
Â¶Â¶

169
00:12:48,800 --> 00:13:01,520
Â¶ I am a doctor. I do not fear Niki. Â¶Â¶

170
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,460
Â¶ That was a track called Â¶Â¶

171
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,640
Â¶ Don't Look at the Photon. Â¶Â¶

172
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,480
Â¶ Don't talk. Don't you dare Â¶Â¶

173
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,100
Â¶ I am a doctor. Â¶Â¶

174
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,780
Â¶ mention Niki in this studio. Â¶Â¶

175
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,160
Â¶ I am a doctor. Â¶Â¶

176
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,720
Â¶ Niki has been on my ass Â¶Â¶

177
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,040
Â¶ for the last nine days. Â¶Â¶

178
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,160
Â¶ What did you say? Â¶Â¶

179
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,780
Â¶ I am a doctor. Â¶Â¶

180
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,940
I do not fear need.

181
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,780
Boy, the girls are laughing at that, and you know what?

182
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,260
That's an old Buck Naked routine.

183
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,540
I stole that from Buck Naked, who now hates the church.

184
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,580
He thinks that evil people are in the church now.

185
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,360
Evil.

186
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,060
He has everyone who looks over at Dr. Lequeum, innocent, with his innocent little sweet baby face.

187
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

188
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,860
I am not an evil man.

189
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,220
I've got this really bad reputation as being an evil man.

190
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,360
But the fact is, I just do what has to be done.

191
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,800
Yeah, I mean.

192
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,920
He never killed anyone on purpose.

193
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,900
Can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs.

194
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,900
It's true.

195
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,740
It's true.

196
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,120
I mean, if you get a flat tire, you've got to change it.

197
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,700
And Lequeum, he's making one damn big omelet for Bob.

198
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,460
That's right.

199
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,440
Man, that omelet's going to feed 40,000 on that escape vessel.

200
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,640
Hey, if I've got to break a few eggs and make me that omelet,

201
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,500
hell, hand me the spatula and the pan full of grease.

202
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,100
I'll be glad to start cooking.

203
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,620
Hand me that pan full of brains.

204
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,440
Brains on drugs, and I'll get to frying.

205
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,240
We're going to need a lot of brains on drugs to make this omelet.

206
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,660
Ah, smell that brain on drugs cooking over there,

207
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,020
sizzling away in that grease.

208
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,040
Let's have some bacon with that.

209
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,260
I had a great mess of brains on drugs at Shoney's the other day

210
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,420
for all-you-can-eat breakfast.

211
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,200
Well, I had my brains on drugs hold the drugs.

212
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,900
I just had the brains.

213
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,260
Oh, if you're not going to eat them drugs, can I have them?

214
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,040
I'll have them in a Texas enchilada with a fried egg on top.

215
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,360
Uh, what?

216
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Hey, kids, you are listening.

217
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,900
This is not a tape.

218
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,520
This is actually happening live in your very ugly face, kids.

219
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,400
Very poor warm-up.

220
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
The Prince's We Are Dough.

221
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,340
The Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

222
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,180
Ha, ha, ha.

223
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,540
Yours truly, Chaz Smith and the Reverend Ivan Stang.

224
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,680
Live in your very face, kids.

225
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,540
Only here on ESO Radio.

226
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,360
That's right.

227
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,720
Only in the swamp.

228
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,680
And I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh,

229
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,300
I think Ivan is here on an evangelical sort of quest

230
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,780
to elucidate throughout the world.

231
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,120
About the evening.

232
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,540
The, uh, the final times.

233
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,560
He's hallucinating throughout the evening.

234
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,280
Oh, that's right.

235
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Yeah, we always end up starting to talk about

236
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,780
whatever the latest trendy drugs are that the kids are doing.

237
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,020
And we forget about Bob.

238
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,060
It starts with a candidate.

239
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,260
Forget about Bob.

240
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,640
Hey, it's so easy to forget Bob.

241
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,660
To leave Bob out of your life in today's,

242
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,560
the hustle and bustle of today's modern world.

243
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:07,920
Backslider.

244
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:08,980
Sure.

245
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,240
You know, it's like Bob ain't always breathing down your neck

246
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,500
like,

247
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,120
some messiahs I could probably mention.

248
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,620
But sometimes he's licking right up close to the back of your short hairs.

249
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,840
Well, now, yeah, he can kick Bob.

250
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,940
He can leave him behind you.

251
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,100
I've been goosed by the old pipe, pipe man myself.

252
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,860
He's left him straight along the line.

253
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,480
I've been goosed by the pipe.

254
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,760
That thing is hot.

255
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,480
You did go all the way, didn't you?

256
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,440
Uh, I don't like to talk about that.

257
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,460
You do want to talk about it.

258
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,420
No, I don't want to talk about it.

259
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,680
Oh, I saw your lips quivering.

260
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,560
No, that's because I'm red.

261
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,140
Come on, man.

262
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,140
You want to talk about it.

263
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,220
I'm hearing those voices again on my teeth.

264
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,300
Oh, well, that's because...

265
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,320
Or is that you?

266
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,200
No, that's not me.

267
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,840
Or is that your teeth?

268
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,340
No, that's not my teeth.

269
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,300
These are the new micro-nasal implants.

270
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,400
They go all the way back up beyond the septum right here.

271
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,360
And as they move, they start moving, by the way.

272
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,280
As they start moving, I guess you get more enlightenable.

273
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,240
Or at least get less in the dark.

274
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,600
Now, I saw an ad in Wired that said that those enhance telepathic linking ability.

275
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,620
Well, they're supposed to.

276
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,760
But so far, I can't even pick up...

277
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,960
I can't even pick up a good radio signal on them.

278
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,460
I've been trying to figure out what you guys have been thinking about all night,

279
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,600
but I haven't been able to do it.

280
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Well, we have.

281
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,480
I have a static generator.

282
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,360
You have a static generator?

283
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,360
Well, I have to.

284
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:24,940
I have to.

285
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,600
You know, it has to be...

286
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,780
Some of us aren't...

287
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,900
It has to be scrambled in case we're caught and interrogated.

288
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,120
Oh, no.

289
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,700
The froth, actually.

290
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,780
That's why Bob forces those of us who work closely with him

291
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,060
to...

292
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:47,180
to take a lot of the Havifrop, Zipulops medicine stuff.

293
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,120
In case we're interrogated, we can't remember what it was.

294
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,360
What any of it was.

295
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,460
At any point along the way.

296
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,280
It's the subgenius form of the flashy thing.

297
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
The flashy thing?

298
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,380
The flashy thing.

299
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,880
It's plausible denial, we call it.

300
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,760
Well, you guys was them guys that busted up all that stuff at Fort Meade

301
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,140
with the D.I.N. and everything.

302
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,920
I heard them remote viewers was all over the place looking.

303
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,040
Looking up everybody's buttholes.

304
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,840
And then along came the big static plongo.

305
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And that was you guys.

306
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,080
You turned them off one night in June.

307
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,220
Some year, 1990, whatever.

308
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,480
Yeah, back in them days, we were pretty anti-establishment.

309
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,920
But now you are the establishment, aren't you?

310
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,060
Well, no, we're the official anti-establishment now.

311
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,140
The establishment is anti-establishment.

312
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,560
Right.

313
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,500
Right, yes, the authorized anti-establishment.

314
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,960
You know, before...

315
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,820
Before us, it was, what, rave, I think.

316
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,640
Before that, it was, what, punk, and then that hippie thing.

317
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,220
There's always some authorized anti-establishment.

318
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,020
Establishment.

319
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,440
Enjoy.

320
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,820
Yes.

321
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,720
Have fun.

322
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,520
It's been great, actually.

323
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,840
They pay us quite well.

324
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,940
Every subgenius address goes to the CIA and MTV

325
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,400
and all of those other federal agencies.

326
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,880
Oh, the big, big monochronos.

327
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,400
NPR.

328
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,720
PPN.

329
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,200
The DIA, once again.

330
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,660
Melantel.

331
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,540
I was there.

332
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,180
I was there.

333
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:16,660
The DMZ.

334
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,100
I did a bunch of DMZ the other night,

335
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,020
and I would not recommend that to the amateurs.

336
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah, me and Stubblebine was trying to raise spoons with our eyelids.

337
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,180
We had a whole cabal of colonels and some kind of witchcrafts in there,

338
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,540
and we were just moving things around like nothing until that thing went off.

339
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,240
That's that LED, isn't it?

340
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,740
Well, these guys used to do a nightclub act

341
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,040
where they would bend the little spoons with their eyelids.

342
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,440
Yeah, and then we'd bend over.

343
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,240
And that was how they got the job with the CIA.

344
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
And that's why I know Dave.

345
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,840
That's where we met, in a little CIA lab.

346
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,800
They were studying him.

347
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,200
Oh, no.

348
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,500
Yeah, we had wild talent.

349
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,020
We loved him.

350
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,460
That's interesting.

351
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,980
That's really interesting.

352
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,320
Uh-huh.

353
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah, the subject, you can see the subject is very pliable, of course.

354
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,940
And it's very easy to control with a microorganism.

355
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,420
Once it's not only a neurotransmitter,

356
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,320
but after a period of time, the brain will begin to degenerate

357
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,720
until it's nothing but a little shh.

358
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,640
A little stinky pile in the back of the cerebral cortex.

359
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,240
Nothing but some rotted dopamine,

360
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:23,920
which Professor Smith and I usually scrape up off of the operating table.

361
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,060
And smoke, actually.

362
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,440
It's not a bad smoke.

363
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,520
We mix it with Vorkham Rift.

364
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,340
Melititious.

365
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,060
Scrambled, scrambled Vorkham Rift with the little brain left over.

366
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,100
Sprinkled over some scrambled brains on drugs.

367
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,020
It's an exit.

368
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,700
Excellent.

369
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,760
Excellent.

370
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,700
Absolutely excellent.

371
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,540
But it makes your accent float a lot of the place.

372
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:47,920
It makes you...

373
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,600
So you don't even know what country you're from.

374
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,640
In fact, it takes a long time to figure what country you're from.

375
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,480
It takes...

376
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,380
In fact, sometimes it takes minutes to figure what country you're coming from.

377
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,580
What place you're going to.

378
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,980
Sometimes you never figure out where you're going.

379
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,240
You wander around and around and around.

380
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,780
I'm not sure where I am.

381
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,040
I'm not sure where I am.

382
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,000
How about here?

383
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,000


384
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,000


385
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,000


386
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,700
Ah, hello, my.

387
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,480
You're not here right now.

388
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,020
I can see you, but it's not you.

389
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,520
I am not here.

390
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,880
You are not where you think you are.

391
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,200
You are in the wrong place.

392
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,240
No, no, no, no.

393
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,960
Look at this.

394
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,260
This is Mr. and Mrs. Grown-Up Stumps.

395
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,300
This is the prenuptial agreement,

396
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,260
and it is guaranteed for exactly as long as the implants,

397
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,520
the nasal implants...

398
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:43,860
Micronasal.

399
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,980
Oh, micronasal implants.

400
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,640
Is that what you're selling?

401
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,680
Top of the line.

402
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,500
You can drop the fake accent and all that stuff now.

403
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,200
Yeah, I'll get down to it already.

404
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,640
Well, okay.

405
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,260
Well, we might as well get down to business.

406
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,340
Micronasal implants.

407
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,980
We're talking nano, too.

408
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,240
We're talking these things will also move laterally, up and down.

409
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,240
They'll reach right out of the old nostril and intertwine,

410
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,460
I've been given to understand.

411
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,600
You can do the Yeti style, nasal hair, intertwining, sex.

412
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,720
I wouldn't want to try, but yes, it is written in.

413
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,900
Yes, and these also have been known to explode.

414
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,720
I ain't never tried it.

415
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,360
Let's put it that way.

416
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,840
Then they will flow all through the body.

417
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,680
What?

418
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,600
They explode, yes.

419
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,320
Yeah, well, some of them do that.

420
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:28,760
That's true.

421
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,200
It is possible.

422
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,820
Does that come with the squeegee blistex?

423
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,620
Hey!

424
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,940
You think I cannot see?

425
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,820
Like father.

426
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,020
The minute you walked in the joint.

427
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,580
Like sons.

428
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,820
Now he's in trouble.

429
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,320
We refuse to be responsible.

430
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,260
Flop, flop, fizz, fizz.

431
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,580
We have a call back for eight seconds.

432
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,060
Two seconds.

433
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,660
Negative, Kay.

434
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,220
Nothing further.

435
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,960
Just see the cabbie on the corner.

436
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,680
Hey, Nani Nani.

437
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,540
She fell from the sky.

438
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,640
She fell very far.

439
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,920
She fell very far.

440
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,960
You cannot petition!

441
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,380
Send the line with prayer!

442
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,360
When I take out my big tennis.

443
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,260
Howdy.

444
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,380
Future events such as these

445
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,820
will affect you in the future.

446
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,020
Good morning.

447
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,280
Oh, good morning.

448
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,640
Um, do you want to come upstairs?

449
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:47,400
Hooray!

450
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,720
Hooray!

451
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,700
In which we're examining the Ten Commandments.

452
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,140
So, what do you think?

453
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,440
There are places in Argentina where they will actually serve the human brain.

454
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:12,880
They'll actually get a human being with a hole, a table with a hole cut in the middle,

455
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,140
and they'll put the human under the table, just his head sticking up, and he can bash

456
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,060
his head open, crack it.

457
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,200
Well, they have special crackers.

458
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,460
Right.

459
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,900
With a big, like a giant nutcracker.

460
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,900
Kind of like a big Humpty Dumpty ant.

461
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,140
Right, and then he can scoop out the fresh human brain, right, then and there.

462
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,660
While he's alive.

463
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,480
While he's still kicking.

464
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,200
He's still, still, sort of.

465
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,440
He's still a kick.

466
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,080
He kills them pretty quick.

467
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,640
It's more of a twitch.

468
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,900
Yeah, but they're still hot.

469
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,000
Yeah, still warm.

470
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:33,700
98?

471
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,360
98.6 degrees.

472
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,280
Mm-mm.

473
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,820
Farm fresh, yeah.

474
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,740
They grow them down there special, too.

475
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,660
Oh, humans.

476
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,120
Well, anyway, this is.

477
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,500
This is 98.6.

478
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,860
Oh, this is that radio station that you're listening to and not whichever one they're

479
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,080
talking about right now.

480
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,600
Well, actually it is WMUH.

481
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,720
Oh, no, no, it's not.

482
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,680
It was recorded in Allentown.

483
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,020
You're just.

484
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,920
You're just on WMUH.

485
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,820
What the hell are we doing here on a Sunday night?

486
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,240
We left our.

487
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,780
We sure as hell aren't taking our antidepressants.

488
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,980
No, sir.

489
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,760
We left them home.

490
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,740
No, sir, ma'am.

491
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,900
Not on this show.

492
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,960
Threw those out.

493
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,800
That's right.

494
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,780
Threw those out with the E. coli ridden beef.

495
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,060
That's right.

496
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,840
We had to do it.

497
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,800
Hey, man, the E. coli is the best part.

498
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,260
Well, for some people.

499
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,540
You know, we figured out.

500
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,440
The wimps would get sick.

501
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:28,180
We figured out who poisoned all those 25 billion head of cattle in Nebraska, and so they're

502
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,180


503
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,180


504
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,180


505
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,180


506
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,180


507
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,360
going to have to wait until the end of the month to get it back.

508
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:28,820
We saw the banger.

509
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:28,820


510
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:28,820


511
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:28,820


512
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:28,820


513
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:28,820


514
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,840
We wanted to make sure that Burger King could not sell burgers for a day and lost $10 million.

515
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,500
The culprit, needless to say, McDonald's.

516
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,500
I was on the.

517
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,900
This is all alleged, right.

518
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,300
This isn't alleged.

519
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,100
No, this is obvious.

520
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,840
This is damned obvious.

521
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,660
I pulled up.

522
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,540
I pulled up.

523
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:50,800
Wrong.

524
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,440
It was Burger King did it to themselves so they could make it look like McDonald's.

525
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,100
They could make it look like McDonald's.

526
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,160
And they're saying it's all wrong.

527
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,160


528
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,580
Oops, that's where I have to flip that tape.

529
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,980
Oh, no way, man.

530
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,940
Think about it.

531
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,720
I know who it was.

532
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,700
It was all them mom-and-pop hamburger joints all got together,

533
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,860
and they formed a conspiracy of mom-and-pop hamburger joints.

534
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,380
A monopoly of mom-and-pop independent hamburger joints.

535
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,980
They're trying to pit McDonald's against Burger King for the final war.

536
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,200
Or Armageddon.

537
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,040
Gog versus Magog.

538
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,040
I just thought of something.

539
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,820
It's always all about organized labor.

540
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,480
You think it's a coincidence that those UPS workers wore brown shirts?

541
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,060
Well, do you think it's a coincidence that the conspiracy is trying to convince people

542
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,920
that it's good to labor and that it's good to be organized,

543
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,200
and then the organized labor is somehow even better?

544
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,260
And people swallow this.

545
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:51,980
They go for it.

546
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,940
Oh, yeah, I'd love to go work.

547
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,220
Yep.

548
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,420
For someone else for eight hours a day.

549
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
I'd love to do that.

550
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,540
It seems like the most natural thing in the world.

551
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,240
That's what you have to do to pay your rent and be a decent person, right?

552
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,720
I hope not.

553
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,760
Well, we're trying to prove that it's not necessary.

554
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,340
Just a few fools standing up against the Goliath trying to knock him on his ass.

555
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,380
That's why you need Bob.

556
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,760
That's why you need a wife that works in a color TV.

557
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,840
Listeners at home.

558
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,000
Yeah.

559
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,300
Or at least a TV and a colored wife who works.

560
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,560
Listeners at home, don't think that you work.

561
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,460
You don't work.

562
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,620
You only think you work.

563
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,820
I work.

564
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,480
Bob works.

565
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,560
Ivan Stang works.

566
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,540
Dr. Lagoon works.

567
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,220
We work to fight the conspiracy.

568
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:39,980
What do you do?

569
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,280
Just sit on your fat asses.

570
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,360
And the funny thing is the kind of work we do, it's just like playing.

571
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,180
It's just like playing with ourselves.

572
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,020
Yeah.

573
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,900
We get paid to literally play with ourselves.

574
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,180
To play with our...

575
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,720
Our own brains.

576
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,880
Don't get the wrong idea.

577
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,760
No, this is a family show.

578
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,560
Yeah, our brains are located between our legs.

579
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,240
But that's a...

580
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,260
Until we all get together.

581
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:03,760
Beside the point.

582
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,800
The anatomy lessons for next week.

583
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,200
Yeah.

584
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:06,960
Tune in then.

585
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,540
You will learn about these special glands and their proper location.

586
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,020
You sure are a pretty man, Reverend Stang.

587
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,280
Yeah.

588
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,400
He gets real nervous.

589
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,440
I've been saying that to him for a long time now.

590
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,480
He always gets a little nervous when I say that.

591
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,780
I mean, face it.

592
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,560
It's because I know you're serious.

593
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,160
You know he likes it.

594
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,940
You know he loves it.

595
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,160
You think he would dress that way?

596
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,960
He's asking for it.

597
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,000
That's what he's doing.

598
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,260
Wandering around in that little short cocktail dress.

599
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,340
He asked for it, Your Honor.

600
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,340
It was Moses, a king of men.

601
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,160
Moses, children.

602
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,800
But, Your Honor, he enjoyed it too.

603
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,540
I know he was under the influence.

604
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,160
I know.

605
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,060
I've seen him swallow a whole load of Gleet just before I picked him up.

606
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:10,280
Next thing you know, there he is, all strung out on Gleet and ready to lift his little pink cocktail dress up for anybody with a nickel.

607
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,720
Was that American Gleet or was that German Gleet?

608
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,060
Oh, man.

609
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,060
Nine hits of German Gleet.

610
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,960
Case dismissed.

611
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,740
Twelve hits of Dobstown Gleet.

612
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,440
Oh, yeah.

613
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,160
Well, you don't need twelve hits.

614
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,160


615
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,760
Twelve molecules of Dobstown Gleet.

616
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,540
I think General Ripper found out about your pre-verses.

617
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,340
That's all I have.

618
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,340
We're organizing some kind of mutiny of pre-verts.

619
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,260
A mutiny of pre-verts, friends.

620
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,400
That's the church of the subgenius.

621
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,240
Pre-verts and pre-anticipatory Gleet.

622
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,040
Right.

623
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,660
Go together.

624
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,420
I think there's some kind of deviated pre-vert.

625
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,020
Let them look.

626
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,940
I'm proud of who I am.

627
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,120
Let them look.

628
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,900
I'm proud of who I am.

629
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,360
Let them look.

630
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,180
One hundred percent first quality copper blind beef.

631
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,660
One hundred percent first quality copper blind beef.

632
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,180
One hundred percent first quality copper blind beef.

633
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,360
But then we have that other tape that we can't play because you would be offended.

634
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,920
I was offended.

635
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,140
That's why I play it over and over again.

636
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,580
over again.

637
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,460
But then,

638
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,660
I'm a sub-G.

639
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,540
The sickest part is,

640
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,040
and the saddest part is,

641
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,160
that there are no cuss words in it.

642
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,080
We can play it on the air,

643
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,600
and yet we can't.

644
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,640
That's right.

645
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,480
Funny how that works here in America.

646
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,740
Yeah, here in...

647
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,240
Here in America,

648
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,660
where a man can lose his right

649
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,200
to speak out in public.

650
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,920
That's right.

651
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,040
Hey, Lagoon.

652
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,760
You can lose your right

653
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,080
to speak out in public.

654
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:50,740
Chill out.

655
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,740
Don't you tell me to chill out,

656
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,440
you bastard.

657
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,080
Oh, yeah, that's right.

658
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,780
That cop.

659
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,700
That cop bastard.

660
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,200
I hope he's out there listening.

661
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,600
Oh, for those...

662
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,240
Tells me I gotta chill out.

663
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,320
For those of you who...

664
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,680
When was there a law

665
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,120
that said I had to chill out?

666
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,920
The hell with that bastard.

667
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,480
I hope he gets shot by a crack dealer.

668
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,180
I don't know if you noticed,

669
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,760
but the last time I checked,

670
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,860
the law was,

671
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,640
no sub-genius can do anything it wants.

672
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,920
Get that?

673
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,540
Yeah.

674
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,700
No sub-genius

675
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,340
can do anything it wants.

676
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,320
That is the law

677
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
as it stands

678
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,580
in the United States today.

679
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,280
He may not like it.

680
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,960
I sure as hell don't like it,

681
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,920
but you better live with it

682
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,300
or else you better believe

683
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,520
the man will pull a David Koresh on you.

684
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,060
He will...

685
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,880
He will ruby ridge you

686
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,540
before you have time to turn around.

687
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,400
For those of you at home

688
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,300
who've been following along,

689
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,140
just so you know

690
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,980
what we're talking about

691
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,760
recently this week,

692
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,100
Dr. Lagoon was issued

693
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,960
a verbal warning

694
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,620
by an undercover police officer

695
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,720
in a Kmart

696
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,800
for disturbing the peace

697
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,680
by uttering the following words.

698
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,880
Customer service

699
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,860
to the furniture department.

700
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,520
The surviving freaks

701
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,620
who seemed immune to the plague

702
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,720
I decided to receive

703
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,500
as an object lesson

704
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,500
in how far human kicks can go.

705
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,300
I read it.

706
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,380
I read me.

707
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,300
I read the captain of the South Coast

708
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,680
by writing

709
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:44,680


710
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:44,680


711
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:44,680


712
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:44,780
the Revelation of the Opportunity

713
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:44,780


714
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:44,780


715
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:44,780


716
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:44,780


717
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:44,900
There wasn't

718
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:44,900


719
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:44,900


720
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,480
The lies were alwaysé¸ã¦ÑITEÑ the rumors that happened in the past.

Thank you.

725

Thank you.

726
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,580
Thank you.

727
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,260
Thank you.

728
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,380
Thank you.

729
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,600
Thank you.

730
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,160
Did you really sign it?

731
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,060
Is there like a chitin-

732
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,640
Yeah, it's okay, hun.

733
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,180
They've got what I need!

734
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,600
You love me, don't you?

735
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,000
Don't you- If you love me,

736
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,000
you'll let me get my bug porn!

737
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,620
You just don't understand me!

738
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,860
No, I don't understand a bugman!

739
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,620
I am president of the

740
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,160
General Merchant Diaspora

741
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,760
In school, they called me

742
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,780
Needle-Pud!

743
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,840
Yeah, I can see why that is!

744
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,020
Yeah, man, that's a funny-looking little thing

745
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,980
I ever saw!

746
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,920
Hey, you don't need to show that, though,

747
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,960
right now. Put that back.

748
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,920
Just- just-

749
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:08,980
Oops!

750
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,480
Oh, well, look!

751
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,280
I have, uh,

752
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,960
a privacy case.

753
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,600
Uh, got an oxygen case.

754
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,440
Got a bug-

755
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,780
bug porn case.

756
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,760
I've got a, uh,

757
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,720
a waiver

758
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,560
from the Euclid High School.

759
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,940
Says I've got a-

760
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,080
I've got a right to the- to the mantis.

761
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,760
I've got a right to the- to the

762
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,020
doodle bug. I've got a- got a right to-

763
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,180
to the purple wing, the lady bug.

764
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,540
I've got a- got, uh,

765
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,300
I'm supposed to be able to have the ghost

766
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,940
and the space ghost, the purple.

767
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,980
And, uh, the-

768
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,760
the- the- the- the sex

769
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,320
cadet brand, uh,

770
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,040
the nine to five. I'm supposed to get,

771
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,080
uh, I'm supposed to have a right to,

772
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,120
uh, an oxygen case.

773
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
It's privacy. I left a legal notice

774
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,420
in the paper, uh,

775
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,260
about the, uh,

776
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,860
it's the, uh, the- the-

777
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,740
the radio brain death case.

778
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,180
Yeah, they're watching you, man.

779
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,760
Uh, no, no,

780
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,020
it's a privacy case. They're not allowed to read

781
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,060
my mind and then rebroadcast it

782
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,600
over the radio when I least expect it.

783
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,740
Okay, when we see, uh, we-

784
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,380
They're like faking my voice.

785
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,800
Yeah, look, see- It's not really me

786
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,080
that's thinking anymore.

787
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,880
Yeah, like he's- he's- he's telling you

788
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,040
the whole thing, man. Like, he- watch him, watch him.

789
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,840
He's going on, he's going on. I've got a right to the-

790
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,020
They're supposed to give me the- the- the-

791
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,640
the bug photography,

792
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,520
uh, micro photography, encephalograms.

793
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,700
So that's the guy? You think that's the guy?

794
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,960
Uh, the, uh, insectoid, uh,

795
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,860
replicant, uh- That's him?

796
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,840
uh, paper, the blotter, the- the 93s,

797
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,680
the llama, the mountain lion.

798
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,420
Yes, yes, yes, yes, uh-huh.

799
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,200
I'm supposed to get a- an oxygen case.

800
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,600
Do you need to talk anymore? Do you need to see him anymore?

801
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,440
I've got a privacy case. I had the, uh-

802
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,140
I left the personal. You're positive.

803
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,840
It's not number two.

804
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,700
You do recognize his voice on the phone,

805
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,540
and that's when he exposed himself.

806
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,160
Yes, it's been terrifying me.

807
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,160
He leaves these messages on and on,

808
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,620
and it's- it's very aggravating.

809
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,940
It's frightening, actually. He's just talking-

810
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,240
Reverend Ivan Strong, Ivan Wang,

811
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,100
uh, Schnig, yes, something like that.

812
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,720
I know the dog, Ivan Wang.

813
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,640
Yes. Well, uh, you'll have to-

814
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,000
we're gonna have to do a complaint, if you wanna do anything

815
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,140
about it, because if not, uh, there's no way I can get

816
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,760
a restraining order or an injunction against him.

817
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,240
I'll be perfectly willing to make out the paperwork for you

818
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,160
if you need that, because it's- it's really been

819
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,920
frightening for me, very, very, very

820
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,120
frightening for me. Alright, ma'am, just calm down, relax,

821
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,840
put your knees together, that's right,

822
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,400
and breathe deeply through your nose.

823
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,980
Put your thumbs,

824
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,140
put your thumbs in your ears.

825
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,600
Oh, that's great.

826
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,700
I will have you say nothing about my thumbs.

827
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,160
My thumbs are not pretty.

828
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,920
Don't talk about my thumbs.

829
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,160
Hey, look, lady,

830
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,740
I see these people every day, you know, like,

831
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,480
you come in here, you're making a couple of guys-

832
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,580
why would a man call you up?

833
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,000
You're a 78-year-old.

834
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,680
I have a right to the privacy of my own thumbs.

835
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,100
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a special

836
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,580
news bulletin. All you over

837
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,680
are idiots.

838
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,060
Which is through we made.

839
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,240
Here, you little puke.

840
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,380
And for you, Reverend Stringy.

841
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,180
Yeah, Trugy.

842
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,880
We're waiting

843
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,620

844
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,540
We're waiting for you, Sting.

845
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,160
We're waiting for you, Sting.

846
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,440
Leaning,

847
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,600
leaning,

848
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,900
safe and

849
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,640
secure

850
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
from all

851
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,400
alarms.

852
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,300
Leaning,

853
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,520
leaning,

854
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,260
leaning,

855
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,560
leaning

856
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,040

857
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,020
arms.

858
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,120
What a

859
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,960

860
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,180
what a

861
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,380
joy divine.

862
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,500
Leaning

863
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,600

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,760
blessedness,

870
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,660
Leaning on

00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,400

00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,400
arms.

873
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,620
I thank God,

874
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,640
every day,

875
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,560

Cattle flesh,

I thank God

00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:45,720


906
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:45,720


907
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,920
been doing

908
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,260
for

909
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:49,640
you.

910
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,580
I thank God

911
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:51,900
for

912
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:51,980
all the

913
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,120
things that

914
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,120


915
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,120


916
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,120


917
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,760
I thank God

918
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,220
for

919
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:55,420
all the

920
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:55,640
things that

921
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:55,960
I've been

922
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:55,980
doing for

923
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:55,980


924
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,000
you.

925
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:43,260
I thank God

926
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:43,340
for

927
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:43,340


928
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:43,340


929
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,540
I've been

930
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:45,540


931
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:45,880
you.

932
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,300
I thank God

933
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:48,300


934
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:48,300


935
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,100
things that

936
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,160
I've been

937
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:49,200
doing for

938
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:49,220
you.

939
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,320
I thank God

940
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,260
for

941
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,620
all the

942
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,320
things that

943
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,540
I've been

944
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:07,640
doing for

945
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:07,880
you.

946
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,680
I thank God

947
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:08,680


948
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:08,860
all the

949
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,120
things that

950
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,460
I've

951
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:10,720
been

952
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:10,820
doing for

953
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:10,840
you.

954
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,860
I know what I'd do if I had a pair of moon pants on right now.

955
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,760
We know how to party around here.

956
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,360
Around where I come from, we know how to party.

957
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,740
There's a party in my moon pants.

958
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,780
It's a big old party, doctor, like you have moon pants, and you ain't there, are you?

959
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,460
And I bet you're thanking Bob that you ain't there.

960
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,720
I certainly am.

961
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,820
That's a disgusting sight.

962
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,300
Look at that.

963
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,120
It looks like a bag full of guinea pigs.

964
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,260
Or pants weasels.

965
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,920
I wear my moon pants proudly.

966
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,960
Sure, I know that there are those of you out there who hide in the closet with their moon pants on,

967
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,820
never to bring their moon pants out of the closet and show them to the world.

968
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:01,940
Why them?

969
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,900
Just walk bust out of that closet wearing them moon pants.

970
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,240
Stride through the mall wearing them moon pants.

971
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,780
Pull those moon pants off and wear them on your head.

972
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:13,900
Yes.

973
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,020
If you ain't chicken.

974
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,900
Unless you're fried.

975
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,820
Afraid your mom's gonna find out.

976
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:24,260
Unless you're afraid that you might get in trouble.

977
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:31,460
Well, maybe you're afraid that everybody around you will not approve of your moon pants.

978
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,740
What's the matter, chicken?

979
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:37,960
No, you see people all over the TV running around wearing moon pants.

980
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,960
Oh, yeah, nobody makes a big deal about that.

981
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,320
Right.

982
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,260
But there shall come a day.

983
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,800
There shall come a day.

984
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,920
When you will emerge from your cocoon.

985
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,840
And you will stand up.

986
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,160
And you will cry out with pride.

987
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,520
I have moon pants.

988
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,960
But I am still a man.

989
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,960
Damn you.

990
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,960
Damn you.

991
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,020
And you will stand there in your moon pants.

992
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,020
And they shall laugh at you.

993
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,780
And they shall point their bony little fingers at you.

994
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,340
And.

995
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:22,160
That little bit of dignity that you may have had for a moment will be stripped away as they pointed you in a laugh.

996
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:22,440
And say.

997
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,120
Hey, there's that moon pants boy.

998
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,660
Oh, yeah.

999
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,460
But don't worry.

1000
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,220
Don't despair.

1001
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,680
One day others shall come.

1002
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,040
And they too shall wear moon pants.

1003
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,660
And soon you shall be a mighty moon panted army.

1004
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,060
Ready to come down and take your place.

1005
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,000
In polite society.

1006
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,520
Wow, what a sight.

1007
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,360
Doctor.

1008
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:46,780
Like you.

1009
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,700
What are moon pants?

1010
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,020
They're pants like the astronauts wore to the moon.

1011
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,420
I've always worn moon pants.

1012
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,800
I've been to the moon.

1013
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,240
But I didn't wear any pants.

1014
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,360
Oh, you've been to the schoolyard and you didn't wear any pants.

1015
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:13,200
I just let my manhood hang loose and walked up to one of them big dare craters on the moon.

1016
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:13,700
Woohoo!

1017
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,340
Oh, yeah.

1018
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:22,140
Well, on a good night with a good telescope, you can see the gleet from here.

1019
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:22,720
Woohoo!

1020
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,260
Yeah.

1021
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,360
The gleet that stains the front of your moon pants.

1022
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,680
With that icicle poking against the front of the moon.

1023
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,460
That icicle-like object poking.

1024
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,920
Pressing outwards against the front of the moon pants.

1025
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,780
That frozen...

1026
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,480
Well, of course, that's if you...

1027
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,960
Compromise the seam.

1028
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,340
Compromise the seam.

1029
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:46,340


1030
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,760
The moon pants in a vacuum.

1031
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,540
Of course, you're inviting serious trouble.

1032
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,320
And, oh, sure, there may be gleet.

1033
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,980
But it's going to be tinkly little hard gleets.

1034
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,320
The moon is made of green gleet.

1035
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:57,600
Shatter.

1036
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,800
That shatter when they hit the ground.

1037
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,900
The moon is made of green gleet.

1038
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,920
Soon the vacuum shall suck every drop of gleet from your body.

1039
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,840
Yes, soon.

1040
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,600
Soon the gleet will explode from you.

1041
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,020
With tragic results.

1042
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:13,320
With tragic results.

1043
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,840
Without compromisation.

1044
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,320
It's the latest...

1045
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,220
It's the latest form of illicit sex that teens are into.

1046
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,640
That's right.

1047
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,780
Don't put those moon pants in your mouth, children.

1048
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,800
You don't know where they've been.

1049
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,020
To compromise and breach the vacuum seal of the moon pants or not.

1050
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,180
That's your choice.

1051
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,600
Expose yourself to the vacuum.

1052
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:43,500
Just as you would expose yourself to the schoolyard.

1053
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,580
Oh.

1054
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,220
Oh.

1055
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,420
I went to the moon and I didn't wear my moon pants.

1056
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,660
Don't be like me.

1057
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:57,300
And don't be like little Timmy.

1058
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:02,840
Don't be like little Timmy with a huge gleet exit wound in the middle of his belly.

1059
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,100
Where the gleet was prematurely sucked out by the vacuum.

1060
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,780
Yes, as if aborted by Mother Nature herself.

1061
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,480
Help me.

1062
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,320
As if...

1063
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,880
As if you were...

1064
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,420
As if you were in a...

1065
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,260
In an airplane.

1066
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:22,200
A jet airplane flying at 40,000 feet and it suddenly kicked out the emergency doorway

1067
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,980
and unzipped at the same time.

1068
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,620
Uh...

1069
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,420
Gleet decompression.

1070
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,700
Oh, it's a painful thing.

1071
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,820
And you can avoid gleet decompression.

1072
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,800
Just send $30.

1073
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,020
$30.

1074
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,860
1403-06 Dallas, Texas 75-1.

1075
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1076
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1077
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1078
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1079
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1080
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1081
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1082
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1083
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1084
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1085
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1086
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1087
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1088
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1089
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:45,860


1090
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:54,120
Did you ever notice that the sacred post office box number of the Church of the Subgenius 140306

1091
00:49:54,120 --> 00:50:01,940
can actually be turned into sort of a sentence in words in that 306 looks sort of like B-O-B.

1092
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,400
A big B, an O, and a little b.

1093
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,220
Okay?

1094
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,640
Now the 140 looks kind of like I-4.

1095
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:10,880
Okay?

1096
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,000
I-4-O-Bob.

1097
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,440
140306 equals I-4-O-Bob.

1098
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,100
I-4-O-Bob.

1099
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,700
I-4-O-Bob.

1100
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,560
I...

1101
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,460
And how much do you owe Bob?

1102
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:27,960
I...

1103
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,600
Do you owe him your children?

1104
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:30,740
No.

1105
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,640
I-4-O-Bob.

1106
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,380
Do you owe him your life?

1107
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:34,720
No.

1108
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,280
I-4-O-Bob.

1109
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,100
Do you even owe him honesty?

1110
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,180
No.

1111
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:38,960
No.

1112
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,720
But we do know what you do, O-Bob.

1113
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,420
I-4-O-Bob.

1114
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:42,480
I-4-O-Bob.

1115
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:42,480


1116
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:42,480


1117
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:42,480


1118
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:42,480


1119
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:42,480


1120
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:42,580
I-4-O-Bob.

1121
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,320
You owe Bob...

1122
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:45,640
$30.

1123
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,880
$30.

1124
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:47,820
$30.

1125
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,420
A mere 30 clams, dear friends.

1126
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:53,320
Ballons.

1127
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,280
But anyway, I'm sorry.

1128
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,880
We do have a letter from Mrs. I think it was a...

1129
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,020
It was a...

1130
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:00,520
Not a current check.

1131
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:04,300
It was Mrs. Korna Hiltz of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

1132
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:11,580
And she says, once we accept Bob Irvingstang, then will all our troubles and problems go

1133
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:11,840
away.

1134
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:12,980
I happen to be a member of the family of Bob Irvingstang.

1135
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:12,980


1136
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:12,980


1137
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:12,980


1138
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:12,980


1139
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:12,980


1140
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:12,980


1141
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:12,980


1142
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:12,980


1143
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:12,980


1144
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:12,980


1145
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:18,340
I have a severely retarded 13-year-old child who makes a house, a mess of my house every

1146
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,460
day and who has beat me three or four times.

1147
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:28,100
If I accept Bob into my heart, will I find some sort of recompense for my earthly problems?

1148
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,600
Well, Mrs. Klepski...

1149
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,020
Yes.

1150
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,060
I think it was...

1151
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:33,400
Your...

1152
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:34,800
Your...

1153
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,220
Your...

1154
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,360
Bob isn't here to answer your question, but...

1155
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,520
No, he isn't.

1156
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,540
But...

1157
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,800
He could be.

1158
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,160
He could be.

1159
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,080
And we don't care.

1160
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,100
No, we don't.

1161
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:50,700
So why don't you just go away and shove it, Mrs. Klepski.

1162
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:50,880
Klepski.

1163
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,760
And deal with your problems yourself.

1164
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,640
Bob is not here for you to lean on.

1165
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,600
He's not some...

1166
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:56,740
That's right.

1167
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,640
This isn't the crutch of the subgenius.

1168
00:51:59,720 --> 00:51:59,860
Here, take this.

1169
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,580
No, it isn't.

1170
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,800
It certainly is not.

1171
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:01,980
Yeah.

1172
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,320
Demons hate noises here, Commander.

1173
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,300
That's absolutely right.

1174
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,760
And some...

1175
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,020
I can't...

1176
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,860
I can't see you out, foul demon.

1177
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,500
I can't see you out, foul demon.

1178
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:10,500


1179
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:10,500


1180
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:10,500


1181
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,320
That's absolutely right.

1182
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,200
All right, we have another letter.

1183
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:20,460
This one is from a man named Harry Corn of Farmington, Maryland, or MD.

1184
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,440
Maybe he's a doctor.

1185
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:21,940
I don't know.

1186
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,580
And he says, I have...

1187
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:29,520
I'm severely stricken with the gout and with lesions all over my entire body.

1188
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,540
Will Bob...

1189
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,140
Can Bob...

1190
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,060
I would...

1191
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,100
I think he would be saying, can Bob cure me?

1192
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,020
Gout?

1193
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,280
Love it or leave it, buddy.

1194
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,600
Learn to live with it.

1195
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,480
Quit complaining.

1196
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:40,480


1197
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:40,480


1198
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:40,480


1199
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:40,780
Quit complaining.

1200
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:42,940
That's...

1201
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,960
And that's good advice for anyone, I would think.

1202
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,620
Well, do we...

1203
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,860
Should we take some more letters now, or should we go on?

1204
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,180
What do you think?

1205
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:49,520
Sure.

1206
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,080
Go ahead.

1207
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,280
Do you have any...

1208
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,600
Oh, actually, I'm going to go...

1209
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:54,800
Did you already think you had some questions?

1210
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,480
I'm going to go flip the scrambled brains on drugs over in the other room.

1211
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,260
I'll be right back.

1212
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:00,840
Okay.

1213
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,440
Also, we have the Princess We Are Dough.

1214
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:10,460
And while the Reverend Ivan Stang is having his parts washed in the ceremony, we have

1215
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:10,460


1216
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,280
the Princess We Are Dough.

1217
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,220
And we'll be having the anointments with oils in a little while, and we'll be blessing you

1218
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:16,700
on the air.

1219
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,220
I have another question.

1220
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,720
Well, a letter from Mr. Stark Pudd.

1221
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,620
Mr. Pudd?

1222
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,960
Mr. Stark Pudd of Angry Lane, Virginia.

1223
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:28,620
Yes.

1224
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,120
And he says, I've taken Bob into my heart.

1225
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,760
What the hell do I do now?

1226
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,280
I can't get him out of there.

1227
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,100
Well, that's a very interesting situation to be in, Mr. Pudd.

1228
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,440
I'm going to go flip the scrambled brains on drugs over in the other room.

1229
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:40,440


1230
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:40,440


1231
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:40,440


1232
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:40,440


1233
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:40,440


1234
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:40,440


1235
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:40,440


1236
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:40,440


1237
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:46,120
One of the things that you can do is just let Bob get bigger and bigger and bigger

1238
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,360
and bigger inside your heart.

1239
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:52,860
And you see, that way, your heart will continue to get bigger and bigger and bigger, and the

1240
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:57,520
power of the luck plane of Bob will fill and consume your heart.

1241
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,380
There you go.

1242
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:02,800
This will be definitely a positive force in your life.

1243
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,240
I can see how it would really work.

1244
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,300
And you've done so much work for the church yourself.

1245
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:08,880
Now, I do...

1246
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,800
We have one more.

1247
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,260
Thank you.

1248
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:10,980
Thank you, Dave.

1249
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,180
We have one more letter.

1250
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,100
We're not going to go too many more letters, because I know that the Reverend Stinky does

1251
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,340
not, especially during the ceremonial...

1252
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:19,880
I'm sorry.

1253
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:20,680
I've got a tongue tied.

1254
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:26,800
The washing of parts and the Holy Oils Anointments does not like to read letters, because he

1255
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,260
gets the Holy Oils on the letters and can't read them.

1256
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:29,720
Yes.

1257
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,120
Yes.

1258
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,920
But we will try and see...

1259
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,500
Take one more before the break comes up.

1260
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,780
And this one is from Firm Hamoose.

1261
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,820
Firm Hamoose.

1262
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:39,780
Firm Hamoose.

1263
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,200
Firm Hamoose.

1264
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,080
Firm Hamoose of Jersey City, New Jersey.

1265
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:47,620
And he says, I am recently an immigrant on your country.

1266
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:57,140
I'm looking for a good new American religion to not only give me all my salvation back,

1267
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,120
but some of your money, too.

1268
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,660
I really can't read this letter, but would you like to talk to Mr. Hill?

1269
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:08,260
I think you did a fine job interpreting Mr. Firm.

1270
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:09,100
Mr. Firm.

1271
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:09,420
It was.

1272
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,360
It was Mr. Firm.

1273
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:10,720
Yes.

1274
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,440
I can read it now.

1275
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,680
My one eye is better.

1276
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,380
Yes, that was just fine.

1277
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:22,660
Well, I think that there's just such a smorgasbord of religions for the Firm.

1278
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,020
There is, isn't there?

1279
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,020


1280
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,920
Some taste better than others, don't they?

1281
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:25,360
Yes.

1282
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,040
And some you just want to go, too, too, too, that's not my religion.

1283
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,000
Or add a little Tamari or something.

1284
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,300
Something to get...

1285
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:33,320
I mean, come on.

1286
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,340
It just gets really, really boring.

1287
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,020
Boring and bland, I would say.

1288
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:37,520
Yes.

1289
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,040
Is that right?

1290
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:38,620
Yes.

1291
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:39,380
I think so.

1292
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,400
I think so.

1293
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,460
Many delicious religions to taste.

1294
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:48,540
So you're not particularly, or in fact in any way, telling him to join or become a part

1295
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,320
of the Church of the Subgenius to stop his problem with his salivation.

1296
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:57,580
Oh, I actually think his salivation would drip perfectly into the Church of the Subgenius.

1297
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:03,120
However, he may want to try dripping into other religions for some period of time until

1298
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,480
he gets a little drip or taste of his taste buds dripping.

1299
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,660
Oh, that brings us up to our last and final letter.

1300
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,760
We won't take any more letters at all.

1301
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,980
I have an ocular drip and also my genitalia are shrinking.

1302
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,540
Can Bob help me or in any way prevent the moistening of my clothes?

1303
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,040
Good Lord.

1304
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,280
Goodness.

1305
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,440
It's getting awfully blurry.

1306
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,960
That's quite a dripping problem you have there, yes, isn't it?

1307
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,460
It's the drip pattern.

1308
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:37,460


1309
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,960
The drip pattern happens to be overflowing at this very moment, doesn't it?

1310
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,780
Yeah, I can just feel that.

1311
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:43,860
It is.

1312
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:44,980
I can feel it too.

1313
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:45,720
The tension of that.

1314
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,420
I'm sure the personal question.

1315
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,260
It's about ready to flow right over the edge of the drip pan.

1316
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:49,540
It's transcendental.

1317
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:55,340
It's a form of bliss that only comes once in a while, once in a lifetime.

1318
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:00,560
And if you just, if you, well, what's the address again?

1319
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,520
If you just...

1320
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,980
Well, the address...

1321
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,140
Or the phone number.

1322
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,920
I believe the address would be...

1323
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,020
P.O.

1324
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:08,340
Box.

1325
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:08,640
P.O.

1326
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,060
Box.

1327
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,340
1-4-0-3-0-7.

1328
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,180
Six.

1329
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:13,640
Seven.

1330
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:13,920
Six.

1331
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,220
Reverend Stang.

1332
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,440
Dal Tex.

1333
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:17,920
Reverend Stang.

1334
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,240
Dal Tex.

1335
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:19,900
Dal Tex.

1336
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:20,280


1337
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,680
75204.

1338
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:23,760
And he's back.

1339
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,360
But we're not going to answer any more questions.

1340
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:26,800
No.

1341
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:26,800


1342
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,520
Princess, we haven't been studying your pre-trials.

1343
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,620
Her brain doesn't, is no longer her friend.

1344
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,300
That's Bob at Post Office Box 1430.

1345
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:36,900
1430.

1346
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,860
1430.

1347
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,400
1430.

1348
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:39,920
306.

1349
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,820
Dallas, Texas.

1350
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,360
Six.

1351
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:48,920
75214.

1352
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,100
www.subgenius.com.

1353
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:57,920
Yeah.

1354
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:03,380
And it says here, for big orders like Chalupas, to order at least two hours in advance.

1355
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,460
All right.

1356
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,900
Moving right along.

1357
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:11,720
Moving along to more significant directions and new religion.

1358
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:18,820
We'd like to talk also about not only Bob himself, or itself, it's not an it, is it?

1359
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,380
It's a transcendental being, isn't it?

1360
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,840
It's not really a purely personal object, something like I might wear.

1361
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:25,280
Yes.

1362
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:25,320
Yes.

1363
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,260
It's sort of an ethereal sort of thing.

1364
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:27,620
Yes.

1365
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:34,940
And can we, is Bob a real savior or perhaps is Bob more of just an icon of our age, of

1366
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:35,520
our times?

1367
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,720
Icon.

1368
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,940
Icon.

1369
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:40,620
Icon.

1370
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,420
Icon.

1371
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:41,700
Icon.

1372
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:41,940
Icon.

1373
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:41,940


1374
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:42,860
Sometimes.

1375
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,520
Most of the time.

1376
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,340
Icon.

1377
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,020
Icon.

1378
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:46,900
Then Icon't.

1379
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,280
Icon't any longer.

1380
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,000
Icon't at all.

1381
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,280
I never could.

1382
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,680
Immanuel can't.

1383
00:58:54,700 --> 00:59:02,260
You had to read the original Welsh to understand what he was saying to you.

1384
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,880
Ah, Immanuel can't.

1385
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:05,500
Immanuel can't.

1386
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:05,500


1387
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:05,500


1388
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:08,980
Immanuel can't.

1389
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,280
Immanuel can't.

1390
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,900
Immanuel can't.

1391
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,840
Immanuel can't.

1392
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:28,680
He is not going to see

1393
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:28,880
the Hur ÐÐµÑ?

1394
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,380
Are you worth waiting for, Immanuel?

1395
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,200
Immanuel â¦ â¦

1396
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,280
Sit down right here.

1397
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,480
And look over here.

1398
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,200
Wax ball?

1399
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,940
We're going to wax ball.

1400
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,860
We're going to loop the loo.

1401
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,720
And we're also going to trim the fin-fan-frastics.

1402
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:43,740
Oh, man.

1403
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,400
We're going to spit out human hair.

1404
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,680
And we're going to sing all night.

1405
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,040
We're going to sing rock songs, babe.

1406
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:49,640
You and I.

1407
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,160
That's right.

1408
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,380
We're going to sing until our...

1409
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,300
We're going to just...

1410
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,160
You know, we're going to...

1411
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,460
I've got to get going home right now.

1412
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,120
Oh, man.

1413
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,080
Sounds like really lippy, you know?

1414
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,240
It's like 4 o'clock or something.

1415
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,820
I don't know.
