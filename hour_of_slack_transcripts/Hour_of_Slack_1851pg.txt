Bob, Bob, love you.
Bob, Bob, love you.
Bob, Bob, love you.
Light your prop eyes up and test it back.
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.
Praise Bob, Bob, and Connie's rack.
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.
All bow before the great metal lord.
Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage.
We're all here tonight to praise Bob.
He's kind of shown us that Devo works in parallel ways with other pockets of humans on this planet.
Where we thought we were alone, we know there are now other human forms that believe in God.
And we know that Bob is a conscious mutation.
As he knows, Bob is merely an enema for a constipated society.
These people here are here to help a constipated society blow it out their ass.
Have you ever met Bob?
Well, like I said, Bob would appear in my bedroom and chase me around, making me do jumping jacks.
He's got food.
I know what you do.
Cause I do it too.
Intelligence.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no, no, no.
Am I as smart as I think?
Probably not.
That's good.

held on August 10th in Cleveland.
The third annual one
organized by several old subgeniuses
and fellow Devo fans.
Reverend Toth Wilder,
Reverend Scott Orsi,
the good Blinker Boy at AOL.com
and help from Steve Sinek.
And friends, it's just been,
it's great.
Because I love the Devo's.
We have a lot in common,
the church and the Devo's.
We're both owned by Bob.
We were both controlled by Bob
completely for quite a long time.
And we both share a philosophy.
We don't always have the same kind of music,
but sometimes we do.
We always have the philosophy.
A special philosophy,
a little different,
depending on which cult you're talking about.
But it is a philosophy for the different.
You know, in pamphlet number one,
what the hell?
This is Herb Alpert here in the background.
Friends, did you know that Herb Alpert
was the guy who signed Devo
to their very first big time record deal?
Anyway, friends,
the church of the subgenius
has called itself the spaz church
of macho irony.
And as I enjoyed the various cover bands
covering Devo
and the new and old and rare Devo materials
that were dredged up
for each of these conventions,
I got to thinking and pondering
about the spazfulness of the great spaz bands.
And the ones I was thinking of primarily
are ones from the 80s.
Elvis Costello,
who I actually used to sort of resemble
back in the day.
And Talking Heads,
I never was that into Talking Heads,
but they were a great spaz band, I suppose.
And David Byrne is a deuce paying subgenius
twice over,
just as are several members of Devo.
Ah, friends.
But you know, some people,
and then of course there's spaz bands today,
and we'll be playing a lot of that.
But you know, some might say
that the spaz,
the spaziness and spazitude
of the weirdos
shows no dignity.
That it is somehow silly and unmanly.
But,
nay, my friends, nay!
I say the ability to spaz
is our treasure,
and the inability to spaz
is the curse of the blockhead and the pink.
Because think,
is not the sexual orgasm coming?
The ultimate,
spaz attack?
The spaz of sex, friends.
The spaz of letting your own mutant abnormality out.
Do you really care what the others think?
Well, sure you do.
But, why let on?
Friends, as Bob Dobbs said very recently
to his young ward, Dr. Onan Kanabite,
Bob said,
I'd rather have the right people laughing at me
than have the wrong people laughing with me.
I'd rather have the right people laughing at me
than have the wrong people laughing with me.
Friends, you think about that
as you spaz out in this, uh,
friends, white, you just white.
You just white.
Is there anything religion can do to help me?
Help me find my friend?
Well, we could join together in prayer.
Uh-huh.
But is there anything useful we can do?
No.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.

Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.

Whoa.


Whoa.



Whoa.
Whoa.





Oh, why, why?

Why should I be?
Oh, what a nophone.
Oh, why should I be behind this?

Why?

Boy, why, why should I divide this like

Oh, boy.

Nasty politicians I resent
Just like me, they're all hell-bent!
I don't wanna hear about big stars
They should all be behind bars

But let's leave things of this world behind
and walk now down the path of Bob
for this brief minute of slack from the church of the sub-genius.
And we find then the family falling apart.
Oh, they wail and gnash their teeth, our rival churches do,
about how the children are getting exposed to too much this and too much that.
What they ain't being exposed to is a little bit of mom and dad.
Forget the pornography, I don't care.
It makes me mad, my friend, the hypocrisy.
Now, I have nothing against hypocrisy.
Every religion must have its fair share of hypocrisy.
As Bob Dobbs once said, I don't practice what I preach
because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.
But that preacher can get up there on TV and, oh, he's so glad to keep you normal,
keep you working so hard you don't even know your own wifey anymore.
And your kids, you don't know your kids any better than your employees.
So, friend, let there be slack.
Salutations.
Today I feel a sense of urgency as I speak to you for Devo Incorporated.
There is a direct connection between Devo's work in the music field and a big wiggly world around us.
You may not be aware of this, but we are in the middle of World War III.
It is not nuclear bombs that we must fear.
The weapon is the human mind or lack of it on this planet.
That will determine our fate.
Capital punishment for airline passengers who attempt to save money.
Spud men and gas lines who forgot that guns don't arm.
And tourists attempting to catch some rays at Three Mile Island add up to a major attack of corkscrews in the brain.
We must fight back.
We must know what we want.
We must want what we need.
And what we need is duty now for the future.
And for the future it is even harder when you are a little kid who looks at this ship and says we are ever going to stand up again.
But in your place, in this world with yourégine will only carry thesenot worse.
We must move from thiskanal Videos.
Meaning we shouldn't lack abilities.
We have nothing to lose.
What is a god's Flash for?
So it is wise to have your possible result at the dispatcher scriptures as an example.
What you can learn is the word you have to practice in order to have success.
