1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
What, what, what?

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,060
The station's full of aliens.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,860
And I'm sick to my stomach.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,980
Look at this thing.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,560
A fetus.

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,580
They've changed the way the boards are set up.

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,500
Yes, my friends, but we will persevere

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,640
because this is the hour of slack

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,320
on which we can only but, but seek

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,480
to find that which will play our takes.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,240
Dr. Smith, radio operator.

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,720
No trouble.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Get set, let's go and aim.

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,300
According, everything's going fine.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,100
No trouble.

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,280
Oh, yeah.

18
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:48,800
Yes, dear friends, this is hour of slack number 1021.

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,780
Except that it's really a rerun of, get this,

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,860
hour of slack number three.

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,680
Yes, the third show.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Ever done.

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,160
And it was done 20 years ago this month

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,760
in early November 1985.

25
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,280
And it was done at the once good Dallas station, K-N-O-N,

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,200
the day after a big subgenius revival at a bar

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,500
called the Twilight Room.

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,300
It was a Halloween revival, which we called the Scary Ball.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,660
And it was a show that starred Doctors for Bob

30
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,880
and Brother Cleve Duncan

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,520
and all sorts of guests from out of town,

32
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,220
some of whom were in the studio

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,980
for this third hour of slack,

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,320
including the baby Gary Gabrog-Fran

35
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,200
from the Puzzly Evidence Show,

36
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,080
the baby Dr. G. Gordon Gordon

37
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,400
in for Dobstown 3 in Brazil,

38
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,600
and the baby Dr. Onan Canobite,

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,160
all of them in the studio.

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,700
And we had really good,

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,560
good tapes of Doctors for Bob

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,000
live in concert the night before.

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,140
And you'll hear yours truly,

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,240
Reverend Ivan Stang, as a baby

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,660
and all hoarse from preaching

46
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,060
and confused at being a DJ at the mixing board

47
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,880
because it was only my third time.

48
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,760
I was 32.

49
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,260
An infant.

50
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,500
Still, friends, it proves the rock-steady

51
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,000
historical bedrock of slack.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,680
It's so as evidenced by this ancient show

53
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,540
and then 20 years later,

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,880
this great music behind me,

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,700
which I'm playing right now,

56
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,360
which is from the new album

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,440
by the Flying Ryan Brothers

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,340
called Blue Marble.

59
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,660
Incredible instrumental dual guitar music

60
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,760
by these Flying Ryan Brothers.

61
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,260
Friends, you can get more information

62
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,440
about that from,

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,220
uh, ryanetics.com.

64
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,060
Uh, yes.

65
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,460
Sort of like Dianetics,

66
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,520
but it's the Ryan Brothers.

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,580
R-Y-A-N.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,780
Ryanetics.com.

69
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,100
Uh, yes.

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,060
And, uh, so prepare yourself

71
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,020
to go back in time 20 years

72
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,180
to Hour of Slack number three.

73
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,120
R-Y-A-N.

74
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,900
Welcome, potential initiates,

75
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
and remain with us

76
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,800
for the next 30 minutes.

77
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,540
Mob?

78
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,660
Mob?

79
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,040


80
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,260
The message is now part of

81
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,700
and registered in your subconscious mind

82
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,860
every time you say,

83
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,080
see, hear, or think.

84
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,080
What about slack?

85
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,180
That's your key phrase.

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,040
It will trigger the entire message

87
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,120
without your being aware of it.

88
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,780
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry

89
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,240
Hour of Slack.

90
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,980
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

91
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,760
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

92
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,880
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox

93
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,480
Megafist Temple Lodge

94
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,340
of the Church of the Subgenius

95
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,180
with Pastor Buck Naked

96
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,560
of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

97
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,900
The opinions,

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,280
the opinions expressed

99
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,780
are not necessarily those

100
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,480
of this radio station.

101
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,980
Before the sermon,

102
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,040
a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

103
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,760
living avatar of slack,

104
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,280
and saint of silence

105
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,820
on planet Earth.

106
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,640
Are we controlled by secret forces?

107
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,480
Do you ever get the feeling

108
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,960
that free will is a joke?

109
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,320
Do people think you're strange?

110
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,860
Do you?

111
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,460
Then you may be on the right track.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,940
Are you abnormal?

113
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,000
Then you are probably better than most people.

114
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,140
Yes, your time shall triumph.

115
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,000
Now, at last,

116
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,660
the step-by-step process is revealed.

117
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,780
This is it.

118
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,400
The only faith that promises

119
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
action, thrill, success in sex and business.

120
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,500
Bring your weirdest dreams

121
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,760
to rampaging life.

122
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,000
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

123
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,980
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

124
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,260
This is a way of life to millions.

125
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,780
Yet, half of them don't even know it.

126
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,560
He's the one true living slack master

127
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,760
with the spiritual know-how

128
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,340
to help you bash through the locked doorway

129
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,700
to financial heaven.

130
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,560
He is the one real shortcut to slack.

131
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,160
Now see another dimension on your TV.

132
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,560
Yes, fear the sharpest of removal no longer.

133
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,420
Become physically attractive overnight.

134
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:06,040
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

135
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,080
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

136
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,360
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

137
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,000
And coming right back.

138
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
Plus, bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

139
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,400
To help you create the highest possible earnings.

140
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,580
From the psychodynamics of abnormality.

141
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,300
To turn conspiracy and blinded personality disorders around.

142
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,680
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.

143
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,500
That will fool normals and get you sex.

144
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:56,920
Ah, yes, dear friends.

145
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,080
Ah, yes, dear friends.

146
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,900
Ah, yes, dear friends.

147
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:01,900


148
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:01,900


149
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:01,900


150
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:01,900


151
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:01,900


152
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,900
Welcome, welcome once again.

153
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,100
And, uh, yes, after the usual slow takeoff,

154
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,840
it's hard to get these shows off the ground,

155
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,560
especially when you're at the very end of your so-called rope.

156
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,340
And, uh, indeed we are, folks, because we,

157
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,520
if any of you were at the amazing subgenius masquerade scary ball

158
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,880
last night at the Twilight Room.

159
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,580
More rope in here.

160
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,260
We came to show off the ground.

161
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,320
We're gonna make it big.

162
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,300
Yes.

163
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,840
No, there's no, you can use chewing gum and stuff.

164
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,520
That's the way this station is held together.

165
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,880
And, uh, oh, this station is on KNON 99.9 FM

166
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,420
in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Arlington.

167
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,820
Put one right in this, uh, in this thing.

168
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,440
Yeah, this, uh, body shrimp.

169
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,180
Now, who are you?

170
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,860
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

171
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,760
There's this, there was only supposed to be one person on this show.

172
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,500
And all of a sudden we've got shows from San Francisco and Brazil and Tennessee.

173
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,100
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,940
And we have walked in to the, uh, radio tabernacle here in Dallas, Texas.

175
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,440
Oh, yes.

176
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:02,880
Oh, yes.

177
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,720
Dear friends.

178
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,540
Reach for those checkbooks.

179
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,460
We're so...

180
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:05,940
That's right.

181
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Reach for those checkbooks.

182
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,500
But you can't write that check to the subgenius foundation

183
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,280
because we can't pray for money over the air.

184
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:13,960
That's right.

185
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,320
Uh, with this FCC license.

186
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,480
But, but we can pray for you to send money to...

187
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,100
This station.

188
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,160
But we can ask you to bring all those things down to the stations now.

189
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,600
Yeah, more of those things.

190
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,900
The things that you keep in your drawers.

191
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,080
That's right.

192
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,080


193
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,280
Those little things that...

194
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,160
Without...

195
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,880
You don't want the...

196
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,960
You're not supposed to talk about drawers on this radio station.

197
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,340
Okay.

198
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
Dr. O'Brogue fan.

199
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,440
Keep in the bloomers.

200
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,460
Uh, bring those things.

201
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,180
Yeah, bloomers.

202
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:37,460
That's right.

203
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:37,620
That's it.

204
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:37,980
Okay.

205
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,040
Yes, bring those things, ladies and gentlemen.

206
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,640
And your parents.

207
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,000
Tell your parents to loosen right now because this is going to be the most offensive piece

208
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,960
of radio you've ever heard in Dallas, Texas.

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,620
Let's try.

210
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,740
We'll, we'll try.

211
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,240
We'll be...

212
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,220
Let's put it that way.

213
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,800
Uh, strangely enough, somehow the show has ended up with a number of subgenius,

214
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,740
celebrity guests.

215
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,160
That's right.

216
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,600
Dr. Gary O'Brogue, friend, star of the amazing subgenius show in Berkeley, California,

217
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:10,480
which you will be hearing on and off in a most confusing manner, uh, as we, as we slowly fade in.

218
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,920
Oh, wait.

219
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,160
What?

220
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,600
What?

221
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,100
The collars?

222
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,820
Are there...

223
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,620
We finally got collars here.

224
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,300
Thanks, folks.

225
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,540
Poor girl.

226
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,180
She's in a bubbling vat of jokes.

227
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,260
We're going to throw a tarp over it and protect it from the elements.

228
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,060
Yeah, we may throw a tarp over it, but we probably, that's all we'll cover it.

229
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,560
This young lady has the jokes.

230
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:24,920
All day, yeah.

231
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,800
She's soaking in the jokes.

232
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,460
We didn't go to use them.

233
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:26,640
We didn't go to use them.

234
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,040
We didn't go to use them.

235
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
We're at the station right now.

236
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,060
We'll cover you up with something soft and warm, too.

237
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,320
We're going to have to reverse the charger.

238
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,560
This is a tarp that's been soaked in water.

239
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,060
You're already covered?

240
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,960
Well, yeah, good.

241
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,740
She has one of those champions.

242
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,360
Actually, you know, a lot of depilatories can help in these, uh...

243
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,820
She was covered pretty well, but maybe not.

244
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,420
With these little dishes, they're covered by the horrible fur that the KPFH...

245
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,460
See if you can get a good bow.

246
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,820
...each of their customers...

247
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,200
My screen.

248
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,580
Don't yell.

249
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,420
It's the only phone you have.

250
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,340
My screen's dark.

251
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,780
Okay, there we go.

252
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,980
What's happening to my picture?

253
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Okay, that's very broad.

254
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,640
I don't know.

255
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,140
I don't know.

256
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,020
I wish I could go to sleep and forget about it all myself, but...

257
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,420
Listen, caller, okay, are you getting...

258
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,920
All these guys are dreams in my head.

259
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,620
There's a storm in here.

260
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,020
I'm getting cold.

261
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,900
I don't like it.

262
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,560
I'm in the dark.

263
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,780
I...

264
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,100
I do like it.

265
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,320
It's...

266
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,040
I want to go home.

267
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,260
This is the most miserable thing I've ever seen.

268
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,160
It's joyous.

269
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,660
I can't even see Mobius Rex now.

270
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,640
It's as dark as a poor thing.

271
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:17,960
Bit.

272
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,300
Bit, bit, bit.

273
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,660
We're having some more serious...

274
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,560
Serious technical difficulties here on the show.

275
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,280
We seem to be colliding with shows from other states.

276
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,840
It's so hard.

277
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,000
We gotta drag this show out into the big part of the auditorium, Doug.

278
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,520
No, no, no.

279
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,760
It's illegal to get this show out on the street in Dallas.

280
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,500
You're kidding.

281
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,280
Buck and I got...

282
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,580
We're almost arrested last week for driving this show up and down Central.

283
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,880
It's so hard.

284
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,520
What is this?

285
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Story with this station.

286
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,980
At least they could give us air in here.

287
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,020
Well, it may be...

288
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,500
It may not be entirely their problem, Dr. Gabrog, friend.

289
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,940
It may be the fact that we've also got subgeniuses in this room from as far away as, yes, Brazil.

290
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,060
The incredible and rather disgusting Brazilian clench has been represented.

291
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,780
See, when we do a show at the Twilight Room, oh, people in Dallas.

292
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
People in Dallas, oh, they can't...

293
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:16,960
They don't always make it, but people from Knoxville, Tennessee, Santa Barbara, oh, Brazil of South America.

294
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,120
So we got the Dr. G. Gordon Gordon, mercenary of...

295
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:30,180
Slack from the Dobstown 2 plantation and zombie skull farm in Brazil.

296
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,180
Welcome, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

297
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,440
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

298
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,820
Yes, he's by far got the classiest accent of any subgenius.

299
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,380
Thank you.

300
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:47,140
And you see, these creatures that have entered this station are actually fallout from the incredible devival.

301
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,620
And it was a devival last night.

302
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,080
It was...

303
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,920
I feel thoroughly devived.

304
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,440
Yes.

305
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,820
I feel like I could just use a bit more, just a bit more of that liquid slack.

306
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,420
Pass another cup over here.

307
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,780
Here, here's a half-pound ton of slack.

308
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,800
Yeah, for those of you who were at the show last night at the Twilight Room and couldn't hear it,

309
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:13,100
we do have the amazing tapes that were recorded there.

310
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,920
So we will be cutting...

311
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,300
That's what we're saying.

312
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,680
No, no, that's why we're here, for people giving us things.

313
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,980
And we want people to bring those things down.

314
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,500
We want people to come to the station.

315
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,400
Yeah, this is a religion of...

316
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,580
We're asking for forgiveness, everything.

317
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,760
We want forgiveness from you and for us.

318
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,100
Yeah.

319
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,160
And hate from you for the conspiracy.

320
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,080
That's right.

321
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,340
The conspiracy that makes you not understand what we're talking about.

322
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,340
Because if it weren't for them, why, it'd be nothing on the air in Dallas except subgenius shows.

323
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,140
And you may groan to think such a nightmarish thought, but actually the...

324
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,780
Yeah.

325
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,260
We've decided...

326
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,120
Yeah, listen to them.

327
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,700
Even the subgenius doctors themselves in terrible, terrible pain.

328
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,020
We're near death here.

329
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,560
And believe me, we can't just ask you to walk out and kill normals.

330
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,020
We can't ask you to do that kind of thing on this station.

331
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,200
We can't ask you to do what would be the rightful work of Dobbs.

332
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,940
No, because it's against the law.

333
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,740
It's against the law for us to do those things.

334
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,520
Gary, would you get the show off Reverend Onan's foot?

335
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,200
I think it's perfect.

336
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,200
Oh, man.

337
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,340
The show...

338
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,740
I don't want to touch that show.

339
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,920
You know what happened last time?

340
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,300
I stuck my finger in the show.

341
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,180
Well, friends, we don't want to be talking about that.

342
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,480
There's just something wrong.

343
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:37,240
But we do also have Dr. Onan Canobite of the amazing subgenius band, Dr. Onan's Wotan Band,

344
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,720
as well as the famous occupant.

345
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,140
Yes.

346
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,980
Yeah, there.

347
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,940
Yes, you can hear.

348
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,260
Yes, yes.

349
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,480
Now, Dr. Onan is only a tape recording.

350
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,520
Yes.

351
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,640
And yet at the same time...

352
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,220
See, we've got a crowded show tonight.

353
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,800
We have over 100 guests.

354
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,940
Over 10,000.

355
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,420
And too many listeners.

356
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,280
I don't think that we can cram the show into that many radios.

357
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:57,940
I don't think it'll...

358
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,920
Just line up and keep it quiet here.

359
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,900
I haven't got enough room.

360
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,320
It's going to thin out.

361
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,700
Right.

362
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,440
If we try to reach too many listeners, it'll just dilute it.

363
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,260
Now, a subgenius church can be a franchise in your own area.

364
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,400
And it's also called, in church jargon, it's called a clench.

365
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
It's called a clench.

366
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,400
Now, Onan was the one who figured out...

367
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,400
Who started his own solo clench.

368
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,040
And it's schismed all over itself.

369
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,160
So tell us about that.

370
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,220
That's what you're most famous for in town.

371
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,860
I want you to know that.

372
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,740
I see.

373
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,080
Yes.

374
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,400
The solos...

375
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,000
The stark fist acting upon a solo clench resulting in ultimate schism.

376
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,940
And friends, you know, most of these religions...

377
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,300
Most of these religions...

378
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,860
They indulge in tremendous infighting between denominations.

379
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,140
We encourage...

380
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,340
We encourage infighting between denominations.

381
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,540
No two subgenius denominations should ever dominate one another,

382
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,060
especially not if they're the same.

383
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,240
And if any two subgeniuses are the same, one must die.

384
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,520
That's true.

385
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,400
Because this is...

386
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,480
It's different.

387
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,080
You know what I mean?

388
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,120
I was going to ask, Dr. Onan,

389
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,560
were you the one that had the first church in the round, the circumschism?

390
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,340
No, that was just hearsay, just rumor.

391
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,640
Oh, it's reverend hearsay.

392
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Yes, I remember that.

393
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:19,960
Reverend hearsay.

394
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,380
These are the kind of things that we can't say on a radio station, KPFA in Berkeley, California.

395
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,620
These are the kind of guests that we can't have on our station.

396
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,460
Yes, but KNON is a non-station, you see.

397
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,640
And because of that, we can get away with things that they would never suspect anyone of.

398
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,320
Especially not us.

399
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
But we're going to...

400
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,780
We've got to...

401
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
See, the problem is...

402
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:45,620
We have so many great tapes that we can play for you, all by subgeniuses.

403
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,960
And you would think, no, I don't want to hear a bunch of amateur...

404
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,820
Garage bands.

405
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,720
But, you see, music by subgeniuses could include...

406
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,060
And let me name drop, boys.

407
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,840
Let me name drop.

408
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:04,820
Music by subgeniuses could include George Clinton, Devo, Ernest Tubbs,

409
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,580
and even Dr. Onan Canabite, who is here and whose tape we are about to play now.

410
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,720
You can buy this tape, friends, from the Subgenius Foundation,

411
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,120
but it's against the law for us to tell you that.

412
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,820
So, turn off your tape recorders.

413
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,720
And indulge in a little...

414
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,920
And after Dr. Onan's, I think we'll be flipping Wellmans out

415
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,720
and going into the next little Wellman of the revival,

416
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,640
the Scary Ball revival.

417
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,340
Last night.

418
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,560
Thank you, dear friends.

419
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,800
Oh, yes.

420
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,700
Yes.

421
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,620
Yes.

422
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,180


423
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,580
Yes.

424
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,360
Yes.

425
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,160
Yes.

426
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,640
Yes.

427
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,400
Yes.

428
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,260
Yes.

429
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:15,820
Yes.

430
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,360
Yes.

431
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:16,700
Yes.

432
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,420
Yes.

433
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:17,900
Yes.

434
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,460
Yes.

435
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,420
Yes.

436
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:19,580


437
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:19,580


438
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,120
Yes.

439
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,120


440
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,120


441
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,120


442
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,120


443
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,120


444
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,120


445
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:28,820
Thank you.

446
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,580
Yes, dear friends, that was the amazing Dr. Onan.

447
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,100
Well, that was actually Occupat.

448
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,080
And they're a panting bunch.

449
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,780
Now hold it.

450
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,100
What was that?

451
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,180
Clown the ballerina here and there.

452
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,440
Clown the ballerina air feed.

453
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,460
Oh, no, that's not.

454
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,120
That was mean.

455
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,340
Why'd you do that to that little girl?

456
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,320
You've got to get the babies out of this room.

457
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,980
It's hard to find a place to sit or walk.

458
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,640
You guys act like a bunch of babies.

459
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,720
What are you doing on the air?

460
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,480
A bunch of stinky little subgenius rats.

461
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,920
Well, what about Roo Mouse and what about Paul's kitty?

462
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,140
Well, it's also illegal to talk about California deities in Texas, Dr. Gbrog.

463
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,220
Friend, there's only room for so many religions in this corporate state.

464
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
What happened to ecumenism?

465
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,000
Whatever happened?

466
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,780
I mean, how come we got California deities and Texas deities?

467
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,500
Is this a state church?

468
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,260
What is the problem here?

469
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,400
Exactly what?

470
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,620
I can't.

471
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,680
I can't worship Bohandas and the radio station in my house in Texas.

472
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,500
All hail Roo Mouse and Bohandas.

473
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,320
And we shouldn't be peeking out the meter so badly.

474
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,700
Yeah, but what about Bob?

475
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
What about Slack and what about the conspiracy?

476
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,180
What about them?

477
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,760
Yeah.

478
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,580
The conspiracy.

479
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,660
The conspiracy has given me so much more than Bob ever gave to me.

480
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,440
Yeah, it's true.

481
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,260
The conspiracy does pay better than Bob Dobbs or, for that matter, almost any other religious savior.

482
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,540
But the conspiracy isn't.

483
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,420
It's not quite as much fun.

484
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,380
And we had a...

485
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,320
Did you get the check in the mail?

486
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah, I got the check.

487
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,160
You see what I mean, folks?

488
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,880
Go tell Stang.

489
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,500
I just...

490
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:26,960
Go tell me.

491
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,580
The Bob said came down and said the check's in the mail and I haven't heard from him since.

492
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,960
You guys are going to have to talk to doctors for Bob about that.

493
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,460
Hey, where's my...

494
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,080
Okay.

495
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:42,860
Well, folks, for those of you who weren't at the scary ball last night, that's too bad.

496
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,540
But for those who were and still couldn't hear it because of the strange acoustics that go with rock and roll,

497
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,320
performances, we are bringing in some beautiful lilting melodies from Doctors for Bob,

498
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,260
most of whom could not be here tonight.

499
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:03,340
Some of them are lost in the station and we're digging through these boxes of cassettes.

500
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,180
I want to say I just stepped on Buck.

501
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,280
That's right.

502
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,560
Oh, poor Buck.

503
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,520
It's okay, Buck. Get up. You'll be all right.

504
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,980
Okay, well, the Twilight Room...

505
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,140
We'll just go ahead and play this lovely...

506
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,860
Just remember, if you'd been there last night, you'd be changed.

507
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,620
But we're going to start off...

508
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,340
We're going to start off with a religious gospel hymn from Doctors for Bob called,

509
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,040
You Can't, and that is, Can't Hide from God.

510
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,680
Because he's mean.

511
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,160
You can't hide from God.

512
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,800
Because he's bigger than you.

513
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,360
Help me, somebody.

514
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,100
You can't hide from God.

515
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,660
Because he's bigger than the whole universe.

516
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,960
Help me, somebody.

517
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,500
You cannot hide from God.

518
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,360
Because he's bigger.

519
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,480
All reality.

520
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,940
Help me, somebody.

521
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,160
You cannot hide from God.

522
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,340
You cannot run from your own legs.

523
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,560
Is there a person in this place tonight who can run from their own legs?

524
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,640
You can'tool see your own eyes.

525
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,180
You can't turn them inside out.

526
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,180


527
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,480
I ain't gonna see your own eyes.

528
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,220
You can't turn them inside out.

529
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,280
You can't see your own eyes.

530
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,620
But if you put your Bible up, if you put your Bible up...

531
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:19,620


532
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,380
You cannot see your own eyes

533
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,980
You cannot run from your own legs

534
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,460
You cannot hide from God

535
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,300
Help me somebody

536
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,820
She ain't got no legs

537
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,980
My legs on fire

538
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,560
They're a problem

539
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,720
My mind's still okay

540
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,340
Right side

541
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,580
You cannot wet water

542
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,120
How you gonna wet water?

543
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,140
You can throw water on it

544
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,460
That's gonna make more water

545
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,960
You cannot wet water

546
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,440
You cannot see your own eyes

547
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,640
You cannot run from your own legs

548
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:11,500
You cannot wet water

549
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:49,520
You cannot wet water

550
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:19,360
You cannot wet water

551
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:39,600
You cannot wet water

552
00:24:50,380 --> 00:25:18,240
You cannot wet water

553
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:40,080
You cannot wet water

554
00:25:50,620 --> 00:26:18,880
You cannot wet water

555
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:49,580
You cannot wet water

556
00:26:49,640 --> 00:27:08,340
You cannot wet water

557
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:42,260
You cannot wet water

558
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:19,620
You cannot wet water

559
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:36,900
You cannot wet water

560
00:28:49,640 --> 00:29:17,760
You cannot wet water

561
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,740
You cannot wet water

562
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:21,980
You cannot wet water

563
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:49,620
You cannot wet water

564
00:29:49,640 --> 00:30:04,200
You cannot wet water

565
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,060
You cannot wet water

566
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,580
You cannot wet water

567
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,540
Hey look!

568
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,880
Prepare for the auto-cataclysm of my hoarding food

569
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,160
Gold, guns, ammo, and gas

570
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,960
Long-term survival techniques

571
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,560
and learning

572
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,520
Of course, you don't want to kill a subgenius believer.

573
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:32,760
God's judgment is going to come and fall again upon a godless, Christ-rejecting, blasphemous society.

574
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,780
Well, if this sounds paranoid, you're right.

575
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,520
But I think I have good reason to be paranoid.

576
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,160
It's a strange world out there.

577
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:53,780
This is what life is like at a bottom-line level.

578
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,020
And I'm not going to make you cut through a lot of other stuff to get through it.

579
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,920
Here's what it is.

580
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,840
There's no gimmick about that.

581
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,440
It's straightforward.

582
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,340
It's strong.

583
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,200
And it's elemental.

584
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,240
We are heavy stuff.

585
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,580
Rich crap.

586
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,140
Voodoo.

587
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,040
Devil worship.

588
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,820
Wild.

589
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,440
Gnome.

590
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,020
Animal hunger will grow in you.

591
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,340
Learn our need.

592
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,720
What about Funto?

593
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,040
Because those confuse people.

594
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,160
Bohandas was walking through Tokyo.

595
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,680
Bohandas is the friend of all the little children.

596
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,800
And what about Wolwo?

597
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,140
Yes, friends.

598
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,520
Halloween is getting closer and closer.

599
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,760
And it is going to be very scary.

600
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,800
Very scary in the subgenius world.

601
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,340
And even out there in the world of reality.

602
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,820
Stand up on your feet.

603
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,040
Everybody wants to have three ladies and go bar soup.

604
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,980
I can't take it.

605
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,520
You can't clean.

606
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,260
You can't wash soap.

607
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,540
What are you going to do?

608
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,440
Cut that bar of soap in half and rub it against itself?

609
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,480
Soap is the cleanest thing known to man.

610
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,220
You can't wash this show out of your ears either.

611
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,220
You tried scrubbing it out.

612
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,460
You tried rubbing it out.

613
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,700
You tried scouring it out.

614
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,800
This is the show that stinks.

615
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,640
You go listen to six hours of Beethoven right now.

616
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,760
And I can guarantee you, you'll still hear this show tomorrow morning.

617
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,320
That's right.

618
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,780
That's the thing about these subgenius shows is you can turn off your radio.

619
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,160
You can stop your car.

620
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,780
You can run away from it.

621
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,660
But you keep hearing it laying in bed at night.

622
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,920
Close your eyes.

623
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,000
You can even put the cables to your power supply and you still get the show.

624
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,440
Oh, it's a scary show at times.

625
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,500
It's in my ear.

626
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,200
It's in my ear.

627
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,500
No, no, that wasn't.

628
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,300
That's not the show.

629
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,520
That's one of those creatures that are with the show.

630
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,560
That's right, Dr. Jewell.

631
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,060
That was that thing that was growing on you earlier today.

632
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:07,680
Oh, no.

633
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,580
It's in my ear now?

634
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,600
It's in your ear.

635
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,240
Oh, no.

636
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,140
I'm going to have to change shirts as well as shorts.

637
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:12,900
This is awful.

638
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,560
Well, doctors, what do you think?

639
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:14,760
I'm going to have to change my clothes.

640
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,420
I've got a whole stack of Wellman hair and we've got everything from more of last night's

641
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:24,760
Twilight Room to more sick music by Healthy Sub-Gene Eye and vice versa.

642
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,260
Let's vote.

643
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Call into the station right now and vote.

644
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:28,940
That's right.

645
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:35,040
Even though we can't take your calls on the air, you can still call this station.

646
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,260
That's right.

647
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:35,940
You can vote.

648
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,820
Pastor Beckett will take your calls.

649
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,540
By your own personal biorhythms.

650
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,880
Calculate your vote.

651
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,320
Even if we give you your own phone number over the air.

652
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,260
Yes, call in.

653
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,760
What is your phone number, by the way?

654
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,860
And we'll call you.

655
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,560
That's right.

656
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,720
Go ahead and call us and tell us your phone number.

657
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,940
Because we can't remember our phone number over here.

658
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,260
Oh, you want the phone number?

659
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,620
Yeah.

660
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,520
What is the phone number?

661
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,120
Okay.

662
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,340
To call us here, Sub-Genius calls it.

663
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,040
Why not?

664
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,000
Here's your shit.

665
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,600
Do it now or you might forget.

666
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,420
Boy, Buck does that so nicely.

667
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:04,800
He does.

668
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,460
Buck is a professional.

669
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,180
Can you call out to California and say his station ID for us?

670
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:08,880
Cool.

671
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Buck underwent four operations to get his vocal cords to be able to do this.

672
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,240


673
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,240


674
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,240


675
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,240


676
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,240


677
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,240


678
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,360
I'll do that.

679
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,260
But he still hasn't been Wellmanized.

680
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,820
Well, let's do that to him after the show.

681
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,960
And I'll inform the head.

682
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,240
The head.

683
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,320
What about the head?

684
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,940
What about the scary poster of Doc's thing?

685
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,100
That evil head.

686
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,480
That evil head.

687
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,680
There's no sign of Wellman.

688
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,900
There's no sign of Wellman.

689
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,460
We're just land loading right here and hoping that we can get in touch with whoever that

690
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:37,540
attack is.

691
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:37,560
Wellman's gone.

692
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,240
Yeah, Wellman's gone.

693
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,820
But if we can just get the head inside that lead-lined vault, we'll be okay.

694
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,220
Wellman's gone.

695
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,220


696
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,220


697
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,220


698
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,220


699
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,220


700
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,220


701
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,220


702
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,560
He's gone.

703
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:44,900
That's a good lead on Stoke.

704
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,000
Friends, beware that head.

705
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,820
It's safe.

706
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,480
Yeah.

707
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,320
I left the little Wellman at home, but he won.

708
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:59,020
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer rose slowly above the trap between the third and fourth

709
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:04,180
greens down at Onion Creek Country Club and Golf Course.

710
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:14,200
Thumping slowly like an over-enlarged fig, the bleeding head slowly rose above the trap,

711
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,200


712
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,200


713
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:23,440
gentle angle above the green, dripping blood. It hovered briefly over the sand trap and

714
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:33,540
then slowly ascended towards the constellation of Orion at an angle of about 44.325 degrees,

715
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:42,480
like a shot off a shovel. There was no doubt that it was the head of Arnold Palmer. That

716
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:54,120
moon-faced smile was unforgettable. The population of southeast Austin went wild. They tore

717
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:00,060
off their clothes, danced in the streets and said, the bloody head has come. The time is

718
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:07,340
here. Take off your clothes and be somebody. The bloody head of Arnold Palmer was above

719
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:20,340
the Repository圖Way area, lo했다 above a tower and was with a

720
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,400
ors Kim void. I joined upon a

721
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,400


722
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,400


723
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,400


724
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,400


725
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,400


726
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,400


727
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,400


728
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,400


729
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,400


730
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,400


731
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,480

At 14 minutes after 9, the bleeding head was sighted on the forward control radar access plant at Barksdorm Air Force Base.

763
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,020
Three interceptors were scrambled, one of which crashed on takeoff.

764
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,260
They could find nothing. Radar was still tracking the head.

765
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,820
The bloody head moved north, rocketed over Dallas and Fort Worth.

766
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:25,600
The radar at Caswell Air Force Base gave subsequent indications that something large and wet was moving north-northeast,

767
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,040
while ascending still upwards towards the constellation of Orion.

768
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,640
The bloody head moved on.

769
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:43,420
Fourteen ex-virgins were rejuvenated in Lubbock as the head passed through.

770
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,740
...raise those tapes properly, they'll just go out on you and come in at all hours.

771
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,680
The prodigal tape returns.

772
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:18,100
Yeah, you raise them no matter how much trouble you go to, to raise these tapes right, they go awry.

773
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,540
Rub magnets on the back of those.

774
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,840
Yeah, and they still go out.

775
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,260
Yeah, it's lovely. It's a miracle.

776
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,900
What's happening?

777
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,900
I don't know. I think the show just died.

778
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,080
This is Saturday. Are we in Little Rock?

779
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,060
No, no, we were in Little Rock on Wednesday.

780
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,620
Yeah, we're going to be in Sanford.

781
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,180
We're going to be in L.A. next month.

782
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,240
Is this subgenius?

783
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:43,120
world revival crusade continues next cities are are my my hometown of san francisco i know there's

784
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,280
a lot of people that are afraid to know there's a person from san francisco in town because you

785
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,760
think you might catch something you're from san francisco get out of here you guys run

786
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,280
but i want to tell you liberalism is not contagious folks

787
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,420
stupidity might be jobs

788
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:10,420
have some more pills go right here the whole bucket yep we got the famous bucket of pills

789
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,660
here we didn't bring the bucket of pills to the scary ball at last night because only a

790
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,920
you know only three or four thousand showed up yeah there weren't enough people to

791
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,360
yeah i mean i've heard that expression you're a really great audience before but

792
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,180
but why lie exactly really

793
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,140
yes at the

794
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,260
you

795
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,760
Twilight Room, folks, you'll find at least 50% of the people,

796
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,380
although it is a wonderful club and they do let us go in there and hurt the audience,

797
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,680
half of those people spend $30 on haircuts that are supposed to illustrate

798
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,580
that they don't care how they look.

799
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,980
But it's very important to them that they are seen looking at bands

800
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,820
with a critical expression on their face.

801
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,160
And a $30 haircut.

802
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,140
And a $30 haircut.

803
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,260
Seeing as how they're too, well, let's just put it politely,

804
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:05,740
cool to be actually up there on a stage attempting to injure the audience themselves.

805
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,820
Or make a fool of themselves by dancing and responding to music.

806
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,340
Who called Doctors for Bob a band in the first place?

807
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,000
An act.

808
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,480
Yeah, they dared call it.

809
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,360
John Anders called Doctors for Bob an act.

810
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,700
Well, if Doctors for Bob is an act,

811
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,700
then that woman who came home bleeding to death from losing her legs last night

812
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,480
deserves an Academy Award.

813
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,060
Copy.

814
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,720
Right, 1985, Jane or Hyperveet.

815
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,420
Well, we're going to return to that lovely, lovely experience.

816
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,600
My legs are on fire.

817
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,920
The studio's on fire.

818
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,980
Yes, we'll be returning to the Twilight Room right about now.

819
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,060
We feel like there needs to be an explanation for our very existence,

820
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,960
so we've got a little piece here that's called The Explanation.

821
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,660
For that very reason.

822
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,280
Before we go on,

823
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,380
we'd like to thank our sponsors.

824
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:58,620
We are the

Unquote

828
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,620
We'd just like to take this opportunity to state briefly and for the record

829
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,040
that my fellow Doctors for Bob and myself

830
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,780
are members in good standing of a church.

831
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,900
But not just any church.

832
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,820
For the church to which we belong

833
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,160
just happens to be

834
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,740
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

835
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,660
The world's only bogus true religion.

836
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,000
Of course, I am referring to

837
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,860
the Church of the Subgenius.

838
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,960
To the city!

839
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,680
Now the Church of the Subgenius,

840
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,060
as founded by J.R. Bob Dobb,

841
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,460
Santa Fe, El Paso, and 1953,

842
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,620
is the grand religion of the future.

843
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,340
Uniting superior mutants,

844
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,140
social renegades,

845
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,720
twisted geniuses,

846
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,940
and sci-fi.

847
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,120
Unite!

848
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:56,420
Unite sinners!

849
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,020
In a worldwide

850
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,340
rrrrrrrr lamp-frame

851
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,940
of em-mari

852
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,180
and prophetic

853
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:03,960
yucks

854
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,280
and grins!

855
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,620
Yucks and grins which will hopefully, inevitably, lead us directly to a commodity all through the after.

856
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,460
And today is Father's Day and you go vote society.

857
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,040
And that commodity, grins, is

858
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,800
SLACK!

859
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,020
Now slack is what the conspiracy wants to take away from us.

860
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,960
Slack is what the conspiracy wants to drive us.

861
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,120
Slack is our way of grabbing money.

862
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,380
And we're not going to be locked by the lapels and screaming at it.

863
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:36,420
Now back in the 50's, Bob himself noticed a decided lack of slack in our culture.

864
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,780
He noticed an awful prevalence of normalcy.

865
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:46,460
He noticed that the normals formed a vast conspiracy against the different.

866
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:52,220
An insidious conspiracy dedicated to squelching our natural rogue instincts.

867
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,480
Dedicated to wiping out our fun factors.

868
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:02,900
Dedicated in short, to the total and utter eradication of the original slack with which we were all born.

869
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,320
Well Bob wanted to fight this conspiracy, ladies and gentlemen, and what better way I ask ye

870
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,640
than by the foundation of a major new world religion.

871
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,560
It's the Church of the Subgenius.

872
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,360
Praise Bob!

873
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,560
Oh, help me somebody!

874
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:25,460
Now many people I know view the conspiracy on a very tiny arcane and mealy-mouthed level.

875
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:32,760
You see the conspiracy only at the US government, the CIA, FBI, Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod, Catholic Church,

876
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,300
Jewish and Minstrel League, Council on Foreign Relations, or Trilateral Commissions.

877
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,560
Other more occultated individuals can see to the next level.

878
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:48,460
You see the conspiracy as the men in black, the green energy demons, the advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures from the hollow earth,

879
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,420
the henchmen of Negian, the Yakutism.

880
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,360
But even they don't have the full story, ladies and gentlemen.

881
00:43:54,360 --> 00:44:00,000
For I'm here to tell you tonight that the conspiracy exists as none other than Jehovah One,

882
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,720
alien space god of wrath from some corporate sin galaxy and his stark fist of removal.

883
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,720
Oh, help me somebody!

884
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,820
Not many of you here tonight, I'm sure.

885
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:16,220
The Church of the Subgenius may sound a bit, oh, demonic.

886
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,360
And you're right, it is demonic.

887
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,180
But well, speaking of benevolent demons, here, well the Church of the Subgenius does recognize it.

888
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:34,960
Every major deity of every world religion, Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, Mohammed, Elvis, Earl, Hank, Buck.

889
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,160
Rather than having one central authority great figure, the Church of the Subgenius possesses an entire pantheon,

890
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:49,380
or subgenion is the word, what are referred to as short duration personal savior, or surdurper sa.

891
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,860
Now, as in any other major world religion,

892
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,820
the Church of the Subgenius has certain inalienable tenets,

893
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,900
certain basic precepts around which a life philosophy can be formed,

894
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,360
the most important of which are...

895
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,260
Too much!

896
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,260
Is always better!

897
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,120
But not enough!

898
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,600
Not enough!

899
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,420
Too much!

900
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,180
Not enough!

901
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Not enough!

902
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:14,780
Not enough!

903
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,320
Too much!

904
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,940
But is it always better than that?

905
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,080
Make your children pray to God!

906
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,080
Help me somebody!

907
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,700
One soul per breath.

908
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,280
I've done you a little more money on that soul.

909
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,900
This soul's already hocked up to its neck.

910
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,700
Jehovah 7, Jehovah 12.

911
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,080
Guy, that's gonna cost you another soul.

912
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,480
There's three more souls.

913
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,900
Give me a double smudge bucket of that air.

914
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,900
Here at the station, we don't have to worry about this.

915
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,340
We've got the souls of the listeners on the way.

916
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,180
Listeners out there, I'm like, I'm sorry to have to tell you this so late,

917
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,120
but after listening to a subgenius show for more than 43 minutes,

918
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,280
we can put a lock on that soul.

919
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,220
Ah, yes, smell it.

920
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,280
And you know, we use your souls to generate new church air

921
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,940
for we the famous subgenius preachers.

922
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,320
That's right.

923
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,340
While you're at work, we're here spending your money and breathing your air.

924
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,080
15 bucks at least.

925
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,020
That's right.

926
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,580
And that's the red scent for entropy.

927
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,740
B.O.D.

928
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,840
B.O.B.

929
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,840
B.O.B.

930
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:34,360


931
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,220
B.O.B.

932
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,340
Bop.

933
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,300
Grrr.

934
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,540
Grrr.

935
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,720
Grrr.

936
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,200
Grrr.

937
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,700
Thank you.

938
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,900
Thank you.

939
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,200
Thank you.

940
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,960
Thank you.

941
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:54,980
Thank you.

942
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,820
Thank you.

943
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,460
Thank you.

944
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,120
Thank you.

945
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,580
Thank you.

946
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:36,900
Thank you.

947
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:38,780
Thank you.

948
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:41,400
Thank you.

949
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:45,420
Thank you.

950
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:45,540
Thank you.

951
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:45,700
Thank you.

952
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,040
Thank you.

953
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,380
Thank you.

954
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:47,620
Thank you.

955
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,880
Thank you.

956
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,200
Thank you.

957
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,400
You know, they sneak in here.

958
00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:03,340
We're foolish enough to let Dr. Gabrog Fran sneak his California-isms into this beautiful and native Texas show.

959
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,500
Yes, remember the Alamo.

960
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,260
Remember Bob Dobbs.

961
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,640
I can't wait to get home to go ride some waves.

962
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,860
I'm going smurfing, Gary.

963
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:15,020
I'm going to go to a smurf burning next week.

964
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,260
Come on, no smurfing so far out.

965
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,220
Well, folks, we've got a choice between playing.

966
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,640
You know, it in some ways is less than an hour and more than a show here.

967
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,500
I think it's less than a show and less than an hour.

968
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,400
Yeah, it's kind of.

969
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:35,740
It's like three-quarters of a show in 45 minutes, basically, is what you're getting.

970
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,580
Yeah, but that's good because that means we can go home and go to bed.

971
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,780
Crack the statues on their own.

972
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,140
Doug, the people know that we're already home in bed.

973
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:43,880
This is taped.

974
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:44,960
We're not here.

975
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,940
And my name isn't Doug.

976
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,280
I'm not Doug either.

977
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,200
So I think we come to an excellent.

978
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,040
Yes, the Ching flings.

979
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,740
The Ching flings.

980
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,340
Oh, no.

981
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:59,540
Let's throw one of those icy Chings and see how it melts and see what it tells us of our future.

982
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,820
Which anagram does it say?

983
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,260
Or hexagram or whatever they call us.

984
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:05,400
It says.

985
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:06,740
Milligrams.

986
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,260
Ice.

987
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,380
A milligram of your fortune, friends.

988
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,880
Bad news tomorrow.

989
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,440
It's Monday and you've got to go to work.

990
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:14,560
But we don't.

991
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,080
Yeah.

992
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,920
Well, speak for yourself.

993
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:17,660
Speak for yourselves, boys.

994
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,780
Reach out the chair.

995
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:22,280
We subgenius preachers never die and we never stop working.

996
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,780
It's a sad, sad.

997
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,180
Except when we spend all that money that those people send in for us.

998
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:28,840
That's right.

999
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,740
Remember, your subscription money goes directly into.

1000
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,800
Listen to that money burn.

1001
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:45,260
Listen to Dr. Gordon burn the contributions of those who spend brave enough to send some money to the subgenius church.

1002
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:45,840
Wait a minute.

1003
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,620
These are cruzeros.

1004
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:47,300
These aren't dollars.

1005
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,400
I can't spend those here.

1006
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,180
They got the wrong print.

1007
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,180
Dead president on them.

1008
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,260
Oh, there's a dead American president.

1009
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,360
They're a lot easier to spend.

1010
00:52:53,620 --> 00:53:02,020
Well, it seems like soon we'll have to go into our lovely, amazing sign off music, which is, by the way, done by another famous subgenius.

1011
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,180
A couple of subgenius famous ministers.

1012
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:07,160
Reverend Mark Mothersley and Reverend Byron Warner.

1013
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,140
Even others.

1014
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:11,860
Yes.

1015
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,140
And so we find our time is running out.

1016
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,540
And it's sad that we have only one hour for each.

1017
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,060
And we're outcast.

1018
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,400
But you know, it all balances out.

1019
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,500
One great religious evacuation.

1020
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,880
And I would recommend reading for scriptures 16, 14, 17, 18.

1021
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,400
And you can write for information on how to order these wonderful, precious tapes.

1022
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,520
Get your pencils ready.

1023
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,620
And we'll be reading the address very soon.

1024
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,760
We need that money for the home for slackless children.

1025
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,600
And your contributions also keep those we hate starving today.

1026
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,700
I command you to spill your gifts.

1027
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,860
See, plan to one hundred pounds of dollar bills on.

1028
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,560
Dr. Gordon's lap.

1029
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,640
And this will buy only clay and transform her toys for those poor children.

1030
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,500
Dogs will bless you for coming to see Faith.

1031
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:53,920
Amen.

1032
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,420
Amen.

1033
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,640
And now the announcer will give our mailing address.

1034
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,540
That's the church of the subgenius.

1035
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,800
Write for information to P.O.

1036
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,200
