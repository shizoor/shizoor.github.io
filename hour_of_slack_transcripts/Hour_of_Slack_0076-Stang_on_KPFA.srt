1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:10,340
Oh yes, dear friends, this is Li Liqin, a Chinese subgenius, and you are listening to the Hour of Slap.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:19,480
Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people. He is a China, just like in America.

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,000
And people need slap.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,540
In Chinese, we call slap Lut in Thai.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,400
But it must be true slap.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Not the best slap.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,300
Boy, will you look at that guy's slap.

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,480
Help me somebody. Thank you, Li Liqin.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,380
Yes, my friends, we have the great Ivan Stang here tonight.

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,520
Ivan Stang himself, the grand auditor and chief inquisitor of the subgenius faith,

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,240
who has every subgenius' name on his special basement computer,

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,980
and he's here tonight to make the hour and a half.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,040
And the hour and a half of slack seemed like, well, like forever.

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,200
Ah, yes, dear friends, so good to be here.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,420
Say it, Ivan, say it.

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,060
Feeling the power.

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,880
In this hideous, hideous place.

18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,020
Bob lives, friends. Bob lives. Don't let him tell you otherwise. He ain't dead.

19
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,960
Oh, what is this?

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,300
I should know. I'm the guy that has to read sooner or later all the mail that comes to that P.O. box

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,980
that you probably thought was your phone.

22
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,700
It's just made up.

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,060
The opinions expressed by Ivan Stang do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the staff and management of this radio station,

26
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:46,260
the other staff, the relations and spouses of the staff and management, or the staff of this staff and staff.

27
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,660
That's really true, Hal, but he doesn't know that it's all over the place these days.

28
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,140
Bob's body dragged out of the Victoria Theater with these eyes.

29
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,260
These deadlights looked on Bob, baby.

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,980
And the light was driven from the...

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,660
...the sky.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,720
...the sky.

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:10,540
There's saint of failed corpses dotting the landscape all the way from Little Rock to Berkeley here.

34
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,240
I don't know what the big deal is.

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,040
I mean, just because there's a Dobbs corpse there doesn't necessarily...

36
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,140
I mean, can Bob really die?

37
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:29,340
I'd say yes, Ivan, and I think you better grow up and face the sick truth that this Bobby of yours isn't necessarily everything that you...

38
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,840
...you said.

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:29,980
...you said.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,320
...you said.

41
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,720
There have always been Bobs.

43
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,680
There has never been a world without a Bob.

44
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:45,440
Just as there's never been a Bob without a Dick, his corresponding evil twin brother, Dick Dobbs.

45
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,500
After a mental mutation...

46
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,540
The demons you may see during the initial hallucinations...

47
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,620
Get him away from me! Get him away from me!

48
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,900
If you do not panic, this phase will end after a few minutes.

49
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,000
JJD

50
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,500
...they'll show up.

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,940
I was gonna make serious funny noises.

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,480
Because we all know that Bob is the man that makes all the ladies go...

53
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,920
He's the man that makes all the men go...

54
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,740
It ain't an om-chattin' laid-back universe, dear friends.

55
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,740
It's a dream universe.

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,720
An action-packed universe.

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,020
Oh, yeah.

58
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,920
I don't know what's here.

59
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,620
A boring and sleepy...

60
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,720
A purulating and putrescent biologically active universe.

61
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,260
...coming from the holes between their shoelaces.

62
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,320
Enormous bioplasm that stretches throughout infinity.

63
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,300
Oh, did you get some of that, too?

64
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,840
Yes, it was delicious.

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,200
Then he'd force him to eat this big ugly piece of meat.

66
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,660
He was a little short, chubby guy, and that's where Bob got the idea.

67
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,260
They say he came in with checkered pants on, but I just don't remember.

68
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,180
He was allowed to eat all he wanted.

69
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,120
Anything he wanted.

70
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,100
Bob's big boy was a real person.

71
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,180
That's true, for there was a real Bob.

72
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,120
And this parable goes to show that there is indeed always a real Bob.

73
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,180
There has to be a Bob, dear friend.

74
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,200
Even the things which you cannot possibly believe in, Bob's big boy, indeed.

75
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,860
Turn out to be an actual historic person.

76
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:57,000
And as it is with Bob's big boy, surely it is with the far more impressive and major deity we know as the Avatar of All Slack.

77
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,560
That's how we know him.

78
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,580
Others call him him, or Monga.

79
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
Others call him a demon.

80
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,600
Or your mama, indeed.

81
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,860
And the children of Bob are everywhere.

82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,080
Bob lives on in his millions and millions, literally millions, of illegitimate children.

83
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,380
All of them...

84
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,980
...crossing lawsuits against me, personally.

85
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,020
Well, Doctor, I'm sure you're used to it by now.

86
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,220
Well, when I took on the job as sacred scribe at the church...

87
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,880
...for this kind of sharing of the lives of the church...

88
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,780
I had no idea what I was going to be getting into.

89
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,960
We had 500 employees in 1980.

90
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,440
Now it's just me and someone else.

91
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,960
Well, that's just the Reagan-esque spirit that's been...

92
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,280
...enjoyed togetherness for its own sake.

93
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,220
And yet they say that Bob doesn't even exist.

94
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,060
There are some who say that there is no Bob.

95
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,320
If there's no Bob, then where did all of those dead bodies come from?

96
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,180
What about all those ads in the 50s that he posed for?

97
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,820
What's this right here?

98
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,040
The body store.

99
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,420
Dead Bobs for any occasion.

100
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,660
Oh, put that away.

101
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,840
No Bob too small.

102
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,980
No Bob too big.

103
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,500
No, really, guys.

104
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,060
All kidding aside, I must admit...

105
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,460
...at least the official Father Church, the subjugation foundation...

106
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,900
...which we don't expect any of you except the stinking Bobbies to cling to...

107
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,220
...nevertheless, we have the only true word of Bob, the original apostles.

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,460
And as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing about Bob being dead is a ruse.

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,880
Bob staged that whole thing himself.

110
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,660
It was fashionable in the 60s.

111
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,840
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

112
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,480
That big...

113
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,080
...head.

114
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,340
That big...

115
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:44,440
...head.

116
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,160
Same frontwards and back, friends.

117
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,460
And there's a reason there's an O in the middle.

118
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,400
A hole in the middle between those two Bs.

119
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,820
It's symbolic, friends.

120
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,020
You can look through that...

121
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,780
...the center of that O in Bob's name and see the future and the past.

122
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,300
I think you guys are afraid of J.R. Bob Bob.

123
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,460
So you've been doing this show for almost five years now, disrespectfully...

124
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,440
...making fun of your high E-pop.

125
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,440
The man who...

126
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,460
...brought you slack.

127
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,500
I ain't afraid of J.R. Bob.

128
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,340
...died for your sins.

129
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,880
Nobody knows how many times.

130
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,640
The only thing that ever brought me slack was leaving Paul in St. Louis.

131
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,040
I'm not scared of Bob.

132
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,760
...shared this message with you.

133
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,980
I was the only slack I ever got out of this damn church, and it cost me $3,000 to have him shipped back.

134
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,160
Most people don't fear Bob.

135
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,600
Don't fear him a bit.

136
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,920
Oh, they think Bob's always going to be their buddy.

137
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,420
And then as soon as they think Bob...

138
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,980
...is dead, they turn around.

139
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,280
They think he ain't looking anymore.

140
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,480
They turn around and go to the pinks.

141
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,840
Going to the pinks, every one of them.

142
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,160
Oh, friends, he's just testing you.

143
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,220
He's been testing you for two years.

144
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,980
He knows if you've been bad or good.

145
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,820
Oh, yeah.

146
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,700
But more people are frightened of Gary than frightened of Bob.

147
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,940
Anybody want to go to an open bar?

148
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,180
Why does this situation persist?

149
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,900
Well, it's because of the general loss of faith...

150
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,240
...which accompanies the modern feeling.

151
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,140
And a feeling that one can no longer...

152
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,360
...support the credulity, superstition, and fanaticism...

153
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,040
...of an earlier time when one might well have believed...

154
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,840
...in the smiling, pipe-smoking, benevolent figure...

155
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,920
...known from the book of the subgenius.

156
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,640
That's right.

157
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,820
That was really beautiful.

158
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,920
Very touching, man.

159
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,180
That was just...

160
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,560
...beautifully moving.

161
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,000
Could you repeat that?

162
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,360
Escape from Alligator.

163
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,760
Ivan Stang, 15, shows scars after being attacked by an alligator...

164
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,580
...near West Palm Beach, Florida, Monday.

165
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,420
Ivan and a friend were swimming in a lake...

166
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,300
...when suddenly he was grabbed by the head...

167
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,340
...and pulled underwater by a giant, sharp-toothed saurian.

168
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,560
I couldn't see anything but teeth...

169
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,200
...and didn't know what had hold of me...

170
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,780
...until the gator let loose and swam away, said Ivan...

171
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,640
...who suffered wounds requiring 41 stitches.

172
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,700
This is supposed to be a religious show.

173
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,980
Now, what is the interpretation of this parable, my friends?

174
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,540
The alligator is the worldly mob, the rabble...

175
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,120
...who are the ones who are the most...

176
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,120


177
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,120


178
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,120


179
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,120


180
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,120


181
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,120


182
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,120


183
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,120


184
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,120


185
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,340
...always seek to devour and assimilate...

186
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,820
...the holy men of the Church of the Subgenius.

187
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,620
The lone swimmer, buoyed up by the fluid element...

188
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,760
...represents, upon the other hand...

189
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,060
...the striving outward force of the Church of the Subgenius...

190
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,860
...which requires 41 stitches...

191
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,280
...the same number as the number of bullet holes...

192
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,040
...in Bob's bullet-reddled body.

193
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,680
Praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.

194
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,000
Praise Bob, praise Bob.

195
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,560
What are we going to do?

196
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,580
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocre...

197
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,100
...disciples?

198
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,060
I wouldn't go that far.

199
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,100
These pink boys, these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens...

200
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,220
...these normals who have made normality the norm?

201
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,720
Well, no, I wouldn't like revenge on those people.

202
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,600
I'd like revenge on you, Ivan, because...

203
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,040
...you've taken one too many $20 check from me.

204
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,960
I've never got...

205
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,320
I want my slack!

206
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,260
Let's see your Subgenius membership card, hmm?

207
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,640
Now, let's not get...

208
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,740
I mean, say the end times came a little bit soon, Gary.

209
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,420
Do you think you'd make it on the escape saucers...

210
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,100
...of the second...

211
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,720
...of the next goddesses without your little...

212
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,520
...Subgenius membership card?

213
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,380
I'd sure try.

214
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,260
Ah, it's a great example you're setting for the people out here.

215
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,560
I've got my Bob Amira card here.

216
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,220
It says that I'm paid up to...

217
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,300
...$1897?

218
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,060
You see, Gary is the Rasputin...

219
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,620
...of the Church of the Subgenius, often thought for...

220
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,880
...but rarely encountered.

221
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,600
And it is this self-same learning for slack...

222
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,880
...which separates us from them.

223
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,640
At the hip.

224
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,020
The human may live...

225
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,160
...without its entire life...

226
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,560
...in a grinding cycle of slacklessness...

227
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,820
...yet he never feels cheated.

228
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,320
He thinks it's natural.

229
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,600
I suppose we could hit him, but...

230
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,300
...they're nothing but half-witted cattle...

231
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,260
...racing each other to be first to the slaughterhouse...

232
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,560
...and stampeding you along with them.

233
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,680
But what do you care?

234
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,040
Oh, you've got slack.

235
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:05,760
Slack.

236
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:05,960
Yeah.

237
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,820
Anybody want to go down the slide?

238
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,820
That's them all.

239
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,380
Oh, get along, little bobbies.

240
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,640
Go head on down to Dobstown now.

241
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,000
Get on in that Dobstown corral, you little bobbies.

242
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,720
Oh, there's a nice fat one.

243
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,340
Yes, he'll be a good trading commodity...

244
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,200
...come the bargaining session with the exes.

245
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,480
First up, I notice y'all don't talk about religion much.

246
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,720
I guess it's real hip out here in California.

247
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,120
It's a more humanistic approach to life.

248
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,000
No, we believe in just...

249
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,180
Just letting the holy benediction of Bob flow out like pus from a pustule.

250
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,080
You just don't understand the true power of the show.

251
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,140
Oh, it's very fashionable to say Bob is a good man.

252
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,900
Oh, he was a prophet, but the son of Jehovah One.

253
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,160
No, well, I don't go for these superstitions, you say.

254
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,720
Certainly not.

255
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,380
Very fashionable.

256
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,720
It hath not been my use to pray with moving lips and bended knees.

257
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,180
But silently, by slow degrees, my spirits I to Bob compose.

258
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,880
In humble trust, my eyelids close.

259
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
In reverential resignation.

260
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,120
No wish described, no thought expressed.

261
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,540
Only a sense of suffocation.

262
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:39,260
A sense, or all my soul impressed, that I'm out in the street undressed.

263
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:39,680
Isn't that beautiful?

264
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,140
Church air, one soul per breath.

265
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,980
Church air, one soul per breath.

266
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,120
Get your breaths right here.

267
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,260
Don't need oxygen.

268
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,180
By the Bob's early light.

269
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,540
That too loudly we'd screech.

270
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,700
In the toilet blaspheming.

271
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,420
Whose clogged eyes and dark ears.

272
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,920
This is supposed to be a religious show.

273
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,580
I thought there was a separation of church.

274
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:13,780
Bob.

275
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,840
Bob and country.

276
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,180
Bob and country.

277
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,540
This is a night where the hamsters were splashed.

278
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,760
And, of course, truffle pie.

279
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,120
I'll bet you think y'all's a joke too, don't you, Dave?

280
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,600
Funny joke.

281
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,460
Bob's a funny joke here.

282
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:37,440
Yo, I see what you've certainly been leading your radio listeners down the great path here.

283
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,180
Oh, big joke.

284
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,240
I guess the conspiracy's a joke too.

285
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,780
Oh, slack.

286
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,760
I guess that's a joke.

287
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:43,760


288
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:43,760


289
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:43,760


290
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:43,760


291
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:43,760


292
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:43,760


293
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,160
So a monk and a pastor said a blank.

294
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,340
Yeah, hang on, Dave, you're not supposed to be here.

295
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,420
You're supposed to be brothers and sisters.

296
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,920
minute notes.

297
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,760
So butter catches the makeup.

298
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,540
.

299
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,560
Oh, and they said to raise the last gift.

300
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,460
One.

301
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:05,520
Two.

302
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:05,520


303
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:05,520


304
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,460
Open.

305
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,460
Five.

306
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:08,620


307
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,840
Four years.

308
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,640
Four, five.

309
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,400
Six.

310
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,460
hl.

311
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,960
Dr. Dubois fan. I'm gonna deliver it myself.

312
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,060
Wait a minute. Don't give him the keys.

313
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,760
No, it's a hymn aphrodite.

314
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,260
I don't know.

315
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,740
I mean, this whole thing, it's like, what happened to the organ music?

316
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,520
Give me a can of sound effects while you're at it, would you?

317
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,580
Oh, yeah, and some show stretcher.

318
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,960
And listen to him.

319
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,700
I need some show stretcher back.

320
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,560
Yes, friends, little did many of you know,

321
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,100
but this isn't the only subgenius show.

322
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:53,880
In fact, there's six weekly subgenius shows now in New York, Beijing, New Jersey,

323
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,500
Richmond, Virginia, St. Louis, Dallas, and Dallas.

324
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,260
This, I'm afraid, does not count as an orthodox subgenius show.

325
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,500
I mean, I had no idea.

326
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,380
I had thought that, I mean, the sermons and the prayers,

327
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,940
and the sending up of praises, and killing...

328
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,340
It just don't happen that way.

329
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,340
You're in Berkeley, Ivan. You're in Berkeley.

330
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,140
The sacrifices.

331
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,720
Oh, we have the sacrifices.

332
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,260
The ritual scars.

333
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,820
We have those.

334
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,120
You used to have ritual scars on your forehead.

335
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,720
You've had them removed.

336
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,580
Oh, I didn't have them removed.

337
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,860
Trying to fit in, I guess.

338
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,300
The rat ate them off in my sleep.

339
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,180
...time I'm down to stay out.

340
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:36,900
Yes.

341
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,780
Oh, the cage.

342
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,460
Yes.

343
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,240
I got to lock myself in the cage when I was sleeping.

344
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,260
No wonder the rats died.

345
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,520
Once again.

346
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,840
Now, Dr. Stang, when we reflect upon the evils in this world,

347
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,420
why is it that Dobbs permits such Yehuism to exist?

348
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,040
Can you answer this spiritual conundrum for our listeners?

349
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,460
Well, uh, the Yeh-Dobb does not permit Yehuism to exist.

350
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,980
I thought he had to deliver the permit.

351
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,000
He allows it to exist.

352
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,340
He forces it to exist.

353
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,200
It is part of the bull-dada matrix of which the...

354
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,460
But what about the cow-dada matrix?

355
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,060
Why must we always look at the male angle?

356
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,300
Isn't it more interesting to look up a cow's dada?

357
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,120
And...

358
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,600
And...

359
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,880
An ancient art form turned into an illegal act.

360
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,600
The Aztecs went out for it in a big way.

361
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,960
Bob does not desire a monolithic one-world subgenius inquisition.

362
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,700
I mean, we don't...

363
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:58,360
We don't have to bow down to him, you know, or bend over to him, as the Bobbies do.

364
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,720
The Bobbies.

365
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,460
Yeah, there's some of these Bobbies here.

366
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,680
Get Zeon by these.

367
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:04,900
Bobbies.

368
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,820
Bobbies.

369
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,460
A little of both.

370
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,200
Both?

371
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,460
And those little collars.

372
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,620
That's right.

373
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,080
You slack vampires.

374
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,900
We'll get a reading on you.

375
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,740
Yes, you can speak to Ivan Stang himself, or the great Gary G'Bofram, or even your humble narrator,

376
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,340
your howling hierophant of the airwaves, Dr. Howell.

377
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,760
We're all broadcasting on behalf of the lurching church of the subgenus.

378
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,080
Help me somebody.

379
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,360
Salvation or salivation?

380
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:34,880
Salvation.

381
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,000
Salvation.

382
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,060
Oh, I'm so sorry.

383
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,820
You are receiving the church of the subgenius show if you are within the sound of our broadcast.

384
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,440
For whatever reason, you were tuned in to our transmission.

385
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:53,040
Be you an habitual listener or even a serendipitous insomniac, ranging the radio spectrum to allay

386
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,160
the tedium of sleeplessness, who happens for the first time upon our broadcast.

387
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,360
Do not attempt to adjust your radio.

388
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,380
I'll have Jack Danielson 7-up, please.

389
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:15,120
This show bears a patented Dobbs drum power shell time code, which may cause some home radios to react unpredictably.

390
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,800
Although only a small percentage of radios or their owners have suffered permanent damage.

391
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,980
We're not responsible, friends. We're not going to be responsible for what happens.

392
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:32,040
But what I want to know is who is responsible? Who's responsible for this suffering?

393
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:38,120
Well, Bob is, of course, Hal. Haven't you learned yet? Pain and sickness and death lies the IRS.

394
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,420
And a headache that lasts all year.

395
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,380
And a lot of checks in the mail, dear friend.

396
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,340
But what does it all lead to? What does it all mean?

397
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,160
An ever larger bank account for the subgenius Foundation Incorporated.

398
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,240
Dobbs did not die because he had to.

399
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,840
Wellman chose to kill him on the stage.

400
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,680
Not for you and everyone, but mainly for his own reasons.

401
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,920
This man was handed over to you by Dobbs's set purpose and knowledge.

402
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,040
And you, speaking to the people of Dobbs Town with the help of Rugo's pinkish ones,

403
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,460
put him to death by nailing him to the crosshairs of Wellman's gun site.

404
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,420
But Gobbs regurgitated, freeing his impoptitude from the agony of slacklessness,

405
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,320
because it was impossible for nee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to keep its hold on him.

406
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,840
And so the ghost of Dobbs...

407
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,140
Now his agonized spirit roams this earth, howling in outer darkness,

408
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,800
but hoping to regain its early hegemony.

409
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,400
The fop monsters are after me.

410
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,360
But the cross or wolf's bane or a sickle through Dobbs's throat or a stake through Dobbs's heart

411
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,000
can keep the e-pop to bay.

412
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,920
Remember, the monsters are out there and it's either you or them.

413
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,680
Even...

414
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,140
This has been a public service message from the Subgenius Show.

415
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,700
I don't understand.

416
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,440
Either you can take your stake and you can eat it or you can pound it through Dobbs' heart.

417
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,880
It has to be frozen, rigid and hard.

418
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,380
Look.

419
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,020
I'm sure you all recognize this beloved melody as the ever-popular oldie but goldie classic

420
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,960
I'll slap your chops shut, baby, with a Stilson wrench.

421
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,900
But did you know that the same haunting tune was also Splat It Over Rich's

422
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,640
Eczema Cantata No. 12, Op. 99 in C major?

423
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,120
Now you and your entire family, including kids from 6 to 60, can enjoy this and other classic

424
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,720
masterpieces of the world's longest-playing music in your own home whenever you like.

425
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,500
Expose your youngsters to the impotent world of symphonic overkill at any time and at your own convenience.

426
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,440
And you'll only spend about as much as you would for a really good set of luggage

427
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,820
or a year of education at one of the more prestigious institutes of higher learning in this great land of ours.

428
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,280
Every week you'll receive another high-tech...

429
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:08,700
...and a 98-rpm album, each in its own permanent storage case of semi-permanent, non-biodegradable, sturdy fiberboard.

430
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,440
And at first, you need pay nothing.

431
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,840
Later, we'll demand more and more, but you'll receive your first mutilaginous masterwork,

432
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,860
the Cospodore Concerti by G.R. Robertini-Dabzini.

433
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,420
Giovanni Rodrigo Robertini-Dabzini was director of chamber music to the Duke of Wellman.

434
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,120
He lived in dire poverty...

435
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,440
I am so tired...

436
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,660
...and suffered from yaws jaundice syphilis.

437
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:31,660


438
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,920
Gout, rotten teeth, and an unknown debilitating disease...

439
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,180
...which caused deaths of blindness, deafness, and madness.

440
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,960
Dabzini fathered 49 children by his second wife, Connie Maria Anna Hugeltoffler.

441
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:53,480
To support his large family, he wrote 467 symphonies, 98 concertos, 48 known motets, 19 operas, and two concertini.

442
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,600
His European fame was based above all on the sensitive sweetness of his adagio movements.

443
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,360
Theologians have debated the existence of a side three, but this, as well as a hypothetical

444
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,480
side four, are only in the realm of conjecture.

445
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,900
My friend, if you can reach side three of this show, then you will know you are already

446
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,420
in life.

447
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,220
Help me, somebody!

448
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,000
Pray, God!

449
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,660
I have a leg cramp.

450
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


451
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


452
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


453
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


454
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


455
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


456
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


457
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


458
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


459
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


460
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


461
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


462
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


463
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,660


464
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,680
Yeah, did you ever look at that Monty Python record?

465
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,000
It really did have three sides.

466
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,940
Well, perhaps if you tried to get side two of the show, you'd just get side zero of yourself.

467
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,740
I try to get to the other side, but there's no oxygen over there.

468
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:58,280
You open up the gates to your lower self, the lower self you share with all other subgeniuses.

469
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,720
Simply because I happen to share a lower birth with many subgeniuses,

470
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,080
I refuse to consign myself to an eldritch cleaving to laws far beyond our disposition,

471
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,600
which may indeed ice my soul.

472
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:18,700
And these starving subgenius refugees seen here crammed together in these Rolls Royces,

473
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:27,740
being sold off, Dobbs' whole collection of Rolls Royces now being auctioned off in Dallas.

474
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,900
Hey, here's a little news thing our listeners might be interested in.

475
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,820
Actors and musicians are invited to audition for the lead role in a stage show, Dobbs.

476
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,020
Words of music.

477
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:47,300
The first Bob is authorized to be done around him, which is made up entirely of 25 Bobs.

478
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,760
This is like a story we heard earlier.

479
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,760
It is as if it were ordained from the beginning of time.

480
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,460
It says here you have to go to Malaysia to audition.

481
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,700
Wait a minute, I'm not getting any royalties for that.

482
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,880
I never heard anything about a Dobbs stage show.

483
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,780
Too late, it's already on its way.

484
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,680
I'm afraid the Dobbs is a trademark.

485
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,120
The name is a trademark.

486
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,280
The name subgenius is a trademark.

487
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,880
I personally wrote a check for $400 to get that face trademark.

488
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,000
Look at this.

489
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,700
I've never paid for any of it.

490
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,280
This is true subgenius stuff you're hearing, folks.

491
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,220
This is the real thing.

492
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,860
This is no razzmatazz.

493
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,760
This is no tomfoolery.

494
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,700
This is the real Ivan Stang, and he's telling you the straight truth.

495
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,000
So stand up and pay attention.

496
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,700
Then she finishes.

497
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,800
Oh, they're making money all over the place off of Bob.

498
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,280
It's like the smile face now.

499
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:50,740
The following corporation is doing business as Dobbs Image Incorporated.

500
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,860
Here's another one right here on page 59.

501
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,960
It says,

502
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,640
The following person is doing business...

503
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,020
Bob's Brain.

504
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,360
Who could Bob be?

505
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,340
I mean, how many of these people are sending you money?

506
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,080
None of them.

507
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
You ain't fooling me, Philo.

508
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,620
I know you're out there.

509
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,140
You're listening.

510
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,480
I want you to call them boys off.

511
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,380
My boys will meet your boys behind the old church down there in Jonesboro.

512
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,180
You can bring all your minions and your evil conspiracy devils.

513
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,120
We're going to have it out, boy.

514
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,480
No, no, no.

515
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,760
That's not how it happened at all.

516
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,440
Doc Holliday stood over here by the fence.

517
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,660
And they were never actually in the sub-G corral.

518
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,440
The famous gunfight actually took place over here by the hotel.

519
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:41,520
Now, Kirk Douglas played the part of Doug Willman in the 1954 movie.

520
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,800
And these souvenir boots have been stuck in the street ever since.

521
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,100
And it's articulated.

522
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,980
It can make 27 smirks and sneers.

523
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,940
On its plastic face.

524
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,860
It has big, friendly plastic eyes, too.

525
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,560
Big, friendly eyes.

526
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:12,420
Experience time travel, anvil possession, past wives, UF odors, and big feet.

527
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,000
Here on the mysterious hour and a half of misery and darkness.

528
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,740
Yes, you're hearing the authentic spewings and spoutings of Ivan Stang himself,

529
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,980
as well as Gary Gubofram.

530
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,900
And the word was wrong.

531
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,460
And the evil Doctor Howell.

532
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,520
The same was in the beginning.

533
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,680
Burn him.

534
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,620
He's evil.

535
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,640
Evil.

536
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,700
And the guidance, the firm, intelligent hand, the guidance of Mobius Rex,

537
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,380
Dr. Mobius Rex, who has led us unerringly, never, Dave, never.

538
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,780
Down the primrose path, I would say.

539
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,300
There's many a grip twixt the tongue and the lips.

540
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,120
Yeah, I think I heard that one.

541
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,220
Actually, it's a lot better than the last sub-G.

542
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,480
I am the pea shooter.

543
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,220
And you are the pea, I think was the line used in there.

544
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,860
Just as we can tune our media in the chosen stations,

545
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,980
so can we attune our consciousness to a higher and more unbiased sub-G.

546
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,940
Hey, Gubofram, man.

547
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,820
There's a lot to be said about not receiving any West Coast money.

548
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,900
Because you understand, the money you receive has to be filtered through the West Coast church.

549
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,500
Because it's West Coast money.

550
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,120
I don't think it would do you any good if it came directly to it.

551
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,180
I think that us...

552
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,880
...saving our glands on the money perhaps does a lot more than you just getting it directly.

553
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,520
You would just waste it on something like paperclips.

554
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,780
Or money.

555
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,680
We take it down to the Emeryville mudflats and just throw it on the spot where you find that dirty, nasty head.

556
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,300
What is money, anyway?

557
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,280
Indeed, all is chaff which blows away in the exhalations of Jehovah One.

558
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:57,540
But it only gains its true power at the moment that it passes.

559
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:57,740
And that's what we had to deal with.

560
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,260
You can send your addresses from your pocket into Bob's.

561
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,060
And since Bob isn't here, you can still send for that information from...

562
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,120
We have Bob's through jeans here.

563
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,500
...the church of the subgenius.

564
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,140
And they need to be laundered.

565
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,100
We have the pocket of Bob here.

566
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,220
What are you talking about?

567
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,940
They smell like they haven't been washed in months.

568
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,120
But look, Connie did this embroidery.

569
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,220
Through this, the envious Willman slashed.

570
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,760
And as he plucked his cursed steel away,

571
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:30,120
Mark how Bob's special ichor followed it, as rushing out of doors to be resolved if

572
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,240
Wellman so unkindly knocked her no.

573
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,380
It is too Wellman.

574
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,440
Then fall Dobbs.

575
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,160
Then burst a mighty fart.

576
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,500
Great Dobbs he fell.

577
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,720
I'm not going to be able to let my kids listen to this show now.

578
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,360
Way to go.

579
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,840
Why, it's just an ancient Anglo-Saxonism from the early history of our race.

580
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,040
Meaning to hit or strife.

581
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,000
Yes, as in farquhar, farharharden farden harden farden.

582
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,860
How many of you pyroflatulate?

583
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,340
You've been blown off pyroflatulate.

584
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,260
Don't be embarrassed.

585
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,720
Come forth and testify.

586
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,980
Just call us at 848-4425.

587
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,920
That's 848-4425.

588
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,080
We release foul gases through our lungs with the sound of .

589
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,360
Call any time, day or night, if the spirits are moving.

590
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,820
Remember, there will always be a subgenius pastor there to hear you.

591
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,400
Hear your words and receive your heart.

592
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,920
Until you do, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

593
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,360
Professionals welcome.

594
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,360
Women discouraged.

595
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,400
Good sex for Mutants League and now stationed in Utah.

596
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,300
Say, I see a little light here on our board.

597
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,200
It looks like we have a caller after all.

598
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,160
A little whoopty-doo.

599
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,860
A caller.

600
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,980
A slack vampire.

601
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,620
Maybe, but maybe one from France.

602
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,420
Hello, you're on the air.

603
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,340
Listen, I've got a problem.

604
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,440
Uh-oh.

605
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,700
Every time I die, I'm going to be a little bit more of a wimp.

606
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:52,700


607
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:52,700


608
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:52,700


609
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:52,700


610
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,580
Something happened.

611
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,860
Cowards die many times before their deaths.

612
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,400
The valiant never taste of death but once.

613
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:07,740
And, you know, if Bob let you know for sure that there was an afterlife, half the people

614
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,140
in the world would commit suicide.

615
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,640
So there's an evolutionary reason for this.

616
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,040
We're interested in the...

617
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,880
And the other half would kill themselves.

618
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,240
It's a real drag.

619
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
It's the before life that concerns us.

620
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,180
That's right.

621
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,100
It's the pre-life.

622
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,860
The pre-existence.

623
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,740
The sub-life.

624
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,680
Sub-life.

625
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,460
The thing which is a plane of existence below our own life.

626
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,280
Hanging around in the ethereal nothingness.

627
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,780
The underwear lurking beneath the clothing of existence.

628
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,800
Subligacular.

629
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,560
Wait a minute.

630
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,640
We've forgotten the customer again.

631
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,320
Oh, yeah.

632
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,420
Dear lady, please express your opinion.

633
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,520
Please.

634
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,920
What should I do?

635
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,440
You must...

636
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:46,900
Open your mouth.

637
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,660
Donate your heart to Bob.

638
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,140
Yes.

639
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,140
Open your mind.

640
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,520
In a figurative manner, of course.

641
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,460
And open your wallet.

642
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,440
Yes.

643
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,160
And bend over.

644
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,560
And touch your ankles.

645
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,520
And receive the word of Bob, dear friends.

646
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,880
And I speak to you through the voice of Dr. Henry.

647
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,560
You will be changed.

648
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,600
You'll be a new being after that.

649
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,760
You'll have giant, powerful television sets and be able to walk through walls.

650
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,180
I am dedicated...

651
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,200
That sounds wonderful.

652
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,120
Say, could you tell me, are you as beautiful as all the women here in the Bay Guardian

653
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,900
want ads?

654
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,420
The relationship ads?

655
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,380
Uh...

656
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,200
Poor Dr. Cabofram is a lonely soul.

657
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:19,600
I feel better already.

658
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,420
I feel better already.

659
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:21,800
Thank you.

660
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,460
We have our own...

661
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:22,660
This is the only thing we can do.

662
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:22,680
This is the only thing we can do.

663
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:22,680


664
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:22,680


665
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,500
There is a subplot.

666
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,040
Wait a minute.

667
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,300
Wait.

668
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,980
Before you go, tell me, are you a fantasy caller?

669
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,160
You could feel the power.

670
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:28,880
Definitely.

671
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,180
Pink around the collar.

672
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,440
Well, let's check out then this other blinking...

673
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,200
Goodbye.

674
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:36,900
...apothegm.

675
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,200
Goodbye.

676
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,300
Put your hand...

677
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,440
Lay those hands on the radio speakers.

678
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,940
Make love to your radio.

679
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,240
I could stay.

680
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,360
L-O-U on air.

681
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,080
Lay your hand.

682
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,880
Yeah, I just saw Bob's body on the freeway, man.

683
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,880
Not again.

684
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,840
See, I told you, baby.

685
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,360
I told you.

686
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,820
We get those calls in Dallas.

687
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,520
Okay, now look.

688
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:51,820
That's why we...

689
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,380
I went out this time.

690
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,840
One of you guys go...

691
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,420
I went out two times and nobody else did it the last time.

692
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,920
Somebody else can go out and pick that thing up.

693
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,060


694
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,520
Call the animal control board.

695
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,060
I mean, I normally eat road kills, but I don't know about the smashed dogs there.

696
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,560
We'll have to send one of those animal control trucks over.

697
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,360
It's no good.

698
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,560
It's destroyed, man.

699
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,340
It's destroyed.

700
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,120
50 cars ran over it before anybody would stop.

701
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,720
Well, I'd say it's probably...

702
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,100
Well, you know, but the cells can still...

703
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,660
One cell carries all the code information to create a new dog.

704
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,140
You cook that thing just like you cook abalone.

705
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,500
You peel that dog's corpse right off the road.

706
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:27,920
Abalone.

707
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,720
You dip it in egg and a little bit of flour.

708
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,120
Eggs.

709
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,880
And cook it in olive oil or butter.

710
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,820
When was the last time you had you a big old bowl of fried dead body of dogs, dear friends?

711
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,720
We call it Bob's Birmingham.

712
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,000
Bob's Birmingham.

713
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,380
That's right.

714
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,200
It's the most delicious of all road kills.

715
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,080
Much better than skunks, squirrels, or kitty.

716
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,900
Or squished ferrets and weasels.

717
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,760
But Bob's spirit lives on.

718
00:32:51,760 --> 00:33:02,080
You can talk about these Bob corpses, like I said, but he lives because he's more than just a dead body with a grin on its face and a broken pipe in its mouth.

719
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,420
He represents something, dear friends.

720
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:04,760
He represents...

721
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:12,980
And all of the checks due to some P.O. Box 1403-06.

722
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,880
Dallas, Texas 75214.

723
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,060
Remember that address, folks, because later on during this program we're going to have a special bonus.

724
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,540
Sonia the seeing poodle wants to get on the mailing list.

725
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,620
Well, let's put her on.

726
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,640
I keep trying to send $20 in, but poodles can't write.

727
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,260
Well, why don't you write for her then?

728
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,760
We did get a subscription from...

729
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,260
And I hope you'll tell her hello from me, Dr. Howell.

730
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,080
Only I think she was kidding.

731
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,360
I think that was a fake name.

732
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,740
Some people use fake names in this jury.

733
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,220
They hide behind a pseudonym.

734
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,440
They're afraid the conspiracy's going to come after them.

735
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,960
Just because they...

736
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,920
The conspiracy gets their addressable friends, I'm the one who's got access.

737
00:33:54,040 --> 00:34:01,940
Me and only one other person on this whole planet, someone else, has access to the identity codes for all of you.

738
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,380
All the listeners of this show.

739
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,260
Cue Night of Slate shooting tape.

740
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:17,620
All right, now we're going to check out the movies on TV here, and we'll have a report about agricultural instruments and...

741
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,520
Oh, no.

742
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,420
Are they showing subgenius video?

743
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,340
The movie again?

744
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,100
Yeah, I believe so.

745
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,440
...and again.

746
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,280
...and again.

747
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,180
Oh, they're looking for a paystub artist to take the pieces of Bob Green and try to put them back together again.

748
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,780
Oh, that's art nowadays.

749
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,740
You put a pipe...

750
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,700
You take any picture, put a pipe on it, it's art.

751
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,580
Get 500 bucks or so for it, New York.

752
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,660
Boy, is subgenius art.

753
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,420
Got a pipe.

754
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,600
My kid does better art than that.

755
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,220
Art.

756
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,800
...

757
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:50,500
Yeah.

758
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:50,520
We've完了, folks.

759
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:50,520


760
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:50,520


761
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:50,520


762
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:50,520


763
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:50,520


764
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:50,520


765
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:50,520


766
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:50,520


767
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:50,500
