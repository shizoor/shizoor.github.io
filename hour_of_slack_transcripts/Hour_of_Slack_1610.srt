1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,640
I am seeking information about Bob. Let us see what is on the radio.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,920
You're listening to PR News.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,960
No, I don't think I can accept that program.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,060
Nor that one.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,180
The Self-Demons Power of Swat Team!

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,600
The Self-Demons Power of Swat Team!

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,340
The Self-Demons Power of Swat Team!

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,180
I cut my finger on a soup can lid. I got an infection and it spread to my dick.

9
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,880
It swelled up to the size of a human head. And then a mouth opened on it.

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,280
And this is what it said. It said it killed the Pink Boys.

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,860
But your job? Mom, go work and worship Bob Dobbs.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,160
What are you doing?

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,900
We'll build a ship and take a trip. Come on and get a pay-write to coordinates.

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,660
Three and a half months in my garage.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,640
Tearing parts off of old used cars. My groin at this point was unusually large.

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,160
I would occasionally hum while smoking cigars.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,580
Our project was finished. The ship would hold twenty.

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,960
The power source was anything the crew would think was funny.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
We didn't need the slack list. They're hapless.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
Our work group is working. Escaping a stark fit.

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,260
On our way to Planet X-R-Sex. The next next.

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,560
The prairies quiver. Every pot of money shot at Connie.

23
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,160
It's an all-haas hour of work.

24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,940
We're a bonanza. It's like a world without Tony Danza.

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,060
A fan to the pink shit that gets the charts.

26
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,900
In a world of dead hearts, I don't think.

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,380
Lobotomy and sodomy. We take a moment and we pause to reflect.

28
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,940
On the pinks that we feel and the planet that they wreck.

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,440
And we laugh like banshees and howl like comanches.

30
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,980
We're a victory dance in our underoos and panties.

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,400
Ah, yes dear friends. In our underoos and panties.

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,420
As the El Queso All-Stars sang in that classic old song.

33
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,440
Planet X-R-Bust.

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:07,840
And Tarzan's radio station is holding up beautifully here on the eighth day of 19X Day.

35
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,600
I don't know how many days we've been out here actually.

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:20,500
But Tarzan's radio studio was used to mix the bands and the ranters last night.

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,540
And it worked like gangbusters.

38
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,240
So it just goes to show if you leave old Reverend Stang.

39
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,580
With his old equipment.

40
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,440
His old Radio Shack mixer.

41
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,140
And his little borrowed other mixer from Reverend Heathen.

42
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,520
You did forget your reel-to-reel though.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,200
Oh, and my 8-track. My 8-track recorder.

44
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,360
What about all your carts?

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,780
Anyway, it seems to work best when Reverend Stang is physically present with the band.

46
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,580
A foot behind them up on the stage.

47
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,200
That's the only way I can hear him.

48
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,140
I'm totally deaf.

49
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:08,280
I do this by kind of braille and watching the lips and the meters.

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,840
You know, the volume meters.

51
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,100
Well, maybe I should turn my amplifier up just a little bit louder to where you can hear it.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,120
But everyone else's ears will just begin to bleed.

53
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,660
Yeah, right. Exactly. It doesn't hurt me.

54
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,680
No, it doesn't hurt you at all.

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,320
I can hear that bell over there. That great big bell.

56
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,820
Yeah?

57
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,480
I'm just guessing what you're saying.

58
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,080
It's not bad, huh?

59
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,660
And it doesn't matter on a subgenius show.

60
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,480
Amplify.

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,240
Yes.

62
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,520
It's kind of like kids in a sandbox anyway.

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,660
Let's see. I'm mic one. Hal's mic two.

64
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,280
And Reverend Angry Larry is mic three.

65
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,580
We have Reverend Angry Larry here today on Hour of Slack number one thousand five...

66
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,180
Insert correct number.

67
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,960
Aren't you lucky.

68
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,720
Yeah.

69
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,400
So...

70
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,840
Ah.

71
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:03,540
And I got my first good night's sleep since X Day started by staying in bed until one o'clock in the afternoon.

72
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,520
You're asleep now, Stang. You've got to wake up and get down to Caffeina's and sit up on the stage.

73
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,540
Oh, no. Oh, where am I? Oh, no.

74
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,660
Oh, Mom, I don't want to get up and go to school.

75
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,960
You... But I had the weirdest dream and you were in it, Hal. And you were in it, Reverend Angry Larry.

76
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

77
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,800
Ugh.

78
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,440
That was a dream.

79
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:39,240
I actually did dream this morning that I woke up and decided to take some LSD, which I haven't actually done in many years because it makes my neck hurt.

80
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,820
Ha, ha, ha.

81
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:51,440
And then in the dream, just as it came on, I realized, oh, no, that was a dumb idea. I told my mom and dad I'd drive them around the shopping mall today.

82
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,580
Ha, ha, ha.

83
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:03,060
My mom and dad are both aboard the saucers, so it was kind of a strange dream. But I woke up before I died either way.

84
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,680
Or before you took them to the mall.

85
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,300
Right.

86
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,800
On LSD.

87
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,640
Ha, ha, ha.

88
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,360
That sort of thing happens.

89
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,240
Ha, ha, ha.

90
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:11,520


91
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,200
Ha, ha, ha.

92
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:18,740
Well, there's nothing like suddenly having to deal with your parents on LSD. That's not something I'm recommending, kids.

93
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,700
Well, a friend of mine dropped an acid.

94
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:22,780
Ha, ha, ha.

95
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:22,780


96
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:33,760
And he was getting ready to chill. And suddenly his mom came to his door and said, oh, you've got to drive me and my church group around. We're going to meet a new writer.

97
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,860
Why don't you? Like, she writes kind of science fiction-y things.

98
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:46,160
And so he was barely able to hold it together, pretending to be normal, picking up the ladies, you know. His mom was directing, which helped.

99
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,780
And then they picked up the writer, Evangeline Walton.

100
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,440
Ha, ha, ha.

101
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:59,120
And she has a strange disease which makes her skin blue. But nobody was mentioning this, of course, out of politeness.

102
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,180
Ha, ha, ha.

103
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:10,480
You know, so my poor tripping friend was trying to deal with someone with, you know, orange hair and lips and blue skin, you know, and everyone else just chattering away.

104
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,860
Things like that wait for you to take the drugs to happen.

105
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,060
Because any other day he wouldn't have had to go pick up this lady that was blue.

106
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,400
No.

107
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,660
Only the day that you drop acid.

108
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,340
I had a weird experience sitting around at my former in-law's patio.

109
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,640
They had a tarp on it and it had rained a little while ago and there were pools of water on the tarp.

110
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,380
And I was tripping. I looked at this pool of water and it was, it appeared to be shrinking.

111
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,760
And I was going, no, no, I've never had a hallucination before.

112
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,360
No, it, it, it, it can't be. What's going on here?

113
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,340
And it was a tiny little hole in the tarp.

114
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,680
And it really was slowly draining, you know.

115
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,920
But it waited until I was tripping to do that.

116
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,160
A ghost is in here drinking it.

117
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,840
Now, the puddle wasn't talking to you, was it?

118
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,480
No. I've never had anything like that happen.

119
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,760
Be calm. I am a puddle.

120
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,820
Well, I'm going by with what that girl that was eating the hot dog.

121
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,460
I was thinking of that too.

122
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:15,860
Yes.

123
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,060
Yeah, the complaining, whining, screaming hot dog.

124
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,840
Yeah, the screaming hot dog.

125
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,720
Who was that?

126
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,840
It was, I think it was designed as a scare film.

127
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,700
Yeah, it was an anti-drug film.

128
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:35,800
About this girl who dropped acid and her and her boyfriend stopped to get a hot dog at a vendor.

129
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:44,720
And she was holding on to it and she looked down and the hot dog began to talk to her about, you know, don't eat me.

130
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,380
Yeah, it's enough to turn you into a vegetarian.

131
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,780
Well, yeah, that.

132
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,920
Well, who knows?

133
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,700
Maybe your broccoli might start talking to you, telling you that, hey, I'm alive when you're cutting me up.

134
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:04,140
Well, one thing we learned out on Stang Ranch is don't name the animals if you're going to eat them.

135
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,160
Makes it a little harder.

136
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,640
Yeah, they raised a little calf.

137
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,440
They decided, normally they just sell, send them off to market.

138
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,240
But my brother decided, well, we'll raise one of these calves and take them to the meat processing place and get the calf back.

139
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,920
For dinner table.

140
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,800
But they named the calf Tap Tap.

141
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,900
And my niece was feeding Tap Tap and treated Tap Tap special.

142
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:35,580
And the day that Tap Tap arrived as a naked lunch on her plate, she became a vegetarian for about five years.

143
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,300
Wow.

144
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:36,880
Yeah.

145
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,960
The Lisa Simpson thing.

146
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,420
How could she tell?

147
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,200
Well, she just knew.

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,280
Well, the Tap Tap wasn't out in the yard anymore.

149
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,080
Right.

150
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,040
And frolicking around.

151
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,380
No, she knew that that was what Tap Tap was being raised for.

152
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,360
It was for their dinner.

153
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,560
It wasn't just going to be some anonymous cow wrapped in cellophane from the supermarket.

154
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,000
This was Tap Tap.

155
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,540
Now, my brother names his goats.

156
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,440
He always has about 80 of them.

157
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,000
And when they have kids, then he names all the kids.

158
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,000
And he really does remember all of their names.

159
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,780
These things look pretty much to you or me, they'd look all alike.

160
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,340
Right.

161
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,980
But they have, for instance, there's one called Twister.

162
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,240
And it was because the white spot on his forehead looked kind of like a tornado.

163
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,140
Well, that I can understand.

164
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,580
A cartoon tornado.

165
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,960
And he'd name them after wines for a while.

166
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,880
You know, one year all the babies would be named Burgundy or Chablis or, you know.

167
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,380
Boone's Farm.

168
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,340
But I asked him, you know, he's fairly close to them as goats go.

169
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,100
I said, I've never gotten a straight answer to this question.

170
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
It's like, what happens to them after you sell them?

171
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,640
And this last time I asked him, he said, I'll try not to think about that.

172
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,620
I believe they end up in Jamaican and Mexican restaurants.

173
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,860
I wish they'd end up in more regular American restaurants because I'd like to try goat more often.

174
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,760
And so this is X Day.

175
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,460
And we are the goats.

176
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,380
Bob is our shepherd.

177
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,980
And Bob is saying right now.

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,880
Our Judas goat.

179
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,820
I prefer not to think about that.

180
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,060
What happens to us, Bob?

181
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,360
What's Planet X like?

182
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,460
Oh, I don't want to think about that right now.

183
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,920
When the other deities go to Bob and go, what really happens to your followers after we rupture them up?

184
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,960
Oh, I don't want to talk about that.

185
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,860
Princess Wee is waving her phone at me as if she just located something that was lost.

186
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,280
Oh, no.

187
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,620
Her phone.

188
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,360
Is that what happened?

189
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,040
Her smile.

190
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,120
Gee, is that.

191
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,940
Her smile is returned.

192
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,600
She found her smile.

193
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,840
Which is always a very beautiful smile.

194
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,540
Your lost coat was left here inside in the nice drive.

195
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,440
Your lost coat was left and you've been worrying about that coat without telling me.

196
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,240
And you didn't want to admit you didn't have the phone.

197
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,440
Oh, I thought she said with.

198
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,980
Oh, well.

199
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,120
With the headphones on, I thought she said she lost her goat.

200
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,040
And she found her long lost goat.

201
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,300
Have you found your hat and goat?

202
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,800
Why a goat?

203
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,920
Well, there's certain aspects of X Day that always happen.

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,540
And one of them is losing really, really important things.

205
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,160
But then they come back.

206
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,260
For a while.

207
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,140
They do come back.

208
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,100
I had a video camera that disappeared for a terrifying three hours.

209
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,000
It was under a box in the back of my car.

210
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,580
It's always under something.

211
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,560
Kids, look under things.

212
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,560
And everyone loves under things.

213
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,780
What do you think subgenius is all about?

214
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,360
Hal explained that many times.

215
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,740
Yes, the underwear lurking beneath the clothing of existence.

216
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,700
The subligaculum that was known to the ancients.

217
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,940
Covering up our nakedness.

218
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:11,460
Yes, as ever had to happen after being banned from the Garden of Eden by the Urim and Thummim and the whirling swords of fire.

219
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,340
Oh, but now we'll take stay.

220
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:13,760
We can't.

221
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,860
We'll have a dance at Jake and all round about the kids are all dancing out there in the field.

222
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,020
We'll be hopping over the Hollyhocks and drinking the poteen.

223
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,860
The vampire leprechauns are stalking everybody.

224
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,780
Yes, leprechaunism isn't catching.

225
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,900
Not in the way you may think.

226
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:42,180
But you might find yourself shrinking a wee bit and being measured for an adorable little pair of buckled shoes.

227
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,940
This music, by the way, is made in Japan.

228
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,760
Of course it is.

229
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,320
It's from the game Monster Hunter 3.

230
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,360
When you walk into one of the little villages,

231
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,680
this stuff plays in the background.

232
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,840
Department of Product Placement Department.

233
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,100
Yeah.

234
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:00,960
Thank you.

235
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,620
Yeah, Capcom pays me.

236
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,620
Wait a minute, they're playing me.

237
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,340
They said they were going to pay me, but they're playing me.

238
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,100
Yeah, they're playing you.

239
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,640
I'm playing you like a sucker.

240
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,880
Wake up and smell the mucilage.

241
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,080
That wouldn't happen to a subgenius to get fooled or tricked or played

242
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,860
by a preacher or a salesman or anything like that.

243
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,240
No.

244
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,740
Preachers and salesmen lying or being wrong?

245
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,000
That's crazy.

246
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,740
Being snookered by Bob?

247
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,100
Could that ever happen?

248
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,380
If that was the case,

249
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,280
everyone would be asking for their membership money back now.

250
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,220
Oh, they do that all the time,

251
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,320
and they want the triple your money back thing,

252
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,500
and I have to point out,

253
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,020
no, you haven't proved that you didn't get eternal salvation yet.

254
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,700
That's going to take a while to prove that in court.

255
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,280
Yeah, that's a long time.

256
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,720
Can you prove you didn't get eternal salvation?

257
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,020
Can you prove damages?

258
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,160
An addendum to the embarrassment of the Christian great white throne judgment

259
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,480
is when they parade Stang and all those memberships.

260
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,720
The judgmental will be at the judgment.

261
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,140
Call forth.

262
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,760
I am recording angels.

263
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,540
Call forth Reverend Ivan Stang.

264
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,540
His name does not appear, Lord.

265
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,160
I work for the church of subgenius.

266
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,660
I'm not really supposed to be here.

267
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,700
Cast him into the lake of fire.

268
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,040
Oh, thank you, Lord.

269
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,940
The lake of fire.

270
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,180
That's what I most wanted.

271
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,520
Just, oh, thank you for not sending me to subgenius hell.

272
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,120
I have changed my mind.

273
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,060
Send him to subgenius hell.

274
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,060
Oh, gosh, that's terrible.

275
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,840
Oh, I'm going to live forever on and on in subgenius hell.

276
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,820
Oh, for the power.

277
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,780
The Briar Stang.

278
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,760
Right, right.

279
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,200
That's it.

280
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,320
Learn from the tales of Uncle Remus.

281
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,740
Yes.

282
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,340
Boy, I heard a politically...

283
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:01,660
That's kind of the whole thing.

284
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,620
I heard, I found a CD of somebody telling Uncle Remus stories at a yard sale, and I bought it.

285
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,120
And I was so sorry because...

286
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,620
I was so sorry because it had been all PC-ified.

287
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,360
Oh.

288
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,120
It had lost its charm.

289
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,500
You know, they had an African-American reading it, but he sounded just like a, you know, modern day.

290
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,620
Your next door neighbor with a can of beer.

291
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,200
Exactly.

292
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,480
No, he actually sounded more like Morgan Freeman playing God or something.

293
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:28,820
Oh, no.

294
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,400
And that's just not Uncle Remus.

295
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,020
I know Uncle Remus.

296
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,080
I knew Uncle Remus.

297
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,780
And you, sir, are no Uncle Remus.

298
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,180
Right.

299
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,480
Yeah.

300
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,100
Well, it's the same thing as Aesop, who was always...

301
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,100


302
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:47,160
He was also a slave, but smarter than the masters, telling these stories which encapsulate all wisdom.

303
00:15:47,380 --> 00:16:02,500
And in the version handed down from African slaves by Joel Chandler, Paris, the original plantation dialect is preserved, which of course is now anathema, except in rap songs.

304
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,680
Right.

305
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,680
Exactly.

306
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,360
Yeah.

307
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,020
It's fine.

308
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,100
It's fine.

309
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,260
It's fine.

310
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,260


311
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,260


312
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,260


313
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,260


314
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,260


315
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,260


316
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,260


317
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,240
What goes around comes around one way or another.

318
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,200
You can't hold back something.

319
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,180
Soul.

320
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,380
That's what you can't hold back.

321
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,800
That's right.

322
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,560
A volatile quantity which will not be contained.

323
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:28,680
Just like here at X Day, where most of the subgeniuses could not be contained at Caffeinez

324
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,900
or this ultimate, or perhaps penultimate, Bobcast.

325
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,080
Well, you can't blame them.

326
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,980
Only the cool ones.

327
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,300
Well, you can't blame them.

328
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,240
Because they know it's...

329
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,800
Here goes a huge load of slack moving out now.

330
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,260
Yeah, there's a truck.

331
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,300
We're watching a truck trundling down the road carrying garbage and subgeniuses.

332
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,540
There's an infant driving...

333
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,380
You make the distinction.

334
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,560
There's literally...

335
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,180
There's an infant driving the truck.

336
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,060
Right there.

337
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,480
There is.

338
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,000
There is.

339
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,860
There's a baby driving the truck.

340
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,400
I am not lying.

341
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,300
He's standing on his dad's lap driving the truck.

342
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,580
Yeah.

343
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,040
Just steering away.

344
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,580
Good for him.

345
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,380
Or her.

346
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:03,960
Well, it's nice to see you.

347
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,380
Thank you.

348
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:04,940
Thank you.

349
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,500
Thank you.

350
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:05,500


351
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:05,500


352
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,440
Well, I saw Reverend Dr. Sinsomniac in that truck smiling.

353
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,960
He's a new guy and having a great time.

354
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,100
Made some new friends.

355
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,420
I noticed there's a lot of new subgeniuses this year.

356
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,260
There are a lot of new subgeniuses and there were some that...

357
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,240
The old subgeniuses that they just got too old for X Day.

358
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,480
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

359
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:34,540
Well, they had to move off to other lands not so permissive as here at X Day.

360
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,280
We had G. Gordon Gordon.

361
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,280


362
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,700
Gordon is in Portugal now.

363
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,220
On purpose?

364
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:39,620
He had to...

365
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,380
Yeah, he had to...

366
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,380
Well, it makes sense for them.

367
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,860
They speak fluent Portuguese and Spanish, but they were a little concerned about President

368
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,320
Trump.

369
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,460
Did they yell all the time?

370
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:49,580
I'm sorry.

371
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,260
Emperor Trump.

372
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:50,960
Emperor Trump.

373
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,860
I'm so sorry.

374
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,720
I didn't mean that.

375
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,000
It's just a slip of the...

376
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,640
By the time this show plays, we're going to be in trouble on the air.

377
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
By then, the election will have happened.

378
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,280
Last X Day, the recorded material lasted through November.

379
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,280


380
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,640
There we go.

381
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,260
The election drove Reverend Lonesome Cowboy Dave crazy.

382
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,760
And he didn't have far to go.

383
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,540
Well, that's true of any of us.

384
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,100
What was eating him?

385
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,660
What was the matter with the couple having a bunch of...

386
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:26,040
I was playing the recordings of us from X Day and he couldn't make it to X Day because

387
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,160
this time his body was sick.

388
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,880
Usually it's because his car is sick.

389
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,780
Or his dog, actually.

390
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,260
His dog, I think, was the main controlling factor in this thing.

391
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


392
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


393
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


394
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


395
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


396
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


397
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


398
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


399
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


400
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


401
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


402
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


403
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


404
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


405
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


406
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


407
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


408
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260


409
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,800
It's not his car, it's his life until old Jake died.

410
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,340
I used to laugh at that because I haven't had a dog in about 15 years.

411
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,980
I grew up with him, but I felt like that's slavery.

412
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,800
And it is.

413
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,700
Most dogs don't know any better.

414
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,220
But then I inherited Pappy's old dog, Dammit.

415
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,320
And now I just can't wait to get back to Texas and watch Dammit run free some more.

416
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,400
The dog's name is Dammit?

417
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,880
Well, why not?

418
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,240
It was...

419
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,600
It's spelled D-A-M-M-E-T-T.

420
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,240
Damnit.

421
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,240


422
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,240


423
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,300
Sort of like Dashiell Hammett or Dammit.

424
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:08,820
All right, gotcha.

425
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,200
There's a Dammit somebody.

426
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,180
That's funny, though.

427
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,660
Because usually you're yelling at a dog that way anyway.

428
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,940
Dammit, dammit, dammit.

429
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,700
Chicken John's dog was named Dammit.

430
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,880
Right, with an I.

431
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,580
The I, right.

432
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,160
Yeah, and Reverend P's dog is probably Dog It or something.

433
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,560
Dog It.

434
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,360
Yeah, of it.

435
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,020
Dog of it.

436
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,140
And Reverend Andrew, Andrew the Impale, what was his dog's name?

437
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,120
Quickly.

438
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,280
Quickly.

439
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,960
He does a song about it.

440
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,000
Fuck it.

441
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,640
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.

442
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,440
That's his dog's name?

443
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't know.

444
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,520
I'm just thinking since we're talking about its.

445
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,940
Yeah, well, on the broadcast version of the show, that's going to say beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

446
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,680
And that's fine.

447
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,580
I think that's funny.

448
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,320
They're fun.

449
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,120
Susie the Flusie and I both can see the word shit as a waveform.

450
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,280
Oh, and what it looks like?

451
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,620
Yeah.

452
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,000
That is good work.

453
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,100
It looks a lot.

454
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,160
It looks a lot like the shout on the Devo album cover.

455
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,860
They use the waveform of shout.

456
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,620
It's a longer than shit.

457
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,800
Yeah, she's drawing it.

458
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,580
Susie is drawing the waveform.

459
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,900
Kind of a little.

460
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,080
Yeah.

461
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,560
Oh, it's so much easier.

462
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,880
All you do is you look for that and you go, okay, that's, that's not, that's a beep.

463
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:35,100
I'm sure somebody could make a software that, that found shits, but they would also mistake other words, you know, and find things that sounded similar.

464
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,120


465
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,920
Slightly like that.

466
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,520
Well, if you were talking about a dog, like a shih tzu, it would only come out as Sue.

467
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,440
Right.

468
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,300
Or beep Sue or Bob Sue.

469
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:46,920
Bob Sue.

470
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,560
Well, that was a weird breed, the Bob Sue that they've made it.

471
00:20:53,560 --> 00:21:02,580
They bred them over in China over centuries to grow the little, little one tooth would grow outwards and then up like a pipe.

472
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,780
Think how many generations.

473
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,100
Yeah.

474
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,320
They had to go through to make a pipe tooth dog.

475
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:07,820
Yeah.

476
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,440
Well, the Bob, Bob Sue.

477
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,020
An ugly dog, in my opinion, that's always drooling.

478
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,200
It can't close its mouth over its tooth.

479
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,660
It's wet fur.

480
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,340
It's a.

481
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,900
It has an underbite, I think.

482
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,120
I don't like dogs like that anyway.

483
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:24,760
I like it.

484
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,200
I think medium sized dogs are best.

485
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,740
I don't like the little bitty rat like ones.

486
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,840
Well, I have a basset hound and they drool too.

487
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,860
But yeah.

488
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:32,880
I like it.

489
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,180
Oh, X day where we talk about dogs.

490
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,620
Yeah.

491
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,960
I mean, but it's from a subgenius standpoint.

492
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,480
Yes.

493
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,220
You can talk about anything from a subgenius standpoint.

494
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,120
It'll sound about all sorts of justice.

495
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,640
Boring.

496
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,160
All different.

497
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:47,780
Shines.

498
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,440
It's boring.

499
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,760
Well, this all started around talking about Lonesome Cowboy Dave's dog and how is it a schnauzer or a Weimaraner?

500
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,340
What?

501
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,040
Lonesome Cowboy Dave's dog.

502
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,400
Oh, well, it's a dead dog is what it is.

503
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,280
What was it?

504
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:01,840
It's it.

505
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,220
It.

506
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,580
It.

507
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:02,740


508
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:02,780
It.

509
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:02,840
It.

510
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:02,840


511
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:02,840


512
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:02,840


513
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:02,840


514
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:02,840


515
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:02,840


516
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,120
It's a great big Labrador, much like Reverend Heathen's dog, Bubba.

517
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,160
Bubba dog.

518
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:07,960
OK.

519
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,140
And I used to.

520
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,320
I'd forgotten what it was like to let a dog rule your life until I had a dog again.

521
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,440
And boy, they train you so fast.

522
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,340
Oh, yeah, they do.

523
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,700
You mustn't allow it.

524
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,840
And especially you must not allow cats to train you.

525
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,460
Cats don't train you.

526
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,860
They just do what they do.

527
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,340
No, they will actively train you.

528
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,420
Oh, no.

529
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,700
I have two of those too.

530
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,280
Yeah.

531
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,280


532
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,280


533
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,280


534
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,280


535
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,280


536
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,280


537
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,380
Cats secrete a special substance through their vomerosal passages, which they rub on you.

538
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,600
Eventually, they can get you to do their bidding if you don't watch out.

539
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,840
Cat ladies are humans who are completely far gone and in their thrall.

540
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,240
The Sissy the Flusy is a lizard lady that way.

541
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,780
They rub their gland, their lizard gland on her, and she's hooked.

542
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,380
Yeah.

543
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,200
Hooked, I tell you.

544
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,740
Yeah.

545
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,200
Yeah.

546
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,840
And afterwards, she saved one from the.

547
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,040
the freezing elements of a middle northern state or something like that.

548
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,920
They nestle in her bosom.

549
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,340
Yep, on the airplane, and she took it home.

550
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:19,500
So you see, if the cat will yowl early in the morning before you get up

551
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,300
and try to get you to get up and give it some food,

552
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:29,340
if you ever give in, even once, and give it some food, it will yowl forevermore.

553
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:35,160
Your only chance is not ever, not for the convenience of the moment.

554
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,820
Don't shuffle out of bed and do what it wants.

555
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,140
Do not ever start doing what it wants.

556
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,000
This is my advice, freely given, probably ignored.

557
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,300
We picked up two disemboweled mice up at Charlene's bed and breakfast in the last couple of days.

558
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,000
At a cat?

559
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,860
Yeah, that's a good cat.

560
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,860
Kings on duty.

561
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,780
Well, the cat saw Princess Wee get scared by a mouse.

562
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,140
She jumped on the table.

563
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,180
It said, eek, a mouse.

564
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,480
And the next thing you knew, there were disemboweled mice.

565
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,120
Corpses all over the place.

566
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,060
Corpses.

567
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,200
Well, it's like I said last night when we were up here doing our free jam with,

568
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,060
I forget, what's the name of our band?

569
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,300
Vulcan Jedi Mentat Dalek.

570
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:16,900
Right.

571
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:17,960
How's that?

572
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,720
I can remember.

573
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,640
Yeah, that's...

574
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,700
As we were playing last night, maybe it was just the noise,

575
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,500
or I would imagine that's probably what it was,

576
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,940
but there was plenty of mice.

577
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,060
There was plenty of mice shooting out from underneath the deck.

578
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,560
You know, I think those are actually voles.

579
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,960
I got a look at them and they didn't appear to be mice.

580
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,100
I vole you.

581
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,440
I vole everyone.

582
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,520
Yeah, either way.

583
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,220
But the voles did not like the band.

584
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,560
No, they did not like the band.

585
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,640
They were deafened.

586
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,720
The what?

587
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,080
Oh, check the vole meter over there.

588
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,540
Thank you.

589
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,580
We do have a vole meter.

590
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,000
We have a slackometer over there.

591
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,820
Oh, yeah.

592
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,500
We'll have to display that later.

593
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,660
It's not much good for the radio audience,

594
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,920
but it's one of those thermometers, you know, used for sales or whatever.

595
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,900
Only this is real and it shows the slack level.

596
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,180
And it was almost at the top last night.

597
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,280
Total saturation.

598
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,120
But then early this morning, it went way down.

599
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,080
Well, we have DJ Shaver to thank for bringing that.

600
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,520
That was a lot of fun.

601
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,280
His show last night was great.

602
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,140
I love his sock monkey reenactments of famous movie scenes.

603
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,240
He reenacted King Kong, Blue Velvet, Full Metal Jacket.

604
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,040
Yeah, Reservoir Dogs.

605
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,060
But he forgot to do the Exorcist, which is always a good one.

606
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,360
Right.

607
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,620
With sock monkeys, friends, if you can imagine.

608
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,280
He's manipulating them like marionettes.

609
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,400
Well, and he had Fay Wray.

610
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,400
Right.

611
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,020
He had Fay Wray that he took to the top.

612
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,040
He had trouble with the top of the Empire.

613
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,820
Oh, in 2001, where the...

614
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,260
Oh, yes.

615
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:03,800
The little sock monkey approaches the monolith tentatively and then learns how to build bombs.

616
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,700
Yeah.

617
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,860
Cool.

618
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,120
It's great what you can do with a sock monkey.

619
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,740
Oh, yeah.

620
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,200
And there's nasty things you can do with a sock monkey.

621
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,820
In our second childhood.

622
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,640
Infancy comes back again.

623
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,820
That he's working on something that has something to do with the amino acids with...

624
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,360
I think it was with the sock monkeys.

625
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:25,960
I don't know.

626
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,060
I don't know.

627
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,300
And so, some kind of a show that he was going to do.

628
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,940
Well, he was also talking about reenacting the human centipede with sock monkeys.

629
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,260
Oh, yes.

630
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,880
But he's going to need two more sock monkeys.

631
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,660
Two more sock monkeys.

632
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,000
Right.

633
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,540
And vomit bags.

634
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,560
Susie, I'd love to get you...

635
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,500
Susie's sitting there.

636
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,080
Could you share a mic with Reverend Angry Larry?

637
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,300
I would love to share.

638
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,700
I don't know if you could share a chair.

639
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,300
You'd have to bring your chair.

640
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,320
I would give up my chair.

641
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,080
You would give up your chair?

642
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,160
I would give up my chair for Susie.

643
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,800
The chairman...

644
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:55,940
Oh, my God.

645
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:55,940


646
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,440
The chairman of the...

647
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,800
Will you rest your boobs on my shoulder?

648
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,220
Awesome.

649
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,440
That's not going to get bleeped out, is it?

650
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,300
Lean towards the microphone.

651
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:02,640
Oh, my God.

652
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,660
Oh, my Bob.

653
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
The luckiest...

654
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,580
Where's the cameras?

655
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,020
Whoa.

656
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,020
Oh, wait.

657
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,120
I've got one in my pocket.

658
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,420
I forgot.

659
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,020
I always have a camera now.

660
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,380
It's so modern and futuristic.

661
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,260
Soon it'll be implanted in my head.

662
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,080
Oh, I can do it from here.

663
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,560
Oh, I know.

664
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,140
If I can wake it up.

665
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,620
Let's see.

666
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,260
It reads my thumbprint, you see.

667
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:21,720
Wow.

668
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:22,940
What?

669
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,200
Oh.

670
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,960
Oh, she's admiring my...

671
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,360
My...

672
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,520
My muscles and my physique.

673
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,140
Move your...

674
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,100
Hey, your hand is blocking her face.

675
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:30,940
Oh, that's good.

676
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,600
What, this is?

677
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:31,900
Yeah.

678
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,460
I can't see.

679
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,500
Oh.

680
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,640
There we go.

681
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,860
I have to do 10 of them.

682
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:36,920
He's got some muscles.

683
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,000
One of them come out hard.

684
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,820
Yeah, extend your arms.

685
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,380
There we go.

686
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:39,800
That's better.

687
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,540
There we go.

688
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,040
Okay, for those of you on the radio right now, I'm getting a massage from Susie.

689
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,520
Susie the...

690
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:49,860
Susie.

691
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,120
I just asked for a massage.

692
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,360
She's just doing it.

693
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,700
Kind of a Japanese massage.

694
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,260
She happens to like my physique, which I find...

695
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,400
Amazing.

696
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,760
Oh, this is good.

697
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,400
Well, you're a rock star, Reverend Angry Larry.

698
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:00,800
Relax.

699
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,020
All that tension.

700
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,860
And a guitar player.

701
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,400
He's an oval man.

702
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,320
Only sax players get more conny than guitar players.

703
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,100
Where did you read that?

704
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,480
Frank Zappa said that.

705
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,360
Because it poked...

706
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,780
You know, with a sax player, he's got a big old horn poking out from his lap.

707
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,580
A guitar player has a big pole at lap level.

708
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,240
For his keyboard, it's a high level.

709
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,240


710
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,240


711
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,240


712
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,240


713
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,240


714
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,240


715
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,760
He's hiding behind a little table.

716
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,440
Yeah.

717
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,020
You know how to get a saxophone player off your porch?

718
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,500
How?

719
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,160
Pay him for the pizza.

720
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,760
That's a bass player joke, but we could use it for a saxophone player or a keyboardist.

721
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,280
Trombonist.

722
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,040
Because that's the other thing.

723
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,260
Trombonist.

724
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,680
Banjo players.

725
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,160
Reverend Samantha is full of banjo player jokes.

726
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,260
Oh, yeah.

727
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:50,580
Of course.

728
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,780
There's that Gary Larson comic that showed...

729
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,220
Oh, yeah.

730
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,220


731
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,220


732
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,140
The people walking into heaven.

733
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,100
It says, here's your harp.

734
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,780
Welcome to heaven.

735
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,460
And they're down in hell.

736
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,600
It says, welcome to hell.

737
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,620
Here's your accordion.

738
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,280
I love that.

739
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,280
I bet Brother Cleve knows that one.

740
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,400
He's a squeeze box player.

741
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,540
I used to play accordion until I pleated my tits.

742
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:15,740
Oh.

743
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,780
Is that another word that's going to get beeped out?

744
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,280
Can you say tits on the radio?

745
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,560
No.

746
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,200
You can say titty, but you can't say tits.

747
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,100
I was informed of that just last week.

748
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,180
Oh, I see.

749
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:25,180


750
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:25,200
I was informed of that.

751
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,200


752
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,200


753
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,200


754
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,200


755
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,200


756
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,780
I pleated my boobs.

757
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,100
Yeah, there you go.

758
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,800
Who decides all this?

759
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,360
Yeah, boobs is a safe word.

760
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,420
It goes...

761
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,240
Where's the line that they do on radio now about, you know...

762
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,700
It's very vague these days, station by station.

763
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,820
Headmoms, llamas, tatas.

764
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,820
Melons.

765
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,820
Bazongas.

766
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,100
Bazookas.

767
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,140
Bazookas.

768
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,660
Headlights.

769
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,440
Dirty pillows.

770
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,620
Yeah.

771
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,200
Dirty pillows.

772
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,220
Ear warmers.

773
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,840
Yeah.

774
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,020
As we know right now.

775
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,400
Yeah.

776
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,900
Boulder holders, in which case your bra.

777
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,160
Yeah, those are all okay, but you can't say tits.

778
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,600
But you can say titties, because it sounds maybe more juvenile.

779
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,700
Yeah, it's cute.

780
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,660
Like poo.

781
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,140
You poo.

782
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:05,440
Oh my God.

783
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,220
Stereo.

784
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,200
You can say poo and...

785
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,060
Stereo boobs.

786
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,620
Wow, something happened where I lost my right side in my speaker.

787
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,040
Not like it matters.

788
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,440
There.

789
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,000
Oh, there we go.

790
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,080
I didn't do nothing.

791
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,640
I didn't do nothing.

792
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,840
It was a double negative, which means you did something.

793
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,180
Welcome to Tarzan's Radio Station.

794
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,180


795
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,940
That's the way things are done here.

796
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,300
Is Tarzan going to show up today?

797
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,100
Tarzan, I don't know if Lord Greystoke is...

798
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,740
Okay.

799
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,700
I mean, theoretically he's still alive, but...

800
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,060
He is alive.

801
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,340
But I just call it Tarzan's Radio Station because...

802
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,020
Why not?

803
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,200
It looks like something Tarzan would have in his tree house in those old Johnny Weissmuller

804
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,080
movies.

805
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,480
Yeah.

806
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,760
Well, the old one where he had a microphone dangling from a string.

807
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,800
We can't hear you, Susie.

808
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,760
The old one where he had a microphone dangling from a string.

809
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,380
I get my boobs right in his face.

810
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,300
That's so hilarious.

811
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,400
Oh, well, we'd have to deal with that.

812
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:09,900
Yeah.

813
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,200
He'll live.

814
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:19,300
Yeah, Tarzan's Radio Station is made of mostly borrowed equipment, and I think I did actually

815
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,140
buy this Radio Shack mixer.

816
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,180
Radio Shack.

817
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,220
And the M3.

818
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:23,260
And the M3.

819
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,260


820
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,260


821
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,260


822
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,260


823
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,260


824
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,260


825
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,260


826
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,340
And the M3.

827
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:23,540
I like it.

828
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:23,620
That was so weird.

829
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,640
The M3.

830
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,880
That wasn't supposed to be here, but you should remember...

831
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,420
Yeah, the M3.

832
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:36,420


833
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,600
...when I bought a pen.

834
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:37,600


835
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:37,720
engines should live.

836
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:37,920
Oh, yeah.

837
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:37,920


838
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:37,920


839
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,100
Well, let's take a look at ourPLK.

840
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,440
M1.

841
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,780
So, maybe it's not that aike.

842
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,280
Let's see what we found...

843
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,280
Okay.

844
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,520
So, but if we pick this one...

845
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,320
Oh, no, no.

846
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,320


847
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,400
We'll open the one on the machine.

848
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:49,760
We'll take a closer look at the machine.

849
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,120
Okay.

850
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,700
So, here's a DJ video we found.

851
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,420
That looks like something of a Disney prophecy.

852
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,720
You can build a theremin with the kits that you can buy there.

853
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,860
No, they don't do that anymore.

854
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,520
No, that was a bad business model.

855
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,440
It wasn't working anymore.

856
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:05,900
Let's get a young guy in here, the same guy that was a consultant for Borders before they went completely.

857
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,740
That's exactly right.

858
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,420
Let's get that hip young consultant from San Francisco.

859
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,020
He says he knows how to make a website.

860
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,900
Make it all about phones and pads and devices.

861
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,240
Well, we predicted that everybody would spend the next day looking at their phone.

862
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,360
I couldn't get the internet to work, so I didn't bother.

863
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,660
I don't use my phone necessarily.

864
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,280
I use it now as a watch and as a notebook.

865
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,340
I noticed that.

866
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,680
I use it as a notebook.

867
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,400
That's what I do.

868
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,060
If I have an idea, I just put it in there.

869
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,840
See, I can't use my phone for that.

870
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,060
I still write things down on little pieces of paper.

871
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:40,980
I don't have pieces of paper.

872
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,760
It just doesn't.

873
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,800
If you have the paper, you don't need batteries.

874
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
It's not going to run out.

875
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,760
I've got phone numbers and addresses on paper.

876
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,780
Oh, no, I still do that.

877
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,820
Every time, Princess, we...

878
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,260
She washes her phone.

879
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,280
I end up...

880
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,460
She's real glad I have that printout.

881
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,040
Oh.

882
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,400
Oh, literally, in the literal sense.

883
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,180
It's printed out.

884
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:02,780
Yeah.

885
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,880
Every time she washes it.

886
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,320
Every time it goes through the wash in some pair of pants or something.

887
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,780
Well, I guess I could feel so...

888
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,580
I just feel lucky that Reverend Lucy generally washes her pants with...

889
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,640
And there's money in it.

890
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,900
So when I throw the stuff in the dryer, take it out of the dryer,

891
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,200
there's always money falls out.

892
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,520
And it's still...

893
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,200
No, it's not coins.

894
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,120
It's always bills.

895
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,220
But they hold together because of the high-quality paper used by your government.

896
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,960
And so that buys my lunch that day with the money I found in her pants pocket.

897
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,800
She'll never know.

898
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
That she'll never know.

899
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,860
Put another one over on her.

900
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,660
Oh, great.

901
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,960
She's going to be listening to this show.

902
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,480
I just realized that myself.

903
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,720
Princess Wee's not going to like that about the repeated washing of phones.

904
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,920
Well, there's this thing called editing.

905
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,440
Just cough.

906
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,700
And she's listening.

907
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,260
Editing.

908
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,120
Oh, that's a great trick.

909
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,040
Bob Clampett, you know who he was.

910
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,200
The animator.

911
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,500
He told me that he would sit next to the censor

912
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,040
when they were screening those cartoons at Warner Brothers

913
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,660
and he knew something that he'd put in was come up

914
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,320
and he would lean forward and know the exact second and say,

915
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,340
do you have a cigarette?

916
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,420
By the time that's done, you know,

917
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,820
the offending piece of...

918
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,560
The animation has flashed past.

919
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,160
God, back in those days,

920
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,340
you were expected to sit and smoke a cigarette in the screening room.

921
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:28,800
Yep.

922
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,520
That was normal.

923
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,420
On the airplane.

924
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,060
Yeah.

925
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,100
In the supermarket, at the hospital.

926
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,480
Into your kids' faces.

927
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,540
The sailor next to you on the bus for thousands of miles.

928
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,960
Did people smoke in church?

929
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,140
Oh, they used to have ashtrays in the back of the pews.

930
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,020
Wow.

931
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,680
Yeah.

932
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,860
Yeah, they gave you cigars or cigarettes.

933
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,440
You had your choice when you went into church.

934
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:49,960
Wow.

935
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,980
That was the reason.

936
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,760
That was the reason so many people worshipped back then.

937
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,100
It was just for the smoking.

938
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,800
Just so they could go someplace to get free smokes.

939
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,440
Yeah.

940
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,080
Oh, hey, let's go to church, man.

941
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,080
Why?

942
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,780
To burn a fag.

943
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,780
Yeah, you get...

944
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,240
Wow.

945
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:07,940
Ay-yi-yi.

946
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,260
Ba-dum-bum.

947
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,940
Well, I've ground things to a halt.

948
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,180
That's also a...

949
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:15,940
Thank you.

950
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:20,100
Not fair for contemporary airplay or something.

951
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,960
He can't.

952
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:20,960


953
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:20,960


954
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,680
You can't take me anywhere.

955
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,800
You'd have to have a long explanation for the historical validity of that expression.

956
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,740
I pulled the music out so that we can hear Susie.

957
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,400
Uh-oh.

958
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,860
I'm smelling Susie right now, and she smells amazing.

959
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,860
She smells like a...

960
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,560
It's like eau de toilette.

961
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,760
It's eau de toilette.

962
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,680
She smells like a cherry pie.

963
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,240
Yeah.

964
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,180
We're talking about...

965
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,080
Pie.

966
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,720
By now, it's a tail-like pie.

967
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,360
There's a lot of flirty polecat smell goes around once in a while.

968
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,080
Really?

969
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,040
Oh, yeah.

970
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,960
I guess you just have to be...

971
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,360
Be in the right place at the right time.

972
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,960
Es sonce de l'eau, Todd.

973
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,520
I don't speak Spanish.

974
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,700
What is that?

975
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,620
Ah, yes.

976
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,220
X-Day.

977
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,780
Beautiful X-Day.

978
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,780
Think the sun might come out?

979
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,520
Maybe.

980
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,140
Someday.

981
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,400
Okay.

982
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,580
According to my rain-detecting phone, it's going to let loose with another gully washer

983
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,340
pretty soon.

984
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,860
Will it do that while we're waiting?

985
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,040
Are you waiting for the landing tomorrow?

986
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,400
It might.

987
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,360
Oh, my goodness.

988
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,360
It might be raining.

989
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,800
Maybe that's what it will take.

990
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,660
A real gully washer.

991
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,000
We've never been standing out there in the rain, have we?

992
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,020
No, we haven't.

993
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,700
Beseeching the aliens to descend.

994
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,400
No, we've been lucky in that respect.

995
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,940
We've been very, very unlucky in the other respect.

996
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,860
Fling off your clothes.

997
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,300
If the alien's actually showing up.

998
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,600
Turn your face up to the rain and believe.

999
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,960
Well, let's see.

1000
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,000
Let's see if 7 a.m. is on this.

1001
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,180
Oh, it looks like it is.

1002
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,580
Now, of course, this weather tune prediction.

1003
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,720
Oh, okay.

1004
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,860
Here we go.

1005
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,460
6 a.m.

1006
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,540
Thunderstorms, 50%.

1007
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,380
Sunrise at 6 a.m.

1008
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,840
7 a.m.

1009
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,340
7,000 degrees and God's thunderbolts.

1010
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,760
Oh, yes.

1011
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:13,900
Oh, no.

1012
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,040
That's 70% chance of rain and thunderstorms.

1013
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,060
Oh, now.

1014
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,260
That's the prediction for 7 a.m. tomorrow.

1015
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:20,880
70%.

1016
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,940
70% chance of rain.

1017
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,760
So, we're having a 7 a.m. wet t-shirt contest.

1018
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,480
Yes, look at it that way.

1019
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,520
With risk of electrocution.

1020
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,580
Right.

1021
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,980
We could all stand around naked, but then that would almost certainly ensure failure.

1022
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,340
Yeah.

1023
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,160
Obviously, I won't be flying my...

1024
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,680
Maybe that's what it needs.

1025
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,160
I was going to say, maybe that is what Bob is looking for.

1026
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,940
There's not enough nakedness.

1027
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:48,740
No.

1028
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,600
Really?

1029
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,060
Yeah.

1030
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,040
Yeah.

1031
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,500
That's fine for some of the subgeniuses, but then there's us.

1032
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,580
Most of them have left.

1033
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,000
Right.

1034
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,260
Yeah.

1035
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,040
Then there's us.

1036
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,240
Oh, well.

1037
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,180
I wonder what my right arm...

1038
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,640
Through falling sheets of blinding rain, one might glimpse another body.

1039
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,460
Obviously, I won't be flying my drone at 7 a.m.

1040
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,900
I'd really look forward to doing that.

1041
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,740
Can you fly it in here, Stan?

1042
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,280
Not in here.

1043
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,280
I was just thinking, though, this would be the last day that we could fake it.

1044
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:20,940
The other one flies.

1045
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,640
I'd fly over to the stone circle, stand around looking up, and I could fly the thing up,

1046
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,820
except that it's about to damn rain again, I think.

1047
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,620
Do a fake 7 a.m.?

1048
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:30,960
Yeah.

1049
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,820
Just for the documentary purpose.

1050
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,560
Wow.

1051
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,040
Like the one every year.

1052
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,220
Yeah.

1053
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,460
No, let's have not too much of that.

1054
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Now, listen.

1055
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,240
Truth teller.

1056
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,040
Oh, yeah.

1057
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,620
Look at this.

1058
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,340
Here's the weather tune.

1059
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,740
Oh, wow.

1060
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,200
Yeah.

1061
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,120
Huge clouds of green oobleck are moving over.

1062
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,120
And where are the little blue dot in the center?

1063
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:58,780
Oh, yeah.

1064
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,820
Yeah, so there's...

1065
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,340
And what's that red stuff?

1066
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,560
The red is where it's really raining hard.

1067
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,420
It looks like a brain.

1068
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,760
It does indeed.

1069
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,840
Looks like a human brain.

1070
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,240
The weirdest weather I've ever seen.

1071
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
Uh-huh.

1072
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,060
Yeah, we're looking at my radar app.

1073
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,320
Cerebellum.

1074
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,700
Yeah, that's...

1075
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,500
Yeah, there it is.

1076
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:20,940


1077
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,940
Uh-huh.

1078
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,460
And it's green.

1079
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,560
So it's a brain-shaped cloud approaching.

1080
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,240
A green.

1081
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,420
The brain from planet Eros or planet X.

1082
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,380
Yeah, well, yeah.

1083
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,660
That is definitely brainular.

1084
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,300
Now, listen what happens when I bring the phone near the mic.

1085
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,500
Oh, it didn't do it this time.

1086
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,580
What was it doing?

1087
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,520
It kind of happened when you were out here.

1088
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,500
There was some kind of static that suddenly I could hear, but I don't hear it now.

1089
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,020
Oh, well.

1090
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,460
Okay, well...

1091
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,520
Like when it's trying to do something, that's what happens.

1092
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,840
Yeah, the phone is trying to escape.

1093
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,280
Yeah.

1094
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,560
I'm going to say fi on Wi-Fi.

1095
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:01,300
UAV forecast for my unarmed flying air vehicle.

1096
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,580
Well, you're a droneist.

1097
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:09,060
Not good to fly because precipitation probability is 28%, it says here.

1098
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,900
When does this Bobcast end?

1099
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:16,640
You could get it right out and fly it between episodes of rain.

1100
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,900
Nature's tantrums.

1101
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,340
Yeah.

1102
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,360
Well, we could end this.

1103
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,800
We could end this and try to fly that thing.

1104
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,720
Can we all fit on it?

1105
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,780
It's big, but not that big.

1106
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:25,900
It's pretty big, yeah.

1107
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,800
Is it a big drone?

1108
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,260
It's bigger than Wilman's, which is...

1109
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:34,100
It is a very expensive drone with a gimbal camera on it.

1110
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,140
It's like a steadicam.

1111
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,700
Somebody gave it to me.

1112
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,160
Whoa.

1113
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,680
Thanks, Reverend Zyfod.

1114
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:45,880
And it's nerve-wracking to fly it because it's worth a thousand bucks.

1115
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,540
It's not a toy.

1116
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,120
I was kind of envious of Dr. Cosmax.

1117
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:55,560
He's a little tiny drone, which zips all over the place real fast and crash into your face

1118
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,660
and won't cut your nose off.

1119
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,920
This thing I've got would bite your face off.

1120
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,960
Oh, my gosh.

1121
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,520
The pressure is off.

1122
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,620
The pressure is finally off as Pastor Pressure and Joyce head out.

1123
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,800
Do you realize that Joyce is the only woman here who has ever been under pressure?

1124
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,240
Oh, my God.

1125
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,180
She just said that Joyce is the only woman who's been under pressure.

1126
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,340
I don't get it.

1127
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:20,460
I don't get it.

1128
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,540
His name is Pastor Pressure.

1129
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:24,760
Okay.

1130
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,300
Yeah.

1131
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,020
That's...

1132
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,320
Boy, your record's even worse than mine, then.

1133
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,820
Real stud, I can tell you.

1134
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,560
Real skirt chaser, huh?

1135
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:35,740
Yeah.

1136
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,100
Yeah, I know.

1137
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,680
Don't take this the wrong way, but I really love your pickles.

1138
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:42,720
Yes.

1139
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,960
Thank you for the food.

1140
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,700
This has been such an edible X-Day.

1141
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,080
It has been.

1142
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:48,940
Wow.

1143
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,720
Thank you.

1144
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,400
He says that he has also been admiring my pickles.

1145
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,740
Thanks to the pressures, the nostrils, and the heathens.

1146
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,200
Yeah.

1147
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,700
That's a strange sentence.

1148
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,680
We ate well thanks to pressures, nostrils, and heathens.

1149
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,400
Yes.

1150
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,120
Well, one heathen, but two nostrils.

1151
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,520
Christ Bob.

1152
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,320
We'll see you on the saucers tomorrow.

1153
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,700
Good travels.

1154
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,000
And there they go.

1155
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,940
We'll see them tomorrow.

1156
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,120
Yes, we'll see them aboard.

1157
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,840
Well, because we're going to belly up to the bar at some point.

1158
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,140
The cosmic bar.

1159
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:35,300
After we finish fooling around, destroying cities, and saving national parks.

1160
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:35,660
Yeah.

1161
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,360
Then we'll all get together again.

1162
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,540
Go, man, that was fun.

1163
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,200
What next?

1164
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,920
I'm going to take everything you have now.

1165
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,020
I'm taking over.

1166
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,240
Everybody becomes power-mad mega geniuses.

1167
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,320
Go out and live on your own.

1168
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:50,720
Uranus.

1169
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,840
That's so cold.

1170
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,260
Not comfortable up there.

1171
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,060
Susie lost Uranus off of her headdress.

1172
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,000
Was it ever found?

1173
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,760
Yes, it was.

1174
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,960
Somebody found it rolling.

1175
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,600
They found Uranus rolling down the road.

1176
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,580
They were rolling around, picking up crap.

1177
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,520
It's another one of those sentences that you never think you'd ever hear.

1178
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,460
I saw Uranus rolling down the street.

1179
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,440
We picked it up and put it back on your head.

1180
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,040
Perfect.

1181
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,080
When you're a...

1182
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:27,220
Among subgeniuses, you hear the strangest sentences that are being said for purely practical reasons.

1183
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,820
Oh, that someone understands what you're talking about.

1184
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,020
One time at Hal's place, I remember the sentence,

1185
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:39,420
Be careful not to knock over the robots with that Tyrannosaurus skull.

1186
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,080
And it was just said in complete practicality.

1187
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,560
And to some people, they would go, what?

1188
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:45,940
What?

1189
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,380
But yeah, we know.

1190
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:47,840
Yeah.

1191
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,860
Well, we have to...

1192
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,420
Our stuff is kind of crowded together.

1193
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,920
You have to walk sideways sometimes through aisles between it.

1194
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,960
And this was a life-sized replica Tyrannosaurus skull.

1195
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,960
As large as that specimen ever got.

1196
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,980
But perhaps they got larger than that.

1197
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:14,800
Well, maybe we should knock this off and try the droney thing and just see.

1198
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,200
Well, you can fly the drone and I can narrate if you leave it hooked up.

1199
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:19,520
Sure.

1200
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:19,780
Okay.

1201
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,000
And Susie can sit down.

1202
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,120
If you're using the drone, I'd better put on something that shows off some cleavage.

1203
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,660
Oh, it'll be way up high.

1204
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,000
It won't be close enough to turn anybody on.

1205
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:35,420
But take a seat and a microphone and a headphone and a Dramamine.

1206
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,720
Okay.

1207
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,300
My machine's over in the car.

1208
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,300
How many times have I fallen for that one?

1209
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,400
Well, you know.

1210
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,760
Susie's in the driver's seat now.

1211
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:48,460
Yeah.

1212
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,680
That's right.

1213
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:49,900
This is...

1214
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,960
Hey, do you want to rename the show, Susie?

1215
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:52,440
No.

1216
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,000
Okay.

1217
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,520
You sure you don't want to...

1218
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,980
We'll call it the Howlin' Larry Show.

1219
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,860
The Howling Larry Show.

1220
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,100
It could actually be, you know, the Howlin' Larry Show.

1221
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,800
Yes, here we are.

1222
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,420
Yeah.

1223
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,920
Subgenius World.

1224
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,040
The sun has never been out today.

1225
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:13,740
No.

1226
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:19,460
Curtained in cloudy red, he pillows his chin upon the orient wave.

1227
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,120
But we wait for the possibility of a break in the clouds.

1228
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,120
There's the infant driving the truck again.

1229
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:31,480
Yes, that infant at the wheel is back with his giant truck.

1230
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:36,980
He's got those evil baby eyebrows and those eyes that see too much.

1231
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,040
I saw that someone brought a brain.

1232
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,620
Now he's...

1233
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,220
Look at him.

1234
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:41,700
Yeah.

1235
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,460
Look at him.

1236
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,320
Oh, yeah.

1237
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,640
He's a master of that truck.

1238
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,660
He's interrogating peas.

1239
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,140
He is.

1240
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:49,220
He is.

1241
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:49,660
He is.

1242
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:49,660


1243
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:49,660


1244
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:49,660


1245
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:49,660


1246
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:49,660


1247
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:49,660


1248
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:49,880
He should.

1249
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:50,880
Your papers.

1250
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,520
Show me your papers.

1251
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,940
Of course, the authorities have made it illegal to ride in the back of a pickup truck.

1252
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,080
There he goes.

1253
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:05,080
Here at the Subgenius Scofflaw Camp, these rules are simply tittered at.

1254
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,040
Nine months old and they gave him a license.

1255
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,320
Ohio is weird.

1256
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,580
Rural America is like that.

1257
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,520
Yes, it's not how old you are, it's who you are.

1258
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,000
I bet he drives a Thresher, too.

1259
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,180
Uh-huh.

1260
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,240
And hasn't killed anyone yet.

1261
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:22,980
Well...

1262
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,280
The International Harvester, not the Grim Reaper.

1263
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,340
They allow babies a certain body count.

1264
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,240
Mm-hmm.

1265
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,120
That's true.

1266
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:31,540
I mean, yeah.

1267
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,480
That's because they're so gosh darn cute.

1268
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,400
Yep.

1269
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,440
Yep.

1270
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,920
Oh, and there's Reverend Teeters LaVert.

1271
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,640
Yes, the stragglers straggling in...

1272
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:46,880
Yeah.

1273
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Because Caffeinus is still...

1274
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,780
The nucleus, for what it's worth, of this hub of Subgenius activity.

1275
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,320
X-Day still hasn't happened yet.

1276
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:07,300
Yes, there is a pause, a silence, an eerie stillness before the dynamic pulsation of the X-Day moment itself.

1277
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,040
Well, it's the calm before the storm.

1278
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,380
But this morning it was a track event.

1279
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,880
People were just pouring out of here.

1280
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,160
What do they know that we don't?

1281
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,060
They were running out of here?

1282
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,000
Yes.

1283
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,500
Maybe they'd concluded...

1284
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,280
They concluded their pancakes and decided not to stick around.

1285
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,380
There was a large pancake-related event.

1286
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:31,740
I could hear nothing about anything except the pancakes we were missing.

1287
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,360
It could have been a Scrapple-related medical crisis.

1288
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,200
There's Stang's giant drone.

1289
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,040
Ladies and gentlemen...

1290
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,160
Oh, that's the controller.

1291
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,860
It's raining.

1292
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:42,980
The batteries are discharged.

1293
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,220
Our ship behind us...

1294
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:45,620
Uh-oh.

1295
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,660
Does it need ultra-special batteries?

1296
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,220
Does anyone here know how to fix an AccuJack?

1297
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,940
Maybe he's going to get some expert scientific assistance.

1298
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,180
There's good technical help here at X-Day.

1299
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:08,180
Yes, the boffins can certainly fix up these ding-futzers and whatchamacallits.

1300
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:12,480
Whatever these gizmos are, you gotta hand it to them.

1301
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,180
I like that word, ding-futzers.

1302
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,520
Well, you know, I'm talking about some kind of Weisenheimer device.

1303
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,200
Something with a canoeter valve.

1304
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,100
Yes.

1305
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:29,360
And so, there it shall be instantly repaired when one gives it up for lost.

1306
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:37,060
But we can't narrate the launching of the Stangian drone because it's delayed.

1307
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,720
I've gone deaf. The music has stopped.

1308
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,600
Can you restart, Susie?

1309
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,120
Oh, there it is.

1310
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:41,500
Oh, here's something.

1311
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,000
Just act like it's back at your own radio station.

1312
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:45,840
Yeah, I know what's going on.

1313
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,040
I do everything at home. It's all overproduced.

1314
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,760
You can do it now while Stang is distracted.

1315
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,260
And when is he not?

1316
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,620
Just manipulate the toggles and easily turn the controls.

1317
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,500
Where's his porno music?

1318
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,320
This would be much more lively with Waka Tiki.

1319
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,580
Is there a bag of, box of tapes to your right?

1320
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,800
Oh, the music is getting a little more lively now that you mention that.

1321
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,680
I still don't see porn to it.

1322
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,660
It still ain't 1970s porno music.

1323
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,160
It's a little too stridently for screwing.

1324
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:18,620
No, this is...

1325
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,180
There's no...

1326
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:19,280
There's no...

1327
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,460
There's no...

1328
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:19,460


1329
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,580
I don't picture Harry Reams in any kind of film with this play.

1330
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,740
Well, that's nice, though.

1331
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,140
I'm happy about that.

1332
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,080
This is like silly capering with nipples music.

1333
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:29,960
Yeah.

1334
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,060
So what?

1335
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,680
Middle Earth porn?

1336
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,300
Uh-uh.

1337
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,820
I thought earthy porn was a lot different.

1338
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,560
You know, I can barely hear this music.

1339
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,200
I hope the mix is...

1340
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,740
Oh, it's very loud in my ears.

1341
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,600
Oh, that's it.

1342
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,300
It's because you're so close to the radio.

1343
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,480
Once again, I got...

1344
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,660
I got the bum headphones.

1345
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,200
Why are you...

1346
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,960
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

1347
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:58,500
As long as you can assure me that we're hearing the sounds of joy.

1348
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,620
Can you hear yourself?

1349
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,760
Yeah, I can hear myself.

1350
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,320
Can you hear me?

1351
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,600
Yep, hear you too.

1352
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,080
That could just be the...

1353
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,600
I hear the music.

1354
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,480
It is just so soft and slight.

1355
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:16,300
I was expressing concern that it might not be potted up correctly.

1356
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,320
But then what do I know?

1357
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,160
Oh, rough.

1358
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,720
I'm a horny-handed son of the soil,

1359
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:27,720
not an ingenious artificer of tiny electronical doodads.

1360
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,580
But I love your horny hands.

1361
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,480
Yes, turned into grotesque clothes.

1362
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:35,700
Rookers.

1363
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,500
Bowed by the weight of centuries.

1364
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,980
You're clawed rookers.

1365
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,840
Leaning upon my hole, I gaze upon the ground.

1366
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,480
The emptiness of ages in my face.

1367
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,160
And on my back, the burden of the world.

1368
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,380
Time to stop.

1369
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,520
For a delicious lemonade.

1370
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,040
That's not lemonade.

1371
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,600
Lemonade the negative.

1372
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,480
Please don't take from me the one pleasure that remains.

1373
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,540
I call it lemonade.

1374
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,860
I call it getting laminated.

1375
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,680
Back to work in 110 degree heat.

1376
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,880
And then a spell of digging post holes in the hot sun.

1377
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:17,980
But that's not anything like as hard as operating this radio bobcast.

1378
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:18,360
Bobcast.

1379
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:18,420
No.

1380
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,380
On behalf of the church.

1381
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,200
The church of the subgenius.

1382
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,300
The post holes are done later, right?

1383
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,820
Well, uh, you, yeah.

1384
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:30,200
They're done after the plowing and the other things that need to be done.

1385
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:30,980
We'll fix it in post.

1386
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,620
Gotta milk the cows and chickens.

1387
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,560
So all of that must be done.

1388
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,320
Yes, you rise.

1389
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,140
Those horses over there are gonna milk themselves.

1390
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,400
No, they're not.

1391
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:48,360
And, of course, the cottage cheese must be reinforced before it goes entirely bad.

1392
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,000
Oh.

1393
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,680
I gotta get out there and milk them bulls.

1394
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,040
Yep.

1395
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,640
Get that cottage cheese going.

1396
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:58,660
Over in the woods, the loathly hag needs some repair on her candy cottage

1397
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,500
because she's not getting as many children as she used to

1398
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,360
and she's certainly even older now than she was when she first set up there.

1399
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,460
See, now that you can blame the internet for.

1400
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,200
Yes.

1401
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:15,840
They don't care about candy anymore, not when they can play Candy Crush online.

1402
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:16,600
Yeah.

1403
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,260
Mm-hmm.

1404
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,320
Mm-hmm.

1405
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:18,320


1406
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:18,640
Mm-hmm.

1407
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:18,960
Mm-hmm.

1408
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:18,980


1409
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:19,040


1410
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:19,340
Mm-hmm.

1411
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:19,340


1412
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:19,360
Mm-hmm.

1413
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,360


1414
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,360


1415
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,360


1416
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,360


1417
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,360


1418
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,360


1419
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,360


1420
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,360
Mm-hmm.

1421
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,560
Mm-hmm.

1422
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:23,560


1423
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:23,560


1424
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:23,560


1425
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:23,560


1426
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:23,560


1427
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:28,880
Or some little old man with a twinkle in his eye might give you three magic beans,

1428
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,840
so you better call the cops and have him hauled away.

1429
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:37,740
So all the witches are driving white Ford Econoline vans with free candy spray painted on the sides?

1430
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,160
Yes, with a clown painted on the side, too, just for good measure.

1431
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:48,840
They're trying to keep up, but they can't keep up with the corporate clowning of major companies.

1432
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,160
Ah.

1433
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,220
There's the Stang drone.

1434
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,060
My God, it's huge.

1435
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,700
Did you manage to repower it?

1436
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,240
Is it repowered, Stang?

1437
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,660
This is 747.

1438
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,280
Oh, no.

1439
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,080
He's making the sound of what it should sound like when it is powered up.

1440
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,900
Could you get the batteries attached?

1441
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,120
Even if I had batteries, it's right in here.

1442
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,400
Yeah, I saw that.

1443
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,840
You wouldn't want to fly it inside Caffeinas.

1444
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,760
Wellman flies it inside buildings all the time.

1445
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,680
Inside KPFA.

1446
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,700
That could be bad.

1447
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,020
How much is this?

1448
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,500
Well, if Wellman jumped off the Empire State Building.

1449
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,100
Because this would chop your nose off.

1450
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:24,740
Oh, yes.

1451
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,600
Well, we don't want that.

1452
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,780
I've already had it wasp assault my face.

1453
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,840
We'll just put the Stangian drone on the table.

1454
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:38,140
And you can imagine the magnificence that might have been had the batteries not been discharged.

1455
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,440
Those things slice gills, India.

1456
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,880
But it doesn't take exotic batteries, does it?

1457
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,060
It looks like it takes ordinary.

1458
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,740
No, it takes very exotic batteries.

1459
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,080
Oh, all right.

1460
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:49,900
So much for that.

1461
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,800
It flies on adrenochrome.

1462
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,400
Well, it's large enough to register as an aircraft.

1463
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:03,140
I sent Reverend Obama $15 for the right.

1464
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,640
Well, that's good.

1465
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,680
Now you're legit.

1466
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,960
If you pay us on time, we'll give it on time.

1467
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:17,640
Well, I guess the baby truck is pulling out, heading back to Babyloin.

1468
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,020
It's Nebraska.

1469
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,100
Sit here on my lap.

1470
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,440
Yes, sir.

1471
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,680
Sit on your lap.

1472
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,460
Some lap.

1473
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,820
You need a lap dog.

1474
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,560
Now, to go back to, we're talking about kind of like the nursery rhyme type thing.

1475
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,680
I've thought about this before.

1476
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:32,980
Yes.

1477
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:40,300
With the nursery rhymes being so, you know, capturing children or just, yeah,

1478
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,680
finding the magic beans with some old crone or old man or whatever.

1479
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,340
Sissy.

1480
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:44,900
Yes.

1481
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,380
Would this change?

1482
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,900
Would this change the whole Mother Goose stories?

1483
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,160
Like, have they tried to make them more politically correct?

1484
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:02,120
Or would it make it, like, not, you know, not acceptable for kids to read anymore?

1485
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,040
The moment they mess with it, they destroy it.

1486
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,680
So it's not supposed to be politically correct.

1487
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,200
They never heard of that.

1488
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,200
They're trying to warn kids that there are monsters.

1489
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,840
And there are.

1490
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:21,180
Old bags who will suck the flesh off their bones.

1491
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,720
Throw them in an oven.

1492
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,280
Yeah.

1493
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:27,900
Well, it's usually old men that suck the flesh off their bones.

1494
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,060
There aren't that many famous old ladies.

1495
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,840
Toothless hags have to cook you first so they can, because they have so few teeth.

1496
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,440
It's mostly the old ginches that are the bone suckers.

1497
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,880
Oh, there's a lot of old cannibal.

1498
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,420
The witches and stuff.

1499
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,060
Takes one to know one.

1500
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:43,960
Takes one to know one.

1501
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,120
The witch's oven actually softens.

1502
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,140
The meat.

1503
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,780
But then they also boil the victims.

1504
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,980
They're all accounts of this.

1505
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,600
They like to gnaw finger bones.

1506
00:55:54,820 --> 00:56:01,740
They don't have many teeth in their old gums, so the meat must be reduced to a pliable consistence.

1507
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,980
And kids are tender.

1508
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,580
Kids are tender anyway.

1509
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,620
That helps them in their quest.

1510
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:13,440
As in the Ray Harryhausen version of Hansel and Gretel, which you must have seen.

1511
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,660
Yes, they actually do push the old lady in the oven.

1512
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:18,540
In that one.

1513
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,640
Do they actually eat her?

1514
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,060
No, they don't.

1515
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:29,720
But when they do, the malefic influence is destroyed and the candy cottage fades away,

1516
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,080
leaving just a damp, sugary spot on the forest floor.

1517
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,800
Well, I just wanted to clear that up.

1518
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,880
Thank you, Dr. Howell, for clearing it up.

1519
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,640
The animation in that short is superb, but then it would be.

1520
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,620
Well, of course.

1521
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,240
It's Ray Harryhausen.

1522
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:54,100
Yeah, well, he's learning his craft, but it's amazing how much was inherent in that.

1523
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,540
He does natural movements, which are very hard to do.

1524
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,220
Sometimes the most natural movements are the hardest to stage.

1525
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,620
Like a character casually walking backwards and looking natural.

1526
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:14,620
Or, I guess my favorite part in the whole cartoon is where they spill the jug of milk

1527
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,880
and it teeters on the edge of the table and falls.

1528
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,320
With milk spilling out of it and breaks and fragments in the floor.

1529
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,720
And the milk spreads, all animated in stop motion with cut-out wooden milk

1530
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,040
and separately supported fragments.

1531
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,100
Why didn't he just use a computer?

1532
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:39,840
Well, he had to be in his garage in the back of his mom and dad's house.

1533
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,120
Yeah, and the only computer they had was the size of, you know...

1534
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,280
This campground.

1535
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:44,660
Yes.

1536
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,640
And it took Niagara Falls to...

1537
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,620
It took a pool of thousands of vacuum tubes.

1538
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:56,360
Actually, the first computer was composed of a thousand women crunching numbers.

1539
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:56,740
Yeah.

1540
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,660
There's a movie about that I've been dying to see.

1541
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,620
I forget the title of it.

1542
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:09,520
But Alan Turing and those guys were trying to crack the German code.

1543
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,700
Yeah, it's the Imitation Game.

1544
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,780
Oh, that's it.

1545
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,700
Have you seen that?

1546
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,420
Oh, yes, I have.

1547
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,520
I saw it. Pretty good.

1548
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,160
It's very good.

1549
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:15,600
Yeah.

1550
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,380
It's horrible.

1551
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,620
I did to the man, but...

1552
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,400
But good recreation of...

1553
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,140
But yeah, it was done very well.

1554
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:27,160
And also just the administrative struggle of trying to demonstrate that it was viable.

1555
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:33,700
And then when they got it, they couldn't use it because if they automatically somehow knew what the Germans were doing,

1556
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:38,180
the Germans would be on to the fact that they could, so they had to let their own people be killed.

1557
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,560
Right.

1558
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,320
Yeah, that's pretty tricky stuff.

1559
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,240
War is hell, folks.

1560
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:43,460
So don't do it.

1561
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:46,420
But it'll be heaven tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock.

1562
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,000
July 5th, 1998.

1563
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,480
Yes, sir.

1564
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,200
Yes, yes.

1565
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,780
It shall happen.

1566
00:58:54,780 --> 00:59:01,720
We will overcome and splash our vengeance upon the earth.

1567
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,640
We shall come to my heart.

1568
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:13,660
