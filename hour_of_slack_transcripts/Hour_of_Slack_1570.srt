1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,740
The Soft Genius Power Calls.

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,440
What?

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,840
It's a joke, Dobbsy.

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,120
Aren't you going to let me in on it?

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,600
In on it?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Sure, I will.

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,380
Sure.

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,980
Ah!

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:36,920
Ah!

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,300
Isn't it great swimming in a sea of slack?

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,840
Let's just immerse ourselves in the luck plane's surfy, surfy waves and waft along.

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,540
Dr. Philo Drummond once said,

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,840
If slack was water, Bob would be surfing and you'd be drowning.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,980
Hey, I'm with you.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,700
I'm willing to settle for death by drowning in slack any day, Doctor.

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,760
Ah, this is the soundtrack to Mr. Lucky,

17
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,000
which is one of Bob's nine billion middle names.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,640
And you know, he's taught me that it's better to be lucky than good any day,

19
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,260
and what an example he sets.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,220
I rejoice in the failings of Bob.

21
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,240
I exult in the slip-ups of Bob.

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,800
Hey, Bob, show us how you make them.

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,600
Make a million dollars.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,780
Yes, make me a failure too, Bob.

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,140
Show me the witching ways of surfing the luck plane.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,620
Look, Bob, I can hang too.

27
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,500
Oh, and when Bob forgets to screw up.

28
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,360
Oh, when he screws up by not screwing up.

29
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,120
It's like breaking the bank at Monte Carlo.

30
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,380
It's such blinding, radiant luck that you can't believe it.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,760
You appreciate the good things in life,

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,480
if you don't waste your time counting on them to happen.

33
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,880
But if you expect the bad things,

34
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,120
every day can be like Christmas.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
Just forget yourself and go with a path of least resistance.

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,300
Sharpen your abnormality focus.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,020
You might do only one weird thing exceptionally well.

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,280
Well, take that weird thing and turn it around and milk it dry.

39
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,300
Milk it for Bobby.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,340
Tap it.

41
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,640
Strip mine it.

42
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,520
There's strip.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,960
Strip mining your slack away,

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,880
leaving toxic poisons to leach into your psychic water table.

45
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,740
Fight the conspiracy.

46
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,780
Give up for Bob.

47
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,840
On and off the road to Bob

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,960
We are marching forward blind

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,760
Me has gouged out both our eyes

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,680
And he's laughing close behind

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,260
He will sell us back our eyes

52
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,960
When we join his noble clan

53
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,520
For just $19.95

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,280
And a taste of our foot plan.

55
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,500
And a taste of our foot plan.

56
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:29,500


57
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,120
On and off the road with Bob

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,280
He has handed us the wheel

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,040
And he cuddles up with love

60
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,580
As he counts himself a field

61
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,500
Our eyes are on the line

62
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,500


63
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,500


64
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,500


65
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,500


66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,500


67
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,500


68
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,500


69
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,500


70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,500


71
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,640
And we're off the road

72
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,320
But Bob forgot to say

73
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:14,140
That the steering wheel went bust

74
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,480
The road carries us away

75
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,100
On and off the road for Bob

76
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:34,800
We forgot why we came here

77
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,660
We have quit all of our jobs

78
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,820
Like a headlight frightened deer

79
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,720
He has lit the sacred pipe

80
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,080
And he's smiling at us

81
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,080


82
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,740
Now

83
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,500
On and off the road

84
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,600
He's Bob

85
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,200
He's our bull god

86
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,380
We are his town

87
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,980
That hurt Bob.

88
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,260
Bob where are you?

89
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,340
Who are you?

90
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,160
A friend of Bob's.

91
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,780
Bob's fingerprints on my fingerprints on my ashtray

92
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,380
And not yours.

93
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,020
It had Bob's fingerprints all over it.

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,780
And he and I both would agree that Bob's not a nice person.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,100
That was enough for them.

96
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,780
It's funny because it's true.

97
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,680
And hey, admit the truth to yourself now.

98
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,060
You know you'll be clawing your way to the head of the line

99
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,320
To buy a membership when the atomic heat rays

100
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,920
Are so close they're welding your butt cheeks together.

101
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,720
Oh, but don't come crying to me.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,380
Oh, but don't come crying to me.

103
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,300
I can't wait for X-Day.

104
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,040
I love the taste of human flesh.

105
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:57,540
I love the taste of human flesh.

106
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,540
I just haven't had it cooked yet.

107
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,420
I just haven't had it cooked yet.

108
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,660
We get down and dirty in this church

109
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:04,940
We get down and dirty in this church

110
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,100
Because religion happens to be a dirty, dirty business.

111
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,660
This church is a lot like an old car sometimes

112
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:11,900
This church is a lot like an old car sometimes

113
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,640
In that it's the dirt that's the only thing

114
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:14,700
In that it's the dirt that's the only thing

115
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,020
That's holding it all together.

116
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,800
And Bob, Bob is the bondo

117
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,520
That keeps our sagging bumpers up.

118
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,260
That keeps our sagging bumpers up.

119
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,700
Isn't that the one thing

120
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,720
That we're here for after all?

121
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,260
The sneakers?

122
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,500
The dirt?

123
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,740
Oh, so let's dig in and dish it up.

124
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,380
Oh, so let's dig in and dish it up.

125
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,580
It's cram-packed with minerals, too.

126
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,000
It's cram-packed with minerals, too.

127
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,880
So don't settle for the poop du jour.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,600
Excremeditate your troubles away

129
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:44,700
Excremeditate your troubles away

130
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,440
with the armor-piercing slack

131
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,680
of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

132
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:49,680


133
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,920
I am mighty!

134
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,460
I am full of it!

135
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,980
But I'm going to let it go.

136
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,740
But I'm going to let it go.

137
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,220
And you've got to let it go, dear friend!

138
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,360
Just as sure as you can bet it,

139
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,620
one of those two greatest guys up there

140
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,900
is going to let go

141
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,460
just as you is letting go.

142
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,000
Bob,

143
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,020
what's Ms. Preskey's heap so far?

144
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,880
Right, Jack?

145
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,160
Ah!

146
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,340
Yes.

147
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,160
Well, how do you feel, Ms. Preskey?

148
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,000
Sick!

149
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,100
Oh, well, you can afford it now, love.

150
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,820
But like the good book says,

151
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,260
there are bigger deals to come.

152
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,700
Oh, Christ.

153
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,440
There is no hurry,

154
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:08,440


155
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:08,440


156
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,300
because still more money is expected to arrive

157
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,300


158
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,300


159
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,340
or deeper winterMy name is John etmek,

160
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:09,340


161
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:09,340


162
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,700
And I know

163
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,340
this is my way of saying

164
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,180
ARSем meglio than ever!

165
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm living

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,040
like a quiet,

167
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,460
accomplished lad.

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,260
I hope things work out the way you want them to.

169
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,940
Thanks, Bob.

170
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,600
I'm hoping too.

171
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,920
Oh, crap! It's on fire!

172
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,240
Thank you.

173
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,720
Thank you.

174
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,140
Thank you.

175
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,800
Thank you.

176
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,160
Thank you.

177
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,480
Thank you.

178
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,840
Thank you.

179
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,120
Thank you.

180
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,540
Thank you.

181
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:25,980
Thank you.

182
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,180
Thank you.

183
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,480
Thank you.

184
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,640
Thank you.

185
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,700
Yes, but not...

186
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,800
Temporary. A temporary respite from...

187
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,760
A false respite.

188
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,880
Not a lasting one.

189
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,720
Stopping points.

190
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,760
That's the unfortunate part.

191
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,900
External stopping points.

192
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,520
But then again...

193
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,720
Is there a quiz on this stuff?

194
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,160
That's right.

195
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,780
It's so serious.

196
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,840
The end of Mr. Deamer's fourth period class.

197
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,780
Mr. Dealer!

198
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,840
So next time...

199
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:22,760
He's been experimenting with a growth serum on hamsters and a large tarantula.

200
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,120
He's been in his laboratory all night long.

201
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,200
Yeah, well, he had this assistant and they had...

202
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,140
His beautiful assistant?

203
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,040
His beautiful assistant?

204
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,600
No, his assistant.

205
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,400
His beautiful assistant.

206
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,680
He is.

207
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,720
Hey, Mr. Deamer, they're talking about you on the show.

208
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,620
He accidentally injected some...

209
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,440
Something horrible.

210
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,980
Oh, yes, dear friends.

211
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:07,400
And we're listening to Reverend Jimmy Ryan in the background here with this instrumental.

212
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And I'm going to give you the credits for what we've been listening to.

213
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:16,040
This time I'm going to go from the beginning rather than from the backwards as I usually do.

214
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,400
The titles were by Lee Murr.

215
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,440
Then the rant by the beautiful woman about Bob and Slash.

216
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:32,200
That was Reverend Susie the Flusie from her show Bob's Slack Time Funhouse on beautiful WREK Atlanta.

217
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:40,280
She played Bleepo Abernathy's song On and Off the Road to Bob.

218
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,280
And she ranted some more.

219
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:50,620
And she played Mark Mothersbaugh's rendition of what we might call the Star Spangled Bobber.

220
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,740
That cover of the old super...

221
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:02,100
Mark Mothersbaugh's hits Under Pressure was, of course, the Rudy Schwartz Project doing that.

222
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:12,540
And we also heard some radio from Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Hal on the Puzzling Evidence show from KPFA Berkeley.

223
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:17,540
You can hear that show every week on the Internet for nothing.

224
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,540
As well as Reverend Susie the Flusie's show Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

225
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,200
Both of those like this show.

226
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,260
Are...

227
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,380
Available for download and streaming.

228
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:33,180
And you can find the information about that at subgenius.com.

229
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:45,700
But I'm going to stop that program now because I want to read to y'all for a while from something that turned out to be one of my favorite books.

230
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,180
I had never read it until a few months ago.

231
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,340
And that's Gulliver's Travels by John.

232
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,160
Jonathan Swift.

233
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,000
Ah, yes.

234
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:06,240
And for background music, we'll use Bernard Herrmann's score of the Harryhausen version of Gulliver's Travels,

235
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,780
which was one of the least bad movies made of the book.

236
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:20,780
The book has a lot of stuff in it that I didn't know about from reading Classics Illustrated or any of those other things.

237
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,100
You know, Gulliver in this novel...

238
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,540
First, he's in the land of little people.

239
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,160
Then he gets shipwrecked in the land of giants.

240
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,380
Then he's in a floating island land called Lapita.

241
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,700
And finally, he ends up in a land where horses are smart and people are dumb.

242
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,260
See, that sounds familiar.

243
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:54,420
Anyway, what I didn't know about in these books is how often problems with urination and excretion come up, as it were.

244
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:04,320
And at the beginning of the novel, which I believe was written in, what, 1702 or 1720 or something?

245
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,220
1726, yeah.

246
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:16,960
At the beginning, Gulliver's, of course, the famous scene where he wakes up on the beach tied down, surrounded by tiny little people.

247
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,000
He's been laying on this beach tied down for some hours.

248
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,200
And he starts to have a problem.

249
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,020
I shall read from the novel.

250
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,480
Soon after, I heard a general shout with frequent repetitions of the words,

251
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:43,800
And I felt great numbers of the people on my left side relaxing the cords that bound me to such a degree

252
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:50,520
that I was able to turn upon my right and to ease myself with making water,

253
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,320
which I very plentifully did to the great astonishment of the people.

254
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:04,120
Who, conjecturing by my motions what I was going to do, immediately opened to the right and left on that side to avoid the torrent,

255
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,920
which fell with such noise and violence from me.

256
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:14,060
But before this, they had daubed my face and both my hands with a sort of ointment very pleasant to the smell,

257
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,140
which in a few minutes removed all the smart of their arrows.

258
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,740
These circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their victuals and drink, which were very nourishing,

259
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,300
disposed me to sleep.

260
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,120
I slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured, and it was no wonder,

261
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:36,500
for the physicians had mingled a sleeping potion in the hogsheads of wine.

262
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,260
Further on in the book, actually only one page later, well, my name is mentioned.

263
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,580
The townsfolk of Lilliput put Giant Gulliver into, they give him a home.

264
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,860
They use some big temple or garage or something that he can lay down in.

265
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,920
And I was told,

266
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,740
I'm going to be a good husband.

267
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,280
And they eventually let him get up and do things.

268
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:06,020
The country round appeared like a continued garden, and the enclosed fields,

269
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,340
which were generally 40 foot square, resembled so many beds of flowers.

270
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:19,340
These fields were intermingled with woods of half a stang, and the tallest trees, as I could judge,

271
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,840
appeared to be seven foot high.

272
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,280
A stang, by the way, I learned, is a quarter of an acre.

273
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,420
How about that?

274
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,920
Wow, have a stang of woods.

275
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,440
Yeah.

276
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,360
I had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of nature,

277
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,400
which was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last disburthened myself.

278
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,600
I was under great difficulties between urgency and shame.

279
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,680
The best expedient I could think on was to creep into my house, which I accordingly did,

280
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,280
and shutting the gate after me, I went as far as the house.

281
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,380
I was so afraid that the length of my chain would suffer, and discharged my body of that uneasy load.

282
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,520
But this was the only time I was ever guilty of so uncleanly an action,

283
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,380
for which I cannot but hope the candid reader will give some allowance

284
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:17,600
after he hath maturely and impartially considered my case and the distress I was in.

285
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,920
From this time, my constant practice was, as soon as I rose,

286
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:28,060
to perform that business in open air, at the full extent of my chain,

287
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,460
and due care was taken every morning before company came,

288
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:38,380
that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheelbarrows by two servants appointed for that purpose.

289
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:44,360
I would not have dwelt so long upon a circumstance that perhaps at first sight may appear not very momentous,

290
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,720
if I had not thought it necessary to justify my character in point of cleanliness to the world,

291
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,900
which I am told some of you have.

292
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:57,820
But I have not yet, my maligners, have been pleased upon this and other occasion to call into question.

293
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,840
And here another section in Gulliver's Travels, still in Lilliput.

294
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,600
A fire breaks out in the palace.

295
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,120
Yes, the palace. The queen is in danger. Everyone might die.

296
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,140
So, let's see.

297
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,360
I found they had already applied ladders to the walls of the palace,

298
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,400
and were well provided with buckets, but the water was at some distance.

299
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,260
Now remember, these people are about two inches high.

300
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,760
Their town is like a dollhouse, a bunch of dollhouses.

301
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,840
These buckets were about the size of a large thimble,

302
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,720
and the poor people supplied me with them as fast as they could,

303
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,240
but the flame was so violent that they did little good.

304
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,080
I might easily have stifled it with my coat,

305
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,200
which I unfortunately left behind me for haste,

306
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,580
and came away only in my leathern jerkin.

307
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,060
The case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable,

308
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,480
and this magnificent palace would have infallibly been burnt down to the ground

309
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:06,040
if, by a presence of mind unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought of an expedient.

310
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,620
I had the evening before drank plentifully of a most delicious wine,

311
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:17,640
called Glimmigrim, the Blefuskudians call it Flunnic,

312
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,220
but ours is esteemed a better sort, which is very diuretic.

313
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,920
By the luckiest chance in the world, I had not discharged myself of any part of it.

314
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,300
The heat I had contracted by coming very near the flames,

315
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,880
and by my laboring to quench them, made the wine begin to operate by urine,

316
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,740
which I voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper places,

317
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,960
that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished,

318
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,020
and the rest of that noble pile,

319
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,320
which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from destruction.

320
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,640
It was now daylight. I returned to my home,

321
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,860
but he was in big trouble by that point, friends,

322
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,540
because the queen did not like what he had done.

323
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,540
Okay, now we should be hearing Lonesome Kalboe.

324
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,700
Great. Well, this is just my night, isn't it?

325
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,720
Did I just hang up on him? Hello? Hello? I guess I did.

326
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Princess Wee, would you do me a little favor?

327
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,520
Of course, I would.

328
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,220
And call Lonesome Kalboe Day.

329
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,200
Of course, I would.

330
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:31,540
And tell him that we love him.

331
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,960
Of course, I will.

332
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,560
Well, let's see what else we have here.

333
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,200
In Gulliver's Travels, when he goes to the land of the giant people...

334
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,080
Oh, let's see.

335
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,880
Bom, bom, bom.

336
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,280
I didn't even have a bom.

337
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,840
Why do I have these problems?

338
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,920
Oh, when Gulliver is in the land of the giants,

339
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,580
he's taken out for a walk by his guardian, Glumdolclitch,

340
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,900
who's a ten-year-old girl about eighty feet tall.

341
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,620
And Glumdolclitch, setting down my traveling box,

342
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,140
I went out of it to walk.

343
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,180
There was a cow dung in the land.

344
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,340
I walked down the path,

345
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,500
and I must needs try my activity by attempting to leap over it.

346
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,020
I took a run, but unfortunately jumped short

347
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,860
and found myself just in the middle, up to my knees.

348
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,700
I waded through with some difficulty,

349
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,500
and one of the footmen wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief,

350
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,220
for I was filthily bemired,

351
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,320
and my nurse confined me to my box till we returned home,

352
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,800
where the queen was soon informed

353
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,020
of what had passed.

354
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,440
And the footman spread it about the court

355
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,360
so that all the mirth for some days was at my expense.

356
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,820
Well, poor Gulliver.

357
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:07,680
In his travels, such problems and terror

358
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,660
having to do with just getting to the bathroom,

359
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,460
because there's no bathroom small enough for him in the giant land,

360
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,180
and there's no bathroom big enough for him in the tiny land.

361
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,800
And when he gets to the human land,

362
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,580
well, everybody's just covered with crap.

363
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,120
It's really, Gulliver's Travels, if you've never read it,

364
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,920
and after all these years I never had,

365
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,920
is a really funny book.

366
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,880
I'll tell you another funny book

367
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,720
that surprised me at its funniness,

368
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,800
was Moby Dick.

369
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,940
I started reading Herman Melville's Moby Dick,

370
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,060
which I never had read,

371
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,540
and people always act like it's the most terrible thing in the world

372
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,540
that anyone ever had to do, read that book,

373
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,220
but it's actually quite humorous at the beginning,

374
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,940
as we might find also with this fellow named Dave,

375
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,720
who I think is on.

376
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,140
It's garbage, it's garbage, isn't it?

377
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,800
Oh, good.

378
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,060
Oh, good. Just as tasty as you wanted it, didn't it?

379
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,000
Mmm, tasty.

380
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,040
So what is your bad idea for a movie?

381
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,920
What's the problem right now, comrade?

382
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,240
Oh, we have all kinds of bad ideas.

383
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,800
A bad idea for a what?

384
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,940
I hear you are stinking up the airwaves

385
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,840
a la Jonathan Swift's style.

386
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,920
Well, I was reading from,

387
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,260
I was reading the dirty parts of Gulliver's Travels, Dave.

388
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,320
Yeah.

389
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,540
And I got through most of the

390
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,460
experimentatory aspects of the, um,

391
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,080
the tiny people's world, Lilliput.

392
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,780
And he had, and I just finished reading where he,

393
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,700
he tries to jump over a cow flop in Brobdingnag,

394
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,180
but the cow flops are eight feet across,

395
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,240
and he gets mired filthily.

396
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,120
It was most droll.

397
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,440
If you like that sort of thing.

398
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,220
Can you see, can you possibly see,

399
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,740
as some have ventured and speculated,

400
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,240
that there is a hidden thing of the,

401
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,860
Jonathan Swift was deacon of the Irish church in Dublin,

402
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,360
Right.

403
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,820
but he was also a nationalist.

404
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,000
He was not a pro-throne enthusiast.

405
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,040
No, and we would now consider him to be

406
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,160
a very, very conservative.

407
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,740
He was a Tory, not a Whig.

408
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,140
We would probably end up being Whigs.

409
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,000
And, but he, yeah, he was a Catholic preacher.

410
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,360
That's pretty conservative, usually.

411
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,580
And there was the plight of the Irish people

412
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,400
somehow explained through the vessel of the,

413
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,840
the travels through Brobdingnag,

414
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,200
Lilliput, and so forth.

415
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,700
Oh, according to the notes that come with this edition of the book,

416
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,940
the whole thing is biting satires on current events

417
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,980
that were happening in England, English politics,

418
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,000
and European politics in the years,

419
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,140
the 1720s.

420
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,700
Yeah.

421
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,880
And I'm sure it would be even more hilarious

422
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,880
if you knew which nobleman he was making fun of

423
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,060
and were there at the time.

424
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,720
But it's still, there's still a lot of stuff in it

425
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,620
that's just as true today as it was then.

426
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,960
His satire on human affairs is really wonderful.

427
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,260
Isn't it?

428
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,920
I mean, isn't it just delightful?

429
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,420
It's delightful euphemism for what part of before,

430
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,800
and still comes afterwards 10 times.

431
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,940
So you actually have read Gulliver's Travels yourself?

432
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,380
Have I read what you're reading now?

433
00:30:59,580 --> 00:30:59,900
Yeah.

434
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,020
No, I don't remember the pooh-pooh and pee-pee parts.

435
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,560
They're just like you did before you found these tracks.

436
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:10,320
You, you know, pretty much the illustrated versions for kids

437
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,480
and stuff like that.

438
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,400
You know, a bunch of Lilliputians all tying them down.

439
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,000
Oh, here's a great description of the state of England

440
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,200
under Queen Anne, which he describes as a race of lawyers.

441
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,480
Let's see.

442
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,700
My master was yet wholly at a loss to understand

443
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,260
what motives could incite this race of lawyers

444
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,620
to perplex, disquiet, and weary themselves

445
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,380
and engage in a confederacy of injustice

446
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,620
merely for the sake of injuring their fellow animals.

447
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,380
Neither could he comprehend why.

448
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,320
What I meant in saying they did it for hire,

449
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,900
whereupon I was at much pains to describe to him

450
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,000
the use of money, the materials it was made of,

451
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,160
and the value of metals, that when a yahoo,

452
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,740
which is the horse people's term for humans,

453
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,320
when a yahoo got a great store of this precious substance,

454
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,840
he could purchase whatever he had a mind to,

455
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,000
the finest clothing, the noblest houses,

456
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,760
great tracts of land, and have his choice

457
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,900
of the most beautiful females, therefore,

458
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,440
since money alone was able to perform all these feats,

459
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,820
our yahoos thought, they could never have enough of it

460
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,900
to spend or to save, as they found themselves inclined

461
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,180
from their natural bent either to profusion or avarice,

462
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,860
that the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor man's labor,

463
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,940
and the latter were a thousand to one in proportion

464
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,160
to the former, that the bulk of our people were forced

465
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,480
to live miserably by laboring every day for small wages

466
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,160
to make a few live plentifully.

467
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,840
I enlarged my study.

468
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,940
I put myself much on these and other particulars,

469
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,320
and basically the intelligent horse he's talking to

470
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,400
decides that the people from Gulliver's world

471
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,580
must be the most vile and filthy vermin ever to walk the earth.

472
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,680
And in fact, when Gulliver gets back from the superior culture

473
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,400
of the Huns, which is the horse people,

474
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,660
he can't stand the sight of his fellow Englishmen.

475
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,580
And he keeps wanting to paw the ground with his hoof

476
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,960
and go, hmm, a lot, and speak, hmm, language,

477
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,800
because he's just so disgusted.

478
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,360
But see, they never put that part in any of the movies.

479
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:34,120
The crappy movies of Gulliver's travel almost all end with...

480
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,160
They kind of deleted the horse people.

481
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,360
Yeah, they end with the Lilliputians,

482
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,000
and he beats the Blephesuians, and that's it.

483
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,480
Yeah, like the fight scenes of, like, thousands of tiny ants

484
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,820
attacking a huge tree.

485
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,520
Or the Statue of Liberty or something.

486
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,380
The very worst version of Gulliver's travels

487
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,800
is the most recent one that I know of,

488
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,980
which sadly was the work of Jack Black,

489
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,880
who can normally be pretty funny, but this just...

490
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,580
Was not.

491
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,540
The only thing that's accurate to the book in that movie

492
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,360
is the putting out the fire in the palace by urinating on it.

493
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,320
That's the only thing they kept from the book.

494
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,660
See, I remember putting out the palace fire,

495
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,520
but I didn't know that it was the fire from the phallus.

496
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:20,900
Get it?

497
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,060
The palace fire and the phallus pyre.

498
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,000
You know.

499
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,900
Yeah, it's a pun.

500
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,860
But no, that is conveniently deleted

501
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,860
for all of us septuagenarians and people without any teeth.

502
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,620
And also young people without any teeth.

503
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,320
Well, they...

504
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:42,800
They don't believe it.

505
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,240
As often...

506
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,060
Every time Gulliver lands on some new island or planet or whatever

507
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,760
and explains his world to the people there,

508
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,200
they're always disgusted and horrified.

509
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,360
Even though their world, in some cases, is even worse.

510
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,620
The Lilliput is worse even than 1720s England.

511
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,660
Yes.

512
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,360
Although their medical science is very similar

513
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,780
to the medical science of England.

514
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,240
Like what?

515
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,980
Like drooling and his pondering and baby-lapping?

516
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,800
Oh, here you go.

517
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,200
Here you go.

518
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,300
I was complaining...

519
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,660
He's in the city of experts.

520
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,100
I was complaining of a small fit of the colic

521
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,400
upon which my conductor led me to a room

522
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,620
where a great physician resided

523
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,380
who was famous for curing that disease

524
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:42,780
but was not a doctor.

525
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,480
I was destined to be a doctor.

526
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,540
Well, the procedure is water and wine.

527
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,380
And you must admit any doctor

528
00:35:59,380 --> 00:35:59,420
who thought black embaixo

529
00:35:59,420 --> 00:35:59,420


530
00:35:59,420 --> 00:35:59,420


531
00:35:59,420 --> 00:35:59,420


532
00:35:59,420 --> 00:35:59,420


533
00:35:59,420 --> 00:35:59,420


534
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:05,800
You can't be the悅sy fork forthwith.

535
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,880
But George H.,

536
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,780
there's five pistons in this conective quilted希ulaFX

537
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,620
body of the patient, then withdrew the implement to replenish it, clapping his thumb strongly

538
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:21,940
against the orifice of the fundament, and this being repeated three or four times, the adventitious

539
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:27,660
wind would rush out, bringing the noxious along with it, like water put into a pump,

540
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,700
and the patient recover. I saw him try both experiments upon a dog, but could not discern

541
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,920
any effect from the former. After the latter, the animal was ready to burst, and made so violent a

542
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,740
discharge, as was very offensive to me and my companions. The dog died on the spot,

543
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,240
and we left the doctor endeavoring to recover him by the same operation.

544
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:00,600
So, yeah, you didn't know there was so much, uh, that's from a voyage to Lapita.

545
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:08,280
Wow. The only problem is, you can't get people to read those, like, 12-page long paragraphs,

546
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,720
I mean, sentences nowadays.

547
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:16,120
Well, there's more words in those older books than men of today know.

548
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:30,080
Yeah. Well, it's hard for people to, um, to read these more intelligent books,

549
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,980
because people are now much, much less intelligent.

550
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,820
I agree. Do you agree, senor?

551
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,440
I mean, I, I know, I'm sure you know people who,

552
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,720
who beg that they have not read a book since school.

553
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,260
Well, they beg. Sometimes they rag a bule like a rat tattoo.

554
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,040
And, um...

555
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
If they're given that chance.

556
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,740
Uh, you know, if you look at your modern bestsellers, uh, by the worthy Stephen King, say,

557
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:07,320
the vocabulary is about one-tenth that of, say, Mary Shelley, who wrote Frankenstein in, uh,

558
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,600
the 17th century, I think.

559
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,980
Yeah. No, in the 18th century.

560
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,800
18th century, but, uh, yeah, but really early.

561
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,760
19th century. Early 19th century.

562
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,020
And, um...

563
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:17,640
1800s.

564
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,700
Uh, right. And, um, yeah, even stuff like, uh, Robert Louis Stevenson.

565
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:32,840
There's, there's, they're full of wonderful flowery words that people sorta know what they mean now,

566
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:39,280
but they can't remember them to use themselves. And maybe there's a lot of words they just don't.

567
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,460
Get.

568
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,900
And, and context is a...

569
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,220
Maybe there would. They hate that.

570
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,520
Context is tricky.

571
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,260
They just think of it that way.

572
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,140
You know, for some folks.

573
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,480
So, yeah, I'm old, and I read really old books for fun.

574
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,640
And you got, like, like, big Coke, Coke bottle cl... glasses, which you wear on your ear,

575
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,460
and then, like, little, like, once you get, like, a tiny little euphemism from Grandmother's Kutchkin.

576
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,920
Oh, I have to use Brobdingnagian glasses.

577
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,340
Brobdingnagian.

578
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,640
I have to use glasses so big that I stand...

579
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,080
Right.

580
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,840
...behind the lens.

581
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:17,460
And, uh, and holding the, it's hard to reach around the glass to hold the book up to my eyes.

582
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,060
See, it would be, it would be weird if people started wearing garter socks and all that stuff like that,

583
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,060
and white wigs and everything.

584
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,820
It's like a total transfusional, uh, dis-, diaspora from the actual innards of, uh, uh,

585
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,160
Why not? It could happen again.

586
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,080
Yeah.

587
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,780
I mean, for, for, I mean, wigs.

588
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,940
I can see how wigs could come back.

589
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,300
Forty years ago, long hair was fashionable.

590
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:49,380
And, um, and then shaving your head bald-headed likewise became fashionable.

591
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,780
Now, what's in between the two?

592
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,600
What's the next step?

593
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,520
Obviously, expensive wigs.

594
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,240
Anybody can grow their hair long.

595
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,700
That doesn't take, all that takes is not getting a job for ten years.

596
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,300
Anybody can shave their hair off.

597
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,460
All that takes is wanting to be just like every other jock on the block.

598
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,500
So, what can you do that's, that nobody else can do?

599
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,060
Spend money!

600
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,780
Be like Trump!

601
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,800
And wear a very expensive powdered white wig.

602
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,600
And that way, it would be a meritocracy.

603
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:29,320
Only people who were smart, that is, inherited money, would be able to be fashionable and wear the wigs.

604
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:36,400
And all these cheap kids that just get tattoos or, or body piercings, all that easy, cheap stuff,

605
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,440
they, they'd be shown off.

606
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,100
They'd be shown for what they are.

607
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,860
Just posers.

608
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:45,400
Cause only rich, it's a, the only thing that's important, as Jonathan Swift pointed out, is money.

609
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:53,980
And so the best way to demonstrate your superiority is to gross everybody out with your expensive, smelly wig.

610
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,740
That time is coming.

611
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,480
Mark my words, even better would be the broomstick up the fundament.

612
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,420
With, from which poor kids would dangle heavy, heavy wigs.

613
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,340
Jewelry.

614
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:14,200
And from which rich kids would dangle more lightweight, but expensive jewelry.

615
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,260
Bling.

616
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,920
Bling your butt bling.

617
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,820
You know, hanging off your broomstick.

618
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:19,220
Exactly, butt bling.

619
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:25,780
And they'd be like little sophomores doing the squids, like where people could wear athletic supporters of their own design, you know.

620
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,680
And sometimes they'd be like made of heavy metals and strontium-90 and, and stuff like that.

621
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,960
And you, and you're right.

622
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,880
The garters and curly shoes.

623
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,500
Shoes with huge, ridiculous curling toes and maybe a little bell on the end of the curling toe.

624
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,360
Yeah, like Taylor's Mackies and band photos and stuff like that.

625
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,240
Cause, cause only rich people could wear shoes like that.

626
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,440
They'd get in the way if you was poor.

627
00:41:49,740 --> 00:42:00,560
And yet, back when those shoes were, were the trend, poor people would spend their last dime to wear those shoes that did them no good cause you couldn't walk in them.

628
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,260
When you're poor, you had to walk.

629
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:02,580
Yeah.

630
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:06,900
You didn't have handmen and foot maidens all toting you around on a planking.

631
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,860
Like I will someday.

632
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,220
Well, we all will someday, but that day's too far in the future.

633
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:23,680
Like, if you think of your conspiratorial theories like, like if I was a Wobbly or somebody like that, you know, you would think that any form of authority is full of crap, you know.

634
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,540
Uh huh.

635
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,420
I'm not saying I would believe anything like that.

636
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:27,800
Trumpy.

637
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,200
Well, you know, if, if, um, see.

638
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:45,080
I think maybe what we should do is throw our, um, our support behind Trump because money is all that, that matters and he's proved that he, well, he inherited money, so.

639
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,460
And he didn't actually make very much.

640
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:58,960
And there he's, and he doesn't even want anybody to know how little or much he might have made or how much trouble he might be in for doing it that way.

641
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,280
But the point is it doesn't matter.

642
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,780
It doesn't matter.

643
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,000
Only power matters.

644
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:12,420
And you see, if you vote for, if, and I'm going to tell, I'm saying this to all the listeners.

645
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:17,340
If you vote for Donald Trump, he will let you in his country club.

646
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,860
That's right.

647
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,780
And if you believe me, you would probably believe him.

648
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,480
So why don't you go ahead and do whatever is the worst possible thing for yourself.

649
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:28,940
Go ahead.

650
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,060
Screw the world.

651
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,880
Screw the authorities and screw the anti authority.

652
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,900
Screw everything.

653
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,080
A vote, as Philo said, a vote for Trump is a vote against boredom.

654
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,420
And isn't boredom terrible?

655
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:57,260
Wouldn't it be better to have excitement like, like, I don't know, losing your job and having to flee the country or, you know, not ever being able to get an abortion or, or medical care that you can afford or anything.

656
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,060
That's.

657
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:58,920
That's.

658
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,220
That's less boredom.

659
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,640
The more misery you have, the less boring it is.

660
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:10,100
So by God, yeah, vote against boredom and for misery on your, of your own part.

661
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:14,480
Except that, you know, of course that Trump, he's like Santa Claus.

662
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,460
He sees everybody who votes for him and they become his friends and he lets them in the country club.

663
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,720
But he sees everybody who doesn't vote for him and all those people, they go on the other side of that big old wall.

664
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,220
They can just, they can make their peace with them.

665
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,920
They can make their peace with the Mexicans and Canadians and stuff.

666
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,820
If they think that they're, that's so, so much better than America.

667
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,000
Because if you don't vote for Trump, that means you hate America.

668
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,540
Calm down, sonny boy.

669
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,640
He's just fine.

670
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,360
Let's pull the audience out of here.

671
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,100
That's what they're saying.

672
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,240
You know, that's what they're saying out there.

673
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,940
Everybody but you and me.

674
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,020
That's what they're saying.

675
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,080
I agree or disagree.

676
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,460
But I mean, I agree with what you're saying.

677
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,200
That there's just too much boredom.

678
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:03,280
Too far too many of them coming in confluence together.

679
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,380
Well, they have something to unite against.

680
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,080
Boredom and success, happiness and health.

681
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,940
They're finally going to end all that stuff because there's just been too many freeloaders getting slack.

682
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,380
And not enough haters getting smack.

683
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,880
Yeah, or what?

684
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,400
Yeah, something.

685
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,500
I don't know what the problem is.

686
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,720
All I know is America's not great anymore and it's going to be great again.

687
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,460
That's right.

688
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,520
Because he said he was going to.

689
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,060
He's not like the other politicians.

690
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:39,880
They're politicians.

691
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:40,680
They lie.

692
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,680
He would never lie.

693
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,660
How could a real estate developer lie?

694
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,760
Have you ever heard of a real estate developer lying or being wrong?

695
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,600
Or any salesman?

696
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:54,680
Yes.

697
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,300
I rest my case.

698
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:58,800
Yes.

699
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,620
I mean, did you think Bob Dobbs, does he lie?

700
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:16,460
Well, you know, all that, what this is all building up to, Dave, of course, is a plug for the little button that says, don't blame me.

701
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,780
I voted for Bob, which I think we mentioned last week.

702
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,620
Yes.

703
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,000
It is red, white and blue.

704
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,760
Frequently as possible because.

705
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,280
Yes.

706
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:35,620
If we vote for Bob, if we electrocute that frying pan Venus of a saucer faced, okra-pied uncle, grandmother.

707
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,740
Old pipe face, we call it.

708
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:53,580
That old pipe faced, hat-wigged wig, then we can truly, truly, truly exert our liberty the way the punishment and the first and fourth constitutions had promised us back in the days of Hitler and Goering and all those guys, you know?

709
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,420
Yeah, man.

710
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:54,720
Yeah.

711
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:59,380
Yeah, those guys, those guys knew what they wanted and they were confident, that's what matters.

712
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:06,440
A con man is always confident, they're the most confident and their confidence is contagious.

713
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:16,560
Unfortunately, creativity is not contagious except inside the church of the subgenius.

714
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:24,400
And a few pairs of shoes, well worn and with long, long, long pointy things in the very, very side of his body.

715
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,140
pointy things at the end of the

716
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,100
toes point right up in the air.

717
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,400
And you can

718
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,360
catch our

719
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,240
contagion of creativity, friends.

720
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,020
You really can. All you have to do is

721
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,260
read all the subgenius

722
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,120
books. No, I'm not telling you to do that.

723
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,160
They're actually really hard to find now.

724
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,160
Only the very first one, the book of the

725
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,100
subgenius is still in print, but it is

726
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,600
an e-book now.

727
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,180
And we're on television now. If you have

728
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,300
a Roku, you can watch the subgenius

729
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,820
Dr. Philo Drummond's

730
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:58,120
subgenius show on OSI

731
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,220
74 channel of Roku,

732
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,740
which currently features

733
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,800
the bulldada of the week is

734
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,780
the worst version of

735
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,860
Star Wars you could possibly

736
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,400
imagine.

737
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,080
Put together by our own friend

738
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,880
Rev X from old

739
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,640
bad copies of Star Wars

740
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,020
and amateur wannabe Star Wars

741
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,180
movies and cartoons

742
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,960
and other things.

743
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,980
In fact, I believe

744
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,700
that he replaced most of the soundtrack

745
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,860
of Star Wars with the soundtrack from

746
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,060
Flesh Gordon.

747
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,380
So you can see that

748
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,320
amazing thing on Roku

749
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,860
for free. You could

750
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,020
see the amazing Dr. Philo

751
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,660
Drummond and the amazing Dr. Hal

752
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,720
at X Day. Dr. Hal

753
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,520
will be at X Day starting

754
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,380
June 27th

755
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:46,880
or something.

756
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,920
And I

757
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,520
and Princess

758
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,700
We Are Doe will be at Starwood

759
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,100
the week after the week after the world ends.

760
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:57,860
July

761
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,940
12th. We're all getting

762
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,900
ready for all that stuff. There's going to be lots

763
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,880
of music and

764
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,220
dancing and a lot of jibber jabbering

765
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,960
and laying on our hands

766
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,200
and all kinds of

767
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,320
brain propagandizing

768
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:12,900
and

769
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,360
immaculations and

770
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,600
You know, I have some

771
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,980
trends that you guys do not know.

772
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,880
You know what, Princess We?

773
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,920
I have some trends.

774
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,620
You did not go over and you were talking about the trends

775
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,380
of young people today. Yes.

776
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,980
Premature receding hairlines

777
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,960
where young men shave their heads

778
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,220
back so they have a receding

779
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,460
hairline even though they

780
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,660
don't really. They give

781
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,140
themselves a receding hairline.

782
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,700
They want to look a little bit more

783
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,940
mature, I would imagine.

784
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,780
And then they can go beyond

785
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,800
that to very

786
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,760
young men shave the whole

787
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,840
top of their heads so they

788
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,620
just have the

789
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,940
monk fringe.

790
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,880
Quick, quick. Yeah, quick, quick.

791
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,400
Quick, quick haircut.

792
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,120
That's it.

793
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,340
And I also

794
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,380
have an announcement about

795
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,400
a wonderful show that's going to happen

796
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,440
next Saturday, a

797
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,300
week from last night, where

798
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,120
Halim Eldab, the

799
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,120
ethnomusicologist from Kent

800
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,160
and Ron Pyrosonic

801
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,320
will be making all kinds

802
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,900
of amazing sounds

803
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,440
using interesting

804
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,900
modern and ancient

805
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,060
instruments in combination

806
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,160
and there will be other

807
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,200
electronic artists and this is

808
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,280
all happening at Spaces

809
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,380
Gallery 2220

810
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,660
Superior Viaduct.

811
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,840
When is that? That's

812
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,060
this next Saturday night.

813
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,420
Halim Eldab

814
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,600
is like a 90,000

815
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,360
year old pharaoh. Yes.

816
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,880
From Egypt.

817
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,800
And he's also a really famous

818
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,420
composer of

819
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,260
opera.

820
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,840
Hard to say. Very avant-garde

821
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,920
stuff. Very. And our old

822
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,940
buddy, Reverend Ron

823
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,800
Slabe of Pyrosonic

824
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,620
has been doing those wild

825
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,820
fire and noise shows

826
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,280
out at Starwood for

827
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,740
centuries. He's not quite

828
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,680
as old as Halim, but

829
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,760
this would

830
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,840
probably be an interesting thing to see

831
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,500
and hear. Yes.

832
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,480
Yes, really.

833
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,080
That's in Akron, though, right?

834
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,800
No, that's at Spaces. There is an

835
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,800
opening in Akron. They're also having a

836
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,520
party. The CD release party, but then

837
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,740
yes, this is a big consortium

838
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,460
of other electronic artists.

839
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,480
Greg

840
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,200
Cinebaldi and Anne Clorox

841
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,780
and these other fellows

842
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,840
from Kent that are going

843
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,420
to come and untie the knot.

844
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,780
I bet

845
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,260
old mother's ball be

846
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,800
hanging around wearing a switch broom hat

847
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,560
and a pair of shy underpants.

848
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,140
I guess he's heading back this way on

849
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,780
like dressed up like a pioneer woman or something.

850
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,840
No, that's his sister, Amy.

851
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,000
She owns a really

852
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,720
nice gallery in Akron.

853
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,680
Reverend Amy

854
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,780
Mother's Ball

855
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,140
has been

856
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,760
she's putting on some kind of big crazy

857
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,980
art show with subgeniuses

858
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,040
involved like Reverend Torrey

859
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,720
and various others.

860
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,740
They're doing

861
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,420
cicada related.

862
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,460
It's a cicada based thing.

863
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,740
It's almost time to go.

864
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,700
We have

865
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,460
to we have to put on music now

866
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,900
because we have to get out of here

867
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,280
and the music will be by the Rudy Schwartz

868
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,740
project. You'll recognize the tune,

869
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,100
but not the version.

870
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,160
Hmm. Well,

871
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,720
I guess that about says it.

872
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,120
Oh, I can hear sounds like tanks,

873
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,380
millions of tanks coming in from the distance.

874
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,960
Those are the cicadas, but they're not real.

875
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,900
They're not real.

876
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,740
That's just your tinnitus in your ear.

877
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,000
Yeah.

878
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Even if there were real cicadas,

879
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,060
you wouldn't be able to hear them.

880
