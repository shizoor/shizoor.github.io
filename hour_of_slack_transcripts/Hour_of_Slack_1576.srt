1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
The western man is at once mournful and menacing.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,520
Why? Why this terror of the man?

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,380
It is not his appearance that stops our heart.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,620
The opposite.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,780
His invisibility.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,500
It is possible to live in the same habitat for years and never encounter him.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,000
He is elusive.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,060
We know he is near, for we see his tracks.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,460
We know he kills, for we see the remains.

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,980
We know he lives because we hear the howl.

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,340
The last peel so frightfully piercing is to go through your heart.

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,040
About 20 yards to my right.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,880
Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are unable to continue the broadcast.

14
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,040
This time we take you to Washington for a special broadcast on the national emergency.

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,040
The radio, remember? Make it work.

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,960
The hour of slug.

17
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,980
So you did bust it.

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,840
Stations aren't strong enough in the daytime. Tonight it'll work.

19
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,780
Tonight it better.

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,960
Can't you smell it?

21
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,660
Then came a message from a distant star.

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,620
Earth needed lovers and they wanted to be ours.

23
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,380
Here they are.

24
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,580
On the Ministry.

25
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,260
leichter....

26
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,580
Historical.

27
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,520
Human.

28
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,560
Water me.

29
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,220
It's ferment change forms within nature.

The best time.

36
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:24,460


37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,920

38
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,980
I'm coming for you

39
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,760
I'm coming for you

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,460

Huh, aliens, I'm coming for you

43
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,520
Huh, aliens, they still want the few

44
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,240
Attention Earthlings, you're not alone

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,260
We are coming to join your home

46
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,780
Your satisfaction is our intention

47
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,420
You will love our greatest invention

48
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,660
We travel through space because we need you

49
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,400
Our only desire is to please you

50
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,100
We're here and we're coming for you

51
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,820
Your dreams are going to come true

52
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,560
We come from space that's far above you

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,260
Our only mission is to love you

54
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,580
We know how to treat you right

55
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,080
We just want to boogie on

56
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,400
And we'll be right back

57
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,400
Yeah, boogie

58
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,840
Yes, yeah, boogie

59
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,280
Yeah

60
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,300
If you dreamed of an ideal lover

61
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,760
Whose body feels like rubber

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,400
And you're not alone

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,480
They're designed for your pleasure

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,960
The perfect fit

65
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,920
Made to measure

66
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,540
They never sleep

67
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,280
And they never die

68
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,940
They've got a match

69
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,040
To start your fire

70
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,460
They know just how to treat you right

71
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,380
They just want to be with you

72
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,380


73
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,380

00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,260
Boogie all night

77
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,780
Your every wish is their desire

78
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,240

Oh, what cool hot aliens, yes!

Oh, what cool hot aliens!

Oh, what cool hot aliens!

Oh, what cool hot aliens!

Oh, what cool hot aliens, yes!

116
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,160
Oh, what cool hot aliens!

117
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,160

00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,140

We boogie all night

129

Hot alien comes to town

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,420
Yes!

134
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,380
Oh, yes, dear friends.

135
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:30,600
That was the Exposed Foreheads, or I should say that was a band called Exposed Foreheads,

136
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,760
using the letter X at the beginning and the numeral 4.

137
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,260
And I'm looking forward to seeing them play at the devotional.

138
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,120
That's the Devo Convention, as it were, for the devotees this August.

139
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,040
And it's also, that particular song was a great one to kick off X Day.

140
00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:00,620
X Day, and our guest, Dr. Howl and Owl.

141
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,580
Yes, I'm here in this special pre-X Day broadcast.

142
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,020
Yes, X Day is coming.

143
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,760
Dear fiends, this is your irritating horror.

144
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,340
I'm your host, Dr. Howl and Owl, to tell you about some of the wonder, the terror,

145
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:32,400
the nightmare, and the ecstasy of merging with the unfathomably unthinkable.

146
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:45,540
At X Day, the apex of all human life and activity, and the end point for a shaken and stirred

147
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,220
planet.

148
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,520
Now, this is the end point for a completely new chapter of X Day.

149
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,580
Yes, friends, X Day, never a duh moment.

150
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,800
X Day.

151
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,100
X Day.

152
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,340


153
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,740
X Day.

154
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,460
X Day.

155
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:01,660
X Day.

156
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,580
All those guys sit around without any pants on, drinking beer.

157
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,540
Is that what it's all about?

158
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,820
It doesn't sound that good to me.

159
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,540
I don't know.

160
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,920
There is that.

161
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,960
There is lots of that.

162
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,660
There is lots of standing around.

163
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,180
and the road yakking.

164
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,880
Naked?

165
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,580
And drinking beer?

166
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,680
Well, we call it sky-clad.

167
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,500
Clothing optional.

168
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,120
Unlike many national parks at this campground,

169
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,560
it is legal to feed the sky-clad seniors.

170
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,300
Yes.

171
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,860
Yes, they'll gobble up those treats

172
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,600
if you're of a mind

173
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,980
to cast them out of the car

174
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,360
with the windows almost completely rolled up, of course.

175
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,840
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

176
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,100
Friends, for those of you

177
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,620
who don't know what we're talking about,

178
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,360
and you probably already tuned out anyway,

179
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,380
X-Day is, well,

180
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,900
it's the prophesied end of human reality.

181
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,800
Yes.

182
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,520
You and we know it.

183
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,320
And we know it.

184
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,840
In our religion, the Church of the Subgenius,

185
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,700
our high E-popped J.R. Bob Dobbs,

186
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,580
bless his sweet...

187
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,020
name.

188
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,720
And pipe.

189
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,820
Predicted, or rather prophesied,

190
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,840
he was given to know, in fact,

191
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,720
by, sure, let's call them the gods,

192
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,660
that on the day of July 5th,

193
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,720
at 7 in the morning,

194
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,340
the world will be destroyed,

195
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,440
and only the worthy will be saved.

196
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,600
Lifted up onto, well,

197
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,020
flying saucers, you might say,

198
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,040
although that's a...

199
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,860
It will be destroyed, or so profound,

200
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,300
and it will be completely transformed,

201
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,780
that one cannot tell the difference

202
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,220
between that and complete immolation.

203
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,360
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

204
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,420
another strange...

205
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,560
It's a lonesome, lonesome time.

206
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,640
His lonely vigil.

207
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,780
For loneliest individuals.

208
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,780
Yes.

209
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,300
Is that what you said?

210
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,520
There are certain ones who occupy a realm outside

211
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,080
that straightened purview of the law,

212
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,740
who feel uncomfortable obeying all of society's

213
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,640
petitions.

214
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,960
I was having similar thoughts just earlier

215
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,400
about interspecial marriage and stuff like that,

216
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,900
and I was thinking,

217
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,820
if you were raised to feel like a dog,

218
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,400
or to feel like a cat,

219
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,820
shouldn't you use the same restroom facilities

220
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,060
as a dog or a cat?

221
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,140
Well, we will be out there at Wisteria.

222
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,760
Everybody uses the same basic facilities,

223
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,060
those blue...

224
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,400
Yes, humans and livestock

225
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,640
thunder into the receiving space.

226
00:14:46,660 --> 00:15:00,580
This that means they don't know whatming kind of animals

227
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:00,580


228
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:00,580


229
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:00,580


230
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:00,640
Well, there are those living creatures

231
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,200
creatures pull them from theafood sauce,

232
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:01,880
and they go and get food.

233
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,220
Yes.

234
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,180
Are they trained in yoga?

235
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,100
K temperatures?

236
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,220
And they have high.

237
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,740
No?

238
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:16,640


239
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,480
No.

240
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,340
There will be a turtle.

241
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,360
Yes, one turtle to rule them all.

242
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,340
But on the other hand, there might be others.

243
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,260
It's a biological hotspot teeming with life forms of every description.

244
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:38,960
There's a mocking turtle sloop down by the old graveyard river there thing that empties into the bottom.

245
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,280
Well, we don't mock the turtle that's there.

246
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,760
No, and he does worse than mock people.

247
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,700
He snaps toes, doesn't he?

248
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,600
Well, he takes one subgenius a year.

249
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,520
He might leave a toe or two behind.

250
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,160
We let him take one of us so that he won't come and destroy all of us.

251
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:03,540
Although this particular year, I'm sure this will be 1998, and this time the world will end.

252
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,420
The real 1998.

253
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,320
Right, finally.

254
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,160
Finally.

255
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,460
And if it's...

256
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,480
Well, let's just not even go there.

257
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,140
It's a terrible thought to think that so many years have passed by just waiting and maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe nothing could happen.

258
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:29,560
Yes, to puny human lifespans, but in the long history of time, hardly a blip or squiggle.

259
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,140
Hardly.

260
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:39,160
Well, the fact that we've waited over 20 years now for 1990, well, almost 20 years for 1998 to happen,

261
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,740
it proves that Bob was just teaching us that we had to kiss our cats.

262
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:45,980
Yes.

263
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,420
Yes.

264
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,640
We don't know.

265
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,780
We don't even know what planet this is.

266
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,200
Stop trying to control time.

267
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,100
Yes.

268
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,040
Yeah, I was just thinking that same thing, too.

269
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,200
I was thinking that if that had gone that far along the lines of what Stan was just saying,

270
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,460
there's no way of knowing how many X days have really gone by.

271
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,280
That's right.

272
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,600
It could have happened 150 years in the past.

273
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,200
Right.

274
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,120
Well, that would be an unpleasant and unforeseen...

275
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,740
Yeah.

276
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,440
...eventuality.

277
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,320
Yeah, it seems like we would have heard about it.

278
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,640
That would demote us all to the status of some etiolated cargo cult,

279
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,540
meaninglessly enacting rituals whose actual use had long since passed.

280
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,260
Well, there's a lot of people who actually...

281
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,300
Lots of people describe us that way, Dr. Howell.

282
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,200
In fact, I believe my old friend Nenslow was berating me about that very thing, mocking me.

283
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,680
What's odd is that Nenslow has had such a violent antipathy,

284
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,520
to the church, that he now claims he never had anything to do with it.

285
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,860
His printed articles notwithstanding.

286
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,620
Goodness.

287
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,460
Yes, he doesn't wish to become the Donald Trump of the Church of the Subgenius,

288
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,420
denying what is provable from the known and extant records.

289
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
What a revisionist.

290
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,800
Well, in that way, he's kind of like the farting corpse in that movie that's just got going.

291
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:08,980
Oh, really?

292
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,540
Well, everyone knows corpses do that.

293
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,740
Well, what I'm saying...

294
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,260
What I'm saying is he ceased to function in the lineal world,

295
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,840
and now he's in a peripathetic world,

296
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,560
where only onions stink, or something like that.

297
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,880
You know, something poetic.

298
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,360
Actually, he's a great artist, and he's just off on his own path.

299
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,680
Yeah, I don't blame him a bit.

300
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,720
It's funny.

301
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,000
Just yesterday, he and I had an exchange on that thing called Facebook.

302
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,760
He was going, yeah, yeah, Bob stuff.

303
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,160
You just add Bob to anything current, and suddenly it's all bobbed up.

304
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,260
I remember that was easy.

305
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,780
I said, and I meant it,

306
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,740
that, dude, you're stuck in the 80s.

307
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,960
And he said, and he meant it,

308
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,800
no, you're stuck in the 80s.

309
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,960
And I said, why not both?

310
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,780
And then Reverend A.P.O. Stacey jumped in and said,

311
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,780
now, am I going to have to separate you two?

312
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,700
Yes, it's incredible.

313
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,780
What happens too often?

314
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,440
Well, men of large ego often come to grips with each other,

315
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,420
or come to blows.

316
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,680
Oh, I wouldn't know anything.

317
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,560
Anything about that.

318
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,960
No, of course.

319
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,760
Existing in a state of philosophical equanimity and sublime dispassion.

320
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,160
Don't mix me up with Bob.

321
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,960
I'm just a sacred scribe.

322
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:35,200
Ruling blandly and effectively over a large unruly group of yet unmolded postulants.

323
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Ringmaster of the cat circus.

324
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,100
That's me.

325
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,760
Yes, and some meows perforce must not be ignored.

326
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,360
Now we're just...

327
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:55,700
We have to deal from time to time with the cat scratch fever of the Church of the Subgenius.

328
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,780
What's that called?

329
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,280
The screeching, the digging of divots of fur out of...

330
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,120
Cat scratch fever?

331
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,960
Nagliera amoeba, something like that.

332
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,140
Nagliera nefertiti, that's the brain-eating amoeba.

333
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,560
Not to be taken lightly.

334
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,760
Incidentally...

335
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:19,540
Incidentally, Dr. Howell, you know, an Ohioan died of that recently in West Virginia.

336
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,260
Uh-oh.

337
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,460
It's a bad way to die.

338
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,600
Yeah.

339
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,580
West Virginia's a lot...

340
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,760
Well, I think coming from an Ohioan being in West Virginia is a bad way to die.

341
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,180
Well, the reason I bring that up is we have this full immersion baptism.

342
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,580
West Virginia.

343
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,300
Normally.

344
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,620
Normally.

345
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,100
But I'm beginning to think, Dr. Howell, that when we're dunking those people, what we maybe

346
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,760
ought to do is just sprinkle them with...

347
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,960
With a little holy water, Chris.

348
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,320
But we're not...

349
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,200
You don't think we should swim in the pond anymore?

350
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,540
We can swim all we want, but you know, when you and I dunk them, when we...

351
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,140
Yes.

352
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,260
We shove their heads underwater, that's a little different because you can get water

353
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:07,140
up your nose, and that's the pathway that the brain-eating amoeba takes to his dinner.

354
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:13,520
Well, I notice we've dunked many boys and girls, and have they suffered from brain-eating

355
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:13,740
amoebas?

356
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,900
How would we know?

357
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,960
They're subgeniuses.

358
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,840
Right.

359
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,380
How the hell would we know?

360
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,540
If you actually have qualms about this, naturally we will modify the program.

361
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,960
We had people hold their nose last year.

362
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,820
Yeah.

363
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:34,000
And shut their eyes tight so as not to behold the horror of all encroaching doom.

364
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,940
Or the pantsless subgeniuses standing around them.

365
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,340
Yes, that's the really hard part to take.

366
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,860
Yeah, it's hard to take, boy.

367
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,360
I tell you...

368
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,380
Last time you guys were doing pictures out there and stuff.

369
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,960
Yes.

370
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,740
A lot of these people didn't even look like human beings anymore.

371
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,580
They look like something...

372
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:50,880
Well...

373
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,340
Well, we tend to give them the benefit of the doubt.

374
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:00,380
They may not be human, strictly speaking, if you want to be niggling about anatomical

375
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,420
measures and rules.

376
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,400
We're not pictures.

377
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,300
But you can't keep dunking and dunking and dunking them as if they were some sort of

378
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,240
magnificent donut.

379
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,700
It is a ceremony.

380
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,540
I know it's part of a ceremony.

381
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,720
It has symbolic value.

382
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,960
It's more like...

383
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,520
The incarnation of a witch or the...

384
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,860
You know, when they used to get a witch, they'd keep on dunking and dunking.

385
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,160
Yes, well, if they were witches and they were innocent, they would sink.

386
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,880
But all subgeniuses float.

387
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,540
Oh, much like some other things that float.

388
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,340
Like ivory soap.

389
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,840
Like ivory soap.

390
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,360
Pure.

391
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,820
So mild it's pure and...

392
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,260
Right.

393
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,560
Like my lofty thoughts floating so high above this gutter of a world.

394
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,120
Exactly.

395
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,860
And like an old egg in a bowl of cold...

396
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,400
Cold water.

397
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,340
Down, down it goes.

398
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,060
Oh, a fresh egg goes down.

399
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,400
I've been referred to as an old egg in a bowl of cold water.

400
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,420
Have any of you?

401
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,180
I'd like to...

402
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,900
No.

403
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,800
Well, I...

404
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,040
Well...

405
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,180
I mean, not an egg.

406
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:08,940
It's not going to be easy to take these private memories out and air dirty laundry in public.

407
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,440
But in a sense, we are all eggs in embryo.

408
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:12,900
To Bob.

409
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:22,780
Waiting to be developed as we enter the profoundly transformative phase of our new life on the morning of July 5th.

410
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,060
Or flipped over easy.

411
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,300
Then you'll see what we actually are like as we reveal ourselves suddenly.

412
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,260
Our new selves.

413
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,840
Their brains scrambled like a piece of cheese.

414
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,820
They made their way to the side of the roof.

415
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,680
Perhaps not in accordance with...

416
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,800
Ideas of aesthetic purity or sublimity of the present time.

417
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,600
But everything will be remade anew.

418
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,460
Anew?

419
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,720
Sublimity?

420
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,700
Sublimity.

421
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,200
Wise on sublimation.

422
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,840
The meaning of putting words is sort of hiding things.

423
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,380
Keeping things under your socks.

424
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,140
Just keep an eye on your gun, Sergeant.

425
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,320
Things are going to get different around here.

426
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,220
A little different, see?

427
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,420
Heaven smiles and faiths and empires gleam like wrecked...

428
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,580
...tracks of a dissolving dream.

429
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,580
That's what it'll be like, won't it?

430
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,700
Yes.

431
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,200
The scales will fall from our eyes and...

432
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,020
...we shall see the new world in all of its...

433
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,940
...incredible complexity...

434
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,760
...and...

435
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,160
...strange beauty.

436
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,840
Is it there already or are we creating it as we are?

437
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,000
Well, I think it's like, you know, if you had special glasses you might be able to see it.

438
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,280
But we no longer...

439
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,180
...retail those glasses after...

440
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,000
...a certain dispute which took place several...

441
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,720
...years ago.

442
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,460
Uh, it's, uh...

443
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,520
The John Carpenter, right?

444
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,480
Yeah, exactly.

445
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,460
We settled with, uh, Mr. Carpenter.

446
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:54,100
But we are ready to go through that aperture of change ourselves.

447
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:07,680
And we already feel drawn there by a strange gravity-like force pulling us at first weakly and then faster and farther toward that one ecstatic moment.

448
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,120
The commingling of communion.

449
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,760
With...

450
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,860
...who?

451
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,420
You!

452
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,400
I wouldn't be excluded.

453
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,320
Ew, gross!

454
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,300
Ew.

455
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:15,880
Ew!

456
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,320
Ew!

457
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,840
All compressed into one ball of atoms.

458
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,260
Do I have to get into a phone booth with those guys?

459
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,020
Ew!

460
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,280
You know, stinky and slobber and smelly and so forth.

461
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,040
Gonna make a phone call to a place far far from here.

462
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,840
If...

463
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,840
...they will accept the charges.

464
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,520
That would move the music perfectly well, I must say.

465
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:51,700
Well, so you're hearing music, huh? That's normal. Many hear voices also, but now we know the origin point of these things.

466
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,360
You know, that's part of what being a sub-genius is all about.

467
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,800
It's the baloners of it all, the debajo, the debajo.

468
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:15,560
A portion of the brain, similar to chopped luncheon meat, which lies underneath the upper system of the convoluted human brain.

469
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,500
You're saying we all have lunch meat underneath our brains?

470
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,620
No, we all meet for lunch in our brains at a special time.

471
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,960
I'm hungry.

472
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,780
Hungry for lunch.

473
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,260
For decent thoughts.

474
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,700
Yes, well, they will flow like a never-lapsing flood come X-Day.

475
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,720
Sandwiched between the knees of the individuals who are ruptured up.

476
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:52,380
Yes, if you have mustered the intellectual acumen to deal with this cosmic sandwich, let us imagine that we can.

477
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,280
I've got the mustard, Sergeant. I've got the mustard.

478
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,780
How we will laugh at our primitive ideologies.

479
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:08,820
We will laugh at the ideas of organization and order when we are freed from them ecstatically in one snapping moment, like the breaking of ice in a thaw.

480
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:23,440
Suddenly, our spirits, let free from the gross bonds of matter, shall leap forward and upward into their new forms, at the same time ecstatically commingling with our alien concubines.

481
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,200
Well, you sound, you talk pretty under St. Louis Hooley.

482
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,660
I'm just...

483
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,360
I'm just reeling off the usual subgenius palafre.

484
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,220
What?

485
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,280
And we've spent our entire professional careers selling this clabber.

486
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,620
Work for me.

487
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:49,000
Yes, and it is now payday. It's now almost X-Day.

488
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,640
And what sort of mustard have you mustered?

489
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,100
Yes, listener, listener, what have you mustered?

490
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,440
Even this could be a controversial subject, you realize.

491
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,740
Oh, everything's controversial now that everyone's addicted to controversy.

492
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:16,320
Well, remember, just recently, the Republicans had a ragegasm because Obama ordered Dijon mustard on his hot dog.

493
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:25,900
And they went on and on about his namby-pamby, sissy, elitist ways, and he wouldn't have good old American French's mustard.

494
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,660
They really made a big thing out of it.

495
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,640
So, since the subject...

496
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:41,900
The subject of mustard is now being offered, I simply thought it was appropriate to warn our listeners that we are about to embark on seas of controversy.

497
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,720
It was well put, and there's all the collateral damages right next to it.

498
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,400
Everything's in perfect order.

499
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,060
It makes sense to me.

500
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:57,920
And I can see President Obama needs to understand why he should have good old French's mustard instead of a French mustard.

501
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,060
Mm-hmm.

502
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,980
Well, curiously enough, French's mustard is not French.

503
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,320
Nor are French fries French, but named after Mr. French.

504
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:14,120
But, naturally, Dijon mustard is, well, obviously, French.

505
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,680
Would you like some Grey Poupon, your Grey Poupon?

506
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,800
On your fruit and fries, monsieur?

507
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,180
Hey, hey.

508
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:21,860
Oh-ho.

509
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,980
Oh-ho.

510
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,460
Oui, oui.

511
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,080
Do-do.

512
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,220
I will meet you on the field of honor.

513
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,860
You have insulted me.

514
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,740
Gravely.

515
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,420
The mayonnaise on the French fries.

516
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,880
Hold still while I pink your cheeks.

517
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,280
Yeah.

518
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,060
And take my glove into the bargain.

519
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,240
I'm not a teacher.

520
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,240
I'm going to be doing the cheek on the back of your head.

521
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,640
Reverend Stang will act as my second.

522
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,380
Le jour de gloire est arrivé.

523
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,100
Actually, that could never...

524
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,820
Yeah, the day of glory here.

525
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,680
In good hands.

526
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,720
Right, right.

527
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,760
It's happening.

528
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,860
The day of glory is happening.

529
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:03,720
Yep.

530
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,460
Ex-day le jour de gloire est arrivé.

531
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,420
Yeah.

532
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,340
You know, guys, I was actually just now looking at my...

533
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,860
The website that I put on here, subgenius.com,

534
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,380
and on the events, the ex-day page,

535
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,540
I've realized I really...

536
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,400
Now that it's about to happen tomorrow,

537
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,740
I need to go in and remove some of these promises.

538
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,360
Well, for once...

539
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,700
Some of them are simple.

540
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,040
There's a sort of a costume ball on Saturday,

541
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,020
and it always had a theme.

542
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,480
Yes.

543
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,180
The theme was going to be dead rock stars this time.

544
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,520
It was going to, but it's been changed.

545
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,160
Yeah, we decided to throw,

546
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,580
along with the schedule and everything else...

547
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,860
Is it a costumeless ball?

548
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,060
It's a themeless ball.

549
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,440
A themeless.

550
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,120
It's a name-your-own-theme, right?

551
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,020
Yeah, name-your-own-theme ball.

552
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,820
I'm sure there'll be some dead rock stars there.

553
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,760
Theme ball.

554
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,720
I was thinking about...

555
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,240
Theme ball.

556
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,780
I was thinking,

557
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,800
what would be the easiest...

558
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,660
What rock star do I look like?

559
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,420
And I was thinking,

560
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,560
well, Jim Morrison, if he didn't die,

561
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,040
but actually went away to Africa for all these years

562
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,140
and then died just yesterday.

563
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,360
I could pass for that.

564
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,760
Leonard Skintone.

565
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,120
I find that hard to follow.

566
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,540
I'm sorry.

567
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,540
We promised a 24-7 bad film grindhouse,

568
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,320
and that will still happen.

569
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:24,860
Oh, boy.

570
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,900
I can't wait.

571
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,480
But it'll be...

572
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,340
It'll be...

573
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:28,620
It'll be...

574
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:28,720
It'll be...

575
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:28,780
It'll be...

576
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:28,780


577
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:28,780


578
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:28,780


579
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:28,780


580
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:28,780


581
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,020
It'll be...

582
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,120
And it won't be 24-7.

583
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,220
Mine, specifically.

584
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,340
It'll be on stage

585
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,580
when there isn't a radio show happening live, right?

586
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,520
Yeah, for the two hours a day

587
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,960
that we're not doing future hours of slack there.

588
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,840
At any time in the focus group,

589
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,360
do you ever say,

590
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,500
brothers and sisters,

591
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,340
gather around me.

592
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,340
I've got a story to tell.

593
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,180
And then you pull down your pants.

594
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,380
And then we dance.

595
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,480
We do our folk dances,

596
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,780
our subgenius folk dances.

597
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,140
Who knows, who cares,

598
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,740
who wears the pairs of dead man's pants

599
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,880
that dance in the darkness of the sun.

600
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,160
Yes, we throw everything to the winds.

601
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,200
And look at Oscar,

602
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,420
standing in the middle.

603
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,520
He has the strongest legs of all of them.

604
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,020
He dances twice as quickly.

605
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,520
Ah, spin in a twirl.

606
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,300
And a little jump backwards.

607
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,080
And now he grabs both ladies with each foot.

608
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,000
He's hungry.

609
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,620
And now,

610
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,800
la bobochaska.

611
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,780
La bobochaska.

612
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,660
La bobochaska.

613
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,920
There's a few new things on the X-Day non-schedule here.

614
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,820
We've added a loudest yeti contest.

615
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,340
That's probably already viral.

616
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,400
We'll hear the cry of the bull ape,

617
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,020
usually evoked by Lord Greystoke

618
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,420
with one foot on his panting victim.

619
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,880
Krieger, bundelo!

620
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,460
A mass eating contest

621
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,280
with a scrapple toss,

622
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,680
a pancake orgy,

623
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,940
frop beating,

624
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,780
and time killing.

625
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,440
A lot of time killing.

626
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,340
A scrapple toss?

627
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,220
I didn't know you had Philly's Favorite there,

628
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,320
down there in Southern Ohio.

629
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,540
Oh, we've got all sorts of things down there.

630
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,740
There'll be sideshow marvels.

631
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,920
And sideshow.

632
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,740
The circus apocalypse,

633
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,140
Andrew the Impaled,

634
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,220
will be there.

635
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,840
They are on their way.

636
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,020
Andrew wrote me and said,

637
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,900
who do I have to talk to about stage time?

638
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,480
And I said,

639
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,800
no one.

640
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,680
Just start up.

641
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,840
There is no organization.

642
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,680
Only your own,

643
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,320
own instinct will

644
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,560
take care of you on stage.

645
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,380
But does that mean,

646
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,540
Reverend Stang,

647
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
as long as we are on this,

648
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,440
perhaps distressful subject,

649
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,320
that there is no stage manager

650
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,900
at any time?

651
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,120
That they are fighting with

652
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,540
boxing gloves and brass knuckles

653
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,880
for preeminence on the stage?

654
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,700
That's the show, man.

655
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,660
All right.

656
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,340
That's the whole idea.

657
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,500
It's going to be like organic.

658
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,420
I want to play.

659
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,580
My band's going to play now.

660
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,560
No, I thought my band,

661
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,500
my band was going to play now.

662
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,860
Life is to the fittest.

663
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,640
The win is the creation

664
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,600
of the creation of X Day 2016, man.

665
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,600
It's just that simple.

666
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,880
Spontaneous doctor band combustion.

667
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,660
There'll be a troll shoot.

668
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,400
All the subgenius concepts

669
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,080
that are banned elsewhere

670
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,920
will be squirting out

671
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,740
all over the place.

672
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,760
Excitement.

673
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,640
Oozing off the stage.

674
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,720
That's lovely.

675
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,660
That one guy will puke.

676
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,400
And pass out in the road again.

677
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,320
That's a promise that's easy to keep.

678
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
At least he won't relieve himself

679
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,320
inside the podium this time.

680
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,620
Not this time, I hope.

681
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,500
That podium is still here.

682
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,940
That's why I got Dr. Dark

683
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,280
to carry the podium this time.

684
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,740
The pulpit.

685
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,560
Wouldn't want it in the vehicle

686
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,340
with us as we approach the site.

687
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,740
It is motorized, though, isn't it?

688
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,660
Isn't the pulpit motorized?

689
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,460
There's some sort of equipment

690
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,180
in the back.

691
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,140
It's been stripped over the years

692
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,900
and rebuilt.

693
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,540
It's been rebuilt.

694
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:57,640
It's been rebuilt.

695
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:57,640


696
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:57,640


697
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:57,640


698
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:57,640


699
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:57,640


700
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:57,640


701
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:57,640


702
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:57,640


703
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,720
Some who couldn't understand

704
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,120
its intricate mechanism

705
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,520
harmed it with their

706
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,540
primitive attempts to repair it.

707
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,520
Well, it has...

708
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,680
The flagellants, I think,

709
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,360
was the main...

710
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,440
It still has wheels.

711
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,320
Yes.

712
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,240
It still has wheels

713
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,660
and it bends in the middle

714
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,260
at the rubber hinge

715
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,720
so that the preacher can lean

716
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,960
right into the face

717
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,920
of the congregation.

718
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,280
That was Mark Mothersbaugh's

719
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,980
idea, by the way.

720
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,040
And the sounding board.

721
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,400
But it has to be pushed around

722
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,360
by minions.

723
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,760
It no longer can be driven

724
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,560
by the preacher.

725
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,020
Just the merest touch

726
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,760
of the lash

727
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,460
gets those little bodies

728
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,040
scurrying to put it

729
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,800
where it belongs.

730
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,040
We shouldn't have taken it

731
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,740
to Burning Man.

732
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,600
No, that wrecks everything.

733
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,680
That desert destroys

734
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
all mechanisms and machines.

735
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,960
They are destructive out there.

736
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,620
They will do...

737
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,640
They will mess your machines

738
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,600
right to well.

739
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,880
It's the alkaline dust itself,

740
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,080
which is the equivalent of acid

741
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,220
only on the other side

742
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,540
of the chemical continuum.

743
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,100
The plioflor.

744
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,320
It gets in things.

745
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,460
It gets in.

746
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,220
Everything.

747
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,840
And I mean everything.

748
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,540
It will give you plioflip

749
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,160
if you try walking around on it.

750
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,860
Take away things when they do.

751
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,700
There will be human fights,

752
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,440
acubating, psychic surgery,

753
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,860
bobby roping,

754
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,360
private adult sex hurt seminars,

755
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,160
bonobo chimp goblin contests,

756
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,600
and oddly normal seeming people.

757
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,900
They're the worst.

758
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,120
And, uh, of course...

759
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,940
Yeah, but they're the...

760
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,560
But, uh,

761
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:27,560


762
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:27,560


763
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:27,620
but, uh, but, uh, but, uh, but, uh,

764
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,680
although it may seem highly scheduled,

765
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,160
it's not as if your helicopter parents

766
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,200
arranged the whole thing.

767
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,880
There's plenty of time

768
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,080
just for good old goofing off

769
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,760
and scratching and spitting

770
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,680
and setting and lying

771
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,600
and munching and wandering

772
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,020
and, you know, unscheduled.

773
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,960
Swimming in the old swimming hole

774
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,640
with old sequoias.

775
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,340
As long as apparently

776
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,880
you don't allow any molecule of water

777
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,400
to get in any of your orifices.

778
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,800
Um, yes, all those things

779
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,620
can and will be

780
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,300
will happen.

781
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,700
What is the name of the virus

782
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,020
against Zinicula or something?

783
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,660
Oh, it's the brain-eating amoeba.

784
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,960
Oh, no, that's another one.

785
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,760
So I should look that up

786
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,400
and get it right.

787
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,200
And there's also the

788
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,820
Zinicula virus?

789
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,600
Neferticula.

790
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,920
Zarticula?

791
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,980
Uh, Reverend Stang

792
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,640
will look it up on his device.

793
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,400
Yeah.

794
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,080
Then we will know the answer.

795
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,740
Don't look at Reverend Stang's device.

796
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,040
Don't look at it.

797
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,440
What will happen if we look at it?

798
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,620
I can't even find it.

799
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,720
You may be enthralled.

800
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,680
You may be entrapped.

801
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,120
You may be whisked away

802
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,620
to a place you don't want to go.

803
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,300
Well, no, I'm not so sure

804
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,580
that that's necessarily going to happen.

805
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,980
As long as we...

806
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,860
We'll just tow the line

807
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,080
and stay on the straight and narrow path.

808
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,140
And if we start to slide,

809
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,880
we'll give a little whistle.

810
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,040
Yeah, that's what we'll do.

811
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,980
Well, here at the, um...

812
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,140
The ask...

813
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,440
Here at the heavy crashing,

814
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,660
in the bushes of some rough beast.

815
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,900
That rough beast would be

816
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,540
the Naegleria fowleri.

817
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,920
There you go.

818
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,500
The Ask Dr. Stang show

819
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,680
has the answer.

820
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,340
Naegleria fowleri.

821
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,400
Remember this little fella.

822
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,060
It's a fowl.

823
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,180
And he's named after the demon

824
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,220
of the subgenus.

825
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,180
Is that actually a word written

826
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,480
or two written backwards?

827
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,940
It is a genus and species name.

828
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,520
Of what?

829
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,220
Of a little amoeba

830
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,300
that climbs into your amygdala

831
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,440
and takes a big bite, chiller.

832
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,200
This does exist.

833
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,380
This amoeba does exist.

834
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,860
I'm afraid it exists

835
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,060
in the pond.

836
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,100
The huge, depthless pond

837
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,720
that is the place

838
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,200
where the baptism also

839
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,560
is performed.

840
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,880
Except...

841
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,540
Except when, as the sign indicates,

842
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,460
it's bottom.

843
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,740
It's bottom.

844
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,160
I've seen those ladies too.

845
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,080
Mm-hmm.

846
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,900
Well, that tends to happen,

847
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,700
but no one has plumbed

848
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,620
the utter depths

849
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,720
of old Sequa's pond.

850
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,220
Well, you guys could dress up

851
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,420
in funny suits and everything

852
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,520
and film it and everything.

853
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,820
No, we have that covered, yeah.

854
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,700
And go down.

855
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,980
Oh, yeah, you're going to do

856
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,520
a few hours on that?

857
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,040
Well, however long it takes

858
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,380
for the, you know,

859
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,420
to provide coverage, as they call it.

860
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,340
Well, if it's bottomless,

861
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,340
I think it's going to take

862
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,620
a long time to get somewhere.

863
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,240
Well, we're not going down there.

864
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,820
That's where old Sequa lurks

865
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,840
at the bottom.

866
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,460
The campground used to be

867
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,620
a strip mine,

868
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,460
so there's tunnels and mines

869
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,060
that go so deep

870
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,160
that they break through

871
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,680
to ancient caverns

872
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,380
that are prehistoric.

873
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,160
And not only that,

874
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,760
isn't there some sort of race

875
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,740
of frog men or amphibian men?

876
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:51,980
Well...

877
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,100
According to that map,

878
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,800
the Loveland amphibious men...

879
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,180
Oh, that's right.

880
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,860
Well...

881
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,480
They are another Ohio group of cryptids.

882
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,840
Isn't it close to where

883
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,320
the big floods were in West Virginia?

884
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,180
Not that close.

885
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,320
There was some flooding in Marietta,

886
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,600
which is not too far away.

887
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
No, it actually isn't very far away,

888
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,440
but a river doesn't run through it.

889
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,040
The Ohio River is far away from it, then.

890
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,580
Now, there's rumors

891
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,760
about strange creatures

892
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,420
out in the woods.

893
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,060
But,

894
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,160
but,

895
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,180


896
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,980
some of them aren't rumors at all.

897
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,560
I mean, for instance,

898
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,860
the Candiru toad,

899
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,500
those are real.

900
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,660
You don't want to...

901
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,800
Yeah, those are a bad thing,

902
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,280
but you have to be careful.

903
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,040
It's like when you're snorkeling

904
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,660
or scuba diving.

905
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,100
You're in an alien world.

906
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,700
It's better that you respect

907
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,720
all the life forms that you see

908
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,600
and not just assume

909
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,420
they're there for your loutish amusement.

910
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,180
And then you'll be all right,

911
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,620
probably.

912
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,120
And some...

913
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:54,780
Probably.

914
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,980
We have probably...

915
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,520
We have.

916
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,820
Even to mention them

917
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,280
would create great difficulties

918
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,540
for us now,

919
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:01,980
since this subject

920
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,100
has become controversial

921
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,040
in the latter days.

922
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,240
Are there not 2,000-year-old

923
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,040
Indian mounds as well

924
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,960
in that same area?

925
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,200
Yes, they are.

926
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:12,940
They're most certainly are.

927
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,460
They're shaped like the giant turtle

928
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,220
and other things that were...

929
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,700
Now, those are the ones

930
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,020
that the people that live

931
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,460
at the Wisteria campground made.

932
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,360
Dave is talking about actual Indians.

933
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,500
The Serpent Mound is in that area.

934
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:26,800
The Serpent Mound is in that area

935
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,800
and other actual Indian mounds

936
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,600
are in that area of southern Ohio.

937
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,580
John Keel's old buddy Mothman

938
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,280
lives not far away,

939
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,980
just on the other side

940
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,340
of the West Virginia border.

941
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,940
There have been pilgrimages

942
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,280
made there during...

943
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,660
What about Athens, Ohio?

944
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,080
Isn't there some strange legend

945
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,580
associated with that place?

946
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,800
Well, that's where the...

947
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,560
The Ohio University is.

948
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,620
The wise philosophers

949
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,020
sit around in togas

950
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,140
and booger young students.

951
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,480
Yeah.

952
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,180
Athens.

953
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,980
That's where many of the baby chameleons

954
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,040
first went to school.

955
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,640
We didn't know each other then.

956
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,440
Their shed skins litter the ground.

957
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,640
Multicolored, though.

958
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:10,960
They're pretty.

959
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,060
Pretty. Very pretty.

960
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:12,540
Yeah.

961
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,400
Well, let's see.

962
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,880
What bands are we going to have at X Day?

963
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,920
Let's see.

964
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,740
Is Hypercube a band?

965
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,840
What about Reverend Angry Larry?

966
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,840
Is he going to be there?

967
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,980
Well, Reverend Angry Larry

968
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,980
is most...

969
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,760
He's the head of the bands.

970
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,760
Well, then...

971
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,340
Let's face it.

972
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,760
Then we've got it covered.

973
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,080
If he's going to be there...

974
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,720
Reverend Sex Mortis,

975
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,120
or Sinfaltibus Ex Mortis,

976
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,020
actually is his name.

977
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,740
His band, X Day,

978
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,540
and the Ex Mortis Experience,

979
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,140
they'll be there,

980
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:42,880
and they'll be bringing

981
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,900
the drum set.

982
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,220
That's always important.

983
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,580
The drumsticks,

984
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,680
the thighs,

985
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,660
the backs,

986
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,200
the wings.

987
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,000
My band,

988
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,420
Vulcan Jedi Mentat,

989
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,900
will be playing.

990
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,180
And, of course,

991
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,560
Pooh Water Towel.

992
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,360
Doctors for Wotan, per se,

993
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,460
won't be there this year

994
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,140
because Philo and Chaosmic

995
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,340
are moving.

996
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,540
Yes.

997
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,880
They're moving towards Wisteria,

998
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,360
but they're doing

999
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,280
a little too slowly.

1000
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,040
But they'll...

1001
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,420
They're moving all of their stuff.

1002
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,800
...be spiritually present.

1003
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:15,440
Yeah.

1004
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,800
But that means I have to do

1005
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,500
all of the Doctors for Wotan

1006
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,980
lyrics myself.

1007
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,320
Luckily...

1008
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,540
With your nasal drip,

1009
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,120
I can just...

1010
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,100
Just imagine the problems

1011
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:26,840
that's going to cause.

1012
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,040
Oh, I got my nose flute.

1013
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,560
In fact, I think I have it

1014
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,400
with me right now.

1015
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,040
That's quite all right,

1016
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:32,400
staying.

1017
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,980
No demonstration is necessary.

1018
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,820
Get that thing out.

1019
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,080
Get that nose flute.

1020
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,240
I'm right here.

1021
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,120
Oh, well, I suppose so.

1022
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,500
I vote aye.

1023
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,920
I mean, get ready.

1024
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,380
All right.

1025
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,220
This is going to be

1026
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,400
a real snorter,

1027
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,340
ladies and gentlemen.

1028
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,760
Oh, there it is.

1029
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,620
I do a really good job.

1030
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,880
Okay, now we're going to hear

1031
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,660
Reverend staying on the nose flute

1032
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,040
playing splatted over it.

1033
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,720
Which is eczema cantata

1034
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,820
in G flat.

1035
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,660
I've never heard a flatter G

1036
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,420
in my life.

1037
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,360
Sounds like A flat sharp.

1038
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,440
Oh, that sounds like

1039
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,700
a disturbed mind right there.

1040
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,180
Those are the reflections.

1041
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,320
Perhaps disturbed,

1042
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,040
but one aflame

1043
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,900
with musical inspiration.

1044
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,080
One which can C sharp

1045
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,380
and B natural.

1046
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,040
I can play the silver flute,

1047
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,000
but I've never mastered

1048
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,640
the nose flute.

1049
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,780
Oh, we're doctors.

1050
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,000
Doctors for Bob.

1051
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,240
Doctors for Bob

1052
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,100
and everything real in my life.

1053
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,440
Yes.

1054
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,600
Doctors for Bob.

1055
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,380
That darn pickup truck

1056
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,360
done run over my wife.

1057
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,740
Doctors for Bob.

1058
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,540
Oh, boy.

1059
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,420
I can see this whole crew

1060
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,420
of the mental case

1061
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,840
is all about to get ready

1062
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,860
to do this thing.

1063
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,620
They're doing it.

1064
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:54,620


1065
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:54,620


1066
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:54,620


1067
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:54,620


1068
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:54,620


1069
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:54,620


1070
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:54,620


1071
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:54,960
They do.

1072
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,940
It's very, very strange.

1073
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,240
I'm glad I come here

1074
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,000
first year of 19 February.

1075
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,780
I think it was my grandfather

1076
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,980
actually said he's going

1077
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,140
to settle in Boston.

1078
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,460
And then he goes to Wisteria

1079
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,360
for the South Genius X-Day.

1080
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,720
Branches of Wisteria

1081
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,560
circumscribe a golden grin.

1082
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,680
Yes, we can satirize ourselves,

1083
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,140
make fun of our own foibles

1084
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,680
and cantrips.

1085
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,160
Sacred cow!

1086
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,620
They're making fun of us!

1087
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,700
Our holy cows!

1088
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,000
Sacred blue.

1089
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,720
Well, now,

1090
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,380
you know,

1091
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,660
one man's

1092
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,900
cattle

1093
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,240
is another man's

1094
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,080
joke.

1095
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,340
It's not your ox

1096
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,940
that is being grown.

1097
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,820
He who the ox to wrath

1098
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,500
hath moved

1099
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,880
shall never be by woman loved.

1100
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,720
Keep them bobbies rolling.

1101
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,560
Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1102
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:51,340
Hi!

1103
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,980
Don't try to understand him.

1104
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,620
Just watch.

1105
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,800
Whooping, rolling, branding.

1106
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,580
Soon they'll be buried

1107
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,900
by Bob's side.

1108
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,540
I'm stuck in that pond.

1109
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,980
Get me out of here.

1110
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,680
My phone's calculating.

1111
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,660
Dr. Sinister will be waiting.

1112
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,760
Be waiting at the end

1113
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,880
of this ride.

1114
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,360
Roll hide!

1115
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,700
Roll hide!

1116
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,840
Through rain and wind

1117
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,580
and weather,

1118
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,140
hell,

1119
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,620
bent for leather.

1120
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,900
Wishing my gal

1121
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,460
was at my side.

1122
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,400
Oh,

1123
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,420
it's long enough.

1124
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,460
At any moment now,

1125
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,040
the gals

1126
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,000
from out of sight

1127
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,960
head them up.

1128
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,280
Move them out.

1129
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
And here's this day, lovely.

1130
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,020
Our typical, famous,

1131
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,060
lovely woman

1132
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:44,920
from another world.

1133
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:45,700
Jane?

1134
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,420
Yes?

1135
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:47,780
Jane?

1136
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,940
So you're from

1137
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,200
another world, eh?

1138
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:52,920
Yes, yes.

1139
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,000
You're from another world, eh, Jane?

1140
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:54,320
Have,

1141
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,140
are coming here

1142
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,180
to visit the humans

1143
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,540
on planet Earth

1144
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,380
on its last morning?

1145
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,420
Jane?

1146
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,280
Uh-huh.

1147
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:03,520
What?

1148
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:04,840
Where's we?

1149
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,000
We is here.

1150
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,560
Where are we?

1151
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,320
Where is we?

1152
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,360
Where are we?

1153
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,140
We are here.

1154
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,920
We has spoken.

1155
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,080
We are there.

1156
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,420
We'll start it up again, all right?

1157
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,500
I am the woman

1158
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,140
from another world.

1159
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,360
Jane says that she's here

1160
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,240
because, Jane?

1161
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,900
Oh, yes, yes.

1162
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,440
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,

1163
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,140
Oh, nobody would believe

1164
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,800
that one, Dr. Stang.

1165
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,460
I'm not paying attention.

1166
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,060
Sorry.

1167
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,880
Yes, remember.

1168
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,600
I'm so excited about X-Day.

1169
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,560
It's been predicted

1170
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,020
for millennia

1171
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,680
and is inscribed

1172
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,560
in the Great Pyramid

1173
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,360
along with the sarcophagus

1174
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,160
of the crumbling mummies

1175
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,280
of ancient Egypt.

1176
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,160
In the navel of the universe.

1177
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,760
It's also inscribed

1178
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,840
on a cherry pie

1179
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,040
that was made yesterday,

1180
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,460
the traditional annual

1181
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,300
X-Day,

1182
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,240
title pie.

1183
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,800
Already partially devoured

1184
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,480
in a ceremony

1185
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,820
that you wouldn't want

1186
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,820
to be present at.

1187
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,300
Yes, that pie

1188
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,740
has partially gone down

1189
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,640
the gullets

1190
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,680
of deserving subgeniuses.

1191
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,820
I wasn't one of them, man.

1192
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,040
I like cherry pie.

1193
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,180
Why didn't you tell me

1194
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:13,920
about that?

1195
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,220
You have to have

1196
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,620
the strength of faith.

1197
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,940
You've got to believe.

1198
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,160
I believe,

1199
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,280
but I don't know

1200
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,100
what I believe in.

1201
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:23,940
You see,

1202
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,360
in ancient Egypt,

1203
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,860
if you took the spiritual journey

1204
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,640
in the solar boat

1205
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,820
over the river of darkness

1206
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,420
in which the evil crocodile god

1207
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:38,100
lurked ready to snap up your soul,

1208
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,740
you would be restored and reborn,

1209
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,160
just as Isis raised Osiris

1210
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,820
from the dead

1211
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,080
after he was chopped up

1212
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,760
in little tiny pieces.

1213
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,100
Pieces?

1214
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,920
Yes, it's all been done

1215
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,380
over and over again,

1216
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,440
but finally these crude legends

1217
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,080
will reach an exquisite enactment,

1218
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,340
all on seven o'clock,

1219
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,180
although some say 7.05 a.m.

1220
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,440
on July 5th,

1221
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,660
in a year which only we know

1222
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,560
is 1998.

1223
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,080
Edgar Cayce said it would be 1998,

1224
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,240
and Nostradamus said it would be July 5th.

1225
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,840
How can we go wrong?

1226
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,540
I mean, those guys knew their onions.

1227
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,400
You're going to argue with the pros and cons.

1228
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:29,920
What is consensus?

1229
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,020
Two of the greatest seers of all time,

1230
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,100
each with their own conditionary

1231
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,100
and their own methods,

1232
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,800
left by followers of Mr. Howell.

1233
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,220
They could only do

1234
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,160
what they were compelled to do

1235
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,520
by their inner natures.

1236
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,420
Predict.

1237
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,280
What did you just say?

1238
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,640
Do I have to bleep that?

1239
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,480
Predictably.

1240
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,580
Predictably.

1241
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,160
Postdictably.

1242
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,800
Do you need to redact that?

1243
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,340
No one needs to redact a prediction here,

1244
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,660
not even the dateline for dominance,

1245
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:06,060
which is always shown the way,

1246
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,900
like a lantern in a dark cavern.

1247
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,820
What about the dateline for dominance?

1248
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,800
Did it not predict all along

1249
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,220
this jagged course of events

1250
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,880
which will unavoidably end

1251
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,060
in the great clandestine?

1252
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:21,400
The climax.

1253
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,280
A dumbass will run for president.

1254
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,160
Boy, that's what I was just going to say.

1255
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,100
Yeah, who could ever figure that out?

1256
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,120
Did it mention Donald Trump?

1257
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,700
Yeah, that's what I was thinking also.

1258
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,200
Well, unenlightened scribes and authorities

1259
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,800
thought it was some reference to Donald Duck,

1260
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,400
but it turns out to be Donald Trump.

1261
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,600
But that's the nature of prophecy.

1262
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,840
It's not really able to be comprehended

1263
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,560
until it finally happens

1264
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,760
in such an obvious way.

1265
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:55,520
Bob indicated that the alien space god Jehovah One

1266
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,120
tended to mumble at times,

1267
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,360
so sometimes the exact wording of prophecy

1268
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,500
was a little unclear.

1269
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,300
He was senile even then

1270
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,420
when the Sons of Mourning sung,

1271
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,820
and he hung the great stars in the heavens

1272
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,060
and set the earth on its foundations

1273
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,500
and bid the weltering waves

1274
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,320
their oozy channel keep.

1275
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,820
He was old even then,

1276
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,040
and now he's absolutely old.

1277
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,720
He's absolutely senile and a danger to the continuum.

1278
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,160
Hence the subgenius war on God.

1279
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,160
Yeah, there's some kind of a maybe facility

1280
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,900
for old gods, you know, where he could go

1281
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,300
and at least people would take care of him,

1282
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,960
let him go to the bathroom once in a while.

1283
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,280
I mean, just think of the poor guy losing his wits,

1284
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,700
and he's just still trying to run the universe.

1285
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,040
Eric von Donikens, Nursing Homes of the Gods.

1286
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,520
Yes, they're all there.

1287
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,740
Those aged deities,

1288
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,640
a whole lot of trouble for their followers.

1289
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,460
Some you've never heard of,

1290
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,320
but they demand constant slavish attention.

1291
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,300
Hey, we're gonna have a firework.

1292
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,020
...assisted living...

1293
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:10,780
Like Ugabalus, who was a god in ancient Poseidonus,

1294
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,200
which Plato called Atlantis.

1295
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,860
Yes, this three-horned, one-eyed god

1296
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,740
who wore a double diadem.

1297
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,760
Now, no one...

1298
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,580
...remembers.

1299
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:26,200
And fishes swim in front of his blind brow.

1300
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,280
But he's gonna be there demanding a piece of the action

1301
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,340
with all the rest.

1302
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,620
They'll probably be in the pond

1303
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,140
waiting for what's-his-name, the turtle.

1304
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,640
I'm glad I won't have to supervise it.

1305
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,700
Well, you may be recruited and have to do that.

1306
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,820
Say, boys, in this time continuum,

1307
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,340
we're about five minutes from end of show, and yet...

1308
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,740
That, too, was predicted by the...

1309
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,740
...the ancient Egyptians.

1310
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,060
And yet in another...

1311
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,860
...in yet a different time continuum,

1312
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:00,200
the other stations will experience this

1313
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,640
in a more chopped-up manner.

1314
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,680
But here, in this time continuum in Cleveland,

1315
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,300
we're going to stay in the station for the next two hours...

1316
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,960
And on station...

1317
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,580
...with the noble...

1318
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,920
...for the Church of the Subgenius.

1319
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,740
...Dr. Sinister, who normally would be playing terrible music...

1320
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:16,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1321
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,700
...for the next hour, but it's gonna be us...

1322
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,460
Terrible dialogue and...

1323
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:20,740
...and we're gonna be playing instead.

1324
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,500
But...

1325
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,860
And this happens as...

1326
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,420
It's like cosmic time, like the eclipse that was supposed to come in 2017,

1327
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:33,520
which would come if astronomy was allowed to be left alone by the Exists.

1328
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,220
Like that, this has happened in a regular pattern

1329
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,580
and will now happen again for the last time.

1330
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,020
Well, what I'm trying to do is get you guys to say goodbye

1331
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,620
for about ten minutes while I do my technical thing,

1332
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,160
and Dr. Sinister does his technical thing.

1333
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,560
I hope you like this story, boys and girls.

1334
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,820
If you would like a free picture of me in the nude,

1335
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,340
write to Aunt Bertha.

1336
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,100
Dial a story.

1337
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,020
Box 1, Grand Rapids, Michigan.

1338
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,640
Goodbye now.

1339
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:08,980
Goodbye.

1340
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,120
Okay, Dave, you're gonna call back in about ten minutes,

1341
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,620
which will seem like an entire week...

1342
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,280
...to the other...

1343
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,600
...to our noble other station, such as...

1344
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:18,600


1345
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:24,360
...which is WREK Atlanta and WORT and so forth.

1346
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,780
Thank you for taking the time to call back in ten minutes.

1347
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,200
And I'm going to get out, as it were,

1348
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:36,060
by playing a Rudy Schwartz cover of a Swinging Love Corpses song.

1349
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,440
Yes, the Swinging Love Corpses' sweet song,

1350
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,840
Pick a Booger,

1351
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:47,200
performed by the great Rudy Schwartz Project, coming up.

1352
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,580
Friends, this has been Andy.

1353
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,060
We're live now on the hour of Slack number 1,576

1354
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,740

1355

For more information, see subgenius.com.

1356
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:02,980
And we'll be talking to you in a soon time, Dave, time.

1357
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1358
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:08,220
And then I think I push play on something.

1380
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:04,700


1381
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,120
Like a poker

1382
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,360
So you're driving in your car and you're looking at your neighbor

1383
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,320
Minding nuggets from his nostril like he's savoring the labor

1384
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,160
He's pulling, he's tugging, he's yanking on a string

1385
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,180
It's a long slimy thing still connected to his brain

1386
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,100
Pick a poker, pick a poker

1387
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,740
Pick a poker, pick a poker

1388
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,860
Pick a poker

1389
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,680
It's a long slimy thing still connected to his brain

1390
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:10,680


1391
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,580
Picked a poker

1392
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:16,160
Pick a poker

1393
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:30,700
It's a long slimy thing still connected to his brain

1394
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,120
Pumpin' out of Livia from deep inside his sinus

1395
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,000
Slave to the master, he's a royal highness

1396
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,980
The kids all wanna have a hint crustaceans

1397
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,560
Cause the Pick-a-Booger Boogie is the new sensation

1398
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,740
He holds it, he rolls it, he's checkin' it for hairs

1399
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,600
He flicks it away, but he's lookin' debonair

1400
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,560
A green one on his finger, he's been flickin' it for days

1401
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,640
Pick-a-Booger Boogie, it's the new dance craze

1402
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,560
Pick-a-Booger, Pick-a-Booger

1403
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,020
Pick-a-Booger, Pick-a-Booger
