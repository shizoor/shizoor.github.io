1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,780
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,460
Then we dip them in the sacred waters of the slot.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,700
And what exactly does this do for them?

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:21,080
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned and prepares their mind for the slate-like impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,380
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of slot.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,240
Slot, slot, slot.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,020
Slot, slot, slot.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,340
Slot, slot, slot.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,560
Slot, slot, slot.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,720
Slot, slot, slot.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,540
Slot, slot, slot.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,440
Slot, slot, slot.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,580
Slot.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:53,820
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,720
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,240
That's your key phrase.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,800
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:22,540
Driven to the brink of false sanity by the conspiracy's false reality and the pressure of a crumbling world?

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,920
Then this may be for you.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,280
Eternal salvation.

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,740
Eternal salvation.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,080
Or triple your money back.

23
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,400
Triple your money back.

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,940
Ah, yes, dear friends.

25
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,320
This is hour of slack number 1800.

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,020
Nice even number.

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:56,400
And, uh, well, I know I promised that this would be a new episode, but instead it's one from 1786 shows ago.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,740
Hour of slack.

29
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,160
Number 14.

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,200
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is out of the hospital, finally, and living with a friend.

31
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,760
But now I'm the one who's laid up.

32
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:20,840
I, uh, well, I was healthy enough to get a big riding mower stuck in a little ditch.

33
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:28,060
And I was stupid enough, or, well, we prefer the term subgenius enough, and just strong enough.

34
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,260
To push the mower out of the ditch.

35
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,740
Which didn't even hurt at the time.

36
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,960
Despite my, uh, spinal arthritis.

37
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,480
However, the next day I couldn't really get out of bed hardly.

38
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:50,880
That was a week ago, and I spent most of that week all hopped up on non-prescription pain meds.

39
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,940
And with, uh, electro-stimulo pads on my lower back and a back brace.

40
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,500
And heating pads.

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,980
And warm, furry breasts.

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,680
I mean, uh, beasts piled up atop me in my bed.

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,860
And I was binging on goofy shows.

44
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,720
I'm fine now.

45
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,380
In fact, by coincidence, I recently had an annual health checkup and blood test.

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,900
And aside from my spine being 67 years old, I'm ironically in weirdly good shape.

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,700
According to the numbers.

48
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,840
But I still can't sit at a desk as long as a brand new show would require.

49
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,880
And I'm behind on other stuff, so I'm gonna cheat for one more week.

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:45,220
This rerun, however, is about as atypical an hour of slack as you'll ever hear.

51
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,800
Uh, the six-year-old co-star, by the way, is now 40.

52
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,940
And an actual movie director.

53
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,760
Probably spotting.

54
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,900
The Church of the Subgenius.

55
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:20,840
Bring you another 33 minutes of condensed, uraglic functions over the quality audio-visual techniques exacerbated and complicated by The Church of the Subgenius.

58
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,820
Oh, Dr. Sperbaum.

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,740
Folks, I'm afraid you'll have to say goodnight to the good music.

60
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,120
For a little while, for the next hour anyway.

61
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,420
This is the Subgenius Family Hour tonight, folks.

62
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:50,640
Yes, tonight, as not promised, is the Subgenius Hour of Slack sound effects special, The Kids Show.

63
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,880
Starring Negative Land and that great adventure team, Captain Sun-Sol.

64
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,120
So, it's thehu-nson and daddy.

65
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,320
So, go wake up your kids.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,780
Or you can tape this thing and, uh, but if you do, uh, get it in stereo.

67
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,880
And use headphones.

68
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,640
This is the headphones show.

69
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,540
THE headphones show.

70
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,780
Uh, before I go on, God, I hope these machines work.

71
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,900
Um, before I go on, I must publicly thank the Smith Zombies.

72
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,780
There were a number of Smith Zombies in the Industrial Laboratory all night tonight.

73
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:32,180
night putting stamps on little pamphlets that are going to China this time, subgenius pamphlets.

74
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,400
We'll give our address at the end of the broadcast where you can write for one of these

75
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,160
heartbreaking and blessing new pamphlets. But, well, everybody in the subgenius church is mad

76
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,320
at me now, so I had to get a new co-host for the show. He's only six years old, so we had to change

77
00:05:47,320 --> 00:06:00,820
the format just a little. This is the new co-host. This is KNON 90.90.N. FM. FM. In Dallas, Texas.

78
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:08,160
In Dallas, Texas. This is Doug Smith, radio operator. I'm going to bring you a piece of that

79
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:16,800
green cheese for sure. And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

80
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,980
Stop right there. Intensifying our prospects' desires, that's when the wheels of action begin

81
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:32,320
to move. Sorry for jumping in, doctors. Go on. Dr. Dobbs is known worldwide as a foremost

82
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,960
spokesman for Christian and family values. He plans to attend this rare personal appearance

83
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,800
of Dr. Dobbs to second in the past four years. Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.

84
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,300
Oh, yes, dear friends. Well, I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little

85
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,420
bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more

86
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,420


87
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,900
careful. For once, I took my own advice, which is rare for a subgenius preacher, especially me.

88
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,140
I did repent, quit my job, and slack off. I actually did that this weekend.

89
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,220
As for not taking my own advice, usually, as Bob Dobbs himself said,

90
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,560
I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

91
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,420
This line from Pre-Scriptures is in fact one of the foundation stones of the Church of the

92
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,140
Subgenius.

93
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,620
is the sandy beach upon which our church is built.

94
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,140
And other churches may be built upon a rock,

95
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,320
steadfast and true,

96
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,180
but ours changes with the tides,

97
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,200
scurrying in and out of holes like a crab,

98
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,700
occasionally pinching innocent bathers,

99
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,280
and finally, in the end,

100
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,160
getting skewered by kids with sticks.

101
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,600
But, uh, it's true.

102
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,140
Oh, sire, there is no more money.

103
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,640
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,820
Get some money.

105
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,560
I did repent, quit my job, and slack off.

106
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,280
I didn't really have a job to begin with before I quit it.

107
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,380
I quit before it started, and you can't beat that.

108
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,980
So I've been slacking off,

109
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,440
and pretty soon I'm going to have to get a job,

110
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,020
one that doesn't last long, I hope.

111
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,100
I only last about as long as it takes

112
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,760
to get a ten-minute film to the lab,

113
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,420
and then I just run out of gas till you put another quarter in.

114
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,820
So, uh, if you need, friends,

115
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,520
a freelance film or videotape cutter,

116
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,980
a clay animator,

117
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,960
weird comedy show producer,

118
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,500
magazine editor, business writer,

119
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,360
babysitter, baby sacrificer,

120
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,500
or a true ordained mad prophet of the airwaves,

121
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,160
or just an all-around cool guy, friends,

122
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,840
just write me at the Church of the Subgenius

123
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,600
or this affiliate station,

124
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,500
which we own,

125
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,940
and no jobs on spec.

126
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,660
Um, my, my.

127
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,180
If, friends, if I don't get a job pretty soon,

128
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,800
uh, I'm going to have to start cashing in

129
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,900
and all those souls,

130
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,900
that are stacking up around the church headquarters.

131
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,660
We, we store the souls of those who send a dollar to the church

132
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,520
in handsome blue cylinders in the tabernacle basement.

133
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,120
We keep these souls on ice

134
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,320
until such time as they can be liberated

135
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,060
from this earthly plane.

136
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,860
But if the church goes broke, friends,

137
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,040
why, we have to cash in some of those souls,

138
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,240
and one of them might be yours,

139
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,860
so neither one of you or us can get them back after that.

140
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,840
I don't know where they go after Bob sells them,

141
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,580
and I don't.

142
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:17,740
I don't know where they go after Bob sells them,

143
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:17,740


144
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:17,740


145
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:17,740


146
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:17,740


147
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:17,740


148
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:17,740


149
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:17,740


150
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,580
So, you can tell by the way I'm talking

151
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,920
that I'd be a dedicated worker

152
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,800
in whatever job you might want to give me.

153
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,540
It's, I love having a show.

154
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,980
It's great.

155
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,220
You can use your own religious broadcast for job hunting.

156
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,600
Oh, yes, but it's better than using the telephone

157
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,140
because I get to do all the talking.

158
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,780
Praise Bob.

159
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,220
Yes, help me somebody.

160
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,440
Ain't got no leg in my legs.

161
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:38,860
I'm on fire.

162
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,520
Pull the lever down.

163
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:39,740
You go.

164
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:39,820
You go.

166
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,100
Well, friends, on with the show.

167
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,380
It's a good thing that this entire show

168
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,140
is composed of one tape and one negative land record

169
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,700
because one of these tape decks does not work tonight.

170
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,360
Thank you.

171
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,980
Let's do this.

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,800
I am the last sole survivor

174
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,820
of the Battle of Dobstown,

175
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,220
popularly called Bob's Last Stand.

176
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,920
I knowed J.R. Bob Dobbs for what he was,

177
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,280
and I knowed the subgeniuses for what they was.

178
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,100
Turn that thing on.

179
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,380
Put on them headphones.

180
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,540
One.

181
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,020
One hundred and eleven years ago,

182
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,680
when I was 33 years old,

183
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,400
right after the atomic wars,

184
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,500
my church was rubbed out

185
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,700
by a band of wild pink boys.

186
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,120
Only ones left were my son and me.

187
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,560
My son, Captain Son Sonson.

188
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,920
I've lost all I ever wavered about my faith.

189
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,980
All I had was the anger that hadaze me with your

190
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,140
murder.

191
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,820
All I ever sought after was the voice

192
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,360
that no one heard.

193
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:29,720


194
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,100
at something real.

195
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,600
I wanted to help to make it where I thought of home.

196
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,000
But it was no longer there.

197
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,720
I had been saving people for that.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,720
Iبةhtisters.com

199
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:39,720


200
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:39,720


201
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,340
Maybe we could stop the monsters.

202
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,620
You think we could use the show to stop the monsters?

203
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,180
Yeah.

204
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,200
If it sounded bad enough, even the monsters would flee.

205
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,360
And the land would again be safe.

206
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,840
For the free.

207
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,080
Friends, we're walking out of the laboratories.

208
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,380
I don't want to go in any direction that ink will be coming from.

209
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,440
Uh-uh. We've got to avoid ink.

210
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,320
And the Yaka Teasement.

211
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,220
We're going to have to fight a lot of monsters on this show tonight.

212
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,960
Right now, we're not live. This is in the daytime.

213
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,220
And now that we're away from the encampment and the laboratories,

214
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:38,160
there are bones of creatures, Martian goats and things that have been killed by

215
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,360
the Yaka Teasement.

216
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,700
By the Cyclops and by other nefarious monsters around here.

217
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,040
What?

218
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,760
What could have done that?

219
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,540
Nothing could have been living in there.

220
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,560
Something could be living in there now.

221
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,480
Careful.

222
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,380
Stick it towards you.

223
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,320
Okay.

224
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,040
Look! Look! Look at what's running out! Grab creatures! Grab a weapon!

225
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,460
Put it on! Grab creatures are coming!

226
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,780
Hey! Don't forget the show! Come on! Grab it!

227
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,780
You stopped the first time!

228
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,560
They're still coming though.

229
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,340
Turn on the radio!

230
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,020
Huh?

231
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,900
Turn on the radio!

232
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,420
What's the devil doing? Well, turn on the radio!

233
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,480
I can't get it to come on!

234
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,660
You do it!

235
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,700
Okay. Now what's the button?

236
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,540
That one!

237
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,020
Which one?

238
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,900
Um, that one. Yeah.

239
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,460
You got it!

240
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,580
Okay.

241
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:37,660
Okay.

242
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,460
Got him!

243
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,540
Oh no! It only wounded him! Here he comes! Quick! Quick, Grim!

244
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,120
I think I got him.

245
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,460
He's down. He's still breathing though.

246
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,000
I hope this isn't an endangered species on this planet.

247
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,620
Let's keep throwing rocks at it!

248
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,360
Got him right in the hole!

249
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,840
Let's throw the show at it!

250
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,420
Ooh! Ooh! The show got something gross all over my hand!

251
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
Ooh! Get away from it! Get away from it!

252
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,600
It's gonna explode!

253
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,840
You okay now?

254
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,200
Yeah.

255
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,000
Did you fix the show?

256
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,380
Alright. Listen, I'm gonna have to...

257
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,240
Here's the array gun.

258
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,560
Oh, I know what...

259
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,100
The show needs new batteries.

260
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,640
Yeah.

261
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,640
Okay, look. I brought some with me.

262
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,520
Let's kill it and try to get some new batteries in.

263
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,960
Won't be any air for a while, folks. It'll just hang on.

264
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,560
I thought it said a gas marriage.

265
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,720
What?

266
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,940
I don't even know what that means.

267
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,060
A gas marriage? Maybe that was the rescue colony that came out here.

268
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,460
It might be a big...

269
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,200
Big thing.

270
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,060
Oh, my God. This pink sky here just... I can't believe it. It's like... Remember Mars? Ooh!

271
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,440
Face, eyes, nose, eyes, and nose.

272
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,380
Yeah, that's not a gas mask. That's a skull.

273
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,760
But of what?

274
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,620
Look under it.

275
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,800
Okay, stand back. Because one of those rhamphorhynchuses might be under me.

276
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,060
Oh, it's okay.

277
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,820
Ugh.

278
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,000
Strange life forms.

279
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,720
Shoot it.

280
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,300
I don't want to find a Gaius Gudis.

281
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:45,100
Captain Zandy here, his face is scarred from an attack by a Gaius Gudis on the way into the laboratory earlier today.

282
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,620
We're gonna need... That's a good weapon right there.

283
00:15:50,280 --> 00:16:02,700
The ground is littered with weapons and bones from the many, many battles that have been fought between the subgenius colonies and the creatures that live on the planet.

284
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:02,700


285
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,080
Head horn.

286
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,300
You know, the amazing thing about this...

287
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,060
This thing is...

288
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,220
I heard something answer you.

289
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:22,540
God, your face looks cool with that scar.

290
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,020
You look like the old G.I. Joes.

291
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,140
The old G.I. Joes, the tall ones, you know, they're about a foot long.

292
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,680
They all had a scar in the same place, like every one of those guys here.

293
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:32,760
You know, they all had a scar in the same place.

294
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:38,020
And the guys had to go through this initiation rite where they were scarred so they'd all look alike.

295
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,900
Even the ones with beards.

296
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,920
I can't believe you still got it.

297
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,220
Yeah, you bet I still got this hook.

298
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,240
This thing could save our lives.

299
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,220
Hey, this is a tree, isn't it?

300
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,700
Oh, it's got me!

301
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,680
It's got me!

302
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,400
What is it?

303
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,400
What is it?

304
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:55,840
Hook him!

305
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,500
Hook him!

306
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,500
Oh, you got me!

307
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,060
Oh, you got me!

308
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,320
Oh, you got me!

309
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,660
Oh, you got me!

310
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,660


311
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,660


312
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,260
Oh, you got me!

313
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,800
I'm gonna have to do the rest of the show yourself.

314
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,260
Here.

315
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,680
Here.

316
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,240
Quick, quick, the show.

317
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,880
Raise Bob!

318
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,780
This has been the subgenius news hour.

319
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:31,260
Brought to you in part by the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer Launcher Society, Dobbs Co.

320
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,760
In Sexer Ground and Yaka Teasmovision.

321
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,060
Oh, yes, dear friends.

322
00:17:52,780 --> 00:18:00,060
Let your body be sucked out of your ears by the sound effects of Bob.

323
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:07,040
We're going to take you deeper and deeper inside yourself to find Bob.

324
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,480
Come with me.

325
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,240
That's right, inside.

326
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,660
Into your consciousness.

327
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,720
It's slippery.

328
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,720
It's wet.

329
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,240
But we shall go deeper and deeper and deeper into the consciousness.

330
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,840
We must bore down into the cranium.

331
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,520
Drill through the irrelevant thoughts of job and reality.

332
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,440
Rolling along the hollowed out inside of the skull.

333
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,720
Piercing the squamous epithelium.

334
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,840
Tickling past the supernumerary nipple.

335
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,160
Scraping along the edges of the birth canal.

336
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,040
Stretching the imagination gland until it pops.

337
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,500
And finally, bursting through the perineum.

338
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:10,820
Until finally, getting into the bottom of the brain pan and tumbling down through the sinuses.

339
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,940
Down the esophagus.

340
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,620
And finally, landing at the very soul.

341
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,920
Located in the foot gland at the very lowest organ of your physical being.

342
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,780
Until finally, an idea.

343
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,780
An ultimate plan.

344
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:34,300
A plan is born at the very bottom of your mind.

345
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,800
And soon, you will be ready for...

346
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,500
Negative Land.

347
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:53,920
Yes, folks, tonight, through the magic of Negative Land, we're going to try to make them famous for a change.

348
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,840
They're not a bunch of subgeniuses.

349
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,080
This band, quote, band, unquote, was doing this long before they discovered Bob.

350
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,660
Negative Land from Concord, California.

351
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:16,520
And if you were ever into Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart, or Wildman Fisher, John Cage, or Johann Sebastian Bach, or any of those zany pop groups, you might enjoy this.

352
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:23,800
And if you can possibly wear headphones for it, or tape it for headphones later, you will be in for the shocks of your life.

353
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,240
I consider these guys...

354
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,120
Oh, time to quit.

355
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,480
Time to quit the job.

356
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,400
Slack off.

357
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,780
Anyway, these guys I consider the most advanced classical symphonic group of this century so far, aside from Doctors for Bob.

358
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,080
And, uh, well, they're my heroes.

359
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,960
And yet, and yet, they did sound for, enhanced our sound system.

360
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,720
That's sort of like, having Negative Land do sound for subgeniuses like having Federico Fellini set up lights.

361
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,140
For your Uncle Fred's home movies.

362
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,640
Or like having Michelangelo do Elvis Presley black velvet paintings.

363
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,480
It's like seeing Jesus pose for pie pads in the Yellow Pages.

364
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,500
You know, it just ain't right.

365
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,440
So, this is the subgenius sound effect show dedicated to Negative Land.

366
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,180
You've got to see this guy for what he is.

367
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,820
He's a maniac out to rule the world.

368
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,780
Yeah.

369
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,080
I guess I'm gonna have to start jamming mobile.

370
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,660
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

371
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,880
Do you think I should start jamming you guys?

372
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,040
Alright, people.

373
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,380
It's almost time for us to be ten-eight.

374
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,840
In just a few moments, we're gonna be ten-eight.

375
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,600
And I'm going to tell you the story of 180 and the letter G.

376
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,300
Alright, people.

377
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,640
It's almost time for us to be ten-eight.

378
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,280
We're almost to that moment right now, people.

379
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,940
In just a few moments, we're gonna be ten-eight.

380
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,940
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

381
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,100
I am a man.

382
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,480
A man with four fingers.

383
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,680
A man with four fingers on my hand.

384
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,220
I am a man.

385
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,440
A man with four fingers.

386
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,360
But that doesn't count my thumb.

387
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,520
I am a man.

388
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,780
A man with three fingers.

389
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,740
A man with three fingers on my hand.

390
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,520
I am a man.

391
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,720
A man with three fingers.

392
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,080
But that doesn't count my index finger.

393
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,760
Or my thumb.

394
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:12,860
Or my thumb.

395
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,900
I am a man.

396
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,180
A man with two fingers.

397
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,180
A man with two fingers on my hand.

398
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,900
I am a man.

399
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,080
A man with two fingers.

400
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,660
But that doesn't count my middle finger.

401
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,140
My index finger.

402
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,780
Or my thumb.

403
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,740
I am a man.

404
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,020
A man with one finger.

405
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,880
A man with one finger on my hand.

406
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,060
I am a man.

407
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,060


408
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,060


409
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,620
A man with one finger.

410
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:08,620


411
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,780
A man with one finger.

412
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,220
But that doesn't count my ring finger.

413
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,620
My middle finger.

414
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,240
My index finger.

415
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,920
Or my thumb.

416
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:32,060
I am a man.

417
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,040
A man with one finger.

418
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,740
I am a man, a man with no fingers

419
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,540
A man with no fingers on my hand

420
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:10,380
I am a man, a man with no fingers

421
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:17,080
But that doesn't count my pinky or my ring finger

422
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,920
My middle finger, my index finger, or my thumb

423
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,740
Okay, we're ten-eight

424
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,520
Okay, we're ten-eight

425
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:32,520


426
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,120
And the number is 180 and the letter is G

427
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,660
There's no other possibility

428
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,880
And all you slimy fruitcakes in San Francisco

429
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,400
Are going to find out how to get to 180 and the letter G

430
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,700
I repeat, there is no other possibility

431
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,500
There is no other possibility

432
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,520
The number is 180 and the letter is G

433
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:09,100
The first thing you have to do

434
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,580
To get over to 180 and the letter G

435
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,100
Is to get into your vehicle

436
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,940
And head east

437
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,360
I repeat, you have to head east

438
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,020
Over the bridge

439
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,440
But before you get onto the bridge

440
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,460
Around one big turn

441
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,520
You'll come to 180 and the letter G

442
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:32,520


443
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:32,520


444
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:32,520


445
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:32,520


446
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:32,520


447
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,600
And come up to the place

448
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,060
Where the sex chemicals burned up

449
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,680
I repeat, where the sex chemicals burned up

450
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,600
And of course, you all must have heard about that

451
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,840
On News Center 4

452
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,280
On News Center 4

453
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,680
No, no, no

454
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:02,500
On your way to 180 and the letter G

455
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:02,500


456
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:02,500


457
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:08,600
On your way to 180 and the letter G

458
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,760
And now, and now, and now we're on the bridge

459
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,660
That's nothing very much

460
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,580
But when you get on the other side of the bridge

461
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,080
On your way to 180 and the letter G

462
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,020
You'll notice two things

463
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,500
First of all, it's very important for you to know

464
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:32,500


465
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,040
That you turn on your AM radio

466
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,360
Set it to 1010 on your dial

467
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:45,840
And let the radio frequency energy from K101

468
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,060
Overload your little tuner

469
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,380
Until it distorts very highly

470
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:58,020
Now right at the point of that extreme distortion

471
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,160
There's the big chairs

472
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,580
I'm not exactly sure

473
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,260
But I think that's where all the sewer water opens up

474
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,660
And then by then, you'll be out of all that distortion

475
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,960
And you'll be looking east toward the hill

476
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,080
And if it's at night

477
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,860
You'll see the little red lights flashing

478
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,420
On my favorite ham radio repeater station

479
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,620
That's WR6 automatic bowel movement

480
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,180
And if you are into jamming

481
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,320
Keep talking

482
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,440
Keep jamming

483
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,340
Because I'll be listening on my scanner radio

484
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,140
And just maybe

485
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,440
Maybe

486
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:00,720
Maybe

487
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,940
You'll be on the news

488
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,320
I'll be listening

489
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,180
You come up to the tunnel

490
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,720
And now we're coming up to the tunnel

491
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,260
Up to the tunnel

492
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,460
And then as you get into the tunnel

493
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,220
You'll start to sense something

494
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,440
And then about halfway through the tunnel

495
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,060
Something will suddenly hit you

496
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,880
You won't sense it a lot

497
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,520
Until you get almost through to the other side

498
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,460
You'll realize right then and there

499
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,360
That you're entering Contra Costa County

500
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,640
It's hard to explain

501
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,940
It's hard to explain

502
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,000
It's hard to explain

503
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,220
It's hard to explain

504
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,900
But you feel a certain way

505
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,600
When you get into Contra Costa County

506
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,040
It was you

507
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,220
It's hard to explain

508
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,000
That was you

509
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,140
So take the stairs

510
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,140


511
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,140


512
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,820
There's no doubt

513
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,840
It's hard to see

514
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
If you were on the radio

515
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:17,840


516
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:17,840


517
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,420
I would've had the nose

518
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,420


519
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,420


520
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,420


521
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,420


522
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,420


523
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,420


524
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,500
Tomorrow

525
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:18,500


526
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,060
No

527
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,820
You go to jail

528
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,380
This is the end

529
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:35,620
It's about 40 degrees warmer, and then your minute is about 15 or so.

530
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,280
You'll just hear about free water.

531
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,840
All the way until you get to Martinez.

532
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,260
When you're at Martinez, you'll see a sign.

533
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,720
A sign that says, G.

534
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,360
And you're just going to go right on up there in your little vehicle.

535
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,140
And you're going to turn left on the G.

536
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,700
On the left-hand side of the street is the A&W Root Beer Place.

537
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:17,320
And on the right side is another place where you're going to call your name is Charlie.

538
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,320
It's Faith Muffins.

539
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,000
Now that you're on G.

540
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,500
You're on G.

541
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,040
You're just going to keep right on going up G.

542
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,820
Heading west on G.

543
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,100
All the way to the top of the hill.

544
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,200
Now that's where 180 is.

545
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,120
Right up there at the top.

546
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,600
And just before you get to the top of the hill.

547
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:51,200
You'll notice the green slime closing out from under the house.

548
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,900
At 180.

549
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,520
And of course.

550
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,640
It had to be true.

551
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,400
You just got to go right back down to Safe Muffins.

552
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,860
And shoplift.

553
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:20,360
I repeat, you're going to have to shoplift the HR Steam Cleaning System from Safe Muffins.

554
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,980
The only way you're going to be able to do it successfully is to become invisible.

555
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,600
And then when you're totally invisible.

556
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,460
You'll just creep right on in to Safe Muffins.

557
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,740
And there you'll see it.

558
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,860
The HR Steam Cleaning System.

559
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,460
This is K-N-O-N 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

560
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,080
And you're going to have to go to 180 very quickly.

561
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,880
So you whisk your steam cleaning machine right back up G.

562
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,240
All the way to 180.

563
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,900
You go right up to the front door.

564
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,720
And you push the button.

565
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,040
And you're going to see the door open.

566
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,100
And you're going to see the door open.

567
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,600
And you're going to see the door open.

568
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,440
The door opens automatically.

569
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:36,060
And the first thing you see is the orange carpet inside 180.

570
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,800
And you'll see the dog juice.

571
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,380
The horrible dog juice all over the orange carpet.

572
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,060
And 180 in the letter G.

573
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,620
You're just going to march right on in to G there.

574
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,860
And with your HR Steam Cleaning System.

575
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,400
Go right all the way back to the kitchen.

576
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,580
Where the Mr. Coffee Coffee Maker has your hot water.

577
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:13,780
Your hot water ready to pour in your HR Steam Cleaning System.

578
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:22,220
So you go in there and get your HR Steam Cleaner all fired up.

579
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,560
And you bring it on down into the living room.

580
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,920
And you take care of all the dog juice on the orange carpet.

581
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,860
At 180 in the letter G.

582
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,860
I think I'd like to have a cigarette now.

583
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,160
Where are my cigarettes, David?

584
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,020
They're on top of the refrigerator.

585
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,180
David, I'd like to know what you did with my cigarettes.

586
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,680
They're under the house.

587
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,140
My cigarettes are missing, David.

588
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,660
I'd like to smoke. What did you do with them?

589
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,060
They're in the tote cage.

590
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,900
David, I'd like to have a cigarette right now.

591
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,500
But I can't find the package.

592
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,900
I put them on the table and they're not there.

593
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,860
Did you take them?

594
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,660
I think we may have left them at the grandma's house.

595
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,860
My mother doesn't smoke, David.

596
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,760
What did you do with my cigarettes?

597
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,360
I told you they're on top of the refrigerator.

598
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,800
I looked on top of the refrigerator. They aren't there.

599
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,980
Will you please tell me what you did with my cigarettes?

600
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,480
Maybe you left them in the car.

601
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,160
I haven't been in the car all day.

602
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,260
You must have put them somewhere and I can't find them.

603
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,640
You better tell me now or I'm going to really get mad.

604
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,160
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I think I know where they are.

605
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,020
They're in back of the TV set where all the parakeet feathers are.

606
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,320
And as you're cleaning the orange carpet, there'll be a voice that says,

607
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,320
Fetch my cigarettes.

608
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,180
Another voice will say,

609
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,020
They're on top of the refrigerator.

610
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,940
And then of course you've forgotten completely about the green slime.

611
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:34,420
And you'll realize that the only way to get rid of the green slime

612
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:42,540
is to go back down, down the stairs, down to the basement of 180

613
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,940
and the letter G, where you'll find a bottle of formula 409.

614
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:59,220
You'll get that 409 up there real quick and go outside to the mailbox of 180

615
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:04,880
where the green slime and all the ants are oozing out on your sidewalk.

616
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,600
And you'll spray it with all your might as hard as you can on that goddamn green slime.

617
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,380
And then you'll have gotten all that formal stuff.

618
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,560
There'll be a few toads left under the house.

619
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,020
And they'll be saying,

620
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,220
Herbivore, Herbivore, under the house.

621
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,340
And spray me with the 409, Herbivore.

622
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,880
That's what the toads are going to say.

623
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,780
They won't crow, they'll actually say that.

624
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,540
What, you're a chee?

625
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,760
What, you're a chee?

626
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:45,760


627
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:45,860
What, you're a chee?

628
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,560
What, you're a chee?

629
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:56,340
By then you'll realize that you're going to have to take your HR steam cleaning system

630
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,820
back down to Safe Muffins.

631
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:04,460
And before you can do it, you'll of course have to become invisible.

632
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,600
And before you can do it, you'll of course have to become invisible.

633
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,720
Once again.

634
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,900
You'll take your HR steam cleaning system,

635
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,000
which you shot up at the safe muffins.

636
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,080
And you'll have to be in the bathroom,

637
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,160
and you'll have to be in the bathroom,

638
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,740
and some of them are going to be in the bathroom.

639
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,660
And it'll be time for you to head back to San Francisco.

640
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,520
And it'll be time for you to head back to San Francisco.

641
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,880
Because if you don't, you'll never leave Contra Costa County.

642
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,700
And I can't hear.

643
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,840
Are you doing something?

644
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,820
Get it out of here.

645
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,280
Don't.

646
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,280
Don't.

647
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,660
Don't do that.

648
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,620
Stop that.

649
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,100
Put it away.

650
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,680
Don't get it on the tape recorder.

651
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,640
Good God.

652
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,380
Get it out of here.

653
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,480
Don't.

654
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,200
Don't.

655
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,200


656
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,480
Don't.

657
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,940
You'll go back through the tunnel.

658
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,080
And you're going to get back on the other side of the hills there.

659
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,460
Through the tunnel.

660
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,320
All right.

661
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,000
You already said it.

662
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,580
I don't want to hear about that tunnel anymore.

663
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,760
And you'll whisk down that hill at 90 miles an hour.

664
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:31,860
You'll get into the appropriate lanes on your way from 180 in the letter G.

665
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,820
Back to San Francisco.

666
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,880
Back past K101 and the big chairs.

667
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,840
Which remind you of the sewer gas back in G where you could become invisible.

668
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:52,500
Not really sure if Oakland sewer gas can do it as well as Montana sewer gas.

669
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,100
Are you?

670
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,820
Are you?

671
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,200
Are you?

672
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,940
And you're on the bridge now heading west into the fog.

673
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,680
The high fog, I repeat.

674
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,800
Fog never touches the ground in California.

675
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,920
It's always so damn high.

676
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,620
And you get across.

677
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,720
And you look back to where the sex chemicals were made.

678
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,300
And finally you get back into your sewer pipe.

679
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,200
Really?

680
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,100
And disappear down into the sewers of San Francisco.

681
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:40,020
And you know that you'll never ever want to come out to 180 in the letter G ever again.

682
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,700
And you'll never ever want to come out to 180 in the letter G ever again.

683
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,980
And that sorry situation.

684
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,320
I think it's just about time we went 10-7.

685
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,880
I'm getting that feeling now.

686
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,300
Deep within those sewer pipes by now.

687
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,820
And you'll never ever want to come out to 180 in the letter G ever again.

688
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,000
And you'll never ever want to come out to 180 in the letter G ever again.

689
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,380
And you'll never find your way out.

690
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,300
And never find your way out.

691
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,640
You'll never wanna find your way out.

692
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,680
I'm sick!

693
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,700
We're 10-7.

694
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,760
Oh, shut it up!

695
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,100
Out!

696
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,300
Shut it up!

697
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,700
Stop everything!

698
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,760
Well we stopped everything.

699
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:39,980
Well we stopped everything.

700
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,600
There is absolutely no other possibility.

701
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,020
That's all there is to it, folks.

702
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,600
That's what I've been playing there.

703
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,980
I can shut off now.

704
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,500
That was Negative Land, their third album, a big 10-8 place.

705
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:04,980
And I'm going to read their address here in just a second so you can send them $7.50 and buy that thing.

706
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:15,100
I know that probably some of my listeners are absolutely disgusted that they'd have to listen to something as probably strange as all of this may sound.

707
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,580
But that's too bad, ain't it?

708
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,400
I quit my job.

709
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,540
What do I have to worry about?

710
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:23,980
Nothing.

711
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,660
It's freedom, baby.

712
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,980
Can you dig it?

713
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,840
So anyway, yes, that's Negative Land.

714
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,100
See, they distribute their own record.

715
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,080
You might be able to find it somewhere.

716
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,840
It's at Box 54, Concord, California.

717
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,660
Valfrofnan 22.

718
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,780
Box 54, Concord, California.

719
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,860
You've been listening to this.

720
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,440
Valfrofnan.

721
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,500
Valfrofnan.

722
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:58,400
And I hope y'all are getting that in stereo because it's really a pretty amazing piece.

723
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:04,080
So if I can just cut myself loose from these other shows, it'd be fun.

724
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,400
Must be fun.

725
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,900
Holy trouver.

726
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:17,160
You can fiddle with the beats, you can fiddle with theelsius, you can fiddle with the 경우 dockия.

727
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:19,540
But,

728
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,240
I'm brand new creatonica.

729
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:20,440
This is my new ain't new thing.

730
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,320
Let me rest my mind in peace.

731
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,300
Because it's so,

732
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:24,300


733
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,880
Now,

734
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,200
go ahead,

735
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,840
go ahead.

736
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,320
What kind of man are you?

737
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,700
I'm watching you.

738
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,100
You've got to see this guy for what he is.

739
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,840
He's a maniac out to rule the world.

740
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,880
What can I do to make you understand?

741
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,080
I love you.

742
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,620
Goodbye, Iceman.

743
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,040
Man, I'm not sleeping.

744
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:58,440
No!

745
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,320
Oh, $%&!

746
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,360
What happened?

747
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,100
Where are we?

748
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,180
A minute ago I was walking around in Glen Rose, Texas and now I'm on this planet.

749
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,580
Sandy, what happened?

750
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,960
You got captured by a monster and it accidentally killed you.

751
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,960


752
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,960


753
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,960


754
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,960


755
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,960


756
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,960


757
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,960


758
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,960


759
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,960


760
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,960


761
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,960


762
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,960


763
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,960
A monster?!

764
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,700
Yeah, right up here!

765
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,360
It's dead though!

766
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,340
What's the show doing here?

767
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,380
You should remember what you do.

768
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,400
I don't remember anything!

769
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,540
You brought the show with you!

770
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,120
From the laboratory.

771
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,940
We're gonna have, I'm gonna have to think about this one.

772
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,820
I don't understand.

773
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:32,920
Let's see.

774
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:33,720
There's a letter.

775
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:34,260


776
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:34,560
It says..

777
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:34,940
Let's see.

778
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:34,940


779
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:46,100
Okay. We're safe now. Man, that was tough. Too many monsters around here. At least this

780
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:56,280
old road is still here that the space bulldozers built. I wish the Transformers were around

781
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:02,980
to help us. Yeah, really. Well, which way do you think we should go, Captain Zandy?

782
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:17,400
Where'd the Lost Subgenius colony... Where do you think they could have crashed? Did you

783
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:27,260
hear that? What did you say? Whatever it is, I'll stop it. Yeah? They'll hear that when

784
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:34,060
I run away. Listen, I heard something going. God, look at those things. God, they're

785
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:34,700
unbelievable.

786
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:44,820
I can't even describe these monsters, folks. Asleep? Some of them are running off in the

787
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,120
bushes.

788
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:04,040
Now, there could be something lurking in those boulders over there.

789
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:13,660
Oh, what is that? Looks like the end of one of the space bulldozers. Yeah. The yellow

790
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:22,980
and red thing. Uh-huh. But what did this to it? What could have done this to a space bulldozer?

791
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:32,000
This is like the Cyclops' head. And a nose horn. And two ears. Maybe the bulldozer had

792
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,920
a crash into the Cyclops and knocked him out. Yeah. Maybe the bulldozer had a crash into

793
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:34,920


794
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,420
the Cyclops and knocked his horn off. If that's the case, he's gonna be really mad.

795
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:47,040
And this is just his whole horn? That's probably just the tip of him. It's only about 8 feet

796
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:58,720
long. The whole horn is 20 feet. Then he must be giant-er than this guy. No. Well, his head

797
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,960
touches those low clouds over there.

798
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,020
We got him badly hit.

799
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:03,380
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared.

800
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:03,380


801
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:04,900
Okay, come on!

802
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:11,460
to take that on that's the only thing if we can make the show sound bad enough

803
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,780
then even the king's sock box will be driven away and the land will be left in

804
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:24,580
peace and harmony forever and the Eternia will be ruled yes without he man

805
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:33,880
yeah only the soon the Transformers will rule Eternia no the Transformers will

806
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:42,940
I hope that the Autobots get back to Cybertron their home why and leave the Decepticons here on earth to destroy us

807
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:52,380
yeah why do you want earth destroyed you've got to see this guy for what he is he's a

808
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,240

out there.

828
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,340
It's kind of, this is

829
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,480
what life is like

830
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,420
at a

831
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,380
bottom line level. You know, and I'm not

832
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,360
going to make you cut through a lot of other

833
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,560
stuff to get through it. Here's what it is.

834
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,520
There's no gimmick about that.

835
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,320
It's straightforward. It's

836
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,000
strong and it's elemental.

837
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,940
Yeah, heavy stuff.

838
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,380
Witchcraft.

839
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:44,600
Rude.

840
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,780
Devil worship.

841
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,060
A wild,

842
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,320
gnawing,

843
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,260
animal hunger will grow

844
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:53,800
in you.

845
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,060
Number is

846
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,460
600.

847
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,040
Three score.

848
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,720
Everybody welcome.

849
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,640
One too stupid.

850
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,880
Three

851
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,740
four dumb.

852
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,460
Five

853
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,260
six idiotic.

854
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,680
Seven

855
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,880
eight seat me safe.

856
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,620
Very stupid.

857
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,280
Very stupid.

858
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,000
Very stupid.

859
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,580
Very stupid.

860
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,600
I like Concord

861
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,540
and 180G.

862
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,380
I like Pleasant Hill.

863
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,520
No other possibility.

864
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,420
Very stupid.

865
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,100
Very stupid.

866
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,660
Very stupid.

867
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,300
Very stupid.

868
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,800
Very stupid.

869
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,460
Very stupid.

870
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,080
Very stupid.

871
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,500
Very stupid.

872
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:54,620
Very stupid.

873
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:54,640
Very stupid.

874
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:54,640


875
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,920
That is no more money.

876
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,760
We gotta get some money.

877
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,860
That dirty, perky shark.

878
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,540
That flaky, porky, filibuster, porky.

879
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,140
You don't want the deceptic- ooh.

880
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,880
That sounded pretty good.

881
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,080
Our ancestors used to do this.

882
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,720
Making stupid noises with rocks.

883
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,940
And one day they found out that certain types of rock, when chipped like that, would become

884
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:31,200
sharp, sharp flint knives worthy of felling even the mighty saber-toothed tiger.

885
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,960
Even the mighty bablosaurus.

886
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,020
Who are our ancestors?

887
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:37,780
Huh?

888
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,280
Our ancestors are the cavemen, right?

889
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,400
And the monkeys and stuff.

890
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,420
Right?

891
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,700
Well, the decepticons are the cavemen.

892
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:46,700


893
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:46,700


894
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:46,700


895
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:46,700


896
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:46,700


897
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:46,720


898
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,260
The, uh, our ancestors.

899
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,480
See Zandy as subgeniuses.

900
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,140
Our ancestors were giant, eight foot tall yetis.

901
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,560
Abominable snowmen and big foot creatures, created by the aliens who came to Earth after

902
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,760
the, after they destroyed the dinosaurs.

903
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:16,700
Uh, unfortunately, these godlike super intelligent ancestors of ours, were smited by evil gods.

904
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:16,700


905
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:16,700


906
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:16,700


907
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:16,700


908
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:16,700


909
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:16,700


910
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:16,700


911
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:16,700


912
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:20,040
and turned into pathetic monkeys and humans.

913
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,240
And the humans and the subgeniuses

914
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,040
have always been a little different

915
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,340
and always waged this endless war

916
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,980
over what's funny and what's not funny.

917
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,180
What do you think about that?

918
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:35,860
What?

919
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,340
What I just told you, the history of mankind.

920
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:39,840
Yeah, here's your club.

921
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,060
What am I supposed to do with it?

922
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,820
Yeah, call it...

923
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,020
Oh, me subgenius, me goon, go find human.

924
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,200
Human!

925
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,760
That's just a rock.

926
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,500
Find human.

927
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,340
Subgenius.

928
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,120
The evolution.

929
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,160
Kill Bob.

930
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,700
Kill human.

931
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,260
Where we find human, master?

932
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,980
I am a human.

933
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:12,900
What?

934
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,820
My own son?

935
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,400
A human?

936
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,240
Yeah.

937
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,060
Shelby didn't tell me.

938
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:22,380
Oh!

939
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,180
This was a plant.

940
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,660
It was a live plant.

941
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,840
See, here's the two eyes, the mouth,

942
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,480
and here's the long nose.

943
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,840
The two horns.

944
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,240
And that was a plant?

945
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,020
Yeah.

946
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,020
Actually, these are like leaves.

947
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,720
It looks like a mutated goat head skull.

948
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,600
And it had eyes?

949
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,840
A plant with eyes?

950
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:44,340
Yeah.

951
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,240
I can hear a small there, последale ste Max by

952
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:48,920
You.

953
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:49,300
That's real.

954
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,280
It's real, folks.

955
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,140
This is a real show and we're really in a dangerous environment.

956
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,500
A hostile planet.

957
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,880
Another time...

958
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,880
Look at this leg.

959
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,240
We're 225 years in the future from when you're hearing this

960
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,000
I wish she was here.

961
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,720
Associated kisser.

962
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,360
Sandy.

963
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:13,700
Sandy?

964
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,980
That's what I'm supposed to be thinking you're only six years old

965
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,100
Must be one of those them-a-pods

966
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:45,620
We gotta find some us-a-pods as an antidote in case one of those them-a-pods bites us

967
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,880
Yeah, because those antidotes can really help

968
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,280
Hear that?

969
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,380
Hear that sound?

970
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,120
I heard gunshot

971
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,380
An earth weapon

972
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:02,500
Look out! An egg!

973
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,020
Egg

974
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,080
Do you think that's a gunshot?

975
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,040
Do you think that's a Gaius Gudis egg?

976
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,340
Well, you're afraid that it'll open it so it'll die

977
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,360
It doesn't explode

978
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,800
I'm gonna stand back

979
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,060
BOOM!

980
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,760
Way to go!

981
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:20,680
Are you okay?

982
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,820
I didn't brush you off

983
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,620
You got egg goop all over you

984
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,040
Wonder what that thing was

985
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,360
Look out! Here comes it's mother!

986
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,960
Grab a stick! Grab anything!

987
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,360
Oh! Oh!

988
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:36,600
Stop me!

989
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,180
Quick! Quick! Turn up the show!

990
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:40,840
Don't!

991
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,380
Stop!

992
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:46,320
I made it!

993
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,660
I made it!

994
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,000
I made it!

995
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,080
Ugh

996
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,340
Zandy!

997
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,020
Am I teaching you too much violence?

998
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:57,680
No

999
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,220
Why would you teach me stuff like that?

1000
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,160
Huh?

1001
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,420
Why would you teach me stuff like that?

1002
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:05,960
I don't know

1003
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,540
I don't know

1004
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,040
I don't know

1005
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,820
Because that's what I got taught

1006
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,260
But it's so much fun

1007
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,720
Like I'm gonna grab you

1008
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,240
Okay

1009
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,480
Okay

00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:45,720
