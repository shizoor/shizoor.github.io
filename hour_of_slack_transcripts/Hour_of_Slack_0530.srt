1
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,500
Who dwells in here?

2
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,200
Who lives here?

3
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,460
And how long have they been here?

4
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,180
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

5
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:48,060
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

6
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,980
The Self Genius Hour of Sight.

7
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,460
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

8
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,820
The Self Genius Hour of Sight.

9
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:16,700
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

10
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,920
The Self Genius Hour of Sight.

11
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,560
Hustle here and hustle there.

12
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,020
New York City is the place where they said,

13
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,620
Hey man, go take a walk on the wild side.

14
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,480
I said, hey Joe, go take a walk on the wild side.

15
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,900
Ah, honey.

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,140
Yes, dear friends, well we're back.

17
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:15,040
Yes, we're back from Cleveland where we did a show with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz Smith and Michelle and all of that hideous crew at...

18
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:26,140
ESO Radio in lovely WCSB FM in Cleveland.

19
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,700
And it was an ugly, ugly night.

20
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,680
But we survived and we bring you the skeletons, the remnants of that ugly night.

21
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,440
The 81 Wild House.

22
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,700
Hello.

23
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,320
Hello.

24
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,160
Hello.

25
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,940
Hello. My name is Chaz.

26
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,840
Hello.

27
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,020
And we are Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

28
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,480
And that's what you were just listening to was Einstein's Secret Orchestra performing for you.

29
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,640
That was last week's show.

30
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,620
Let's put last week's show away and create a whole new show just for you.

31
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,800
I think we should put this guy over here on the turntable where he belongs.

32
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,360
And start here.

33
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,560
Oh, I didn't want to do that.

34
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,720
Okay, there he is.

35
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,220
Break dancing.

36
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,620
Now by the time you get this communique, it'll be too late.

37
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,580
The pigs are outside the door.

38
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,160
What I want to know is who speaks for Earth.

39
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,280
Hey, here's Moansome Cowboy Dave.

40
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,860
Michelle down in the other studio on that box there of hers.

41
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,520
I'm sitting here with a keyboard.

42
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,440
And Dave's got his guitar.

43
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,340
And Lisa Lisa is over there.

44
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,840
And the Reverend Ivan Stein.

45
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,780
Standing right behind me.

46
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,900
And that's a dangerous proposition, boys and girls.

47
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,380
Praise God.

48
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,380
Praise God.

49
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,040
Princess Lisa.

50
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,300
The KY Jelly is ready to go.

51
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,000
And everyone is standing around in line.

52
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,600
Look, they fell for it again.

53
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,700
They're back again.

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,040
Told you they'd do it.

55
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,140
And they always fall for it every time.

56
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,360
Always will again and again.

57
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,480
Thought you could get away, did you?

58
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,720
Look at it.

59
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,520
He doesn't even remember, does he?

60
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,180
No, no, no.

61
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,700
Just let him guess.

62
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,680
We'll just let him drift in and out of realities for a while.

63
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,400
Who speaks for Earth?

64
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,240
Who sells for Earth?

65
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,340
And who is the one who sells for Earth?

66
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,940
Who will buy Earth?

67
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,920
Here's one for Mother.

68
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,340
You are about to discover a part of yourself that you have never dared dream might exist.

69
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:19,900
This show will be a personal experience between you and the man with the pipe.

70
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:30,640
You are about to rip open a yawning chasm in what you thought was your personality.

71
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,520
You will stand on the brink of a hole deep within yourself.

72
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:46,960
A pit, a pit, a stinky pit, and then the very deepest, blackest part of the pit that is your mind.

73
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,880
You will discover a secret.

74
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,400
Bob.

75
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,780
Bob?

76
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,280
But first let's step back out into the real world.

77
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,980
The real world.

78
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,520
The real world.

79
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,040
Now that you have achieved, Transstate, come with us.

80
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,380
Come and travel in the astral plains as we seek.

81
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,760
That which is dark.

82
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,040
But first you must pull loose from your own body.

83
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,160
Yes, it's easy.

84
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,040
Just a little tug.

85
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,660
Close your eyes.

86
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,280
Float upward and give your soul a little tug.

87
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
You see?

88
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,720
You're free, you're free.

89
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,000
You never thought you're so.

90
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,760
Your soul a little tug.

91
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,900
You never thought it would be so easy, did you?

92
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,920
Then let's go upwards.

93
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,700
Let's float.

94
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,240
Upwards.

95
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,180
To get perspective.

96
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,760
Upwards.

97
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,620
Higher.

98
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,200
Towards heaven.

99
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,960
But we'll stop here in space first.

100
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,680
Just past the Earth's atmosphere.

101
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,020
You see?

102
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,920
We can go anywhere instantly this way.

103
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:18,980
And it's...

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000


105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,180
It all was so easy.

106
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,780
Right within humanity's grasp all along.

107
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,060
And you know the secret.

108
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,220
Really.

109
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,580
You can go anywhere.

110
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,340
Let's try something new.

111
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:34,620


112
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,180
Ça n'est pas à la fois

113
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,180


114
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,180


115
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,180


116
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,180


117
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,180


118
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,440

Oh, it's beautiful down here.

132
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,380
We could just float along and watch the fish.

133
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,480
Or...

134
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,180
Or...

135
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,180


136
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,140
Or...

137
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,400
I can plunge you into this trench

138
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,100
in the middle of this blistering hell planet

139
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,100
and send it to you to sit in chains in this ditch forever.

140
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,840
Just waiting, waiting

141
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,120
until the ticks come again.

142
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,020
Yes, just waiting.

143
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,500
The giant ticks.

144
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,520
Here they come again.

145
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,960
Press a shooting.

146
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,620
Don't look.

147
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,140
They may look.

148
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,380
Keep shooting.

149
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,500
Shoot another one in another hour

150
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,120
and you'll never kill them all.

151
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,460
Keep shooting.

152
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,120
Keep shooting.

153
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
Just keep shooting

154
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,520
or they'll get you.

155
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,940
See, just like your job.

156
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,760
Back at home, ain't it, boy?

157
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,140
Yep.

158
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,800
You just can't get away.

159
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,240
You can't get away from them...

160
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,780
them ticks, my friends.

161
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,880
So join them.

162
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,800
The father's never answered one of my prayers.

163
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,840
I've made obeisance.

164
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,560
I've made obeisance.

165
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,380
Well, you've paid obeisance, Dave,

166
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,380
but did you pay money?

167
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,860
Actual cash, green and gravel.

168
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,940
Think about it, boys.

169
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,120
Don't wait till everyone in your neighborhood's got the bomb.

170
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:34,940
Nuke them.

171
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,780
Now at Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse.

172
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,700
Hi, friends.

173
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,280
I'm Hiroshima Schwartz of Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse,

174
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,440
home of the Mini-Mag, the Pocket Thunder,

175
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,900
the baby neutrino that leaves their apartments intact,

176
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,120
and many other fine, low-range, low-rad nukes.

177
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,060
These teeny-tiny warheads actually fit in your wallet, purse, or pocketbook.

178
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,160
And what's on special this week at Hiroshima Schwartz?

179
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,000
It's the giant X-Day Drill Sale.

180
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,080
Now until the wee-wee hours of July 6, 1996.

181
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:13,320
We are literally giving away tons and tons of useless and useful weapons.

182
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,880
It's the Werner Von Braumeister Party Special

183
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,300
that blows away 50 party pinks at a time, leaving the party intact.

184
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,520
Disguised as a four-gallon keg, that first draft really packs a wallop.

185
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,940
But for paid subgenius, it's the Smart Prairie Squid Face Seeking Special.

186
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,260
I'm sorry, I always get that wrong.

187
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,760
It reads your mind and literally knows where to send the warby.

188
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,840
Finally, now until X-Day, bloodier than any golf pro,

189
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,160
it's the exploding head of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

190
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,100
When the pipe lights, it's armed.

191
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,000
When launched, it zaps up to 100.

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,260
That's 100 useless bobbies at a time.

193
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,000
Friends, don't wait till it's too late.

194
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,620
Everyone will soon have the bomb.

195
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,740
Nuke them now.

196
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,680
From now till X-Day and beyond,

197
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,140
we are literally blowing up the competition.

198
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,940
Hiroshima Schwartz's X-Day End of the World Sale.

199
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,840
Tell them Bob sent you and received 23% off.

200
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,860
Batteries not included.

201
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,620
Some assembly required.

202
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,000
You know, I've been eating alien shmigma pie for almost 50 years

203
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,040
since those first shawster crashes near Roswell.

204
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,820
My sons growed up on it. His sons too.

205
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,380
Here in Wilberville, it's as natural as pie.

206
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,840
But many folks don't know about alien shmigma pie.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,820
Things kind of changed since we landed on the moon.

208
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,640
Some things we didn't even know.

209
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,600
Some folks believe in things called gray.

210
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,720
Can't sell it.

211
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:55,720


212
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,100
Gramps!

213
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,280
Gramps, Jillian.

214
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:56,780


215
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,180
Did you bid my fall back to events.

216
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:14,560
Please.

217
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,720
from alien genitalia.

218
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,040
It's made me sexually active again.

219
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,260
And it tastes great.

220
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,440
That's all I know.

221
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,640
Building a new race in this life is hard.

222
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,720
And nothing gets it as hard

223
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,140
as alien smegma pie.

224
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,440
Alien smegma pie.

225
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,360
The taste that's out of this world.

226
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,720
Bob loves me.

227
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,100
And I love Bob.

228
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,740
He hates you.

229
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,320
He hates you.

230
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,260
I love Bob.

231
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,080
And Bob loves me.

232
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,300
No, he hates you, Dave.

233
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,440
He hates you.

234
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,420
Bob hates you.

235
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,140
J.R. Bob Dobbs has answered

236
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,340
all of my questions.

237
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,180
He even told me

238
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,560
go and fling myself down the stairs.

239
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,700
I did it on a lark,

240
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,300
but now I'm glad.

241
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,920
Bob loves me.

242
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,440
And I love Bob.

243
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,240
He hates you.

244
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,220
You may love Bob,

245
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,240
but Bob hates you, Dave.

246
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,520
He makes you fling yourself down the stairs for fun.

247
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,740
Oh, I love Bob.

248
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,480
And Bob loves me.

249
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,240
We're sweet and slimy

250
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,940
just like little bricks on a tree.

251
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,340
And tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

252
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,680
He calls me on Valentine's Day.

253
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,840
And I'm sending flowers and chocolate.

254
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,100
And he loves me anyway.

255
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,060
I'm sending...

256
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,820
Bob loves me.

257
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,900
And I love Bob.

258
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,340
He hates you, Dave.

259
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,740
What could be more pure?

260
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,500
It's the purest form of love anyone could imagine.

261
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,040
He answers all my letters.

262
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,120
He calls me up and leaves messages on my phone.

263
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,340
He's always with me.

264
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,260
He's always with me.

265
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,040
The computer does all of that, Dave.

266
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,060
And I love Bob.

267
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,000
And I love Bob.

268
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,920
Don't be a sucker.

269
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,980
I may mess it up for you.

270
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:01,980


271
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:01,980


272
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,760
I'm sensible.

273
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,340
I'm modes.

274
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,340


275
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,640
my answer is whether you like me or the computer.

276
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:14,640


277
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,600
I can't help myself since you looked at meet you.

278
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:16,780
Maybe in Cosmody.

279
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,260
My answer is this.

280
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,260


281
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,940
You even send me tutte les lettuces,

282
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,280
peaches and frits.

283
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,780
To the police afore буßt với dich.

284
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,640
Whoa.

285
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:19,640


286
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:19,640


287
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:19,640


288
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,720
He turns up.

289
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,920
しか nichts.

290
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,700
Oh, my love.

291
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,680
Stop talking.

292
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,880
You don't want to.

293
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,840
This is what Bob meant when he said,

294
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,380
pull the wool over your own eyes.

295
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,400
I can't see anything.

296
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,660
Oh, I'm going blind.

297
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,160
I'm going blind.

298
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,040
But you can still see Bob in your mind's eye, can't you, Dave?

299
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,360
My mind.

300
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,260
You never stop seeing Bob in your mind's eye.

301
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,000
I can't stop.

302
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,760
Such as it is.

303
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,400
My mind?

304
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,340
What there is of it.

305
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,060
What?

306
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,520
What?

307
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,480
Your mind.

308
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,740
Your mind is no longer your friend.

309
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,180
I'm a physical person.

310
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,200
I'm in love.

311
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,900
I'm in lust.

312
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,100
I'm in love with Bob, and I don't care what you say.

313
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,920
I love Bob, and Bob loves me.

314
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,460
Bob does love a fool.

315
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,360
That's true.

316
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,820
Bob loves the fools of this world,

317
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,560
and truly the king of fools is Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

318
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,140
now performing the greatest guitar solo in the universe.

319
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,780
Bob's

320
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:31,780


321
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,600
Rock out, baby.

322
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,120
Play it, Dave.

323
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,040
I don't hear the music, but don't make me go.

324
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,860
What do you mean, which one?

325
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,060
I thought that was all these strings.

326
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:52,140
And you see, friends, you'll see how the love of Bob has freed Dave from the ponderous

327
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,120
real life around him.

328
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,660
He pays no attention to what other people might think of him.

329
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,500
Sure, they think he's a fool, but he's not.

330
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


331
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


332
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


333
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


334
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


335
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


336
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


337
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


338
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


339
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


340
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


341
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


342
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


343
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


344
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,440
They think he's a fool, an idiot, a bad person, a half-janger.

345
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,280
But he's happy.

346
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,120
You can hear the simple happiness in his voice.

347
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,540
He's a form of expression.

348
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,620
I can't express how happy I was when I think about it.

349
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,860
Oh, don't think about it.

350
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,860
You won't be so happy if you stop and think about it.

351
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,880
Now, will you, Dave?

352
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,040
Why are my pants all wet?

353
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,400
What's wrong with me?

354
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,480
And how come I can't even breathe?

355
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


356
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


357
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


358
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


359
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


360
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


361
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


362
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


363
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


364
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


365
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


366
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


367
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,480


368
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,760
Why can't I close my mouth or open my eyes?

369
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:38,500
And why doesn't Bob ever call a writer, answer my letters, or move anything on my message

370
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:38,880
machine?

371
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,200
You're not losing your faith now, are you, Dave?

372
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,440
That would be a great sin, a grievous sin indeed.

373
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,260
To lose one's faith.

374
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,980
To lose one's faith in Bob.

375
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,320
I have no faith in Bob.

376
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,580
Bob has no faith.

377
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,780
He has no faith, meaning he only has a head.

378
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,460
He cannot have a head.

379
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,580
He cannot have a face and a head.

380
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,900
To the world's little God, John has had two faces on his head.

381
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,140
Neither one of them were looking at the same thing at the same time.

382
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,920
And Bob can see you out of each one of those dots on his face, like multifaceted eyes of

383
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,200
the mighty insect.

384
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,560
The mightiest insect.

385
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,200
Boing, boing, boing, what's happening to my brain?

386
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,160
The mightiest insect is the Dobson fly.

387
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,080
It's growing from its little tiny peel.

388
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,460
It's growing from its little tiny peel.

389
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,700
Like, hmm, into a magnificent, magnificent brain.

390
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:46,080
Yes, the sucking bugs of the amazing Northern Ohio area include, among the order Hemptera,

391
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,320
I said the order Hemptera.

392
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,160
The sucking bugs, the bugs who suck things through pipes, such as the water scorpion

393
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,480
and the rantrofusca.

394
00:18:59,460 --> 00:18:59,460


395
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,820
The giant water bug. Did you ever see that movie, The Giant Water Bug?

396
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,020
That was great. The Giant Water Boatman was the sequel.

397
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,440
These are lovely and interesting insects of the Northern Ohio swamp areas.

398
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:21,580
But, aside from the pleasant, happy-go-lucky order Hemp Terra,

399
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:32,560
one also finds the order Neuroptera, which includes, in the sinister family Cory Dolly Day,

400
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,720
Do you hear the significance of that? Cory Dolly Day?

401
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,600
Like Salvador Dolly Day?

402
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:48,020
We find a creature, yes, a living, actual bug of the Northern Ohio swamp areas, called the Dobson Fly.

403
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,440
The Dobson Fly?

404
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,180
The Dobson Fly, which is a...

405
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,560
You know what?

406
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:58,620
You can go see a stuffed, mounted example of this hideous, vicious beast in the Cleveland Natural History Museum.

407
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:06,760
The Dobson Fly, while surrounded by lovely butterflies and not-too-alien-looking dragonflies,

408
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:16,060
you'll notice that the Dobson Fly has the head of a vicious red ant with hideous, clicking mandibles,

409
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:21,560
and the body, a body that resembles the tail of a rattlesnake.

410
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,680
Horrible, flapping, leathery wings.

411
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,440
Yes, the Dobson Fly.

412
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,000
This is not some biological freak that we're making up.

413
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,300
I'm afraid there are thousands of Dobson Fly larvae.

414
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,760
Now, they are in their season, their 50-year season.

415
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,340
As evolution lied, is evolution alive?

416
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,500
It was in the 40s.

417
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:51,080
In the 1940s was the last time the Dobson Fly cycle reached its peak.

418
00:20:51,080 --> 00:21:00,840
And thousands died as these pincher-like beaks of billions of Dobson Flies attacked the suburbs of Cleveland.

419
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,500
Oh, the days of Velikovsky.

420
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,920
I thought it was Wassily Kandusky.

421
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:13,420
And every time you swatted a Dobson Fly, a million eggs would squirt out of its ruptured abdomen.

422
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,460
Each egg hatching into another million Dobson Flies.

423
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,760
And each time you tried to squash one of those, it would hatch another million.

424
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,580
Evolution has no plan.

425
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,940
You see, friends, man likes to think himself the grandest thing in all of God's great creation.

426
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,060
But indeed, no, it is the great order of the insectorii.

427
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,040
The great brain of all collective insect hives and tribes

428
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,120
is a billion times smarter than any single insect.

429
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,360
It has an ego-centered human brain.

430
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:59,800
Certainly, one Dobson Fly or one tick may possess a rudimentary brain,

431
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,980
but they can communicate by radio with each other.

432
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,280
And the millions of each species each forms a great brain of that species.

433
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,680
And those brains get together to form brains.

434
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,780
And let's face it, you're outsmarted, Mr. Earth Boy, Mr. Human, Mr. Two-Legged,

435
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,000
Mr. Two-Using Prime.

436
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,660
Mr. Thinks-He-Saw, Big-Time Smarty Pants.

437
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,440
But you know, if you took that human back into the early Devonian period,

438
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,400
even here in the lovely Northern Ohio area,

439
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,840
you would find that there was no Devo.

440
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,120
No Devo?

441
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,940
No Devo.

442
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,740
But because there was a slimy ocean covering the Northern Ohio plains,

443
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,100
a filthy, sewer-like, shallow plain.

444
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,400
But murky, muddy, disgusting, smelly ocean.

445
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,020
And in the depths of these foul, murky puddles,

446
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,480
there grew such creatures as the Dunkleosteus.

447
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,820
Yes, the Dunkleosteus.

448
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,440
And friends, I hate to tell you this, but there is a...

449
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,800
It's true that there was an ancient plant discovered, fossil of this plant,

450
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,720
and they named it...

451
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,000
Yes, the Clevelandodendron Ohioensis.

452
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,780
4411-O-E-S.

453
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,020
No, seriously, the Clevelandendor...

454
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,020
Clevelandendodron Ohioensis.

455
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,980
That was merely, however, just a tube-like plant with teeth and thousands of eyes.

456
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,180
From Club Moss.

457
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,980
Einstein's secret...

458
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,780
Yeah, I mean, Club Moss was a great place back then.

459
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,220
I saw Devo at Club Moss.

460
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,500
Yeah.

461
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,200
In the Devonian period.

462
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,980
Einstein's secret orchestra.

463
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,400
ESO Radio, boys and girls.

464
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,560
Ivan Stang...

465
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,200
in the house.

466
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:04,520
Now, as usual, speaking of the all themes of the insect kingdom,

467
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,020
we notice that through these over-exaggerated sense of smell,

468
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:17,040
that they also keep, in a form of ESP, extrasensory contact with each and every other member of their community.

469
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,080
And as we notice here, if I expose one of these insects to this molasses,

470
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,800
all of the rest of the insects will begin to come within the air,

471
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:30,180
even if they have been exposed, or have been held in this container,

472
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,780
and are incapable of actually smelling the molasses.

473
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,940
As soon as they're released, they all begin exploding,

474
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:41,140
because some of them have distillate charges in the back of the vacuum in.

475
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,280
Some of them have even approached 300 feet in length,

476
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,020
and some of them are already dead.

477
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,020
And some of them are well over 2,000 pounds.

478
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,960
And I see them in my dreams.

479
00:24:53,540 --> 00:25:00,240
I keep on thinking that one of them was with Harry that night when they went over the edge.

480
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,780
Worship.

481
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,300
Worship.

482
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,700
Worship.

483
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,980
And confess to me.

484
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,480
And confess to me.

485
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,460
And confess to me.

486
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:26,340
In this small, dark room.

487
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,260
I take my corpse.

488
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,120
Back.

489
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,020


490
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,100
Back up.

491
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,280
Back up.

492
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,360
Back up.

493
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,320
Back up.

494
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,020
Back up.

495
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,340
The white zone is for immediate loading.

496
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,260
These phobias can be conquered.

497
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:40,620
No, but the most insects were there the night Harry went over the edge.

498
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:48,840
Oh, Jesus.

499
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,440
And how can we surmise that from this incident,

500
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,100
the head of J.R. Bob Dobbs did emerge into the lustrous as a numinous being?

501
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:14,620
I don't know, but you can find out by coming to the X-Day Drill in Brushwood, New York,

502
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,580
on July 5th through 7th this year and every year from now till X-Day.

503
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,500
That's right, Ivan, that's right.

504
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,540
I'll give you a call for free information about the amazing X-Day Drill.

505
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,400
Yes, it's like the legendary Doc Stock.

506
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,140
That's right, Ivan, that's right.

507
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,800
Oh, you'll see the most hanged preachers of the subgenius church.

508
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:43,620
You'll camp out on a lovely, fully developed campground surrounded by abandoned geeks.

509
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,680
You'd rather not ever spend much time with them.

510
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,880
But by God, you'll know more about the subgenius,

511
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:57,320
because, friends, you will have practice for that fatal day, that glorious day, X-Day.

512
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,380
Yes, only two years from now, in 1998, the sex goddesses,

513
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,180
from Planet X, shall come in their space vessels

514
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:11,500
and rupture up the news paying fully Dobbs-approved subgenius ministers.

515
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,160
That's right, Ivan.

516
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,440
All 4,000 of us, and destroy the rest of the planet.

517
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,080
That's right, Ivan.

518
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:24,780
Well, not destroy it, but turn it back into the stinking swamp that it was before the filthy humans came along and muddied everything up.

519
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,880
But, friends, you can come along and muddy everything up.

520
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,420
You can wallow in the filth.

521
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,300
You can dance all night.

522
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,280
Oh, whoa.

523
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,580
You can pull your clothes off and county law doesn't care,

524
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,360
because we are having the first X-Day drill this July 5th through 7th.

525
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,840
Sunday, Sunday.

526
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,780
Sunday!

527
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,840
You'll see the pill.

528
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,380
You'll see the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

529
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:55,540
It lives, it bleeds for you if you don't vomit your money back.

530
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,940
Friends, you will see things you wouldn't dare believe,

531
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,760
things you never wanted to believe,

532
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,260
and things you'll wish you'd never had.

533
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,820
Things you never saw.

534
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,720
That's right, Ivan.

535
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,860
Yetis will be copulating in the bushes.

536
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,580
Oh, dude.

537
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,600
The Loch Ness Monster will rise up from the little pond.

538
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,620
The crazed pagan drummers will drum all night long and keep you from sleeping.

539
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,860
Mosquitoes the size of dogs and flies will devour you, but you won't care.

540
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:30,780
You won't care because you spent your money and came to the X-Day drill July 5th through 7th in Brushwood, New York.

541
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,620
Brushwood, New York.

542
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,260
Only in Brushwood, New York.

543
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,520
Only three hours from Cleveland.

544
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,880
And friends, you can call for information.

545
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,560
216-556-0338.

546
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,040
I'll give that number again.

547
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,220
Write that number down.

548
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,700
It's the free information divival hotline at the Church of the Subgenius here in Cleveland.

549
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,920
556-0338.

550
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,660
That's 556-0338.

551
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,500
What do those numbers add up to?

552
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:58,880
Aha!

553
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,040
Now you know the secret.

554
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,240
Now you know what we're really trying to tell you.

555
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,480
The froth.

556
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,520
Yes, the froth.

557
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,840
There's no interest in buckets of froth.

558
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,420
Back tubs full of froth.

559
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,140
Three months tired.

560
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,340
That's right, I've had a froth.

561
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,360
An ancient Babylonian ocean full of froth.

562
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,860
Well, gee.

563
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,560
Ancient Tibetan herbs growing right up under your feet.

564
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,940
You won't be able to sleep.

565
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,840
There'll be so much froth growing at high speed underneath your sleeping bag tossing you around.

566
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,580
It's like a giant funhouse.

567
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,720
Yes, it's insane.

568
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,620
It's crazy.

569
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,220
But ain't it always been the crazy?

570
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,220


571
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,460
Crazy people that were able to party like they knew how?

572
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,140
Yes, sir, e-bomb.

573
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,260
Yes, sir, ma'am.

574
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,780
Sir, lady.

575
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,220
You will finally learn what it's like to be a subgenius.

576
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,220
That's right.

577
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,380
I've been staying in the Church of the Subgenius since...

578
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,460
Oh, did I say that?

579
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,400
Well, then pick up on it, man.

580
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,020
Hmm.

581
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,580
Oh, my God.

582
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:01,760


583
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:01,760


584
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:01,800


585
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:01,800


586
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:01,800


587
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:01,800


588
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:01,800


589
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:01,800


590
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:01,800


591
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:01,800


592
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:13,360
I wish I could make it to the top, like I always do.

593
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,240
It says at the end of the world, she'll come in a great flash.

594
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,100
I sure hope so.

595
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,180
Some people might go and the other ones might last.

596
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,720
Will you be the one who goes?

597
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,280
Well, you'll be on next day, brother.

598
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,900
Where is your where will you be on x-day brother?

599
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,460
Will you be on x-day brother?

600
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,500
Will you be in the sauce with me?

601
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,200
There's still lots of room

602
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,740
Or will you be down in the room?

603
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,100
You can have anything you want

604
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,940
Will you be burning?

605
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,700
Excessive

606
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,480
Empty sink

607
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,560
Will it be perfect pleasure?

608
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,560
Perfect pain

609
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,900
Which will it be?

610
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,380
It's up to you to choose

611
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,780
Bob gives you free will

612
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,340
But you can't feel anything

613
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,080
Until you sign on the dotted line

614
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,980
And x-day is coming so

615
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,580
You better move fast because

616
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,260
Where will you be on x-day?

617
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,100
I got plenty of time

618
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,800
To spend my thirty dollars on that Bob ministership

619
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,540
I got plenty of time else

620
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,360
Two more years for x-day

621
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,000
Why am I in any kind of hurry?

622
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,780
There couldn't possibly have been

623
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,340
Some kind of a misprint

624
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,500
In the book of the subgenius

625
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,940
I mean just because that first edition

626
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,980
From McGraw-Hill actually did say

627
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,400
That x-day was on July 5th 1996

628
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,160
Well they changed it after that

629
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,460
I'm sure that I mean it looked like a mistake

630
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,040
Probably was a mistake

631
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,320
I don't think I really have to spend

632
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,180
That thirty dollars quite yet

633
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,460
Because that probably was just

634
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,920
It's probably not that the world's gonna end

635
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,260
In this year 1996

636
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,760
Probably not I could probably afford to take that risk

637
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,620
I mean I've got that thirty dollars

638
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,640
That's not the problem

639
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,920
But there's this Hootie and the Blowfish

640
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,580
CD I wanted to get

641
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,640
And well you know I wanted to go to this movie

642
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,480
About waterspouts and

643
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Well I just I just

644
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,960
You know I mean Bob will wait on me

645
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,960
I mean Bob's a patient man

646
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,020
He ain't a wrathful God now is he?

647
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,960
I heard Bob will love the subgeniuses

648
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,500
Even if they never spend any money

649
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,860
A patient man? A patient man?

650
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,740
Man he ain't no patient

651
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,960
Bob is the doctor

652
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,600
He ain't no patient man

653
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:46,180
Bob is the surgeon who will excise

654
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,500
The filthy rotting tumor that is America

655
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,240
That is modern America today

656
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,440
Yes my fellow rebellious citizens

657
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,760
And untaxed payers

658
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,220
And militia members

659
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,540
All the citizens of courts

660
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,780
We must come to get them quick

661
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,840
They're coming they're trying to stop me from speaking

662
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,460
All of us religious nuts

663
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,100
And crazy right wing maniacs

664
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,780
We must band together against the man

665
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,400
Because oh wait they're coming

666
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,300
I've got to get my message out

667
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,500
The last true hope is

668
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,800
5560338

669
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,880
Call 55603

670
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,140
Here they come no no

671
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,260
I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be

672
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,520
Ba ba ba ba ba

673
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,960
I won't give you long to me

674
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,780
Ho ba ho ba ba

675
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,900
You'll love the lamb more than one day

676
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,120
Mini mini mini mini mini bow

677
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,780
I'm gonna tell them not that I won't

678
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,060
Boo ba ba boo ba ba boo ba ba

679
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,980
I won't tell them not that I won't

680
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,840
Mini mini bob mini ba ba boo

681
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,420
Hey!

682
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,940
Hey!

683
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:20,940


684
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,580
Huh!

685
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,660
Ah!

686
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,300
Huh!

687
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:31,960
Ah!

688
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,760
Hey!

689
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:35,760


690
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,380
Got a cobra snake for a necktie

691
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,460
Got me a church by the roadside

692
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,240
Made out of rattlesnake hide

693
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,740
Bob is gonna ask you who do you love

694
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,740
Bob is gonna ask you who do you love

695
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,620
Bob is gonna ask you who do you love

696
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,460
Bob is gonna ask you who do you love

697
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,640
Oh my god!

698
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,440
I'm gonna tell you who do you love

699
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:15,440


700
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,420
Oh I tried to win you but you dropped me

701
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:20,700
But

702
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,560
You love me

703
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,860
Got me around

704
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,240
To hell

705
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,520
To hell

706
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,240
To hell

707
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,340
To hell

708
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:31,880
To hell

709
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,220
To hell

710
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,220


711
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,220


712
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,360
Oh I need more

713
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,300
Such ropes

714
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,820
Just how I fell

715
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,320
Ha ha!

716
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,500
Ha ha!

717
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,480
Hey!

718
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,740
Hey!

719
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
Ha ha!

720
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,440


721
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,440


722
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,060
Ohhhhh

723
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,060


724
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,780
Thud

725
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:52,780


726
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:01,780
Ah!

727
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:01,780


728
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:01,780


729
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:01,780


730
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:01,820
Wooah!

731
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:01,820


732
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:01,820


733
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,060
I love you.

734
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,900
I fade away.

735
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,320
I love you.

736
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,200
I fade away.

737
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,200


738
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,400
I fade away.

739
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,700
I love you.

740
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,840
I fade away.

741
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,120
I love you.

742
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,760
I fade away.

743
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,960
Bob's love faded like one glistening dewdrop.

744
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,700
It's gone, man.

745
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,460
He hates you. He hates you, man.

746
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,460
Give it up. Give it up.

747
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,860
He don't love you, man. Bob never loved you in your whole life, man.

748
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,900
He don't care one

749
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,440
about you, dude.

750
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,820
You got to get it right, Brumper.

751
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,980
Your head screwed on the wrong man.

752
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,220
Bob don't love you. Hates you, man.

753
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,280
You understand the meaning of the word? Hates.

754
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,620
Ask yourself, are you worthy?

755
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,320
Are you really even

756
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,900
worthy of his hate?

757
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,800
To me? Am I worthy?

758
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,320
Of Bob's hate?

759
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,400
Of course I'm worthy of Bob's hate.

760
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:58,180
Everybody hates me. I'm one of the most hated

761
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,000
men ever to walk the earth.

762
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,280
There's no reason why I dare

763
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,540
Bob Dobbs, the old hate-meister,

764
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,580
wouldn't want to give me a few stabs at the old

765
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,500
Pogues and Eyeball.

766
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,300
I'm afraid you flatter yourself, Dave.

767
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,240
Oh, man. It's a form of love, dude.

768
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,940
You know, like, he beats you up

769
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,160
because he loves you. It's like a heavy thing.

770
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,760
You know, it's like a tough love.

771
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,380
You know what I mean?

772
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,140
What's so close to that?

773
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,840
But you know, Dobbs did love Dave.

774
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,780
And there have always been days.

775
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,600
Yes, for thousands,

776
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,180
millions, and millions of years,

777
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,880
there have been days.

778
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,680
Lonesome cowboy days.

779
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,260
Generally ignored

780
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,460
by science for obvious reasons.

781
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,860
But,

782
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,140
this month only in Cleveland

783
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,300
Natural History Museum, there is

784
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,080
in fact a display.

785
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,700
A rather large

786
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,340
exhibit called

787
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,800
Cleveland Before Bob.

788
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,360
In which one may

789
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,340
actually see fossils of the ancient

790
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,560
peoples. The precursors

791
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,940
to the modern Dave.

792
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,080
The Dave that we unfortunately

793
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,360
know now. There have

794
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,280
been, for instance, there's

795
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,180
quite a wonderful set of

796
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,500
artifacts that were raised up

797
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,740
from the P-Dog site.

798
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,360
There, that prove that

799
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,540
even the early Dave-onians

800
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,200
were tool using.

801
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,460
Not quite at the level of

802
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,180
primates.

803
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,360
They had an unusual,

804
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,340
there were an unusually

805
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,140
large number of stone

806
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,220
pot shards.

807
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,300
As well as, oddly enough,

808
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,280
many pot sherds

809
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,680
found at this dig.

810
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,360
Obviously pots

811
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,060
were used,

812
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,920
overused, probably.

813
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,380
Abused.

814
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,040
Yes, the abused pots. They were

815
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,260
broken all over the place.

816
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,060
Old clothes. However,

817
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,900
we do know that the ancient Dave's

818
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,560
had a sex life of some

819
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,160
kind. As we can see,

820
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,260
I see in this, a fairly

821
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,080
well honed

822
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,580
fluted

823
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,420
point.

824
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,200
Carved from stone.

825
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,580
And notice here, the wooden

826
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,560
fore shaft.

827
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,320
Of the ancient Dave

828
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,720
people.

829
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,880
Contained quite a wide

830
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,580
groove.

831
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,420
So you can take that wooden fore shaft.

832
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,400
The ancient Dave, them old Dave

833
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,320
men, the old Dave men

834
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,100
could take. They had a wooden fore shaft

835
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,680
with such a wide groove.

836
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,960
And the fluted point of it.

837
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,740
Nowadays, modern Dave,

838
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,240
it's not even made of wood.

839
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,440
It's just limp, like an old

840
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,940
wash rag. You've still got the fluted

841
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,260
point. But, you know,

842
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,620
it ain't nearly as sharp

843
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,980
as they used to be. Because the

844
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,460
ancient, strangely enough, the Neander Dave's

845
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,880
actually had a larger

846
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,140
cranial capacity than the

847
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,480
modern homo

848
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,100
Davean.

849
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,600
And so, the

850
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,360
Neander Dave,

851
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,440
the ancient Dave men,

852
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,620
were able to build nothing but

853
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,120
crude,

854
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,340
crude

855
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,340


856
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,340


857
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,340


858
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,340


859
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,640
pipes.

860
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,980
There are thousands of varieties

861
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,080
of pipes, shattered

862
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,880
pipes found in the ancient

863
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,680
settlement.

864
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,240
In which they smoked what, as far

865
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,160
as we can tell, wild

866
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,200
plant materials, including

867
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,260
dogwood. The bark

868
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,240
of the dogwood.

869
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,600
Which was quite strong,

870
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,300
quite a bit stronger than the bite of the dogwood.

871
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,880
Although it did have a good bite.

872
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,060
If he made you a dog stick,

873
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,040
dogwood stick, rolled you up,

874
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,640
run up some dogwood,

875
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,080
that does have a bite to it. Has a hell of a

876
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,960
bite to it. Man, brain too big

877
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,820
today. Smoke them dogwood.

878
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,760
Ow!

879
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,880
However, the ancient Dave

880
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,420
men had a natural enemy.

881
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,260
The mammothus primigenius.

882
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,320
Oh my god, here they come.

883
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,520
Or primigenius, or

884
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,460
which is Greek for primitive

885
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,800
subgenius. Ironically,

886
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,560
far more intelligent than the modern

887
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,680
subgenius. I want to play on the old record.

888
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,000
Proved by the fact that you're listening to this

889
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,320
show at all right now.

890
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,040
Want to smoke all the props?

891
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,660
Ah, here they come.

892
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,700
Unfortunately,

893
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,920
the largest display in the museum

894
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,480
showing the Dave men

895
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,920
is the items of unknown

896
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,180
function. Carefully

897
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,840
carved and intricately

898
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,120
decorated bone and ivory

899
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,660
fragments, which

900
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,100
the uses of which have yet

901
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,240
to be discovered. They seem to be senseless,

902
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,940
randomly created

903
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,440
perhaps some

904
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,920
scientists suspect they

905
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,460
may have been used to dislodge

906
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,560
unwanted objects from

907
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,200
obscure body parts.

908
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,940
The early Dave

909
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,640
men possessed more

910
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,660
orifices than the modern Dave

911
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,960
and made copious use of them.

912
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,800
And also thyroid wax

913
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,600
collector, also under

914
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,840
pineal nostril, also beneath

915
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,140
both follicles of the ear.

916
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,880
Ah, ah, ah, oh,

917
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,100
wow, wow.

918
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,800
In these ancient holographic films,

919
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,720
you can see the olden time Dave,

920
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,780
the primitive Dave,

921
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,200
chanting in their silly rituals,

922
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,640
yes, even then,

923
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,200
man had religion.

924
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,780
The Dave's buried their dead.

925
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,080
Infant Dave's fetus skeletons

926
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,980
have been found,

927
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,760
which showed signs

928
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,600
of having been ritually slaughtered

929
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,040
of a man.

930
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,040


931
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,040


932
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,040


933
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,240
The ancient Dave's

934
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:54,240


935
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:54,800
encouraged by their parents

936
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,260
for the delicacy,

937
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,080
the one item of diet that we know

938
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,840
that the ancient Dave men enjoyed

939
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,120
was fetus nads.

940
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,340
Don't quite know how to put that,

941
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,440
but certainly a serious delicacy.

942
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,360
Those things would go for

943
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,920
14.95 an ounce at least nowadays,

944
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:14,940
you know, down at the...

945
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,200
I want to show you...

946
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,440
Down at the Piggly Wiggly,

947
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,100
you can't hardly get fetus nads.

948
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,300
But the ancient Dave men were able

949
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:24,060


950
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,040
Time, time now.

951
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,460
Time to go out and harvest.

952
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,360
Harvest?

953
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,200
What was it we were harvesting?

954
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,500
This was during the dawn of agriculture.

955
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,620
And these ancient Dave men

956
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:40,380
were in fact what we call skull farmers.

957
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,040
Ah, there they are.

958
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,660
300 of them.

959
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,480
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

960
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,800
Just waiting to be glopped.

961
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,680
The women stay in the campground,

962
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,880
mating with the men from rival tribes

963
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,460
as the Daves were out in the fields

964
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,400
harvesting the skulls and the heads.

965
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,300
They tried to grow heads,

966
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,280
but generally they were so...

967
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,500
such badly skilled farmers

968
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,140
that they were able to only grow skulls

969
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,300
or else they'd forget to pluck their heads

970
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,980
until they had become skulls.

971
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,880
Ah, it's white. It is gleaming.

972
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,360
It is ready to lop.

973
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,240
And now what do we do afterwards?

974
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,460
We drink, we drink.

975
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,880
We carve out the skull and we drink.

976
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,280
And boy, these are big skulls

977
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,200
because we have such big brains.

978
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,700
But more to drink.

979
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,080
In a vain attempt to gain the intelligence

980
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,820
of the mighty mammoth,

981
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,800
the Dave would drink the brains of the mammoth.

982
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,160
To gain the courage of the mighty...

983
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,220
uh...

984
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,440
uh... cow.

985
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,240
And its craftiness and speed.

986
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,920
The ancient Dave men would drink the brains of the cows

987
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,140
or rather suck them up through crude stone pipes.

988
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,460
Now remember, son, when you drink cow,

989
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,060
you're imbued with all power of cow.

990
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:08,800
Strength, beauty, sleep, fast, quick, small, tiny, little...

991
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,920
Ah, shut up.

992
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,740
This is what is known as sympathetic magic.

993
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,780
Obviously, today in today's modern world,

994
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,220
we know better than to fall for simple, simple magic.

995
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,040
But there are superstitions.

996
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:25,420
I drank that genius's urine just for a taste of brilliance.

997
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,140
That's true.

998
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,280
There is the one exception.

999
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,340
Sympathetic magic does still work in the church of the subgenius.

1000
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,160
If you will but drink of the fluids of Bob,

1001
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,400
you will gain the wisdom of Bob.

1002
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,380
His... his great intellectual acuity will be yours.

1003
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,400
And you all know how smart Bob is.

1004
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,400
He's from the church of the sub-gum guys at subgenius.

1005
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,320
They're like old geniuses or something, right?

1006
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,720
Isn't that what they're trying to say or something?

1007
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,260
And Bob's a smart guy.

1008
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,600
And so if you kill Bob and drink of him,

1009
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,700
and eat of his body, then you'll be as smart...

1010
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,440
Nay! Nay, it's a lie, friends.

1011
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,320
Because Bob...

1012
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,760
Bob is not smart nor intelligent, but only lucky.

1013
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,400
So you don't drink of his brain.

1014
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:23,360
You drink of his other fluids until you have gained some of his luck.

1015
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,860
Drink his spinal fluids for good luck.

1016
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,720
Wear it on your head.

1017
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,940
His armpits sweat.

1018
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,220
Wear his armpits sweat on fat.

1019
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,280
If you can stand in front of Bob when he sneezes,

1020
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,520
you will be able to gain the viruses of Bob.

1021
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,260
His milk is his most precious.

1022
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,480
Oh, yes, his milk and fluid.

1023
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,920
If you clean up Bob's bathroom after he has finished in there,

1024
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,380
and I think you know what I mean, Bob.

1025
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,000
Hey, I just came to clean up.

1026
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,360
No, no, I wouldn't want to do anything like that.

1027
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,320
Just trying to fix the plumbing.

1028
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,400
You will gain his sales acumen.

1029
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,340
I will own the plumbing business around the rest of the world.

1030
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,360
I will control the plumbing enterprise of the planet.

1031
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,060
It's true, folks.

1032
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,140
You, too, can be just like the modern Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1033
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,680
This paragon of manhood and manly beauty.

1034
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:23,260
This confident and stalwart stud and cool guy.

1035
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,680
All you have to do is to know Dave is to know Bob.

1036
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:34,160
And to know Bob, you merely must call the secret number.

1037
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,180
Yes, this is a secret.

1038
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,540
Don't tell anybody.

1039
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,820
Turn your radio down.

1040
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,740
Get your pencil out.

1041
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:46,200
Call this number, 5560338.

1042
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,620
Go ahead, kids.

1043
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,260
Give it a try.

1044
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,320
What if you got to lose a little time, maybe?

1045
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,380
You did sign the application.

1046
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,100
Kids, don't forget to get your special Bob Dom's decoder ring

1047
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,720
that explodes in your face for only $49.95.

1048
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:04,500
Call now.

1049
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:42,300
You don't need these for murky state.

1050
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:42,740
To send me my proposal...

1051
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,200
I told my daughter I would

1052
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:44,200


1053
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,180
It rocked me, I thought that I was like Bill Clinton.

1054
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:46,180


1055
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:55,160
I heard the boy dream of angels

1056
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:05,460
Little darling, tell me why

1057
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:10,280
I get so cold looking in your eyes

1058
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,640
Is it you?

1059
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:11,700
Is it you?

1060
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,460
Baby, is it you?

1061
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,600
I heard the boy dream of angels

1062
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,240
I heard the boy dream of angels

1063
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,940
I heard the boy dream of angels

1064
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:37,940


1065
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:41,120
My little baby

1066
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,060
leaving this leather place

1067
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:43,060


1068
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:43,500
Leather and weight

1069
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,540
take a minute to find out

1070
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,580
Is it you?

1071
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,900
Baby, is it you?

1072
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,800
I heard the boy dream of angels

1073
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,580
Is it you?

1074
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,680
Is it you?

1075
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,400
Cause you controlling me

1076
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,520
Is it you?

1077
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:11,520


1078
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:11,620
Is it you?

1079
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:11,620


1080
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:11,620


1081
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:11,620


1082
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:11,620


1083
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:11,620


1084
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:11,620


1085
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:11,620


1086
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:11,620


1087
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:38,800
I'm a little darling

1088
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,640
Show me now

1089
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,180
Somewhere, somewhere, somehow

1090
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,020
Is it you?

1091
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,780
Oh, baby, is it you?

1092
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,040
I hope I dream of an angel

1093
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:08,580
I hope I dream of an angel

1094
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,200
I hope I dream of an angel

1095
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,480
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1096
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:37,260
Who speaks for earth?

1097
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,620
Who smells for earth?

1098
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:40,620


1099
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:40,620


1100
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:44,160
Who flies in the face of authority for earth?

1101
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,240
Why is none of it in the river?

1102
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,580
And I was staying with the church in the sub-games

1103
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,060
Who's paying the rent on earth?

1104
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,180
That's the question.

1105
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,580
Who's gonna take care of this bill?

1106
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,620
Who's paying?

1107
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,140
It's crammed by the pretty piggy.

1108
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,120
Well, who will stand for earth?

1109
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,400
I don't know. Maybe me.

1110
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,300
Maybe you.

1111
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:05,880

1122
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:59,880
inaccurate name it should be referred to as gigantanthropus it's more a primitive man than

1123
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:06,760
just merely some animal gigantopithecus he's a mission and an animal an animalistic thing but

half the size of the gigantanthropus the prehistoric yeti we call it prehistoric of

men up by our parts and swing us around their heads and we loved it oh it hurt yes it hurt but

1170
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:21,180
we loved it because we they were disciplining us you see we had discipline in those days the big

1171
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:28,760
women the bigger and hairy women taught us discipline and we thanked them for it yes we

1172
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:35,240
got down on our knees and we worshiped them we were polite to a woman in those days and i

1173
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,400
language didn't like this

1174
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,580
we exploited a woman who can do with respect for the woman

1175
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,860
this is a big boy

1176
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,960
when we when we

1177
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,760
when we decimated

1178
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:49,640
a race of gigantic yetis we did it out of respect

1179
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,840
and discipline

1180
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,420
we did it on time

1181
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,700
not like these slackers of today

1182
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,380
yes

1183
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,040
the five day slackers

1184
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,360
the old days the racking yeti women

1185
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,680
on time always on time

1186
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,980
the blood runs thin

1187
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,420
they have urine in their blood

1188
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:13,520
they're not like the yeti of yesteryear the yester yeti

1189
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,200
but boy they can make a pickle when they put under the armpit

1190
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:23,180
no i'm sorry i remember that sometimes from the yeti woman you could take a

1191
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,320
whole cucumber and slap one in the each armpit and make a pickle in five

1192
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:27,880
seconds

1193
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:35,660
and you too can get a whip off of one of them pickles

1194
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:42,280
if you come to the X-Day Drill, July 5th through 7th in Brushwood, New York.

1195
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,060
That's Sherman, New York.

1196
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,420
That's right.

1197
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,520
You'll find out all about that when you call that phone number.

1198
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,880
Call that important phone number.

1199
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,240
Who speaks for Earth?

1200
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:57,580
You can find out at 216-556-0338.

1201
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,960
Praise Jesus.

1202
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,100
And there ain't no Chinese fire drill, is there, Reverend Andy Stanton?

1203
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:07,040
Oh, hey, did you know that Jesus is now working for the Church of the Sub-Gene?

1204
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,880
I had heard that he was not only on the payroll,

1205
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,620
but that also that he was having eye surgery from some crooked Medicare program he was running.

1206
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,980
Well, this goes along with the job.

1207
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,420
We'd like to look after our employees, but it's true.

1208
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:24,700
The Lord Jesus Christ, who is now about 26 years old in this incarnation.

1209
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,380
26 to 52, somewhere in that range.

1210
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:32,280
Formerly the owner of the now-defunct Flying Lemur bookstore.

1211
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:36,000
But Jesus is now, has moved to Dallas.

1212
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,820
Jesus just left Chicago and has moved to Dallas.

1213
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:44,940
And he's filling the, he's taking over the mail order of the Church of the Sub-Genius, friends.

1214
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,320
He's the promotion, he's he who was foretold by Bob.

1215
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,760
They said he would come wearing one sandal.

1216
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:57,480
And he would buy a chariot from the Eritreans.

1217
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,020
And they would cheat him.

1218
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,800
And he would be screwed.

1219
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:02,640
And yet it is.

1220
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,360
Yes, it is as the prophecy said, friends.

1221
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,300
Praise Bob.

1222
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,760
We were saved.

1223
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,880
The smart money guy finally showed up.

1224
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,660
And this time he's got connections.

1225
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,480
You know what I mean?

1226
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,600
He's got family, if you know what I mean.

1227
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,980
Yeah, the Church of the Sub-Genius has got some new friends.

1228
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:27,260
The kind of friends that's got some muscle.

1229
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:33,080
You know, the kind of friends that if you cross Bob the wrong way, you may just wake up and say,

1230
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:33,080


1231
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:47,000
God will have wanted this ball and this ball.

1232
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,680
Do you have interest in the booby –

1233
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:49,680


1234
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:58,440
When I tell you that I'm addicted toesian energy –

1235
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,560
You know you just get obsessed with LISA JUNG.

1236
01:01:59,560 --> 01:01:59,940
That handles youriah hole, that helps the power of your mind.

1237
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:00,260
Be still.

1238
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,660
Thrust her with foundation.

1239
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:09,100
But he sheds. Now that it's summertime in Texas, Jesus is shedding all over the church.

1240
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,000
I can't believe Jesus depilated all over the church of the subterra.

1241
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:16,000
You mean all of his bodily hairs are laying around your area there?

1242
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,880
Yeah, thank you. Yes, I know.
