1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Hello! I'm scared! Let's hear a new echo!

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:16,040
Good evening and welcome to the subgenius radio hour of slime.

3
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,400
This is the end of the world.

4
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,360
The end of the world will come in July 1999.

5
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,720
Perhaps in the form of an atomic holocaust?

6
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,860
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand.

7
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,980
The lighthouse will confirm an order.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,400
The first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.

9
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,320
Those missiles have all gone off!

10
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,060
They pushed all the buttons!

11
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,860
You know what that means, don't you?

12
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,700
Either we fired first and they're going to try to hit what's left,

13
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,800
or they fired first and we just got our missiles out of the ground in time.

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,020
Either way, we're going to get hit.

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,840
So what are we still standing around here for?

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,820
Of course, since all human life has been under the surface of Earth for 16 years,

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,460
there was no actual loss of life in the sense we know it.

18
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,660
What's this?

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,540
What you get?

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,260
What you get?

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,920
What you get?

22
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,200
What the hell do you expect?

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,000
What do you expect?

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,580
What do you expect?

25
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,960
Pretty red roses.

26
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,900
White puppy noses.

27
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,540
Mammoth proper hoses.

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,760
It is more like it.

29
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:43,940
Oh!

30
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,800
The strange worshippers pull at their faces.

31
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,740
Despite himself, a strangled cry escapes Brent

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,660
as he sees the ghastly heritage of atomic radiation.

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,460
Hey, Tony, let's have some.

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,360
Get out of here.

35
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,480
Get out of here.

36
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,640
I mean, hell, this turn, the other cheap thing can be carried a bit too far, you know.

37
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,500
Hey, neighbor, let me give you some advice.

38
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,240
The Russians are about to pulverize us if I sleep tonight.

39
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,180
That is if the crazy Arab social rights don't get us first

40
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,400
and the fire will rain down from the sky.

41
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,320
The fire will rain down from the sky.

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,060
People die.

43
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,000
People die.

44
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,000
People die.

45
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,860
People die.

46
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,980
I love you.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,760
I love you.

48
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,600
The flying saucers are my friends

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,520
because they're so nice.

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,980
I'm gonna see them again and again.

51
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,780
Is that before or after the bob pills?

52
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,460
The Bob Pills.

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,360
And we are back.

54
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,260
The Bob Pills are this stop-and-go game for all types of loveierenness or for the investigating

55
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:22,500
inなら huh Huh fuck Yeah more and more

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,980
not just used to teaching something

57
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:23,980


58
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,040
no

59
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,440
were just

60
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,640
no

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,560
216-687-

62
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,820
If not, if not, if not, if not.

63
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,540
Call any time if this

64
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,680
is on the air.

65
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,500
Well, hey, Dr. Sinister, how's everything

66
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,100
going? Well, it's

67
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,520
been how long since I talked to you,

68
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,580
so that's a long story. And don't be

69
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,420
a stranger, Ragnar.

70
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,200
I know. I'm a stranger.

71
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,160
Yeah.

72
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,380
We guessed it was you. That call

73
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,440
from Kentucky was Ragnar.

74
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,440
Yeah. 859

75
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,680
represent. Yeah.

76
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,460
Well, the good

77
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,000
news and the bad news is that

78
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,780
I'm not as

79
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,660
in kind of a bad financial

80
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,480
situation as I am with the house.

81
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,300
Oh, that is good.

82
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,560
But the bad news is I will have to sell it.

83
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,660
Oh.

84
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,620
And then what?

85
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,880
And then I

86
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,360
severely declutter and I take a

87
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,280
smaller life into a new

88
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,500
apartment somewhere. But I've

89
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,180
come to the conclusion that I'm just not

90
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,800
ready to own a house. And

91
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,020
it came to a realization

92
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,860
with three things. When

93
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,080
my dad died and basically left

94
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,800
me with nothing because senile dementia

95
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,260
basically destroyed any inheritance

96
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,180
that I would have gotten for keeping

97
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,340
the house in good condition.

98
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,620
Then

99
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,800
the house started falling into

100
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,260
disrepair. And then

101
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,980
things that are major repairs like

102
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,020
a new heating and air conditioning and a new hot

103
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,120
water heater, things like that

104
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,140
just start stacking one on top of the other.

105
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,780
And I don't have

106
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,900
barely enough income to just keep

107
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,400
utilities going in my house

108
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,640
anyway. And

109
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,740
keeping up with the property tax also

110
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,940
every year became an

111
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,940
issue when I had medical issues last year

112
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,880
and had a nervous breakdown from working

113
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,020
at my new call center job for

114
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,060
a major

115
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,100
smartphone company. Let's just call them that.

116
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,620
Oh, smart, eh?

117
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,480
I'm sorry to hear that.

118
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,620
And

119
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,740
then I just

120
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,120
came to the realization one day.

121
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,060
That I don't have any kind of slack in my life

122
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,940
anymore because this house just

123
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,660
is a slack vampire to me.

124
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,820
The house that fed on slack.

125
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,440
It's a slack trap.

126
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,240
Exactly. It

127
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,500
became a slack trap.

128
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,020
Just make sure that you have a slack pad

129
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,640
to land on or in

130
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,020
first before you do

131
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,000
anything. Honestly, I have no

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
idea how people can afford to own houses.

133
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,000
And even living in a place like Cleveland where

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,160
the cost of living is relatively low and property

135
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,980
values are relatively low compared to other parts of the

136
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,100
country.

137
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,800
I would need to make literally twice as much

138
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,700
money as I make now to be able to

139
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,140
comfortably afford a house.

140
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,800
You're paying for the financial errors in the banking

141
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,680
system. That's what it is. You're paying for all the

142
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:05,940
annals.

143
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,980
I'm talking about basic maintenance.

144
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,200
Just basic maintenance.

145
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,740
And all that. And property tax

146
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,560
and all that. It's like,

147
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,740
yeah, I don't think I'm ever going to own a house

148
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,600
in my entire life. Ever.

149
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,860
Here's the good part of it. I talked to a real estate

150
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,880
agent yesterday who also happens to

151
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,640
be, you know, a radio

152
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
host of a major radio

153
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,680
program here in Kentucky.

154
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,080
Now that is a coincidence.

155
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,220
Well, he actually showed me the true value of the

156
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,700
house and the land. It was even less than you

157
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:35,920
thought.

158
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,820
No, actually, you remember the $75,000

159
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,660
that my dad stole from the home

160
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,240
equity loan?

161
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,920
Well, he

162
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,460
managed to borrow

163
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,640
$75,000 behind my back

164
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,500
on property that he never owned in the

165
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,400
first place.

166
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,340
Goodness.

167
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,000
That's some heavy horse trading

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,340
there.

169
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,480
Yeah, he actually

170
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,960
got a major bank, and I'm not

171
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,760
going to name the name,

172
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,860
out of respect, because I don't want to get

173
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,040
sued necessarily. Well, that's a good thing.

174
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,940
Yeah, but he got

175
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,780
a major bank to sign off on a loan

176
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,920
on property that was never in his name

177
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,160
to begin with, and

178
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,520
left me holding the bag for the loan.

179
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,940
But here's the deal. When I

180
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,660
turn around and sell the house,

181
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,800
which is actually going to be more than

182
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,860
the amount of $75,000 that was

183
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,800
borrowed against it,

184
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,180
I'll hold that whole amount in

185
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,780
escrow to where I can't touch

186
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,540
it and the bank can't touch it.

187
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,740
And I'm going to say, you want that

188
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,900
$75,000? You show

189
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,600
a judge that that loan document

190
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,540
exists. Then I'll release it.

191
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,220
And you heard it here first.

192
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,540
All of Northern Ohio is

193
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,500
inspired by your story. Your

194
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,280
inspiring story, Ragnar.

195
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,320
We want to be like you.

196
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,260
You're giving away your plans there, man.

197
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,280
You're tipping your hand.

198
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,060
Be like Elvis. Give your house away.

199
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,080
But how many people are listening after all?

200
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,260
What if I gave it away as a

201
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,660
habitat for humanity restore?

202
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,180
Imagine the tax refund on that one.

203
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,940
Why don't you just incorporate

204
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,020
as a church?

205
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,960
Why don't you just incorporate as a church?

206
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,100
Well, here's the even better

207
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,080
part of it. Princess Wee,

208
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
do you remember me showing that beautiful

209
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,200
photo of that beautiful woman in Montreal, Canada?

210
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,540
Yes, I do.

211
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,120
I may just as well

212
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,980
cross the border and go live with her

213
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,160
if Trump gets elected. She's not really a woman,

214
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,800
Ragnar.

215
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,640
It's a thing! It's a thing!

216
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,800
Not man! Not beast!

217
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,580
Thing! No, that was a woman.

218
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,320
You're thinking of someone else.

219
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,660
It's always good to

220
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,000
explore personally and make

221
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,020
sure you have bought a

222
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,220
pig in a poker.

223
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Real quick, who's been that?

224
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,860
Princess Wee knows. This is someone that

225
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,860
I'm going to build my own pleasure with

226
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,960
on July 5th.

227
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,800
On July 5th.

228
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:54,880
Yes.

229
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,200
On July 5th, 1998.

230
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,400
On July 5th, 1998.

231
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,120
Mm-hmm.

232
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,720
Yes, July 5th, 1998.

233
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,020
It's only just around the corner, kids.

234
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,900
It all boils down to that. Yes, so rushing toward us

235
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,240
like an express train seen in the distance

236
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,420
which looms up suddenly at the last moment.

237
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,900
The wagon load exploded.

238
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,540
I heard that person before

239
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,900
and that was a radio voice.

240
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,040
Is that an actual person now calling

241
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
from the Clever area?

242
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,000
It's just part of our art and cleverness.

243
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,040
No one would actually...

244
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,900
do that in today's real estate market.

245
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,680
Oh, I'm...

246
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,100
Yeah, I mean, yesterday

247
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,860
I was the little dog that was moving around

248
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,060
the Monopoly board.

249
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,080
Today I'm Rich Uncle Pennybags.

250
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,520
Rich on what?

251
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,580
Rich Uncle Pennybags from the Monopoly game.

252
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,300
Oh, Rich Uncle Pennybags.

253
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,680
I'm sorry.

254
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,720
Did you get yourself a monocle and daddy warbucks?

255
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,840
Ah, Uncle Pennybags.

256
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,220
Also, I have LeBron James to thank

257
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,400
for giving me a little flat...

258
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,340
Peter J. Pennypacker.

259
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,960
For the free tacos.

260
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,760
Pennypacker fortune.

261
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,880
You got free tacos?

262
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,940
Free tacos?

263
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:55,940
Yeah.

264
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,920
Everybody got free tacos.

265
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,600
I'm moving to Kentucky!

266
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:58,980
Yeah!

267
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,800
Free tacos!

268
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,700
And reclusive billionaire

269
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,020
John Bearsquare Tipton.

270
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,040
I want a free taco.

271
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,380
Hey, have you had a chance to make a...

272
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:07,800
I was in a movie the other day

273
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,060
at a major taco company,

274
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,040
which I'm not going to say the name of.

275
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
Yes, it wouldn't be...

276
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,760
It would be proprietary information.

277
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,060
Exactly.

278
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,680
But it was all thanks to...

279
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,300
Hey, man, I think...

280
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,700
It was all thanks to LeBron James winning on the road.

281
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,640
You should...

282
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,380
Rockdoll, if you have not yet seen it already,

283
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,100
you should look at some of the...

284
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,760
I saw some pictures of downtown Cleveland

285
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,880
during the victory parade on Wednesday.

286
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,340
I don't think that...

287
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,300
That's exactly how Lexington looks

288
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,700
when we win an NCAA championship.

289
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,680
There were one...

290
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,140
There were 1.3 million people

291
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,640
in downtown Cleveland.

292
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,420
1.3 million,

293
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,660
which is like three or four times

294
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,160
the population of the city itself.

295
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:45,960
Yeah.

296
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,580
And only...

297
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,340
Were there any couch burnings?

298
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:47,760
And only...

299
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,020
No.

300
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,620
There were no couch burnings that I know of.

301
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,300
And only one guy got shot.

302
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,280
Only one guy got shot.

303
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,880
We're gathering that pay.

304
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,820
In the Ancule.

305
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,360
Right.

306
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,040
Yes.

307
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,660
But yeah,

308
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,320
Sportsland has officially annexed Ohio now.

309
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,540
What is Sportsland?

310
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,300
What is Sportsland?

311
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,800
Well, he is Governor Rocknarr.

312
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,280
He is the governor of Sportsland.

313
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,540
Administered by Governor Rocknarr

314
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,340
after the econoclasm.

315
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,260
Governor Rocknarr will take over Sportsland.

316
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,540
Exactly.

317
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:18,920
As we know,

318
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,800
these things are set in...

319
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,880
Etched in brass.

320
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,440
It's a...

321
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:22,860
It's a...

322
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,840
It's a wall around Sportsland

323
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,920
and they're changing paperwork.

324
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,440
A wall of sheer binding energy.

325
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,360
Tuxes out of America now.

326
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,240
Force that cannot be transcended.

327
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,180
You know,

328
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,400
enormous energies

329
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,980
are going to be brought into place.

330
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,980
This planet has only a small amount of energy

331
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,940
which we get parasitically

332
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,900
from our central star,

333
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,820
the heating system.

334
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,100
But this is by far

335
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,120
different from the universe's

336
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,620
most awesome energy.

337
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,520
Which our friends,

338
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,220
the X-ists,

339
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:54,740
manipulate.

340
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,620
Are we going to see a Tegxit?

341
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,580
Are we going to see a Tegxit

342
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,360
before X-Day?

343
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,360
No, not until after Hillary Clinton

344
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,260
gets elected.

345
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,320
We're going to practice Earth's tip.

346
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,080
Returns from the Antarctic Expedition.

347
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,280
She'll be back any day now.

348
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,740
Earth out of solar system.

349
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,960
Hey, let's...

350
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,140
Actually, we're getting another call right now.

351
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,620
I hope you guys will hang on here

352
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,620
because I think we're about to be joined

353
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,980
by the one and only

354
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,840
No Money Mark.

355
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,680
Hello, you're on the air.

356
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,640
Hi, how you been?

357
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,140
Everybody?

358
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,740
Well, we'd be okay.

359
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,600
Better than Ratnar, apparently.

360
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,240
He's engaging in some

361
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,720
high-finance, jittery poker.

362
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,420
I'm on top of the world right now.

363
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,900
Like James Cagney in White Heat?

364
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,000
Exactly.

365
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,140
I mean, I'm not afraid anymore

366
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,580
about what's going to happen to the house.

367
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,440
That's good.

368
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,820
It's good not to be afraid.

369
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,060
The markets hate uncertainty.

370
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,520
Have you ever drunk Moxie?

371
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,600
Do you live in a foreign country?

372
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,720
I have drunk Moxie

373
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,840
and I know where you can still get Moxie.

374
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,680
I think you can get it in New England, can't you?

375
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,400
You can get it at Galco's New World Grocery

376
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,000
in Los Angeles.

377
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,300
I have shipped of the Moxie.

378
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,280
But who wants to go to Los Angeles?

379
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,620
Well, you have to go there

380
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,500
because they have every kind of soda known to man.

381
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,260
That's not exactly making it sound any more appealing.

382
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,800
Yes, but with 20 bucks you can come back

383
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,120
Do they have Ale 8?

384
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,240
Do they have Ale 8?

385
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:11,820
Wow.

386
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,080
They have Inca Cola.

387
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,660
There's a couple of specialty gas stations

388
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,900
in Texas that have that.

389
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,660
Well, then you have to go to every run-down

390
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,140
rag-tag gas station in Texas.

391
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,880
I'm going to do it.

392
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,040
Oh, no.

393
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,840
They're not rag-tag.

394
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,320
They're far from rag-tag.

395
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,240
They're a very nice little country store type place.

396
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,300
With coolers, with heavy glass doors,

397
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,180
filled with sweating cans of soda.

398
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,460
Made around the United States

399
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,260
and some Canada and some Mexico.

400
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,340
Well, I guess that covers that.

401
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,020
I'd love to be a Mexi-Coke right now.

402
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,020
Mexi-Cokes are awesome.

403
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,660
Mexican Cokes are pretty good.

404
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,800
The ones that use refined sugar.

405
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,660
They're in glass bottles.

406
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,740
Yes, indeed.

407
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,820
They sure will.

408
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,100
Yes, but then Mexico has its own

409
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,840
delicious soda.

410
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,440
Delicious flavors.

411
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,120
Not just Coca-Cola, but Squirt is made

412
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,620
on the old machines in Mexico.

413
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,660
And RC Cola.

414
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,840
They make Tab down there,

415
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,760
if you remember Tab.

416
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,760
I remember Tab.

417
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
Yes, they never stopped making it.

418
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,100
But that, too, is all available

419
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,960
at Galco's Old World Grocery in Los Angeles.

420
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,480
Plus all the Mexican sodas themselves

421
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,460
are quite delicious.

422
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,860
The Pina and so forth.

423
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,620
The Penafiel.

424
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,200
Yes, you must have very vigorous aisles

425
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,920
of lemon juice to consume this heavily sugared,

426
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,660
foaming, surging beverage.

427
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,220
I'm sure Hal remembers that Fanta was invented

428
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,380
by Nazi Germany.

429
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,420
Of course.

430
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,220
And Fanta.

431
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,180
The Fanta Menace.

432
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,700
Fanta was quite popular in the desert

433
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,460
when I grew up in Arizona.

434
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,960
Yes, there was a Fanta bottling company in the desert.

435
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,360
Exactly.

436
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,800
Few people ever ventured near it.

437
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,680
And those who did were not seen again.

438
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,880
It is a favorite bevy in Great Britain right now as well.

439
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,340
Fanta.

440
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,080
Mm-hmm.

441
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,500
And then in California,

442
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,380
we have Shasta beverages emanating from the Deros

443
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,800
under Mount Shasta.

444
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,580
You drink that stuff?

445
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,460
Do they have Werner?

446
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,960
They know what that is, right?

447
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes, we have Werner's, Werner's Diet, and so forth.

448
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,780
Werner Heisenberg?

449
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,200
The Reeds Company makes the best ginger beer,

450
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,680
including the ultra-strong ginger beer.

451
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,640
If all these obscure soft drinks are still being made,

452
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,960
why can't you buy them nationally?

453
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,860
Because there's a conspiracy plan

454
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,900
Distribution.

455
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,640
They're not just about soft drinks

456
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,280
and the people who drink them.

457
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,520
They are now considered responsible for the epidemic

458
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,060
of obese children you see marching down the street.

459
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,180
Not exactly marching.

460
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,300
Well, they're sort of undulating.

461
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,240
Puffing and puffing.

462
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,760
Yes.

463
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,420
The worst for your teeth would be things like Coke or Pepsi

464
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,380
that have high quantities of phosphoric acid in them.

465
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,240
Yes, the wonderful phosphoric acid.

466
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,960
Ph of two.

467
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,240
Carbonation is not quite as bad as just adding phosphoric acid to something.

468
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,000
I mean, like, Pepsi has a Ph of two.

469
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,060
Well, here's the thing, you know,

470
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,560
if there's ever any kind of outbreak of some kind of, like,

471
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,740
Andromeda strain-type virus that turns everybody else's blood into, like, powder,

472
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,180
we would be the ones that would survive.

473
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,000
That's happened to me.

474
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,680
Because our blood would be at different acidity level.

475
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,160
Well, the thing is, these, uh...

476
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,260
I, I, I prefer taking different kinds of acid.

477
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,840
The human body itself contains powerful corrosive acids,

478
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,620
which are contained in their proper...

479
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,440
area.

480
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,940
Uh, and Coca-Cola...

481
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,780
Oh, up until then.

482
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,180
Oh, sorry.

483
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,820
It's a healthy, uh, belt.

484
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:32,600
But, but, uh, belches and burps occur in nature and in cosmic physics,

485
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,100
where they create planets, nebulae, and galaxies.

486
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,040
It depends on the, uh, the, the depth and the resonance.

487
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,460
That's always been my opinion of the difference between a, a belch and a burp.

488
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,180
Yes, we have learned how to make ever-bigger booms here on our planet,

489
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,940
but they are only baby burps,

490
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,380
compared to what the universe can do with its vast, explosive force.

491
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,680
Can I add, uh, that it has nothing to do with the subject currently,

492
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,620
but the South was, had many, many different varieties of soft drinks, and still does.

493
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,020
All available at Galco's Old World Preservation.

494
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,240
There's not quite as many as there used to be, but there were, there were, every town had its own soft drink.

495
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,160
A South out of America now.

496
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,180
But now they're trying to force Po folks to eat kale and health food.

497
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:24,780
Uh, they replaced all the candy bars and vending machines in San Francisco with kale chips and snacks.

498
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,940
So, if a diabetic is having a bad moment and tries desperately to get a candy bar,

499
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,580
sorry, buddy, we got health food.

500
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,420
It's for your own good that you can expire on the floor in front of the candy machine.

501
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,360
No, not all, San Francisco maybe, not...

502
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,100
There's a supervisor named Scott Weiner who's trying to, uh,

503
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,200
Oh, God.

504
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,220
He's trying to eliminate all, anything that isn't health food as long as poor folks, uh, consume it.

505
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,120
Oh, Scott, next thing you know, next thing you know, Scott Weiner is gonna have,

506
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,800
is gonna have vegetarian rules that you can't feed meat to cats.

507
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,800
You may laugh, but you'll see the name of Scott Weiner as he edges closer and closer toward the governor's position in the state of California.

508
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,460
Oh, Lordy. Is he one of Hillary's superdelegates?

509
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,240
He was a weiner.

510
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:12,960
He sounds like it.

511
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,140
He's on the Hillary side, but he's still in contention with James.

512
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,180


513
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:22,760
He's on the Sanders side, who got a surprising amount of votes, and there'll have to be a runoff election.

514
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,580
But so much for californicating politics.

515
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,680
You don't want that on this show where we're talking about cosmic things.

516
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,540
Like how the Exists power their interstellar space vehicle.

517
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,420
How do they power them, Dr. Howell?

518
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,140
Well, how are spaceships powered?

519
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,980
You know, that is one of the two problems.

520
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,060
One problem is too far, and the other problem is not enough power.

521
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,700
I thought they were fueled by mutilated cattle tongues.

522
00:18:51,080 --> 00:19:05,260
They can be fueled by anything, because all you need to do is confront matter and antimatter to get the giant explosive force that will push your vehicle through the brain.

523
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,340
Hey, let's pause for a moment here. It sounds like nobody Mark has a comment he wants to make.

524
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,740
What do you guys think of the Brexit?

525
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,780
Of champions? Wheaties?

526
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,200
Mr. Brexit?

527
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,160
The solar system out of the galaxy now.

528
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,520
My personal take on it, I don't think the UK ever should have joined the EU in the first place.

529
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,580
I don't think they ever really had their hearts in it.

530
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,960
It was Napoleon's idea. The common market. United Europe.

531
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,720
There's two reasons why the EU rejected the UK's admission into it.

532
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,660
No, that's the other way around.

533
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,420
The plucky British decided they wanted their shillings, pence, and all that stuff back.

534
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,880
And the pound has been devalued.

535
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,480
It's lost a good deal.

536
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,520
It's going to get ugly. It's going to get ugly for a while. It's going to cause a lot of economic and political chaos for probably a decade.

537
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,000
It's probably going to take a decade before things get back to normal.

538
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,160
British clockwork toys are now affordable again.

539
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,000
I thought it was already ugly.

540
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:08,760
More people are going to come to my golf course. They'll be able to fly to England and spend their money here.

541
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,320
It's huge.

542
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Because the economy is going to destroy thanks to Obama. I think it's a great idea. But it's all Obama's fault.

543
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,460
The beauty of me selling my house is I can actually move to Amsterdam now if I want.

544
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,980
And you can start that Chef Boyardee franchise once you get permission from the chef.

545
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,680
Oh, don't encourage him to do that.

546
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,660
At this point, I've got nothing holding me back from Lexington anymore. Why not?

547
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,760
But Lexington and Concord? What about the rude bridge that arched the flood?

548
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,340
Are you going to make America a cheese grater again?

549
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,320
Their flag to summer breeze unfurled.

550
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,300
Cheese grater?

551
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,940
I just got that. It took two and a half hours.

552
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,680
That's where the embattled farmers stood that fired the shot heard round the world.

553
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,140
You'll leave that for the double Dutch of Amsterdam?

554
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,740
No, in a heartbeat. Because there I'll just be a person and I'll be looking down upon.

555
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,480
Well, if you stick your thumb in the dike, perhaps you will be suitably...

556
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:04,880
Ouch!

557
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,840
Oh, you had to go there.

558
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,080
I can see you being a Dutch boy, Ragnarok. I can see that.

559
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,380
You can start by cultivating the haircut.

560
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,880
I wish I could do that lurch.

561
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,220
Well, I always use the term Dutch boy as...

562
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:28,680
They've had to go in a different direction than building dikes because the sea level has risen so high now that they're going more towards the little Venice routine.

563
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,760
Pardon my French, but you'll be in Dutch if you don't put some English on it at the finish.

564
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,420
See, I always use the word Dutch boy as an analogy...

565
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,700
Hey, Dutch boy!

566
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,060
As an analog of...

567
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,980
...of a fag hag, you know? I'm a straight male and once upon a time I realized that like half my friends were lesbians.

568
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,700
How many of them were Dutch?

569
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,400
None of them, but...

570
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,840
See, I know some Dutchies.

571
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,780
I know they might have had some Dutch ancestry, but they were all as American as apple pie.

572
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,420
They were a bit worse than a Dutch fag hag.

573
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,980
I remember...

574
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,320
Now we're casting insults around.

575
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,920
Let's have another Friendsgiving in Amsterdam with Xavier Hollander. Why not?

576
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,600
If she's up for it.

577
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,780
I think she would be.

578
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,900
She was nonplussed.

579
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:19,700
Nonplussed by this not-American holiday happening at her bed and breakfast, but willing to do it.

580
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,600
Well, she had that American manservant who knew how to cook a turkey.

581
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,880
They knew what a turkey was. They barely knew what a turkey was.

582
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,720
The whole world doesn't celebrate these American holidays.

583
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,740
It's like a chicken, only bigger and less flavorful.

584
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,120
Yeah, but they're only Chip Boyardee.

585
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,040
Oh, that would be...

586
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,660
Yeah, that's...

587
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,020
Thank Cleveland for that.

588
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,980
The Dutch are dying for Chef Boyardee pizza.

589
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,720
Thank Cleveland for Chef Boyardee.

590
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
Yeah, exactly.

591
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,560
They're $18.97.

592
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,220
But they have cod stands.

593
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,640
Chef Boyardee would be like one of those fancy type restaurants.

594
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,300
You can go to a cod stand and get a cod sand.

595
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,580
Which?

596
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,780
A noodle.

597
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,340
We could use pool noodles and cod pieces before we have our ritualistic armor fight.

598
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,980
It's all delicious.

599
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,920
I'll have a Coney Island whitefish sandwich, please.

600
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,140
With a couple of Yankee Doodles and devil dogs on the side.

601
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,880
You want the Marines to be on the side?

602
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,640
How about curly fries, Larry sandwiches, and...

603
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,920
And mohash.

604
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,620
I can't stop imagining the cod piece with pool noodle.

605
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,720
Well, see what you did?

606
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,360
You've contaminated Princess Wee's mind.

607
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,760
This is starting to sound like noodle implements.

608
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:32,900
Yes.

609
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,440
And like all fertile things, her mind is readily smelly.

610
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,120
A noodle ready to be fried.

611
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,760
Fertilized.

612
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,160
Speaking of, we should pay honor and respect to someone that...

613
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,300
I don't know if any of you remember that, you know, Crazy White Sean.

614
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,580
He passed away a couple of years ago.

615
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,920
Oh, yeah.

616
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,800
Unforgettable character.

617
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,960
His act made you literally pass out in horror.

618
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,140
What happened to him?

619
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,460
Did he take one shard in the face too many or something?

620
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,220
I think it was him eating the light bulb that kind of did it.

621
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,600
Damn.

622
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,180
Oh, that's nothing.

623
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,460
Uncle Fester ain't got nothing on him.

624
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,600
You can eat the light bulb as long as you chew the glass really well.

625
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,100
There's one bucket of bricks hanging from his...

626
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,780
I saw a guy like...

627
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,920
I saw a guy pound nails into his sinuses.

628
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,980
Yeah, my circus friends do that too.

629
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,000
And there's some on NXT that can be seen.

630
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,340
You must have met the Enigma at some point.

631
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,900
He has to pull them out with a pair of pliers.

632
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,560
And they always have like that little tiny bit of brain at the end of them.

633
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,520
Is the guy who has the full body blue jigsaw puzzle tattoo?

634
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,260
He's dead?

635
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,520
Oh, man.

636
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,960
I got to meet him about 15 years ago, actually.

637
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,900
It was weird.

638
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,280
He was just hanging out in Cleveland because he was doing a Halloween show

639
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,200
down at the amphitheater in the flats.

640
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,600
And he was just hanging out at a bar one night.

641
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,460
And we ran into him and had a good time.

642
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,520
And he was very unique.

643
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,500
And we hung out with him the night after his show.

644
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,840
Actually, the day after his show.

645
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,080
What was that?

646
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,620
Akhenaten coffee shop we were at, I think.

647
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,220
Named after the heliocentric pharaoh of ancient Egypt.

648
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,020
It was the one by the Cannabis Museum.

649
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,480
By the Hash Marijuana Museum.

650
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,820
Yeah.

651
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,160
I don't remember that place.

652
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,480
You weren't there.

653
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,400
If you did remember.

654
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,580
You weren't there.

655
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,040
We were special guests there.

656
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:42,880
I remember that.

657
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,760
Yeah, we were the judges.

658
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,000
Yes, we had a grave responsibility.

659
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,540
Barney's in Amsterdam just hooked us up with all that stuff.

660
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,680
Yes, we had to march around from bar to bar, huffing it.

661
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,240
We were not allowed to rest in any particular place.

662
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,500
I remember it well.

663
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,500
Oh, it was awesome.

664
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,380
And it felt like being in a Grand Theft Auto type video game

665
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,060
where you have to go.

666
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,220
You know, make these little achievements

667
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,780
and collect all 27 coffee shop rewards.

668
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,760
Make a little achievement over there

669
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,840
and you have to clean it up.

670
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,240
And were you all given T-shirts and a beer?

671
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,620
Oh, absolutely.

672
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,720
Well, we were given samples,

673
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,440
which we were not allowed to bring back over the border.

674
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,200
So we had to give them to our eager hosts.

675
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,060
It was like a real cup d'or, right?

676
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,260
Yeah, really.

677
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,740
A gold cup of, you know, okay.

678
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,580
Yes, I didn't pray that this cup...

679
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,480
be passed from me.

680
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:44,100
But it was the Cannabis Cup, of course.

681
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,860
And we were there in time to see the bizarre Christmas preparation

682
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,020
that the Hollanders have with Black Michael and Father Christmas.

683
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,120
Black Peter.

684
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,180
Black Peter, yes.

685
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,640
We have to let our listeners know that this, you know,

686
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,600
Habsapropzipulops, or Frop, is not cannabis.

687
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,960
I already covered that in an earlier part of the show.

688
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,180
It is something far, far better.

689
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,360
Yes, it is.

690
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,220
Medical cannabis is now legal in Ohio.

691
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,640
It's the 25th state.

692
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,060
Yep, medical weed is coming to Ohio.

693
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,440
Well, that's good.

694
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,060
And, I don't know, I have really mixed feelings about it.

695
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,260
I think it's kind of...

696
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,740
You know, it's so obviously, like...

697
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,240
I don't know, that's a topic for another day.

698
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:26,600
Whatever.

699
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,960
But one thing I do have to say, though,

700
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,260
is that portions of the following broadcast

701
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,840
will be objectionable to some members of the audience.

702
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,740
Therefore, WCSB advises listener discretion.

703
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,700
The views and opinions expressed on this program

704
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,580
are not necessarily those of the audience.

705
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,040
Those of WCSB or Cleveland State University

706
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,360
or anybody with their head screwed on straight,

707
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:41,880
for that matter,

708
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,920
this is a special edition of Synesthesia.

709
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,020
I'm your host, Dr. Sinister.

710
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,340
We have us right now joining us by phone.

711
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,220
We have Governor Rocknar of Sportsland.

712
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,240
We have No Money Mark.

713
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,560
We have Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

714
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,940
We have Dr. Hal.

715
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,980
We have Princess Weardo.

716
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,960
We have the Reverend Ivan Stang.

717
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,620
The gang's all here.

718
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,620
We're getting the band back together.

719
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,120
There are people in most countries

720
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,820
who would like to live in the United States

721
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,120
or the Dominion of Canada

722
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,000
where that good auger coal is sold.

723
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,180
The citizens of our free world

724
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,480
are the envy of every other country in the world

725
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,740
because of the personal freedoms that we have enjoyed.

726
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,980
Why then doesn't every other country

727
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,740
enjoy such a level of personal freedom?

728
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,000
One answer is that although people might be

729
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,480
enjoying these personal freedoms,

730
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,080
they'll vote for whatever dumbass they choose.

731
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,680
Now, I'm going to be your dictator.

732
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,040
Exactly.

733
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,540
And that's how they sell their lie to the people.

734
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,180
Yep, it's orange in all two true stories.

735
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,340
It never changes.

736
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,740
It's been that way for a lot of people

737
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,660
since 1776's struggle that's continued ever since.

738
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,120
Ever since primordial humanoids

739
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,900
thrust their chests out

740
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,120
and dominated by brute force

741
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,380
in the council meeting

742
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,120
around the pounded Earth mound,

743
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,740
Earth's own politics have taken a familiar shape.

744
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,860
But we subgeniuses will move

745
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,140
into a completely different realm

746
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,560
and leave the country.

747
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,980
Quarreling humans adrift

748
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,040
on their own disintegrating world.

749
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,380
Yeah, well, now they're builder baggers

750
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,400
and all the rest of their...

751
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,500
Not baggers.

752
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,660
WCSB.

753
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,900
There is no way to move through space

754
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,200
without the annihilation of matter,

755
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,900
anti-matter,

756
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,340
because even the hydrogen-helium reaction

757
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,180
of the sun is inadequate.

758
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,280
Not only do you have to get up

759
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,080
to an unthinkable speed,

760
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,840
then you have to stop also,

761
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,560
which is an annihilation.

762
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,220
It's an entirely different suite of problems.

763
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,900
Well, just use the inertial dampers.

764
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,720
Well, the problem is that this anti-matter

765
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,080
cannot come into contact with matter

766
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,460
without creating the explosion.

767
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,080
But in our universe, in our galaxy...

768
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,400
Which is why you have the containment field

769
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,520
around the anti-matter core.

770
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,360
You have to have that plasma container bottle, yes.

771
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,860
But our own galaxy has fountains of anti-matter

772
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,080
erupting out at various places,

773
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,240
engaging active creation.

774
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,180
Two-bedroom jobs.

775
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,440
In the universe.

776
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,900
Perfect efficiency.

777
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,560
Who needs anti-matter?

778
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,680
The total control of matter to energy.

779
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,300
Gravitational wave drives.

780
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,280
So you could take a piece of tongue

781
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,180
or a piece of old shoe leather

782
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,340
and have enough to force a planet out of its orbit

783
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,280
with that particular...

784
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,380
The problem is when you jump the battery

785
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,520
on those spaceships,

786
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,460
you've got to be really careful.

787
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,040
Well, that's why Scotty was always worried

788
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,400
on Star Trek down there.

789
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,040
If I give out any Marshall Blue!

790
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:36,940
Exactly.

791
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,220
I cannot change the laws of physics!

792
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Every time the Starship Enterprise's warp core

793
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,460
was about to lose its anti-matter...

794
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,240
Only the writers can change the laws of physics!

795
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
Scotty would eat another secret snack

796
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,180
out of the refrigerator down there.

797
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,480
Secret snack.

798
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,440
Indeed.

799
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,800
And who gave Anton Yelchin the red shirt?

800
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:00,660
The red shirts were worn by the engineering section.

801
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,220
It has nothing to do with people

802
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,340
who are left behind on planets to die.

803
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,440
That's popular mythology.

804
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,380
Gold shirts for...

805
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:07,740
Administration.

806
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,240
Red for engineering.

807
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,340
Blue for science.

808
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,720
I'm just going to come right out and say

809
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,120
that I do not care for the Star Trek reboot...

810
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,620
at all.

811
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,420
Yeah, they had to tear down the whole

812
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,420
previous Star Trek universe.

813
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,980
Anton Yelchin is not Chekhov.

814
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,660
He will never be Chekhov.

815
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,400
He's dead.

816
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,420
He died in a recent freak accident.

817
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,600
I'm aware of this.

818
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,440
His car crushed him.

819
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,820
His own car.

820
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,860
It was the first ever to have that happen

821
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,400
as a result of that recall.

822
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,920
Well, um...

823
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,400
The original Chekhov was put in Star Trek

824
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,580
because they thought he was like

825
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,240
Davy Jones of the Monkees

826
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,120
and would bring youth in to watch the program.

827
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,220
Boy, now that you mention it,

828
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,120
I do see the resemblance.

829
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:47,700
Yes.

830
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,060
Yeah, like Davy Jones' locker.

831
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,200
That's the same Harry suit

832
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,700
everybody has to wear when they're playing.

833
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,520
And pretty soon,

834
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,620
any time anybody was injured or captured,

835
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,580
it turned out to be Chekhov,

836
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,340
the chipmunk-faced Russian

837
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,840
who the entire script had to divert

838
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,700
to pull back.

839
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,120
A Russian was always wounded first.

840
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,700
You're right.

841
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,040
Remember?

842
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,020
Yes, it's true.

843
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,600
You know what?

844
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,200
I hated the Jar Jar Abrams version of Star Trek.

845
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:10,980
Aw.

846
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,360
I hate Jar Jar Abrams.

847
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Well, I thought it was rather...

848
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,420
But Anton Yelchin was actually pretty good

849
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,280
in those movies.

850
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:17,980
Mm-hmm.

851
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,920
But now we've seen the last of him.

852
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,180
Definitely great casting

853
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,600
to bring Scotty in

854
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,040
as the hero of

855
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,720
Shaun of the Dead.

856
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,600
Right.

857
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,800
Especially now after the Brixton

858
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,680
of the British Empire.

859
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,680
The Brixton of the Union of...

860
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,740
You know, the UK and stuff.

861
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,320
When the Scotts break away,

862
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,500
then where's Scotty gonna go?

863
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,140
He's gonna be...

864
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,740
Yeah.

865
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,500
Well, he's already with the angels.

866
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,300
The beauty of Star Trek now is...

867
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,680
I think we need not worry about that.

868
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,780
...the original universes

869
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,140
that it existed in.

870
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,100
It becomes its own universe

871
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,900
for whoever wants to believe in it.

872
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,500
Vulcan is out of the Federation now.

873
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,320
Are you out of your Vulcan mind spot?

874
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,020
Well, the fact is that the universe...

875
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,000
You bloody nose picker.

876
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,760
It was...

877
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,440
Previously,

878
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,620
this universe was destroyed

879
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,820
only to create the current universe,

880
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,020
but that doesn't mean

881
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,400
in the give and take

882
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,220
of Benzedrine-laced script writing

883
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,280
that the old universe

884
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,980
can't later be determined

885
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,140
to exist somewhere.

886
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,000
So we have the contrived scene

887
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,600
of old Star Trekkers

888
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,120
fighting new Star Trekkers,

889
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,540
just the way Superman

890
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,720
tangles with Batman.

891
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,460
Something which actually happened

892
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,580
in more than one DC comic.

893
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,280
Like the one

894
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,960
that I took from the

895
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,480
Bulldog auction last year.

896
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,760
Lex Luthor teamed up

897
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,900
with the Joker

898
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,200
and Superman

899
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,680
fought Batman.

900
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,040
It seemed as if the world

901
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,180
was turned upside down,

902
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,620
like when the British

903
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,340
had to acknowledge

904
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,540
the American victory

905
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,620
at Yorktown.

906
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,940
We all remember the song.

907
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,540
We all play it.

908
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,000
It's a tune

909
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,260
when I'm in the bathtub.

910
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,860
It's a song of our own defeat.

911
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,280
Our own smelly...

912
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,720
People mistake Hal

913
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,080
for his current human form,

914
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,580
but right now,

915
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,620
he's the guardian of forever.

916
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,700
This isn't even his final form.

917
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,000
That's right.

918
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,120
I'm in transition.

919
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,040
See my gills?

920
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,580
He has his own beginning

921
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,400
and his own ending.

922
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:17,800
Sorry.

923
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,500
Well, look,

924
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,800
I was just trying to explain

925
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,740
how when anti-electrons,

926
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,420
which we call positrons,

927
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,300
meet electrons,

928
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,440
there's a whacking great explosion.

929
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,220
This is what our friends,

930
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,100
the Exists,

931
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,500
are using to come here now.

932
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,580
They are...

933
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,760
going to enter our solar system

934
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,160
in less than 24 hours.

935
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,140
And by July 5th,

936
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,300
they will be hovering

937
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,960
over the landing field

938
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,300
where the eager subgeniuses

939
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,920
are turning their anxious faces

940
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,960
upward at the spinning shadow.

941
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,380
And how those saucers get towered

942
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,980
is they actually harvest

943
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,420
the souls of the human pinks.

944
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,220
The matter is the soul itself

945
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,260
and the antimatter

946
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,800
is the hatred within that soul.

947
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,260
That's how the Exists

948
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,460
power their big ships.

949
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,900
And that's how they use

950
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,620
their own weapons

951
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,500
to destroy them

952
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,680
and save the world

953
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,460
for the rest of us.

954
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,960
Lovely, beautiful,

955
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,140
educated subgenius.

956
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,940
What a sad way to put it.

957
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,860
It's true, though.

958
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,680
You have to destroy the world

959
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,580
to rebuild it anyway.

960
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,060
The largest explosive power,

961
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,380
as I have described,

962
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,440
is from the confrontation

963
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,760
of matter and antimatter.

964
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,640
But science has also...

965
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,440
Actually, it's a matter-antimatter.

966
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:34,900
It's a matter-reaction

967
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,760
that causes the continuous burning

968
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,500
of Bob's pipe.

969
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,180
There's a recent theory

970
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,140
that there's something

971
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,300
even more horrible

972
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,680
and even more powerful,

973
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,920
which is called

974
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,960
zero-point energy.

975
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,540
The power of absolute vacuum.

976
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,720
Ask Dr. Howell, please.

977
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,600
Dr. Howell, tell us,

978
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,900
what is zero-point energy, please?

979
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,580
Zero-point energy,

980
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,140
according to some,

981
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,880
if you had a vacant pickle jar of it,

982
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,800
it could boil away

983
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,780
all our oceans

984
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,440
in three seconds.

985
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,740
A vacant pickle jar.

986
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,340
It is the power

987
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,440
of absolute negativity itself.

988
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,060
It's the nothing.

989
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,800
It's too much for humans

990
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,320
to have control of.

991
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,120
Fortunately, they're never going

992
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,680
to get anywhere near there now.

993
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,100
Catastrophe might indeed follow

994
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,260
if we could figure out

995
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,900
how to capture

996
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,700
and exploit vacuum energy.

997
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,320
So we don't even have to worry

998
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,040
about the matter-antimatter thing.

999
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,620
The only thing that can stop the nothing

1000
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,600
is to give the Empress a new name.

1001
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,120
Unless our son decides

1002
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,360
to go haywire

1003
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,460
in the next few days.

1004
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,740
Called the Luck Dragon.

1005
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,780
It could happen, too.

1006
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:41,600
Sure.

1007
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,980
It could just decide

1008
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,880
that it had burned up

1009
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,520
all its fuel

1010
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,620
and then suddenly swell up

1011
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,860
to a grotesque size,

1012
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,860
immolating all the inner

1013
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,800
rocky worlds,

1014
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,060
including our own.

1015
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,640
If it happened at night,

1016
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,500
we would see the moon

1017
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,820
get super bright

1018
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,520
all of a sudden

1019
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,340
and realize our life

1020
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,420
was to be measured in hours.

1021
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,120
Honey, what a bromantic...

1022
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,100
What a bromantic...

1023
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,100


1024
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,360
Now, if you're on that side,

1025
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,780
you're protected for a bit

1026
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,100
by the rocky bulk

1027
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,240
of the Earth itself

1028
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,260
from the solar storm.

1029
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,900
And that does take

1030
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,760
eight and a half minutes

1031
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,580
to get here anyway.

1032
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,280
I love subgenius pornography.

1033
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,380
And there'll be plenty of that

1034
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,220
at X-Day.

1035
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,400
Yes, we will be titillating senses

1036
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,580
you didn't even know you had

1037
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,260
as you reach your newly found

1038
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,680
evolutionary potential.

1039
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,560
Like pollywogs

1040
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,260
in old Ziqua's pond,

1041
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,260
at the last minute

1042
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,360
we will find ourselves

1043
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,840
developing unusual

1044
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,280
new supernumerary structures

1045
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,820
and organs of unknown purpose.

1046
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,240
Now, you know,

1047
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,000
there's another possible side

1048
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,780
to all this.

1049
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,000
Earlier, Dr. Sinister,

1050
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,900
you were mentioning

1051
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,860
the good shepherd

1052
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,780
and what happens to his sheep.

1053
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,380
My brother is a shepherd of goats

1054
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,820
and I asked him last time...

1055
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,420
Why a goat?

1056
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,640
Why a goat?

1057
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,600
Because they're so tasty.

1058
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,680
What happens to the goats

1059
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,240
after you sell them?

1060
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,500
And he said,

1061
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,980
I choose not to think about that.

1062
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,620
And, uh, friends,

1063
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,780
isn't that how Bob regards us?

1064
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,640
He just doesn't even want to...

1065
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,820
He's going to get us

1066
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,760
to those saucers,

1067
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,740
but, you know, when you...

1068
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,360
Well, wait a minute.

1069
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,580
Now, what happens...

1070
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:29,940
What happens next?

1071
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,880
And, well...

1072
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,420
He loves us so much.

1073
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,560
I prefer not to think about that.

1074
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,520
The lust and slackfulness of Bob

1075
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,120
is not necessarily shared

1076
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,320
by some geniuses.

1077
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,520
He knows of the awfulness

1078
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,360
and the hedonism

1079
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,240
of the entire unifracture.

1080
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,100
When everything goes to...

1081
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,800
When the goats get eaten...

1082
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,740
Or whatever.

1083
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,620
Or milked.

1084
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,340
Or whatever.

1085
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,080
Perhaps cheese is made

1086
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,420
by the exes of a cow.

1087
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:57,900
There's a lot of things

1088
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,940
you can do with a goat,

1089
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,900
especially if you've got

1090
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,140
real big boots.

1091
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,060
Yes.

1092
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,220
That's right.

1093
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,860
And you can use them

1094
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,800
as a lawnmower.

1095
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,220
Have some dirt custards on me.

1096
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,240
You don't need to use

1097
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,340
a gasoline-powered lawnmower

1098
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,300
at that point anymore.

1099
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,340
The lawnmower?

1100
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,540
Goat?

1101
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:10,920
Do goats?

1102
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,800
Mr. Natural,

1103
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,900
do goats eat cans?

1104
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,100
Why, yes, my boy.

1105
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,220
They certainly do.

1106
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,320
They do eat a lot of things,

1107
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,740
but not cans, right, Hal?

1108
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,880
Well, yeah.

1109
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,820
You put one down in front of one

1110
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,500
and he might try it.

1111
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,860
He might ruminate upon it.

1112
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,940
Being a ruminant,

1113
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,080
he might chew thoughtfully.

1114
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,980
Eat a nice, thin Ale 8 can,

1115
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,580
probably.

1116
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,960
You know, it's just like

1117
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,260
the circus bros

1118
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,820
who do eat broken glass.

1119
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,200
If you chew it up

1120
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,440
into small enough parts,

1121
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,700
it gets coated with mucus

1122
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,520
and it just passes

1123
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,440
right through you.

1124
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,020
Similar does the goat

1125
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,380
with his stereotypical can

1126
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,640
and the other objects

1127
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,320
which he eats.

1128
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,620
Even humans are subject

1129
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,180
to a condition

1130
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,660
known as pica,

1131
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,180
where for some cause,

1132
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,420
rooted in an unknown

1133
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,080
psychological aberration,

1134
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,180
people have been known

1135
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,500
to eat inedible things

1136
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,600
and create boluses

1137
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,120
or bezoars in their stomachs.

1138
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,460
Eating string, fabric, dirt.

1139
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,380
Stones.

1140
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,440
Yes, yes.

1141
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,520
Reverend Funny Night

1142
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,480
made a whole bicycle.

1143
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,260
He's supposed that's where

1144
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,400
Crazy White Sean's soul came from

1145
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,760
and he's supposed that's where

1146
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
his soul's gone back to.

1147
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,180
Is that of a goat?

1148
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,920
Well, it may have gone

1149
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,280
into another organism

1150
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,680
of a higher or lower

1151
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,160
category.

1152
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,660
Yeah, it could be

1153
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,660
like a real high goat.

1154
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,880
Like, you know,

1155
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,000
the meta-goat.

1156
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,560
They all start out

1157
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,620
as zygotes.

1158
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,320
That's right.

1159
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:41,720
Yeah.

1160
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,960
And end up as perigotes.

1161
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,300
Do you still play video games?

1162
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,060
I'm sure you do.

1163
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
A stangor, right?

1164
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,800
Uh, yeah, yeah, of course.

1165
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,500
Yeah, sure.

1166
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,240
Yeah, yeah, right.

1167
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,520
Do you have goat simulator?

1168
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,700
Oh, yes, I certainly do.

1169
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,540
I have goat simulator

1170
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,340
in my phone.

1171
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,920
On his phone.

1172
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,800
All right, now let's not

1173
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,400
commit a hate crime here.

1174
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,160
Actually, goat simulator

1175
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,160


1176
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,160


1177
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,160


1178
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,160


1179
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,160


1180
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,040
is awesome

1181
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,080
because it's just

1182
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,360
the most random,

1183
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,140
free-roam,

1184
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,560
and bug-filled game

1185
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,100
there is.

1186
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,580
It's really bull-dodger.

1187
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:10,760
And the bugs are what make

1188
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,620
the games so much fun.

1189
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,120
It's a very surreal experience.

1190
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,860
Exactly.

1191
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,820
We watched an expert

1192
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,900
goat simulator player,

1193
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,840
Reverend Bucky Argyle,

1194
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,900
in Germany.

1195
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
Hi, Bucky.

1196
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,780
Hi, Tanya.

1197
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,920
Yeah, I think

1198
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,640
he really had,

1199
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,140
he could do a lot of things

1200
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,160


1201
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,600
He could get the goat

1202
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,160
to the top of the skyscraper

1203
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,240
in no time at all.

1204
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,620
Oh, it's easy.

1205
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,760
And bug people off

1206
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,380
of the top and so forth.

1207
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:39,980
That was really,

1208
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,040
really so...

1209
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,580
Oh, the fun is

1210
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,400
you can take the random pinks

1211
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,440
that are at the barbecues

1212
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,620
and just drag them

1213
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,640
to the sacrifice pit.

1214
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,680
Oh, really?

1215
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,320
I didn't know that.

1216
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,200
I really haven't played

1217
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:49,940
it much myself

1218
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,260
because there's a lot

1219
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:52,680
of monsters

1220
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,340
that need to get killed first.

1221
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,160
But, uh...

1222
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,640
You can get,

1223
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,060
you can get a jetpack

1224
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:58,640
for yourself

1225
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,260
and just fly around everywhere.

1226
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,940
Oh, the goat?

1227
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,500
The goat gets a jetpack?

1228
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,600
Yeah.

1229
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,560
It makes better sense

1230
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,580
for them than a human.

1231
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,200
I can't even think of goats

1232
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,700
right now

1233
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,020
because there's a crushing weight

1234
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,720
on my forehead.

1235
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,640
It reminds me...

1236
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,480
And I can hear these voices

1237
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,180
from outer space

1238
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,260
crying and yelling at me

1239
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,620
and trying to get me

1240
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,180
to do things.

1241
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,440
And I just refuse.

1242
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,580
But I still can't resist.

1243
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,860
It's so much for you,

1244
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,060
space bullies.

1245
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,920
Yeah, I was on

1246
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,600
the sub-site the other day

1247
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,840
and I was back on the

1248
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,260
uh,

1249
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,160
uh, old Mac page

1250
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,860
which for stuff

1251
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,420
that you had

1252
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,720
if you had system 7, 8

1253
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,020
or maybe 9.

1254
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,360
Faith and Begora.

1255
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,400
Yeah.

1256
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:41,960
Oh, yeah.

1257
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,560
Those, uh,

1258
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,140
those ancient games

1259
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,320
are really wonderful

1260
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,360
on those emulators.

1261
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,380
You can, uh...

1262
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:47,540
Yeah.

1263
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,600
They only take up

1264
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,420
about 4 kilobytes, too.

1265
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,120
A whole centipede

1266
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,180
or the original Donkey Kong.

1267
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,220
They're the size

1268
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,200
of a text file.

1269
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,720
You could fit them all on a...

1270
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,420
You could fit every one

1271
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:58,820
there ever was

1272
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,520
on a floppy disk.

1273
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,140
Yeah.

1274
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,300
Yeah.

1275
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,740
Yeah, Rocknard gave me

1276
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,340
a floppy disk.

1277
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,360
It had the emulator

1278
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,200
and about 40 games on it.

1279
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,880
It was long.

1280
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,240
That was like 20 years ago.

1281
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,420
You know, I probably have

1282
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,640
some stuff on floppy disks

1283
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,100
going around

1284
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,600
that has been lost forever.

1285
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,560
I don't know how

1286
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,080
I would be able

1287
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:15,600
to read them now.

1288
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,440
I, I,

1289
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,300
all of my

1290
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,660
old computers

1291
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,780
still work.

1292
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,520
Oh, wow.

1293
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,160
So try me.

1294
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,480
They're all Macintosh,

1295
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,160
so...

1296
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,800
You know what?

1297
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,720
My old,

1298
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,320
my old Windows 95 computer

1299
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,220
probably still works.

1300
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,420
My 1984 classic Mac

1301
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,100
still works.

1302
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,680
I can look at...

1303
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:31,880
I can...

1304
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,780
You can put

1305
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,240
all of your system

1306
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,280
and MacPaint

1307
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,320
and MacWrite

1308
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,580
and all of your data

1309
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,460
on one floppy disk.

1310
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,900
Product placement.

1311
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:41,980
And no RAM.

1312
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,140
But then how do you

1313
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,000
get it off that computer?

1314
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,000
Oh, oh.

1315
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,520
Another one.

1316
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,540
Well, I think we're

1317
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,100
starting to run out of time.

1318
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:48,760
Well, that's when you have

1319
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,500
to buy the $7,000

1320
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,980
external floppy disk

1321
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,960
so you can have

1322
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,300
a second floppy disk.

1323
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,640
I've got...

1324
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,380
As far as I know,

1325
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,660
I've still got stuff

1326
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,000
that can read those old things.

1327
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,100
I had to resurrect

1328
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,440
the parts of the book

1329
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,560
Revelation X,

1330
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,040
which had been laid out

1331
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,360
by Paul Mavridis

1332
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,260
in Pagemaker 1.

1333
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,540
And I was able to

1334
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,620
force evolve

1335
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,720
the whole book

1336
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,380
up to InDesign.

1337
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:20,680
No, no.

1338
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,980
It was a move upwards.

1339
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,780
The funny thing is

1340
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,180
everything...

1341
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,020
I had the right fonts.

1342
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,060
I had everything in place.

1343
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,920
And it worked completely

1344
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,360
except the...

1345
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:29,840
the kerning.

1346
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,060
I had to figure out

1347
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,180
what kerning adjustment

1348
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:32,740
to make

1349
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,220
so that the pages

1350
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,100
were exact duplicates

1351
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:36,940
of what they had been

1352
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,820
20 years earlier

1353
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,020
in 1994.

1354
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,200
Hopefully you saved

1355
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,960
everything in Adobe PDF format.

1356
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:44,940
In a what?

1357
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,640
Adobe PDF format.

1358
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,460
Well, our last book

1359
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,120
was actually delivered

1360
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:51,780
to the printer

1361
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,300
as a 250 megabyte PDF.

1362
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,940
What'll I think of next?

1363
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,180
And when I went into

1364
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,100
OfficeMax today

1365
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,280
to get the X-Day brochure printed,

1366
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,400
the young lady there

1367
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,300
could work with the PDF,

1368
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,540
but they had evolved away

1369
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,380
from the ability

1370
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,740
to make a copy

1371
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,280
from a Photoshop file.

1372
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,380
Photoshop was just too old time

1373
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,420
and she couldn't do it.

1374
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,140
I had to lean over the counter

1375
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,780
and go, no, no, scroll down,

1376
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:23,640
scroll down.

1377
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,040
I'm sure she was

1378
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,980
appropriately grateful.

1379
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,980
No, as a matter of fact,

1380
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,820
she was surly.

1381
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,280
And resentful

1382
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,020
that I knew how to work

1383
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,200
this machine at her office,

1384
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,680
you know, at her workplace.

1385
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,320
Have you ever heard of pride, dear?

1386
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,740
I, a subgenius,

1387
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,140
have never, ever,

1388
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,380
I have heard of it,

1389
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,760
but this is a feeling

1390
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,080
I have never felt,

1391
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,440
for I am the most humble

1392
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,720
and egoless

1393
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,500
of all prideful creatures.

1394
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,160
I read on, read on, read on.

1395
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,660
And as Brinwickle once said,

1396
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,620
when it comes to humility,

1397
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,900
I'm the greatest.

1398
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,400
Right, exactly.

1399
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,200
No, actually, actually.

1400
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,920
Nobody's more humble than I am.

1401
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,260
No, no, Dr. Howell,

1402
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,380
truly you are the most humble.

1403
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:12,940
I am more humble than you.

1404
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,280
Great.

1405
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,680
In this shell.

1406
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,500
Well, of course,

1407
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,360
one who claims humility

1408
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,800
has automatically screwed the pooch

1409
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,720
because you violated the rule.

1410
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,800
And remember,

1411
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,720
practice it all in your closet.

1412
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,140
We're not going to do that.

1413
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:28,140


1414
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:28,140


1415
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:28,140


1416
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:28,820
Nobody can see you.

1417
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,900
Not out in the street

1418
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,020
where you can be thought to be

1419
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,140
a whited sepulcher

1420
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,160
containing all manner of uncleanliness

1421
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,060
with a clearly whitewashed exterior.

1422
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,080
Amen.

1423
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,200
Do not...

1424
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,640
Oh, by the way, Doc,

1425
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,800
Reverend Stang,

1426
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:44,420
I gotta say,

1427
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,120
as someone who worked at OfficeMax

1428
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,200
for almost a decade,

1429
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,320
I'm sorry for the low level

1430
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,300
of customer service you found there.

1431
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,120
You're fired!

1432
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,540
Oh, is this on?

1433
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:57,880
You're fired.

1434
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,880
No, you're fired.

1435
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,260
No, you're fired.

1436
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,600
Gentlemen, please, please.

1437
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,520
No fighting in the war.

1438
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,460
Push, push, push.

1439
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:07,580
We're all fired right now.

1440
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,880
At least we want to go home.

1441
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,080
Well, there's no going home

1442
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,380
for some of us.

1443
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,120
We are on our final flight path,

1444
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,660
our ultimate trajectory.

1445
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,100
It's a one-way trip, baby.

1446
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,460
Coming in for a landing.

1447
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,300
But how many years can you say this?

1448
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,660
I mean, it's just...

1449
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,220
As many as it takes.

1450
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,860
Come on.

1451
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,160
Come on.

1452
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:29,640
Yeah, yeah.

1453
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,240
What do we get with the program?

1454
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,540
Be a sport.

1455
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,220
Be a sport.

1456
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,660
I'll try.

1457
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,200
I mean, are you going to ask

1458
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,580
the Jehovah's Witnesses that?

1459
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:39,700
Yes.

1460
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,660
Is it Jehovah's One's Witnesses?

1461
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,820
They won't even blush.

1462
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,980
Jehovah's Witnesses,

1463
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:46,640
as we know.

1464
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,460
Jehovah's Witnesses

1465
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,320
defense attorneys,

1466
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,120
in this case.

1467
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,640
No, Jehovah One

1468
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,860
has lost his marbles

1469
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,240
in the continuum long ago.

1470
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,480
Is the evil...

1471
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,560
Well, not evil.

1472
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,240
No, not necessarily evil.

1473
00:47:59,260 --> 00:47:59,620
And not good either.

1474
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,980
He's just a senile lord.

1475
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,380
He's just kind of the insane space deity

1476
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,060
that the laser project has to signal home

1477
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,360
to Jehovah One's parents.

1478
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,940
He still threatens this Earth,

1479
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,980
but he knows no better.

1480
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:13,180
Yeah, your son is actually kind of going crazy right now.

1481
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,060
No, the sun is still on its same orbit

1482
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,340
around the Milky Way that it's been on.

1483
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,200
It shows no sign of deviating from that.

1484
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,680
Well, he was a baby, and now he's all of a sudden...

1485
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,080
I forgot.

1486
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,420
Also, he was in an assisted living facility.

1487
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,380
Well, now, don't confuse the different

1488
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,820
Trinitarian parts.

1489
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,700
They all fit together nice and neatly like this.

1490
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:42,160
They snap into place, and then you have the Godhead.

1491
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,060
Easily accessible.

1492
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,040
It's a laser beam signal, a tachyon signal.

1493
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,780
Coming from God knows where.

1494
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,800
The fountain of creation.

1495
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,220
No, God knows when, actually, because tachyon,

1496
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:57,020
traveling faster than light, would come from...

1497
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,540
Self-sufficient.

1498
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,100
...a head in our future going backwards in time.

1499
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,580
He's trying to explain to us about tachyon particles right now,

1500
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,180
which goes over the tachy...

1501
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:06,180


1502
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,040
...going backwards in time.

1503
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,500
Yes, it is, because, after all, they are entirely theoretical.

1504
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,940
But let's say your tachyons do exist.

1505
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,280
Let's say that.

1506
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:19,460
Are we really to believe that there is retrograde movement

1507
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,940
backward in time from these bodies?

1508
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,500
Right now.

1509
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,440
I think that's all...

1510
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:26,880
...wishful thinking.

1511
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,580
...that there has to be an anti-time that goes in counter-clockness

1512
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,440
to our normal time.

1513
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,760
Yeah, but if there is...

1514
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,280
If there is tatter and anti-matter, then there is time and anti-time.

1515
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:40,800
And that is staying?

1516
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,560
How do you suppose time control is managed?

1517
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,120
Exactly.

1518
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,720
You know our galaxy is hungry, ready to gobble us all up.

1519
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,120
And wherever you have gravitation and falling, you have time.

1520
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,760
We have staying as well.

1521
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,560
Wherever you have gravitation and falling, you've got the Reverend I.

1522
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:03,360
In a minute there is time for decisions and revisions, which a minute can reverse.

1523
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:03,980
What?

1524
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,260
He's laying the blame for gravity on you, Grandpop Bob.

1525
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,660
Just because I answer the mail at Bob's factory doesn't mean that I'm Bob, okay?

1526
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,920
But primitive peoples make this confusion.

1527
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,400
I'm like one of the elves that worked for Santa.

1528
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,660
Yes, well, once again...

1529
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:22,700
We're Bob.

1530
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,320
Bob don't ever change.

1531
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:23,920
We're Bob.

1532
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,140
Always will be Bob.

1533
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,140
With Santa Claus, we have the same problem or condition that we see in the insect kingdom,

1534
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:38,120
where one large organism is surrounded by many small ones furiously working and supporting

1535
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,600
the central one.

1536
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:47,320
These others are miniatures of the first but sexless drones, and only Santa Claus itself

1537
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,820
produces innumerable progeny.

1538
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,940
But in our world we have deceit.

1539
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,020
And that means that one of these little tiny small elves could actually be Bob himself,

1540
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,620
making the other elves look bad, very bad.

1541
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,180
Not intentionally.

1542
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,600
Not on purpose.

1543
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,220
Well, he's unintentionally making Bob look bad.

1544
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,720
It's an epiphenomenon.

1545
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,100
And besides, we swore to stomp out Smurfs generations ago.

1546
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,940
Well, if we're going to stomp out Smurfs, we've only got six minutes left to do it.

1547
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,300
Well, Santa...

1548
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,120
Reverend Stang?

1549
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,580
I have a question for you.

1550
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,640
Is there a Jehovah Two?

1551
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,240
How many Jehovah's are there?

1552
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:22,920
Yeah, right.

1553
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:22,920


1554
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:22,920


1555
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:22,920


1556
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:22,920


1557
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:22,920


1558
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:22,920


1559
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:22,920


1560
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:22,920


1561
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:22,920


1562
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,620
There's an infinite number of Jehovah's.

1563
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,480
That's what Jehovah is.

1564
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,960
He is an infinite number of deities that live in an infinite number of universes created

1565
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,660
by the infinite number of choices that you make throughout your timeline.

1566
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,160
He's on dope.

1567
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,860
A really good one.

1568
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,660
A really good one.

1569
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,000
Remember, beauty is balance.

1570
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,440
Old Kentucky prop.

1571
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,280
Our galaxy already has started to pull in the large Magellanic cloud.

1572
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,900
The Milky Way grows and evolves by the second.

1573
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:52,900


1574
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:52,900


1575
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:52,900


1576
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:52,900


1577
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:52,900


1578
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,960
By swallowing smaller galaxies.

1579
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:01,700
And sometime fairly soon, in cosmic terms, the galaxy of Andromeda is going to collide

1580
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,180
with ours.

1581
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:03,840
Weeeee!

1582
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,620
Yes, Santa.

1583
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,220
I can hear it putting on the brakes now.

1584
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:11,280
Ah, there are no brakes, unfortunately, for anyone.

1585
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,460
God, don't give galaxies no brakes.

1586
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,440
Don't give nobody no brakes.

1587
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,940
They'll just turn into kind of a blob galaxy.

1588
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,560
Well, they will reform.

1589
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,960
They'll reform, of course, all according to the laws of gravitation.

1590
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,280
Mm-hmm.

1591
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,740
Just as there is a Big Bang, there is also a big collapse that comes into it and creates

1592
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,860
another Big Bang again.

1593
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,280
The universe has been reformed.

1594
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,820
Yes, it's time we got off this treadmill of absurd...

1595
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,360
I can't believe that you're accepting...

1596
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,260
You always want to get off after a Big Bang.

1597
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,020
Yes.

1598
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:42,520
Yes.

1599
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,240
It comes with the territory.

1600
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:45,760
So to speak.

1601
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,700
I can't believe everybody's so accepting of all this.

1602
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,480
Hey, I have another...

1603
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,880
...because you were written smote and low.

1604
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,540
I need to announce another joke.

1605
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:52,540


1606
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:52,540


1607
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,320
I have a lot of dibs I have from X Day.

1608
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:54,940
Here we go.

1609
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,520
This is not a national park this time.

1610
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,180
Is this McDibs or what?

1611
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,180
Well, you know, when...

1612
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,080
Giga dibs or giants...

1613
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:02,660
Start that...

1614
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,780
I know you're claiming the Rijksmuseum.

1615
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,240
About...

1616
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:05,400
Yes.

1617
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,200
No, yeah.

1618
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,440
Go ahead with the Rijksmuseum.

1619
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:07,820
Yes.

1620
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:17,220
I reserve for myself the original manuscript on which Sir Isaac Newton predicted the end

1621
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:21,540
of the world from biblical evidence for, I believe, the year 2035.

1622
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,020
Ooh, good one.

1623
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:28,580
Yeah, I want that because it'll look funny someday.

1624
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:36,540
Unless the world does end in 2035, in which case it turns out, I guess, that Isaac Newton's

1625
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,280
smarty pants and the Bible was right.

1626
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,420
That wouldn't be quite as surprised, now, wouldn't it?

1627
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:45,660
Well, didn't he just drop apples out of trees or something like that?

1628
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,060
And he tripped balls.

1629
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,520
He knew more than most people have.

1630
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:51,520


1631
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,460
I have never forgotten.

1632
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,120
Will you look at it with...

1633
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,320
Especially when it comes to alchemy.

1634
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,020
And yet he was still a nut.

1635
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:57,820
He was quite a good people, Fig Newton.

1636
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,180
He was the smartest guy in the world.

1637
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:05,340
Well, actually, that's debatable because another guy invented the calculus at the same time.

1638
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,920
I thought he was a little bit mad.

1639
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:07,580
But...

1640
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:08,100
What did he mean?

1641
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,560
Yeah, well, he was crazy as a loon.

1642
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:09,980
He was...

1643
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:10,520
Absolutely.

1644
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,880
...in charge of the coinage of...

1645
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,600
Yeah, he was also in charge of the mint.

1646
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,220
...English kingdom.

1647
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:17,960
But...

1648
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,020
He invented money.

1649
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,500
Once he had a special...

1650
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:21,500


1651
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:21,500


1652
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:21,500


1653
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:21,500


1654
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:21,500


1655
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:21,960
...and fallen.

1656
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,320
...device made from an artificer.

1657
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,000
A clockwork maker made a beautiful model of the solar system.

1658
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:33,740
By turning the handle, the little gears would move the orbiting bodies around the planets.

1659
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,400
And a friend came over and said, oh, what a beautiful thing.

1660
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,600
Who made it?

1661
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,740
And Newton said, nobody.

1662
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,820
I had not heard that one.

1663
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,320
That's a good one.

1664
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:44,640
Yes.

1665
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,040
He's an atheist.

1666
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:45,340
Hi.

1667
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,300
I'm a scientist.

1668
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,080
I'm a scientist.

1669
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,460
I'm a scientist.

1670
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:51,460


1671
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:51,460


1672
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:51,460


1673
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:51,460


1674
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,900
Is that the same as the joke about the agnostic...

1675
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:54,760
It's not a joke.

1676
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,020
...language...

1677
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,420
It's not a joke.

1678
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,020
No, it's...

1679
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,340
It's a historical anecdote.

1680
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,180
Oh, I know about the part about him being an atheist or an agn...

1681
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,580
No, he was not an atheist.

1682
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,000
He was not an atheist.

1683
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,580
He was a religious nut by our standards.

1684
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:05,960
...at all.

1685
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,800
He was very, very devout.

1686
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,760
He took the Bible literally, and that's where he made his calculations about the end of

1687
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,380
the world from.

1688
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:17,380
In those days, they all believed in Providence, which is just a town in Rhode Island.

1689
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,120
Well, Providence is...

1690
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,040
Well, it's really there.

1691
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,440
The way that...

1692
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:29,480
Good was able to be churned out of evil by the avenging angelic spirit.

1693
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:35,760
Didn't he make eyeglass lenses out of gold and think that he could look at the sun through

1694
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,700
those lenses and it wouldn't damage his eyes and he became blind?

1695
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,260
Well, they had tiny little holes in them.

1696
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,700
...of his thyroid gland.

1697
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,240
Well, there was a...

1698
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:50,040
No, there was a theory behind that, and gold is used in the insides of the helmet visors

1699
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,660
to keep the...

1700
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:51,480

1701
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,120
...it is.

1703
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,380
... Telescope, as it were.

1704
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,560
It's called a Atlampia.

1705
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:54,560


1706
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:54,580
Yeah, it is.

sent to Benjamin Franklin, who

1712
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,300
apparently used them in his

00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,600
I got me a gold

1718
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,520
tooth that's made out of King Solomon's gold.

1719
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,480
It's magic gold. Maybe it'll

1720
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,340
sell me a gin and I don't need

All the gold in the world has come from outer space anyway.

1723
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,740
It all came from asteroids.

1724

All the gold in the world can't buy

00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,240
and Heinz Schwartz and Gluck.

1732
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,620
And boots and pence. Boots and

1733
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,920

drink, and let every puppy drink.

1739
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,260
Well, my conscience

1740
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,020
is clear. I've done

1741
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,980
what I could to bring the heathen

1742
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,260
and the sheathen to subgenius

1743
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,920
understanding. Oh, and puppies

1744
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,340
drink their sweet, sweet, sweet.

1745
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,100
Now I must get into my own escape

1746
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,980
capsule and take my

1747
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,140

00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,060
Yeah, I gotta get in my escape

00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,560
Oh, shut up.

1753
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,620
I took a powder.

1754
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,280
The world is ending. Quit. Run.

1755
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,560
Hide under the table.

1756
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,020
My phones are going down.
