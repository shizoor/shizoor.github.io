1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,180
One rice, the human rice. Well, and plus the subgenius rice, but not everybody, they didn't put that on the census, I noticed.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,740
That's right. Negroes, yes, but not subgenius.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,500
No. Oh, well.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,080
Keeping the slack man down.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,800
Yeah, that's right. Keeping the slack man down. The pinks.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,000
From PR News in Washington, I'm more competitive with young people abroad.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,180
Vatican spokesman told Vatican Radio that attempts to link me to an alleged cover-up have failed.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,920
President Obama threatens flooding in several major cities.

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,480
He's proposing a child suicide law in Germany.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,920
Johnny Carson says Washington.

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,100
From Washington, this is PR News.

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,260
Authorities say PR's bad.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:50,880
PR's bad.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,820
Thousands of anti-government protesters in Thailand, many of them flocking to that country.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,980
Ask those who live in the Delaware Valley.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,660
And you might hear, thank heavens it's not Philadelphia.

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,800
The U.S. has no plans to Americanize PR News in Washington.

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,700
I didn't catch your name, mister.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,700
Dobbs.

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,100
Most young people will continue through life as normal, responsible citizens.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,540
Others, the shunted and unloved, the unguided, the seekers of thrills and kicks,

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,520
are candidates for the slave world of lifelong...

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,600
How does it happen?

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,900
Where does it start?

25
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,180
What are the signs?

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,140
The pattern is generally the same.

27
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,600
Bob?

28
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,520
Take a lack of responsibility, the inability to make right choices,

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,840
add to it ignorance and indifference,

30
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,800
and top it off with a desire for escapism and kicks.

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,800
The sum total is then...

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,400
The Self-Genius.

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,940
Power of Swag.

34
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,480
This is the real action.

35
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,140
This is the test.

36
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,560
The time to separate the man from the boy.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,860
Willpower, individuality, character are slipping down the drain.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,040
In their place comes Bob.

39
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,700
Don't be chicken.

40
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,400
Now, hang on to your hats, cause we're ready to blast off on a trip through space with...

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,900
Ah, yes sir.

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,780
Okay everybody, here we go!

43
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,260
I believe in the power of the...

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,840
I believe in the power of the...

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:37,840


46
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,040
Bob!

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,680
Bob!

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,380
I believe in the power of the...

49
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:44,940
Bob!

50
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,440
Bob!

51
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,180
Bob!

52
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,460
I believe in the power of the...

53
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,040
Bob!

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,240
Bob!

55
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:52,460


56
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:52,720
Bob!

57
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,060
Ah, Jesus.

58
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,320
And what's the church of the sub-genius?

59
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,660
Oh, you don't know about that?

60
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,660
No, we're trying to learn about it.

61
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,220
That's a mojo.

62
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,260
The Reverend Ivan Stang made a parody church down in Dallas while high on acid.

63
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,800
And you're gonna have to look it up on the InnerTube.

64
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,420
You know, the church of the sub-genius is a parody church of a regular church.

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,160
And also there was a lot of fucking and doing drugs too.

66
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,760
Sounds like the Catholic church.

67
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,820
Jesus.

68
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,620
Bob.

69
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,620
Bob.

70
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:25,740


71
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,920
Bob...

72
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,060
Bob.

73
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:39,880
Bob...

74
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,040
That's what I mean!

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,500
God,

76
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:42,760
that's what I meant by,

77
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,700
the government's motto is to keep the mad nations away from tomorrow.

78
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:51,420
The rabble as쳐.

79
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,680
God is hurting the rich.

80
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,500
The dominion,

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:55,720
your answer.

82
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,420
The modernists, those who wish to see proof of Bob.

83
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,900
But I don't care what they say.

84
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,080
I'll keep preaching.

85
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,520
If you go down, pull them with you.

86
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,220
Praise Bob.

87
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,400
Help me, somebody.

88
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,620
Let there be slack.

89
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,700
See www.subgenius.com

90
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,760
Some men, they go through their whole lives with only one ball.

91
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,300
And that's fine, you know.

92
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,640
So I've read, and well, I guess I figure that you're not really punished if I leave you with a spare.

93
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,700
But what is father?

94
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,080
Bob.

95
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,120
Bob.

96
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:27,600
Bob.

97
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:27,640
Bob.

98
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,880
Bob.

99
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,860
Bob.

100
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,100
Bob.

101
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,920
Bob.

102
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:14,880
Bob.

103
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:15,860
Bob.

104
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,260
Bob.

105
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,540
Bob.

106
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,520
Bob.

107
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,980
Bob.

108
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,280
Entertainment, isolation, paperwork and violence.

109
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,860
Gentle, conditional, democracy in silence.

110
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:02,660
Endless collapse continue, endless recovery.

111
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,300
Unweld pública, with знать noits.

112
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:22,960
We will be firing at one darling.

113
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,960
Thank you.

114
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,560
Thank you.

115
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,500
Thank you.

116
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,420
Thank you.

117
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,320
Thank you.

118
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,340
Thank you.

119
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,300
Thank you.

120
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,720
Thank you.

121
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,300
Thank you.

122
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,600
Thank you.

123
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:26,740
Thank you.

124
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,320
Thank you.

125
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,020
Thank you.

126
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,020


127
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,480
Thank you.

128
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,940
Thank you.

129
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,740
Thank you.

130
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,960
Thank you.

131
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,600
Thank you.

132
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,720
Thank you.

133
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,540
Thank you.

134
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,040
Thank you.

135
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,540
Thank you.

136
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,200
Thank you.

137
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:44,680


138
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,700
Thank you.

139
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,980
Thank you.

140
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,640
Thank you.

141
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,000
and all the success for planning.

142
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,960
I would wait a lifetime

143
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,600
if it takes that long.

144
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,740
I know she's out there

145
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,120
For I have heard her song in dreams she sings to me

146
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,880
Her angel's voice, a symphony

147
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,140
Is she in a garden or a meadow fair?

148
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,680
Does the dappled sunlight shine ribbons in her hair?

149
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,740
Does she sit patiently, smiling as she waits for me?

150
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,040
She's my millionaire girlfriend, she's my life

151
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,080
Once I finally find her, I'll get permission from the wife

152
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,320
We will all live in a castle

153
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,200
My beloved

154
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,260
And my millionaire girlfriend

155
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,720
And I

156
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,540
She's a stolen secret

157
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,840
From a pirate's chest

158
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,660
I will wear an ascot

159
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,140
And a suit that has a vest

160
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,240
And I will put it on

161
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,120
As I watch God no more than long

162
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,200
She's a fairy princess

163
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,280
From a song of old

164
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,960
I will have a toothbrush

165
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,580
That is made of solid gold

166
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,520
And I will watch TV

167
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,540
As my manservant flosses me

168
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,840
She's my millionaire girlfriend

169
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,040
She's my life

170
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,900
Once I finally find her

171
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,120
I'll get permission from the wife

172
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,360
We will all live in a castle

173
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,160
My beloved

174
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,240
And my millionaire girlfriend

175
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,660
And I

176
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,580
Does not matter to me

177
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,580
If she's pretty

178
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,020
Or cute

179
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,020


180
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,440
Counts as what she's

181
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,840
Got at City Bank

182
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,760
Chase Manhattan

183
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,300
Or even Washington Mutual

184
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,960
When my search has ended

185
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,820
I will cherish her

186
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,700
She will sign some papers

187
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,000
Give me power

188
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,220
Of attorney

189
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,740
And what's hers

190
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,340
Will be mine

191
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,560
In perpetuity

192
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,460
She's my millionaire girlfriend

193
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,640
She's my life

194
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,540
Once I finally find her

195
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,740
I'll get permission from the wife

196
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,000
We will all live in a castle

197
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,380
My beloved

198
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,000
And I

199
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,000


200
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,000


201
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,000


202
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,000


203
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,000


204
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,000


205
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,340
You

206
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,040
My beloved

207
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,920
And I

208
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,400
My beloved

209
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,520
My beloved and my millionaire girlfriend

210
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,260
And I, my beloved and my millionaire girlfriend

211
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,380
And I

212
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,360
It's 11.30 p.m.

213
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,040
Do you know where your children are?

214
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,260
I'm surveying with a magazine.

215
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,400
Eat me along.

216
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,860
I'm surveying with a magazine.

217
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,320
Eat, eat, eat, eat me along.

218
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,820
I am surrounded by freaks.

219
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,080
Hey, you don't know the half of it, lady.

220
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,620
And there's one of the freaks now.

221
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,740
I don't like being called a freak that much.

222
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,380
Die, ugly normals.

223
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,680
But I have news of a freak.

224
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,240
Did you read Pravda today

225
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,400
while you were scouring the items for items?

226
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,020
Did I?

227
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,600
Did I read what?

228
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,380
Pravda.

229
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,760
And it's about a nine-year-old girl

230
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,500
giving birth to a perfectly normal child.

231
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,800
Well, that's happening all over the place now, isn't it?

232
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,140
Well, isn't this...

233
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,280
I know an eight-year-old girl

234
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,100
who's just had her time begin.

235
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,540
You had an eight-year-old

236
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,600
who just had her time begin?

237
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,800
Well, it wasn't my eight-year-old.

238
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,020
Well, you shouldn't have said that.

239
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,620
But, no, I think we said that last week

240
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,880
and it had something to do with the cow snot or something,

241
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,840
the stuff in the...

242
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,400
in the snot that comes from the cows' udders

243
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,260
has the growth hormones in it.

244
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:45,800
Yes.

245
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:46,900
Right.

246
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,760
Which, yeah, but...

247
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,200
I could use some of those myself.

248
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,580
Well, apparently...

249
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,340
Stumpy doesn't mind being small, though.

250
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,960
Stumpy can fit in small places.

251
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,120
As long as Stumpy can stand up and salute,

252
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,900
who cares about the rest?

253
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,460
But also on Pravda was a...

254
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,820
There were pictures of the trees on Mars

255
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,020
that's been going around as...

256
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,500
NASA has been fibbing about something.

257
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,460
And then in the very last frame,

258
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,000
it explains how they're just...

259
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,960
It's an optical illusion.

260
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,200
But it's amazing that you don't hear about these things

261
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,380
in the good old UXA where corn cobs were born.

262
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,420
Well, they quit publishing the Weekly World News,

263
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,080
although I understand they still have a website.

264
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,560
That's not very good.

265
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,500
Pravda is fun in much the same way

266
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,800
the Weekly World News is.

267
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,240
It's got a lot of Bigfoot news, celebrity news,

268
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,260
three-headed chicken type stuff.

269
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,160
Hot Russian babes.

270
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,740
By the way, Dave,

271
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,580
I still haven't done the credits.

272
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,040
Well, I thought it was like 9.20,

273
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,020
so I better shut up.

274
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,660
Well, no, you can...

275
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,500
But I do need to let people know

276
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,040
that the very last collage was by Mr. Rection.

277
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,020
Before that, the song Millionaire Girlfriend

278
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,320
was by Jonathan Colton,

279
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,320
the ultimate...

280
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,380
As Dr. Leguim called him,

281
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,220
the ultimate superhero.

282
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,120
The genius songwriter.

283
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,400
It turns out Reverend Back It On Up

284
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,440
was the one who turned Leguim

285
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,220
onto JonathanColton.com.

286
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,720
We heard The Large versus Dr. Howell,

287
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,560
a collage by Lee Murr,

288
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,700
a collage by Mr. Rection,

289
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,980
and that song about the passport,

290
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,820
Don't Need No Passport,

291
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,340
that was Pilgrim Speakeasy.

292
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,440
Pilgrim Speakeasy,

293
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,600
and they can be found on CDBaby.com and Facebook,

294
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,180
and...

295
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,560
MySpace.

296
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,720
Pilgrim Speakeasy.

297
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,360
I could be wrong,

298
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,640
but I think they're from Finland.

299
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,400
We had collages by The Large,

300
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,700
a little clip from Mr. Sistar,

301
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,560
an old Stang minute of slack,

302
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,080
and Opie and Anthony were talking to Mojo Nixon

303
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,160
about the Church of the Subgenius.

304
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,020
That was Mojo Nixon telling those pink boys

305
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,720
about the Church.

306
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,160
The Large,

307
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,940
Reverend Maynard Brainard,

308
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,220
Reverend Sodi,

309
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,120
and of course,

310
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,600
Fernanda Nandy Lee Murr

311
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,880
did the collages that opened the show,

312
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,220
and that is all I have to say about that.

313
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,320
Well, it was quite well said.

314
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,660
Quite well said.

315
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,000
You were succinct,

316
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,300
and you were wearing the clamps as usual.

317
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,380
I was sinking.

318
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,000
You were lip-syncing your own vowels

319
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,900
in front of a mirror?

320
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,400
Yeah.

321
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,800
I thought you gave that up for Lenten holidays.

322
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,640
Ever since I lost my hearing,

323
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,840
it's the only way I can...

324
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,880
I can't hear myself talk, you know?

325
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,900
Well, at least you haven't lost other things.

326
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,540
I mean, hearing is bad.

327
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,780
Don't speak too soon.

328
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,580
Sight is bad.

329
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,820
Princess Wee isn't here.

330
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,340
But why?

331
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,200
She had a meet.

332
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,580
She's...

333
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,680
Because she's designing Starwood

334
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,580
single-handedly, practically.

335
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,600
She had to go to a meeting

336
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,680
and make sure that Starwood will happen,

337
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,100
and it will.

338
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,440
And the new site,

339
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,260
she went to visit the new site,

340
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,220
Wisteria Campground,

341
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,020
and it's just about like...

342
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,460
Brushwood.

343
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,240
It'll be just about the same,

344
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,360
but not as cold,

345
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,960
because it's in southern Ohio.

346
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,500
Is it near Cincinnati?

347
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,520
No.

348
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,020
No, it's way...

349
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,680
It's more near Athens.

350
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,840
Mm-hmm.

351
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,540
It's lovely down there.

352
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,860
It's actually in Pomeroy.

353
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,940
Quite a few mounds down there.

354
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
Yes, and they even made their...

355
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,860
They built their own turtle mound.

356
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,980
I didn't know what Princess Wee

357
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,280
was talking about at first.

358
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,740
I envisioned a big,

359
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,900
big pile of turtles,

360
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,100
but it was a mound,

361
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,300
like an Indian mound,

362
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,920
shaped in a tertalian shape.

363
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,180
Isn't that...

364
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,580
That's exciting to me.

365
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,120
Well, it's a good,

366
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
well-appointed campground

367
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,400
with showers and everything.

368
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,120
Now, X-Day is still where it's always been,

369
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,940
and that is coming up,

370
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,500
and that's what's been keeping me busy

371
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,040
is trying to get ready

372
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,820
to start getting ready for X-Day.

373
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,080
It's funny how much effort you put in.

374
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,780
Even though you know the world is going to end.

375
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Especially when you know the world's going to end.

376
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,240
You have to think positively, Stan.

377
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,820
It could actually happen this year.

378
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,280
Well, sure, sure.

379
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,440
But for that matter,

380
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,340
it could happen in the next five minutes.

381
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,980
That's thinking real positive.

382
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,480
Right.

383
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,680
Hurry up, X-Day.

384
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,140
I think what needs to be done

385
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,160
is to have people remove the blinders

386
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
and to look squarely at the outcome.

387
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,780
Wait, I'm so bored.

388
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,060
Things have already been done.

389
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,760
They've been preordained,

390
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,620
and they already have happened

391
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,480
in different dimensions,

392
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,240
and they're just waiting

393
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,000
for that saddle-up moment

394
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,660
when everything flops like an eagle.

395
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:41,780
Right.

396
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,620
Where the sun doesn't,

397
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,500
there is no more sun.

398
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,860
Where Bob don't care to look.

399
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,700
Well, there's no more solar system

400
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,500
as we know it.

401
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,960
No sun to speak of.

402
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,800
Man, I was,

403
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,420
I told you,

404
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,120
I've had the bad habit

405
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,640
of reading the comments

406
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,220
after the news articles.

407
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,300
Yeah, me too.

408
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,360
And there was the news article

409
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,880
about global warming,

410
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,740
and apparently,

411
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,160
somebody must have prompted

412
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,620
the teabaggers

413
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,500
to all say the same wisecrack about,

414
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,720
well, you're going to keep

415
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,100
the whole solar system

416
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,920
from warming up next,

417
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,240
Mr. Al Gore.

418
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,880
He invented the internet, you know.

419
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,840
If we were students...

420
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,080
I've heard that so many times,

421
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,960
I've about decided,

422
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,920
yeah, Al Gore did invent the internet.

423
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,920
And Obama is a Muslim communist

424
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,980
who hates our freedom,

425
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,760
and no Democrat ever,

426
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,700
works.

427
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,760
I've read that today.

428
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,520
I was informed...

429
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,180
No, they don't pay taxes either.

430
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:39,540
Right.

431
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,220
No Democrat ever works

432
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,120
or pays taxes.

433
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,660
Only Republicans and teabaggers

434
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,340
ever work or pay taxes.

435
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,120
Although, oddly,

436
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,780
they seem to have

437
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,100
an awful lot of spare time

438
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,520
to add comments

439
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,700
to Yahoo.com news articles.

440
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,820
It's amazing how,

441
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,120
I thought that their lack

442
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,900
of spelling ability

443
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,160
was perhaps a plant

444
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,720
by this covert shadow government.

445
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,040
Yeah, yeah.

446
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,960
That they,

447
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,620
they talk about

448
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,480
meaning the shadow

449
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,600
covert government

450
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,260
was not on their side.

451
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,800
It was against their,

452
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,860
it was on our side

453
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,940
or not,

454
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,640
no, they're,

455
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,540
well, you know what I mean?

456
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,920
Kind of, pretty much.

457
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,840
Well, all I know is that

458
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,020
the, the, the,

459
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,100
the people who hate,

460
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,720
really hate

461
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,240
the, the government.

462
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,380
I mean, more than I ever

463
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,260
hated the government,

464
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
and that's saying a lot.

465
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,620
They seem to agree

466
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,120
with the president of Iran

467
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,840
on quite a few issues.

468
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,680
I know.

469
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,320
It's funny how that,

470
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,540
you know, how do you,

471
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,920
how do you make

472
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,300
all that stuff jibe?

473
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,540
Logically,

474
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,360
but I guess you don't have to

475
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,100
because you don't use your mind

476
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,520
to think about your religion.

477
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,400
They move the dog

478
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,600
and all of dogma

479
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,580
take away the veil of death

480
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,640
and what you see

481
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,820
is what you get.

482
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,620
That's the problem.

483
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,120
They don't,

484
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,960
people are not,

485
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,300
that's, they're not,

486
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,460
not pantheistic

487
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,600
or xenophobic.

488
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,360
It means they can only see

489
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,460
in the, the mindset

490
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,000
that they're in right now,

491
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,160
which is American mindset,

492
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,620
259.

493
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,700
Well, I, I'm the same way.

494
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,860
I can only see things

495
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,280
as a cosmically expanded mind

496
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,140
of a subgenius can see things.

497
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,780
That's because you receive...

498
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,360
Which is like from the bottom,

499
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,000
I can see the sides

500
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,360
and top of the barrel.

501
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,860
I'm, yeah, but you're not

502
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,200
like the average American

503
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,740
because you receive

504
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,820
your mediated messages

505
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,200
from perhaps Bob,

506
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,440
perhaps extraterrestrials.

507
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,300
I don't know.

508
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,440
Alt.slack.

509
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,160
Alt.slack, certainly.

510
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,880
And any other place

511
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,900
that you care to look

512
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,260
when you can and when you do.

513
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,740
But the average American

514
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,720
listens to the old hot media,

515
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,860
the propaganda media

516
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,820
of the 30s,

517
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,560
which tells them

518
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,820
and makes you wonder

519
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,720
what it's like to live in a world

520
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,980
where nothing that you hear

521
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,920
is true and yet you

522
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,720
fervently believe all this stuff

523
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,500
and you're really, you know...

524
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,020
I read a headline today

525
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,700
that bald-faced stated

526
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,440
polls grow.

527
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:03,880
Grieve.

528
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,220
And I thought,

529
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,640
that doesn't make any sense.

530
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,120
That's impossible.

531
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,000
I mean, no.

532
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,280
Polls grieve.

533
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,040
Hmm.

534
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,540
At the loss of their mourn.

535
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,220
That's the problem, too.

536
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,320
It's not even mourning

537
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,040
where most of my telephone polls exist.

538
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,160
That's a totally subcontinent...

539
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,980
Your mourning poll.

540
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,580
I have, oh, I found...

541
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,020
I found something good in the news.

542
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,100
A prophecy,

543
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,940
not even a Bob prophecy,

544
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,680
one of my prophecies came true.

545
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,920
No one, no slack for anyone ever again?

546
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,560
No, no, this was, well, yes and no.

547
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,480
I was reading an article

548
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,200
about a new powerful beer

549
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,440
that some brewery in Scotland is making.

550
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,460
And I've been hearing about

551
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,740
heavily fortified beers,

552
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,740
but this one is 32%

553
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,720
alcohol beer.

554
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
It's 53 bucks a bottle.

555
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,720
And here's the name of it.

556
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,460
Tactical Nuclear Penguin Beer.

557
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,540
Nuclear Beer.

558
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,200
As predicted in my underground movie,

559
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,800
Let's Visit the World of the Future,

560
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,560
available free on Google Video, I think,

561
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,040
which has the people of the future

562
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,680
injectifying cans, entire cans,

563
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,440
that have needles on one end,

564
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,460
and a plunger on the other,

565
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,280
injecting cans of nuclear beer.

566
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,560
Now, my nuclear beer was

567
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,260
part fortified alcohol,

568
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,020
or grain alcohol,

569
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,540
and part amphetamine,

570
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,860
methamphetamines.

571
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,260
And if you'll notice...

572
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,000
And nuclear weight.

573
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,740
Not only are they making

574
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,280
nuclear beer in Scotland,

575
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,760
but here in the U.S.,

576
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,400
you see many alcoholic beverages

577
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,960
that are packed with caffeine

578
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,280
and power drugs, you know,

579
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:00,880
or whatnot.

580
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,940
The Guarana and stuff.

581
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:02,960
Yeah.

582
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,420
Yeah.

583
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:03,720
So forth.

584
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,560
Yes, this is all the rage.

585
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,760
But it's part of a very old tradition.

586
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,000
As far as the fortified ales go,

587
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,360
every anniversary in the British Isles

588
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,720
for some important event,

589
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,540
they try and get it up,

590
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,400
but 32 is a new record.

591
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,980
But I, myself, have ingested the 28%,

592
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,520
which makes you stupid after one.

593
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,800
It's just annoying.

594
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,800
It's just like,

595
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,640
yeah, I had a beer, man.

596
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,380
Stupid.

597
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,280
I had that experience.

598
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,400
I had been reading...

599
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,540
Well, one of the subgeniuses,

600
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,640
Dr. Lobotomy, said,

601
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,600
hey, look how terrible

602
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,640
these people in socialist countries,

603
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,080
in real socialist countries, have it.

604
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,780
It was a news article about...

605
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,060
Like China and Russia, right?

606
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,600
Well, now get this.

607
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,280
The workers at the Carlsberg Brewery

608
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,180
in Copenhagen, Denmark,

609
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,320
are on strike

610
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,580
because they're not allowed

611
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,960
to drink all the beer

612
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,460
they want any time anymore.

613
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,220
Now they're only allowed...

614
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,520
The workers at the Carlsberg Brewery

615
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,020
are only allowed to drink during lunch.

616
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
And that's how hard they have it

617
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,780
in those socialist countries.

618
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:13,780
I know.

619
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,840
And when they fall down on the machinery

620
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,040
from being able to drink all day and stuff,

621
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,940
somebody pays for it besides them.

622
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,040
Well, now that's what they were...

623
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,520
Well, indirectly, they do

624
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
because they have high taxes

625
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
in these Scandinavian countries, I guess.

626
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,460
Well, the reason these workers were so upset

627
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,580
was because nobody asked them about it.

628
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,020
They were used to being consulted.

629
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,540
Before there was a big change.

630
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,780
And suddenly the management had announced,

631
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,540
no, you can't drink on the job all day anymore.

632
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,060
You can only drink at lunch.

633
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,700
Now, here in the land of the free,

634
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,500
I know that for most companies,

635
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,180
if you come back from lunch

636
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,800
with the tiniest whiff of beer on your breath,

637
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,080
you're docked pay for two weeks,

638
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,420
you know, or something worse.

639
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,420
Or you just put the zero tolerance.

640
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,320
When I was a young drunkard

641
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,200
working in the industry,

642
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,600
working in the Dallas film business,

643
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,280
it was...

644
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,420
Everybody had two beers at lunch.

645
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,880
That was just normal.

646
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,560
You know, it was expected.

647
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,720
Sometimes you would have four

648
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,000
and you would be stupid

649
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,320
when you got back to work.

650
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,440
And it wasn't fun.

651
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,520
Well, if you were stupid,

652
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,460
then you got in trouble.

653
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,720
But if you could function on a couple of beers,

654
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,340
which most people could in Texas,

655
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,700
that was okay.

656
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,700
In fact, it was legal to drive down the road

657
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,320
sipping on your can of Lone Star

658
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,180
as long as you weren't drunk.

659
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,580
On the other hand,

660
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,580
when I read about that Carlsberg Brewery,

661
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,680
I got so...

662
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,380
It planted...

663
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,620
It was like the best advertising in the world.

664
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,480
I had to go out and try some Carlsberg beer,

665
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,240
but I bought the kind called Elephant,

666
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,940
which is fortified.

667
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,620
Yeah, 7.2.

668
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,620
And just as you say,

669
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,740
it wasn't like having one beer.

670
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,420
It was like having a beer and a half.

671
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,340
And I was kind of,

672
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,940
well, I can't get my work done now.

673
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
I can't work on this important stuff.

674
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,200
I have to work on this beer.

675
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,200


676
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,200


677
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,200


678
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,200


679
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,940
I have to work on an hour of slack.

680
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,960
Yes, I remember the days

681
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,300
when you would have a few at lunch and stuff.

682
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,240
And the first two,

683
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,460
when you got back to work,

684
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,760
the first two hours would just fly by

685
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,120
and you were having so much fun.

686
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,680
And the last two were just really,

687
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,520
really horribly slow.

688
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,120
Just like school.

689
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,220
Just like life, Stang.

690
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:22,600
Yeah.

691
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,580
Without slack or without Bob,

692
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,400
after reading some of your works,

693
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,340
I'm starting to think that Bob

694
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,100
is a lot more important than I thought.

695
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,120
He's the kind of person or icon

696
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,920
or whatever that I used to just want to go

697
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,620
up and punch in the stomach real hard.

698
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,640
Maybe urinate on his foot.

699
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,420
Oh, he'll pay you for that

700
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,620
if you can find him.

701
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,580
I mean, he loves it.

702
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,680
He's into that kind of thing.

703
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,700
He's kind of kinky.

704
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,160
I don't think that's why I like him now.

705
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,460
There's nothing you can do

706
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,460
that he doesn't want you to do.

707
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,980
Well, I like that he fornicates trees.

708
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,840
And I remember the old psychopath

709
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,840
Pathfinder saying,

710
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,720
I had adultery.

711
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,480
I committed adultery with an adult tree.

712
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:02,940
Adult tree.

713
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:03,980
Yeah, I remember that.

714
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,180
And when I heard that Bob was doing it,

715
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,200
I realized that it was probably something

716
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,280
I should be doing, too.

717
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,320
I could probably be a wood borer in some way

718
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,240
if I, you know, set my mind to it.

719
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,640
And I think, well, not really.

720
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,500
I don't think anything.

721
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,580
Lucky you.

722
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:22,940
Just like Bob.

723
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,040
You have reached the state

724
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,700
that every subgenius aspires to.

725
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,240
Break no-think.

726
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,680
The state of no-think.

727
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,980
Break mind.

728
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,420
It's beautiful.

729
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,980
Well, I suppose not really beautiful

730
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,940
because words defy and decry and despise.

731
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,980
Right, you don't have words

732
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,060
when you have no mind.

733
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,640
Not even pictures.

734
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,400
I would desecrate those same spots if I could

735
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,560
or make them with my body, you know?

736
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,640
That's a beautiful thing.

737
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,480
And this beautiful music in the background,

738
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,820
by the way, is by Ron Slabe.

739
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,340
Pyrosonic.

740
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,880
It's, what he had playing last Starwood.

741
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,440
He composed this for the Island Fireworks Show

742
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,240
or the Fire Tribe Dancing, Juggling, Fire Eating.

743
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,460
This isn't the one that ended up in the small,

744
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,280
the explosion.

745
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,660
No, that was another group.

746
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,340
That was the Time Machine Fellows.

747
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,100
That's to Ron's deck.

748
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,880
Cash Starburner, in fact,

749
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,700
was the guy that,

750
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,900
that caused the explosion at the last Starwood.

751
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,420
You know that,

752
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,880
I almost got my legs sheared off

753
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,580
by a door of the structure that blew up.

754
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,760
It's on the video.

755
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,180
You can see this door in night vision

756
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:49,760
coming straight towards the underside of the camera,

757
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,980
which would be my legs.

758
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,660
But Bob or God or the devil caused it,

759
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,940
or the wind caused it to suddenly change direction

760
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,080
and it zipped off to the side

761
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,920
as if I had a,

762
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,680
a fire.

763
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,180
Force field.

764
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,900
But we won't,

765
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,040
we won't have any more of those happening out at Brushwood

766
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,420
because there won't be any more Starwoods out at Brushwood.

767
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,880
No, no more Bob facial implants.

768
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,340
We'll have to blow things up elsewhere.

769
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,060
No more Bob facial implants in New York State.

770
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,980
Oh, I know people who won't go to Burning Man anymore

771
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,560
because you're no longer allowed to use a machine gun

772
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,500
or use explosives without a permit.

773
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,600
Or an exposed cerebral cortex.

774
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,680
God, that is yucky.

775
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,060
Oh, you actually, you can do that.

776
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,320
Well, you can, but you may not.

777
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,380
I'd hate, it's awfully sandy environment for, for that.

778
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,740
That would be horrible.

779
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,180
Yeah, you get a lot of grit.

780
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,940
I mean, I'd, I'd break every video camera that I take out there.

781
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,680
I would think that if you walked around with your brain exposed,

782
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,540
it would get pretty gritty pretty fast.

783
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,380
Well, here's a 40 and a side note to that.

784
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,580
The grit that could accumulate in your head

785
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,800
and it could go into your skull

786
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,680
is very similar to the giants that the Indians were scared of around here.

787
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,540
Um, in this area of where we're speaking and stuff,

788
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,760
there are these giants, these macrocephalic giants

789
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,020
who have very, very large foreheads

790
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,000
and they're all gritty as if pockmarked with sand

791
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,780
and as if the skull itself was a sandy surface.

792
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,000
And some of the less erudite members of the tribe

793
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,980
have postulated that perhaps Vikings, um,

794
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,600
who didn't want to intermarry after the little ice age,

795
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,660
whatever it was when the weather wasn't so good,

796
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,140
so nice and got crappy for a while like it is often.

797
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:34,620
Yeah.

798
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,740
It was real warm, I guess, a while ago

799
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,080
and it's getting warmer again, perhaps.

800
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,940
Anyway, it's not important.

801
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:45,840
Anyway, these giants had huge, huge shell-shaped, um, sandy pocked skulls.

802
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,320
Forehead skulls.

803
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,380
That's in the Bible too.

804
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,120
There were giants in the earth in those days.

805
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,460
These were what we...

806
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,160
But they were just broke Swedes.

807
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,780
These were what we call the Yeti.

808
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,860
The Yetis of the Himalayas and, uh, who then migrated to Mount Shasta.

809
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,540
Right.

810
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,220
They live underground.

811
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,520
Yes.

812
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,620
Mm-hmm.

813
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,540
Mm-hmm.

814
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,740
Mm-hmm.

815
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,760
Oh, how.

816
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,820
Uh, I don't know.

817
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,160
Uh, uh.

818
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,200
Well, right.

819
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,680
To quote Philo...

820
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,420
Hey, we got farced!

821
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:14,680
Pardon?

822
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,440
We got farced.

823
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,100
X-Day got farced.

824
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,340
What happened was, uh, uh, good Reverend Motomac,

825
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,360
the sex god, sent out his annual press release

826
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,160
about the subgenius X-Day end of the world festival

827
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,660
where we gather and wait for sex.

828
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:31,760
And he sent out a press release about the subgenius X-Day

829
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:31,760


830
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,680
we're going to have to wait for the world to end on July 5th this year

831
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,540
and have done every year.

832
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,060
And he sent that press release out and like most years,

833
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,380
most of the news services ignored it.

834
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:45,420
But Flash News picked it up and the next thing we knew,

835
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,080
disinfo.com was talking about the church

836
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,700
and I got about 10 orders that way.

837
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:57,620
And then farc.com started to put up a, uh, carried that news.

838
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,520
It's, it's, the news release itself is full of misinformation,

839
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,180
misquotes,

840
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,320
Thank God.

841
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,260
everything wrong,

842
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,060
Right.

843
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,700
but they did spell subgenius right without an O.

844
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:17,700
And, um, so we, that's why I'll be able to,

845
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,760
to send you a check for this phone call.

846
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,680
$5,000.

847
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,780
This long distance phone call you had to do.

848
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,080
Yeah. $5,000.

849
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,120
It's cause I mean, you, I remember back in 2007,

850
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,880
we were, we, I'd have been sending you 20,000 bucks

851
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,440
after being farced like that.

852
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,200
A brief farked on a phone call.

853
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,720
The times have changed.

854
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,100
It's like, I, all I can think of is Steinbeck or somebody or whatever.

855
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,020
I know.

856
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,280
Who wrote Grapes of Wrath?

857
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,740
I'm sorry.

858
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,240
I'm so ignorant.

859
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:48,720
I forgot.

860
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,700
I just think of swirling oak bowls and dusty things and, you know,

861
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,060
farmers being forced into the, you know,

862
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,380
into the concentration camp so they can learn how to focus more properly

863
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,540
when they're using, you know, the little headwear they use

864
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,020
when they have the mind control games.

865
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,000
Have you ever tried those or been tried by them?

866
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

867
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,520
I haven't.

868
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,640
You know, it's all the rage among the 11- and 9-year-olds and stuff

869
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,320
to strap a metallic balloon toy on their head

870
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,200
and focus on a ball and make the ball rise and fall.

871
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,660
I found myself doing that at Winterstar last time.

872
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,200
You were looking at your own decomposing body in the bathtub

873
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,860
to calculate the process, I think.

874
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,680
The things have changed.

875
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,260
I've noticed computer memory is real cheap now,

876
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,120
and so are bad memories, but good memories are dear, dear, dear,

877
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,280
very dear, very expensive to keep a good memory in your head.

878
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,960
You have to keep a lot of the bad memories,

879
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,180
but all the good memories are expensive.

880
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,180


881
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,760
Or else you'll make the same mistakes over and over again.

882
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,080
Yeah, yeah.

883
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,720
I was thinking in the psychosociopathic plus realm myself

884
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,820
when you mentioned that I didn't think I was hearing me,

885
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,920
you know, the errand hollerings of any people locked up in the monastery

886
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,140
or something for cripes sake, you know.

887
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,060
That's the devil locked up in that monastery, man.

888
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,460
Don't, whatever he tells you, don't believe him.

889
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,400
Don't let him out.

890
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:22,740
The lovers of the scaly foot do not believe this thing.

891
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:23,940
Of course.

892
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,520
You know, that's the way things are run around here.

893
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,180
And what if X-Day doesn't work out around here?

894
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,660
So what if we don't get out of here so they don't have to...

895
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,220
We'll be sitting around begging for spare climate change.

896
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:46,400
And as you can scan, we shall get any other than errant mind control

897
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,540
from every source as over-mediated monkeys.

898
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,140
That's what I feel like.

899
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,900
I feel like a research.

900
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,060
I feel like some sort of lab.

901
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,040
Monkey or something.

902
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,440
You kind of look a little bit like those ones that are raised with the terrycloth mothers.

903
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,160
Well, don't you know about associative environment and testing and so forth?

904
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,320
Of course I look like Mark Mother's paw now.

905
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,560
My feet have all grown back in.

906
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,960
Man.

907
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,300
That's the way it works.

908
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,320
Once you're in an environment for long enough, you begin to resemble your environment.

909
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,300
Uh.

910
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,900
Yeah, that's concrete.

911
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,900
That's glassy.

912
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,720
We're concrete and we're glassy and plasticky looking.

913
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:38,280
And, uh, hey, I, uh, we were talking earlier off the air about how the government doesn't

914
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,520
have to force you to be hooked up to machines because everybody can't wait to be hooked

915
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,340
up to their machine.

916
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,340
They get up in the morning and put on their headphones and take their iPad and their iPod

917
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,880
and their iPhone and their iMind and their iCar and their iVac.

918
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:52,880


919
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:52,880


920
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:52,880


921
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:52,880


922
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:52,880


923
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:52,880


924
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:52,880


925
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:52,880


926
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:52,880


927
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:52,880


928
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,920
And they're hooked up to a van and they stang away down the road, all hooked up to everything

929
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,440
they do.

930
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,500
They're hooked up to a machine.

931
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:07,300
And then they go, they, they, they roll their car up to Walmart and they crawl into Walmart

932
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:13,140
and climb onto a little machine and tootle around Walmart on a little golf cart or the

933
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,620
supermarket.

934
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,300
What would Australopithecus think of us right now?

935
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,080
Think of us as some sort of, uh.

936
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:21,820
Probably.

937
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,660
Probably.

938
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:22,840
Probably.

939
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:22,880


940
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,360
Like an easy kill.

941
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,000
Like look at that mass of meat.

942
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,840
And they're so slow.

943
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,060
We don't even need a very good hand axes to bash their brains in.

944
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:42,900
Well if there was a real time based continuum that made sense, we would be the cargo cult.

945
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,240
Not we, I don't wear any of those clothes.

946
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:51,840
But the, the Australopithecans would become the new, you know, sausage farmers and delinquents

947
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,760
and people like that.

948
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,080
And they would raise the banner and, you know, so on and so forth.

949
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:05,200
There was a new Australopithecus, well, an old Australopithecus discovered, newly discovered, some excellent skeletons.

950
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,800
I read I had to go and...

951
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:18,560
They think it might be, not really be Australopithecus, they think it might be one of the many, too many perhaps to conceive of,

952
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,560
of pre-human humans walking around hanging out at pretty much the same time.

953
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,820
Yeah, there were a lot of other ones besides us at one time.

954
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,040
That's the Yeti diversity, man. That's what we need.

955
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:42,740
Now, you know, the thing about, well, not an Australopithecus, an Australopithecus girl wouldn't look that hot to us.

956
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,540
But a Homo erectus woman seen from young Homo erectus...

957
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,980
Homo erectus walking neck and down the road, seen from behind, you'd start following.

958
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:59,580
Now, when she turned around and looked at you, you might, that might take a little getting used to.

959
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,060
It may have taken some getting used to.

960
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,340
There might have been a lot of getting used to and such like going on back then.

961
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,820
I guess we may never know.

962
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,980
Well, that's called hag syndrome.

963
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,160
It's in every town in the nation.

964
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,240
You're cruising down the street, you see some hot babe, you know, from behind.

965
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,540
And then you turn around.

966
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,660
And I look at her and she's 94 years old.

967
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,080
Her body's just well preserved.

968
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:30,420
She has no teeth, no eyes, certainly no third nostrils because she's probably only got one to begin with.

969
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,640
Maybe she's a little flat for ears.

970
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,420
That's a beautiful thing.

971
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:45,240
Ben Franklin pointed out that as women age, the first parts to age are the visible parts, the face and hands.

972
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,340
But the parts that you don't see are oftentimes continuous.

973
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:54,760
They continue to look pretty much like they did when they were young teenagers for quite a long time, in some cases.

974
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,200
The kind that, in fact, that I was looking at on the Internet just earlier today.

975
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,420
Oh, I read that the 3D pornography is on its way.

976
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,520
Oh, God, I hope so.

977
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:12,100
Well, according to Nefier's minions, many parts of their bodies continue to live forever.

978
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:17,580
And that's why we can, what did you say about buying a different one?

979
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:25,280
Well, some, our bodies don't live, most of our parts don't live forever.

980
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:33,500
But I was reading about my little buddies, the rotifers, the little barely visible to the naked eye creatures.

981
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,260
Some of them are too small to see.

982
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,280
I see them a lot because I keep them, you know, I raise them.

983
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,460
I have a rotifer farm and a water bear farm and so forth.

984
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,140
It was, it has been discovered lately that when rotifers,

985
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,540
well, they basically can't be killed.

986
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:52,960
What?

987
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:59,780
You can deprive them of all heat, all air, all water, all everything.

988
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,100
You can put them out in space.

989
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:07,580
They will dry up into little pill-shaped things that will last.

990
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:10,260
You can fit a thousand of them into a little thimble.

991
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,360
And they'll last for years and years.

992
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,980
And the next time that water falls upon them, why?

993
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,540
They come back.

994
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,080
They come back to life.

995
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:26,000
And even though their DNA has been destroyed by radiation or drying or whatnot,

996
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:33,720
these creatures have the ability to absorb DNA from other creatures

997
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,840
and automatically rebuild their own with it.

998
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:45,820
Now, what if we could, you know, I've got a lot of busted chromosomes from all that LSD

999
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,320
that Mojo Nixon was talking about earlier.

1000
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,060
I've got a lot of busted chromosomes from all that LSD that Mojo Nixon was talking about earlier.

1001
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:52,360
That I had to take in order to get a job for Bob.

1002
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,140
And that was a long time ago, obviously.

1003
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,440
So you're saying there's a lot of freaked out...

1004
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,140
An hour and a half ago.

1005
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,420
I wish that stuff would come on.

1006
00:46:59,500 --> 00:46:59,720
God.

1007
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,780
Stangy rotifers around?

1008
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,600
You're saying that there's a lot of freaked out, flippy, stangy rotifers around

1009
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:12,880
that won't die forever because they're sucking everyone else's DNA to make their own

1010
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,580
and just don't believe in dying?

1011
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:13,700
Right.

1012
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,200
Why can't we do that?

1013
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,540
Why can't the subgeniuses pick up an idea from Microsoft?

1014
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,760
Micro creatures like rotifers and do that very self-same thing.

1015
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:31,400
You know, we have been working for years on trying to encode the text of Book of the Subgenius

1016
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:37,520
into the DNA of cockroaches so that the book will always be in print forever.

1017
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,120
Because they do live an extremely long time.

1018
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,880
Even, I mean, not as an individual cockroach.

1019
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,620
Well, they reproduce and they survive well.

1020
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,140
Yes.

1021
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,080
But really, we should be encoding...

1022
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,100
I'm going to turn the Book of the Subgenius into phylodina rotifers.

1023
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,300
Those are my favorites.

1024
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,100
Wow.

1025
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,560
Well, that's an important discovery.

1026
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:03,280
I'd shake the halls of science, at least in Dobbs Town, because you stumbled on something

1027
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:03,560
there.

1028
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,480
Give up the idea of implanting roaches with the knowledge and use the rotifers.

1029
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:08,940
Right.

1030
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,380
I don't know.

1031
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,060
I like it.

1032
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:11,660
Yeah.

1033
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,620
And they really will live forever.

1034
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,120
Of course, the problem is that over the years...

1035
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,040
It's a copy of a copy of a copy.

1036
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,120
The text, certain words start to become misspelled.

1037
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,980
Next thing you know, all the rotifers are going, praise Bill instead of praise Bob.

1038
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:32,920
Well, then they'd have to die, too, because if they became associated with anything entropic,

1039
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,280
eventually they would start to wind out of control.

1040
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,600
Maybe they wouldn't die.

1041
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,340
They'd just keep on mutating.

1042
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:39,880
Oh, yeah.

1043
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,800
That would be weird.

1044
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,060
That would be kind of sad, I think.

1045
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,980
I wonder if we will keep on mutating.

1046
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,200
Or if we'll just stagnate.

1047
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,980
Well, we've already stagnated.

1048
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,340
That's not the point.

1049
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,260
I mean, us personally.

1050
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:54,920
You and me.

1051
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,220
Well, no, I know.

1052
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:56,720
That's what I mean.

1053
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,720
I've got a pretty weird-looking toenail that makes me think I'm still mutating.

1054
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,440
Yeah, I keep on growing new things.

1055
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,140
I have another large egg-shaped thing on my head, only on a different side.

1056
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:08,760
Really?

1057
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,580
Well, I think you've seen this one before and said all you need to do is lance it.

1058
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,880
Well, I actually use Sir Lancelot's lance, and it still didn't work.

1059
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,600
Oh, my night, you have to use sandpaper.

1060
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,020
Or a sander, actually.

1061
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,960
A belt sander.

1062
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,300
It smells horrible, doesn't it?

1063
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,260
You know, when you burn away one of those big warts on your head?

1064
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,160
Because that's kind of what they are.

1065
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,600
Some of them are cysts, and some are bros, and some are warts.

1066
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,280
And you can lance the cysts or squeeze them out.

1067
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,880
I've seen them as big as an egg.

1068
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,680
An actual?

1069
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,940
A little duck egg?

1070
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,920
The cyst being removed from a human body.

1071
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,420
Not my body, thank goodness.

1072
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,160
I had one right under my eye once that was quite scary.

1073
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,540
Did you ask the doctor if you could keep it or take it home with you?

1074
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:09,880
As a matter of fact, the doctor and the nurse leaned closely over me and started to squeeze it.

1075
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:16,300
And I envisioned them being squirted with foul-smelling cyst juice.

1076
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,400
And I said,

1077
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,480
Are you guys sure you don't want to cover that up while you squeeze it?

1078
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,400
And they both looked at me and rolled their eyes like,

1079
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,880
What a stupid idiot!

1080
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:32,580
And at that moment, they were both squirted with the most foul ichor imaginable.

1081
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,640
I mean, it must have stunk up.

1082
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,320
And it sprayed all over the doctor's face, all over the nurse's clothes, across the room.

1083
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:47,300
It was a beautiful, beautiful thing following that condescending look that doctor gave me.

1084
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,600
That was not my regular doctor.

1085
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,980
That was an emergency doctor.

1086
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,840
And there were reasons for keeping the excreta from your thing.

1087
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,840
You see, there's still a little slice on my face where that cyst once was.

1088
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,480
Everything that could have harmed you is gone.

1089
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,460
Everything that could hurt you is a memory now.

1090
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,400
Yes, you're right.

1091
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:17,140
Sit back and relax and know that your fluids are being used to further the pursuit of science.

1092
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,780
Pull the when.

1093
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,100
That mankind will march forward.

1094
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,280
Pull the when over your own eye.

1095
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,080
Release the winds of the hounds of Hades.

1096
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,340
Just get it over with and drop a bomb.

1097
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,020
No, you can't say that on the air, can you?

1098
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,180
Can you?

1099
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:43,420
I remember when I was a hero back in 19...

1100
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,980
It's domestic terrorism jokes.

1101
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:47,740
Well...

1102
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,760
The satire bands are definitely in effect for those right now.

1103
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,280
I guess if you check out a website, you're kind of collusional.

1104
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,340
Is that true or is that just scuttlebutt?

1105
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,260
It depends on the website.

1106
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:06,080
If you check out subgenius.com, then you'll know what's going on with subgenius.com.

1107
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,780
At least they won't come to your house.

1108
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:16,140
And you'll learn about the revival, the subgenius church revival meeting in Shanghai, China in May.

1109
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,200
There really is one.

1110
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:30,320
They keep having to put it off a month because people keep getting scared to do a weird religious meeting in mainland communist China.

1111
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:39,360
But I think communism has become so capitalist, it wouldn't matter what the commissar thought, if this was good thinking or correct thinking.

1112
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:44,640
If you gave him enough money, he would probably come out there and deliver the opening massage.

1113
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:45,800
Right?

1114
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,040
Right.

1115
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:50,100
I know what happens when Chinese people first lay eyes on Bob.

1116
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,680
They crack up.

1117
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,180
Because, let's face it, to them, Caucasians are funny looking.

1118
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:56,820
Big noses.

1119
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,480
I was going to say, he looks like a dumbass white man.

1120
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,940
And he's the most, he's the whitest white man.

1121
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:15,200
Just as poor Chief Wahoo has exaggerated features that are supposed to look like an American Indian, Bob is like the cartoon white man.

1122
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,120
In fact, Bob...

1123
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:19,200
And Chief Wahoo have a lot in common.

1124
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,380
Their expressions are kind of similar.

1125
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,380
Sly.

1126
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:22,900
Losing teams.

1127
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,020
They look sly.

1128
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,260
They are sly.

1129
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:26,780
Yeah.

1130
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,400
Yeah.

1131
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:33,020
I understand why some people would be upset with Chief Wahoo since, you know...

1132
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:36,760
On the other hand, I can see why people might be able to take a joke, too.

1133
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,640
Seeing as how I don't look at...

1134
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,160
Every time I see a picture of Bob Dobbs, I don't go,

1135
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,880
Oh, I'm insulted.

1136
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,440
Somebody's making fun of Wasp.

1137
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,400
Male Wasp.

1138
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,680
Well, white dudes.

1139
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,700
Well, they didn't necessarily steal Bob's continent, though.

1140
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,980
They didn't necessarily come along.

1141
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,740
Well, that's true.

1142
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,040
Still 90% of the people steal everything.

1143
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,840
Well, yes and no.

1144
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,360
Yes and no.

1145
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:14,800
Not Bob's continent, but his ancestors' island of England was certainly conquered over and over again by the Danes and the Romans and the French and the Germans and just about everybody.

1146
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:14,940
It's not just about the Danes and the Romans and the French and the Germans and just about everybody.

1147
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:18,460
And they conquered everybody back, so it doesn't count.

1148
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,720
Well, everybody does that.

1149
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:25,860
Everybody gets conquered real bad, and then their time comes.

1150
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,880
Remember when Persia was the most civilized place in the world?

1151
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,500
Remember when Mongolia had the most advanced civilization?

1152
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:40,200
Remember when Spain was cooking?

1153
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,060
I'm sure there were...

1154
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,780
And the South Americans were very civilized.

1155
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:44,780


1156
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:44,780


1157
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:44,780


1158
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:44,780


1159
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:44,780


1160
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,700
America and Central America, Mexico.

1161
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:52,960
Everybody gets their turn, and then they get the smallpox or the whatever.

1162
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,560
You know, something.

1163
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,480
Somebody comes along and invades them with video.

1164
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,560
So what's going to destroy the American empire?

1165
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:06,060
Video games and movies and TV and Texas textbooks.

1166
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,940
How about indolence and stupidity?

1167
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,020
That helps, too.

1168
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,500
Yeah, but that's what we want.

1169
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,960
We're subgeniuses.

1170
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,120
Insolence and indolence and stupidity and insolence.

1171
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:20,260
But we want the same thing that the conspiracy wants.

1172
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,120
No, man.

1173
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,960
We must want something more sublime, perhaps.

1174
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,100
We want the cool version.

1175
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,480
Hey, Dave, it's about time.

1176
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,880
It's about space.

1177
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,600
It's about two men in the craziest place.

1178
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,940
I'm going to rip off this chest merkin right now

1179
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,920
and go and play my stand-up bass fiddle for a couple hours.

1180
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,480
How about you?

1181
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,660
I am going to go straight home.

1182
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,560
A cup of neocraft, perhaps a salute to the west wind,

1183
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,180
and maybe a few arguments with some stray dogs on the way home.

1184
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,260
Yeah.

1185
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:56,600
Okay.

1186
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:01,700
Well, you know, it's just an exciting life for us.

1187
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,220
Home. Home. Home.

1188
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,160
Okay, and with that, that's it.

1189
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:11,300
I'm going to cut you off, but I'll keep the little,

1190
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,460
I'll keep the little end, I'll keep that end piece, okay, Dave?

1191
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,180
What?

1192
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,520
Don't worry. It's a religious thing.

1193
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,940
Oh, I love that kind of stuff.

1194
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:20,740
And good night.

1195
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:24,740
I don't want to have to cut this artificially later to get it down to time.

1196
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,240
Bye.

1197
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:25,440
Okay.

1198
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,240
That was it. That was it, baby.

1199
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:34,620
And we've, this music in the background was Ron Slabe's Pyrosonic.

1200
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,720
And we'll take that out and we'll put on a little bit more of,

1201
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,020
uh,

1202
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:47,520
collage here, I think, uh, after this ID, there's the large and lemur,

1203
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,080
and everything will be just groovy.

1204
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,680
Everything will be just.

1205
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,680
You're normally such a slacker.

1206
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,720
It's the first time you've heard of him.

1207
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:58,440
Are all four of you guys in here?

1208
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,060
Is Phil in there?

1209
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,000
He just, yeah, yeah.

1210
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:00,400
Can we?

1211
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:00,740
Yeah.

1212
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,620
Do it with four?

1213
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,280
Yeah, all four.

1214
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:02,800
Okay.

1215
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,360
What are we doing?

1216
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,900
How do we, this is, this is.

1217
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:05,600
Oh, the other one.

1218
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,160
They'll do the comedy.

1219
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,820
How about this is Phil, Phil, Pete, and Dave of the Fireside Theater.

1220
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:10,640
This, okay.

1221
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,640
This is Phil.

1222
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,200
Phil.

1223
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,720
Let's take it again.

1224
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:14,980
Yeah.

1225
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,100
Oh, Pete and Dave.

1226
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:16,320
Okay.

1227
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:16,660
There we go.

1228
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:16,840
Yeah.

1229
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,420
All right.

1230
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:17,960
You over here.

1231
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,980
You just shut up.

1232
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,300
This is Phil.

1233
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:20,540
Phil.

1234
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:20,920
Pete.

1235
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,380
And Dave of the Fireside Theater.

1236
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,520
And we're listening to The Hour of Slack.

1237
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,040
Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.

1238
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,020
Because we're subgeniuses.

1239
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,920
And we're slackinging off.

1240
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,280
Started typing at the heart.

1241
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:34,920
And now.

1242
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,160
Started typing at the heart.

1243
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:37,980
And now.

1244
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,420
Started typing at the heart.

1245
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:40,420


1246
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:40,420


1247
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,000
And now.

1248
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,000


1249
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,000


1250
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:41,320
Now.

1251
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,880
Started typing at the, at the, at, at the heart.

1252
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:44,560
And now.

1253
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,040
Now.

1254
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,180
Now.

1255
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:46,220
Now.

1256
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:46,220


1257
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,240
Now.

1258
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,440
Now.

1259
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,140
Now.

1260
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:48,140


1261
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:48,140


1262
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:48,140


1263
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:48,140


1264
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:52,960
The stock market has been seen floating in the sky among a cloud-shaped man who's believed

1265
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,380
to be PR news in Washington.

1266
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:55,660
Hard time.

1267
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:56,740
Slime.

1268
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,780
Some genius Hour of Slack.

1269
00:57:59,400 --> 00:57:59,620
Slime.

1270
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:00,620
Slime.

1271
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,900
Slime.

1272
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,400
Slime.

1273
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,180
Slime.

1274
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:03,500
Slime.

1275
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:03,860
Slime.

1276
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,160
Slime.

1277
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:04,540
Slime.

1278
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:05,260
Slime.

1279
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:10,380
I believe you need to be an enabler of success and an exemplar of this review.

1280
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:15,620
Be an analyst, analyst, analyst, analyst, employee, customer, partner, your company, or your client objectives.

1281
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,960
If you do this, you will define your own success and get others to follow you to the organist.

1282
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,840
My first PR was at the Washington PR at the PR News.

1283
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:24,660
What?

1284
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:31,520
From PR News in Washington, I'm angry about being sworn in.

1285
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,320
Uh, um, and, uh.

1286
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,940
Pink Floyd claims this is PR.

1287
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,140
You want to inspect on you?

1288
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,540
Good, that's a wonderful thing.

1289
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:42,880
Pick a lesbian.

1290
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,840
Suffering 80 years out of her body, she's all gone!

1291
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,000
Oh, my God!

1292
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:54,880
Oh, Jesus!

1293
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,140
Lady, put down.

1294
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:56,820
Oh!

1295
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,020
Feet up!

1296
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:03,140
Well, it landed softly for coming out so hot it didn't go but about 15 feet after it landed.

1297
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,120
Thank you.

1298
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,880
There is a God.

1299
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,080
I know I'm a God.

1300
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,980
I know I'm a God.

1301
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:36,740
Give me my pen.

1302
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,820
If you say go, people of Minotaur.

1303
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:40,960
When the public in school hears a woman's name window link on the screen,

1304
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:40,960


1305
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,100
We're set on this event 오케이 askeduna.

1306
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:41,100


1307
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:41,380
Do you edited such a whimsical troublemaker?

1308
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,380


1309
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,380


1310
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,380


1311
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,760
Give me a break, will you?

1312
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:41,740
