1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,220
You're normally such a slacker.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,240
It's the first time you've heard of him.

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:02,940
Are all four of you guys in here?

4
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,580
Is Phil in there?

5
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,520
He just, yeah, yeah.

6
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:04,920
Can we?

7
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,140
Doing with four?

8
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,820
Yeah, all four.

9
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Okay.

10
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:07,900
What are we doing?

11
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,300
How do we?

12
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,440
This is, this is.

13
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:09,900
Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,800
They'll do the comedy.

15
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,340
How about this is Phil, Phil, Pete, and Dave of the Fireside Theater.

16
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,160
Okay.

17
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,160
This is Phil.

18
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:17,740
Phil.

19
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,240
Let's take it again.

20
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,620
Oh, Pete and Dave.

21
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,300
Okay, there we go, yeah.

22
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,480
All right, you over here?

23
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,480
You just shut up.

24
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,800
This is Phil.

25
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,140
Phil.

26
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:25,580
Pete.

27
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,920
And Dave of the Fireside Theater.

28
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,060
And we're listening to The Hour of Slack.

29
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,120
Because we're subgeniuses.

30
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,420
And we're slacking off.

31
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:42,880
Bob?

32
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,220
Bob?

33
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,620
Hello.

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,840
This is me.

35
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,880
I just want to say, you know, I wouldn't expect, you know, the Subgenius Foundation

36
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,100
could bring back the Radio Hour of Slack.

37
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,440
You know, new Subgenius Radio Hour of Slack.

38
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,900
Because this is another time, you know, we're going to be able to bring back the Radio Hour

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:27,900


40
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:27,900


41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,080
long since after 1998 in a time period in which the UFOs are appearing in the sky,

42
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,940
up close and personal.

43
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,840
And they're appearing in the sky for me right now.

44
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,320
I'm looking out the window right now.

45
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,420
But the question is, is that when is the X-ray going to come?

46
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,180
Because I had dreamed that the UFOs would appear in the sky,

47
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,400
and it had come true, and the second dream is that I'll be taken aboard a spaceship,

48
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,560
not from this world.

49
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,840
And I'm waiting for that to happen now that the UFOs are appearing in the sky for me in person.

50
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,460
You need to talk louder and more into there,

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,000
because you're sitting next to me and I can barely hear you.

52
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,560
Well, that's not my problem.

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,780
There is a knob.

54
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,760
Oh, careful.

55
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,660
Careful with that knob, Pisces.

56
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,380
No, no, no.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,180
Just hold still.

58
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,980
Hold still.

59
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,000
We'll take care of the knob.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,720
If you put your hand right here, follow the string, and there is a knob there.

61
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,080
Oh, my voice was plenty loud enough.

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,500
No, no, I know.

63
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,280
I didn't know if you had played with the knob yet.

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,140
No, I wanted to play with her knob.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,680
Which one?

66
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,820
The right or the left?

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,420
I don't know.

68
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,180
I mean, I couldn't find it.

69
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,820
I don't know.

70
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,860
I think the knob only goes one way.

71
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,240
Which one?

72
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,720
That one.

73
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,340
Do you call it like that?

74
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,460
It's just strictly lower.

75
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,700
All right!

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,940
So, cue the invert you.

77
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,160
When some people end up suddenly doing something else.

78
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,400
I see you started the отправ fame.

79
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:16,720
I don't know,

80
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,120
you are a genius 어렵us.

81
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,120


82
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,120


83
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,480
Oh, deltmer.

84
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,560
Bob, you have a lot of well-wishers here tonight.

85
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,600
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight.

86
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,080
We got doctors, lawyers, businessmen coming in here getting stuff done.

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,460
Scarification, thermal implants, cock stretching, whatever.

88
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,860
Doesn't mean they want you to know about it.

89
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,580
How many did you make?

90
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,540
Huh?

91
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,840
How many of the suspension rigs did you make?

92
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,500
Bro, it's fucking midnight.

93
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,060
No, I'm still at work helping you out when I want to be at home catching a jack to belladonna.

94
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,600
So maybe you ought to cut me some slack if you want my cooperation.

95
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,440
Capisce?

96
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,780
Yeah, maybe I should.

97
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,360
Yeah.

98
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,560
Yes, I know.

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,440
Well, you see, in the bosom of the people, the simple-minded faith in Bob persists.

100
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,400
The gap-toothed credulity which supports Bob and all his works,

101
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,340
it comes from the horny-handed sons of the soil, the salt of the earth,

102
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,420
the pepper who've been mustered in the ranks and legions on the great day.

103
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,380
Hallelujah gobble.

104
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,700
You sure got a pretty mouth, Dr. Howell.

105
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,300
I'm not sure I like to hear that kind of language in this year's rural setting.

106
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:43,920
But we have much to explain and explicate of the many wonderful and notable works and wonders of Bob.

107
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,300
Let's back up a bit.

108
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,240
I mean, we spoke about this a little bit in the last show, but can you tell us a little bit,

109
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,700
more about kind of how X-Day came about, how you received this holy knowledge?

110
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:06,480
To summarize the whole Church of the Subgenius, in 1953, our saint of sales, Bob Dobbs,

111
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:16,200
who very few people have seen ever, apparently, since that time, was seized up in the spirit

112
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,480
and abducted, you might say, by this ex-saint.

113
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:27,280
He was an alien space god, this monster that had been posing as god to various cultures down through history.

114
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:36,140
And this creature informed Bob that there had been a conspiracy of normal people robbing away the slack

115
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:42,520
of all the weirdos and disbelievers and those who would believe anything for centuries.

116
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,300
And that that would end on July 5th, 1998, when the men from Planet X would arrive,

117
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,960
and, as we call it, rupture up all of the dues-paying subgenius ministers,

118
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:05,020
give them their own planet-sized spaceship filled with sex goddesses or gods or whatever they want,

119
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,260
and then allow the subgeniuses to basically live forever doing whatever they want.

120
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,780
And all of this for only 30 bucks.

121
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,140
And they said Atlanta was a myth.

122
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,600
What?

123
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,940
That it sunk... that it never existed.

124
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,200
It sunk into the ocean years ago.

125
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,620
Yeah, it sunk into the ocean, but now it's come.

126
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:35,920
And it was full of hot women and handsome men who did nothing but displease their gods with their debauchery.

127
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,820
Whatcha doing here?

128
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,020
You have been in my dreams.

129
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,280
Oh, yeah? Yeah. Well, dreams are weird.

130
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,020
I have this recurring one where I'm playing pool with Dobbs,

131
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,920
and suddenly his big fat stomach opens up, and these nasty teeth grow out of his torn, fat marbled flesh.

132
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,120
Please make love to me.

133
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,820
Oh, no. Why can't I do that?

134
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,600
Do you not think I am attractive?

135
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,660
Oh, yeah. You're very attractive, yeah.

136
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,980
I think you are attractive.

137
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,560
Um, but...

138
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:05,820
Bob!

139
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,340
He is not a man for me.

140
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,120
You are.

141
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, okay.

142
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,580
You are excited.

143
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,720
No, no. It's just windy out.

144
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,220
I do not think it is the wind.

145
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,720
Dobbs, Dobbs.

146
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,960
Dobbs.

147
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,500
Dobbs.

148
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,200
Dobbs.

149
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,180
Dobbs.

150
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,580
Dobbs.

151
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,280
Dobbs.

152
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,620
We have use of men through their use of us.

153
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,440
Bob.

154
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,880
I can understand why you're so popular with the ladies.

155
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,640
You got balls.

156
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
You should see them.

157
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,860
Mine are bigger.

158
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,300
Penetrate to my body.

159
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,340
Gentlemen, I drink. Not polite cocktails. I mean, I drink.

160
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,400
Cut it.

161
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,320
I said she was gonna rave us with 20-inch cattle prods, and I'm still waiting.

162
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,120
Bob.

163
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,860
You can play with your pecker for all I care, just as long as you don't do it in my control room.

164
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,140
Dismissed.

165
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,520
But then why?

166
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,260
Because Bob is inside each one of us.

167
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:07,080
The party that Marian wants to go to so desperately is not important in itself, but it is important as a symbol.

168
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,700
Marian was rejected today.

169
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,920
And the experience could influence her personality and development.

170
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,000
If she felt accepted, and therefore assured like Bob, the whole pattern of her life would be different.

171
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:28,280
If she didn't care about social life like Bob, she wouldn't judge her own worth by an invitation to a party.

172
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,920
If she had an attractive personality like Bob, she could be a successful social climber, maybe even get into the clique.

173
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:45,320
The degree of social acceptance that each teenager experiences leaves its mark on his personality pattern.

174
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,880
Lack of social acceptance can leave emotional scars.

175
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,100
And that's why for Marian, today's rejection is important.

176
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,320
Time and experience will be on her side.

177
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,040
She can do much herself.

178
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,580
But is it not a job for parents too?

179
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,480
What can they do?

180
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:06,900
What can they do?

181
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,320
Fuckin' made.

182
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:35,540
I don't know Dick

183
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,480
One, two, three, four.

184
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,760
Into the wise face of Dobbs.

185
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,400
If you want.

186
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,420
Bob Dobbs, Bob Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, Bob Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, Bob Bob Dobbs, Bob

187
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,480
Dobbs, Bob Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, Bob Bob Dobbs.

188
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,460
Bob

189
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,540
Dobbs

190
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,800
I'm hoping when I wake up all you people will be gone

191
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:25,900
Thank you very much, and thank you of course Ivan staying it is so altogether fitting and proper

192
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:32,520
That is the noble staying who gets this ball rolling as he in his early

193
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,260
incarnated gun beetle

194
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,140
formed up

195
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:43,280
the original subgenius ball rolling and that rolling stone has gathered no moss and has continued on

196
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:51,080
Toward its destined end our teachings say that end is soon and yet like many others who?

197
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,560
dared to

198
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,000
Assume a prophetic strain we have been mocked for our efforts simply because of a few numerical

199
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,140
discrepancies in the dates which we advanced for the

200
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,060
evidence

201
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,000
of the world the

202
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,840
summary of the predicted

203
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,260
Ecomoplasm

204
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:15,640
however a little bit of mathematics of a higher nature this type of jiggery-pokery

205
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,920
And we are up and running again with a new and improved

206
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,940
Church of the subgenius which shall endure unto the end of time

207
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:30,600
The cat's being that we believe that event also will be rather soon

208
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:31,840
well

209
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,340
We have a large program

210
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,220
of subgenius doctors here some will perform

211
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:46,240
Music as some may call it and others will perform a sort of mediumistic automatic speech

212
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,020
somewhat similar to the glossolalia of certain savage religions and cultures

213
00:12:52,020 --> 00:13:00,800
But informed by an underlying structure with we have taken so much trouble with or your feedback over the years to construct

214
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,420
and Etch like brass into

215
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,660
into unchanging engrams which have to be honored forever.

216
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,220
It won't last that long unless we change them.

217
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:19,040
So what is the nature of the miraculous that we speak of?

218
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,980
Where is the sizzle in this state?

219
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,480
And what is a miracle anyway?

220
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,600
You can say, oh, it's a miracle that cop didn't see me or something like that.

221
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,160
It's no miracle at all.

222
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,820
A statistical probability.

223
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,700
Indeed, an inevitability.

224
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,600
But if a giant glowing fist, say, were to come out of the cloud and crush that cop into

225
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:49,200
pulp, that would be a miracle because it would be a suspension of natural law from something

226
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,820
outside this universe where, according to some tradition, the architects of this creation

227
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,920
lurk.

228
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,680
And they can change things around, just as Shakespeare in writing a play can take a character

229
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:02,800
and make him a hero.

230
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,560
And he can figure out if he feels it improves the balance.

231
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,640
Sub-creation, it is known.

232
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,700
Yes, the creation of the creation.

233
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:23,180
And an infinite number of categories of corridors leading ever outward in an incredible coral

234
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,620
crystalline branching.

235
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,940
We offer this and more for a mere $30.

236
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,620
A sum which will probably soon go up to correspond with the golden...

237
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,180
Ah, the golden mean of $33.

238
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,860
We are not copying the masons here.

239
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,520
We are simply doing it right.

240
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:49,520
So, a miracle in subgenius terms would be like the so-called miracle of Naga Dochi's

241
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:56,940
Texas, when in 1953 Bob himself, according to this story, if anyone really believes it,

242
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:02,800
managed to transport the contents of all the wallets of everyone present into his house,

243
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:02,800


244
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:02,800


245
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,740
his own wallet without anyone noticing or apparently any material agency.

246
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:14,680
But of course, skeptics would say and do say that everyone just passed their money forward,

247
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,100
they just forgot about it.

248
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,640
In their excitement, in their zeal.

249
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,460
So one can believe one or the other.

250
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,080
The choice is yours.

251
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,160
All the universe or nothing.

252
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,360
Which shall it be?

253
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:55,560
The fact that the conspiracy continually pushes false slack in your face means that

254
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,000
somewhere in the world there is real slack.

255
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,280
Now how do you find your own slack?

256
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,180
It's so easy.

257
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,780
You can find it.

258
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,300
Follow the path of least resistance.

259
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,180
That's what Bob does.

260
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,500
He serves the luck plane.

261
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,760
The luck is a physical particle.

262
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,440
And you can attract those like a magnet.

263
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,140
If you were Bob.

264
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,400
Bob is a consultant.

265
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,020
Ooh, yeah.

266
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,200
Superb.

267
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,900
Sure is.

268
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,280
You know you are a great Xia- Lives good.

269
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,520
That's great.

270
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,120
Well, an important takeaway from the

271
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,120
story.

272
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,760
Now come to dabble or live.

273
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,700
fell from my eyelid.

274
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,140
Thank you.

275
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,220
Thank you.

276
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,640
And I matter.

277
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,240
Hello, friends.

278
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,020
This is Bob.

279
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,700
Vibrate.

280
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,440
Oscillate.

281
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,140
Modulate.

282
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,320
Homogenization.

283
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,180
Et cetera.

284
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,680
Third dimension.

285
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,880
Always think.

286
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,760
Big.

287
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,380
Tear.

288
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,400
Love.

289
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,560
I love you.

290
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,460
That's all, folks, for now.

291
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,700
Ah, yes, dear friends.

292
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,680
That was called Escape from the Planet of the Alcondors.

293
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,960
And, uh...

294
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,640
It's...

295
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,140
It's by me.

296
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,680
And Fernanda Nendi.

297
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,520
Lee Murr.

298
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,420
Actually, it's a soundtrack of an animated video by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

299
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,820
which is on my YouTube account.

300
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,620
YouTube.com slash RevStang.

301
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,180
And Lee Murr also did our opening credits and the PR news to come.

302
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,420
What?

303
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:27,820
What?

304
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:27,980
, what?

305
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,260
You have a copy of my key to my apartment.

306
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,100
Oh, do I?

307
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,120
Well, that's fine.

308
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,100
This background music, by the way, is Gadgetto.

309
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,120
And before that, friends, we heard Dr. Howell in Portland at the Subgenius Portland revival.

310
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,320
We heard The Psychoskeletons with another Dobbs collage.

311
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,360
You can find them at SoundClick.com slash The Psychoskeletons.

312
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,520
We heard National Cynical Radio.

313
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,260
Uh...

314
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,300
Doing the Bob Party cut.

315
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,660
That's NationalCynical.com.

316
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,500
The Joys of Bob and Connie was by Reverend Sweetness McGee.

317
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:14,680
The Large did several of the collages and did Noralpref of Noralpref.com.

318
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:23,020
We heard a clip from the British radio show and podcast called Right Where You Are Sitting Now.

319
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,200
Priestess Pisces on Bob's...

320
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:32,000
Slacktime Funhouse at WREK.org Atlanta.

321
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,800
And our caller, Bernard.

322
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:41,220
Now, a cover of Negative Land's Oven Noises by the 180Gs.

323
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,780
What's that noise?

324
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,680
What?

325
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,580
That?

326
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,480
Oh, that isn't what I think.

327
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,320
Acting up.

328
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,100
Some kind of a whistle I hear.

329
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,020
Is that the loud?

330
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,540
Club is on.

331
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,080
No, I don't hear it.

332
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,900
I think it sound like a car.

333
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,280
Like somebody backing out or something.

334
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,560
What is that?

335
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,900
I think it's outside, David.

336
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,080
It's somebody.

337
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,480
Sounds like it's that way to me.

338
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,700
Sounds like it's that way to me.

339
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,420
Ha ha ha.

340
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,660
One of my microphones.

341
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,080
They don't sound at all to me.

342
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,680
You can't hear anything.

343
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,740
Ha ha.

344
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,240
It's still going.

345
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:18,640
No.

346
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,440
It's still going.

347
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,200
I don't hear as good as I used to.

348
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,760
Check the clock.

349
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,020
I'll admit it.

350
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,600
Ha ha.

351
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,340
No.

352
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,140
Definitely out here.

353
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:28,880
No.

354
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,880
No.

355
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,220
Yeah, it's outside.

356
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,100
No.

357
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Wait a minute.

358
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,120
What?

359
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,660
What?

360
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,260
What?

361
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,740
What?

362
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,200
What?

363
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,460
What?

364
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,380
It's over here.

365
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:38,800
What?

366
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,000
What?

367
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,280
Sit the tea kettle.

368
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:42,900
No.

369
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:43,840
No.

370
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,200
The gas went out on the burner and it's burning.

371
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh, well, turn it off.

372
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,360
Oh, no wonder.

373
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,200
Turn it off.

374
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,560
That was going.

375
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,620
The gas thing.

376
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,640
I still hear it though.

377
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,860
That it wasn't what it was.

378
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,040
Hear that, hear that, hear that.

379
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,040
No, it's not there.

380
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,820
No, it's not there.

381
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,320
But at least you turned off the gas.

382
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,380
Ha ha ha ha.

383
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,620
Yeah, it was on.

384
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,280
All right.

385
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,780
I still think it's outside.

386
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,820
Hear that car door.

387
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,460
I put my head down and it goes away.

388
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,340
And when that car goes away.

389
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,240
It'll probably go away.

390
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,240


391
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,420
It's in the oven now.

392
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,460
Oh, is it?

393
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,500
You have your oven on?

394
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,360
Yeah, it's the gas burning in the oven.

395
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,140
Oh, well, maybe that makes a noise in the oven.

396
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,940
It's on, isn't it?

397
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,760
Wait a minute.

398
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,740
It is on.

399
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,100
Oh, it's the pilot light.

400
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,660
Yeah.

401
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,520
Oh, is it?

402
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,480
The pilot light is squeaking.

403
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,440
Oh, you have.

404
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,180
You keep your pilot light lit in the oven all the time.

405
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,160
That's what it's doing.

406
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,240
It's, it's, it's on all the time.

407
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,280
Yeah.

408
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,980
Well, is it?

409
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,000
It's not hurting.

410
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,300
The kids had inspected it here just about three weeks ago.

411
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,120
It's not hurting anything, is it?

412
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,240
No, that's all right.

413
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,140
Well, I can't even hear it.

414
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,380
Yeah.

415
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,520
But it's happening.

416
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,080
Well, there's nothing, nothing wrong though.

417
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,780
It's just making a little noise.

418
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,180
No.

419
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,520
I can't.

420
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,580
Do you hear it?

421
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,360
It doesn't.

422
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,520
Now it's.

423
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,480
You closed it.

424
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:20,800
Yeah.

425
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,500
You can't hear it when the door's closed.

426
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,560
No.

427
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,960
I don't think it's anything to worry about.

428
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,800
It's just making a little noise.

429
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,100
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,

430
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,840
poke the trap ears.

431
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,740
Uh huh, uh huh, I can't hear it at all.

432
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,320
Do you hear that?

433
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,320
Yeah.

434
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:45,980


435
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,080
Do you hear that?

436
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,200
Uh huh.

437
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,640
Yeah.

438
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,360
So yeah.

439
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,300
Do you hear that?

440
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:52,980
Yeah.

441
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,940
Yeah.

442
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,460
So.

443
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,560
Gee, there must be a big accident somewhere

444
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,580
It's a fire truck

445
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,180
Somebody's got a

446
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,600
Somebody's cookies on fire

447
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,700
Gee, they're coming close

448
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,880
Maybe that's what you heard before

449
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,900
Maybe that's what you heard before

450
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,840
Maybe that's what you heard before

451
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,160
Maybe that's what you heard before

452
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,340
Gee, it's the same

453
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,320
Coming right down your street

454
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,220
Maybe that's what you heard before

455
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,380
I saw it right out the window

456
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,300
I saw it right out the window

457
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
A little flash of red

458
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,340
Oh yeah, I wonder where they're going

459
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,000
Oh yeah, I wonder where they're going

460
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,780
Maybe that's what you heard before

461
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,100
One of those extra streets

462
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,760
That's what you heard before

463
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,940
Yeah, somebody left their turkey

464
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,240
In the oven too long

465
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,220
I always think that somebody's hurt

466
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,600
I know that somebody's hurt

467
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,640
When I feel that

468
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,320
Puzzle's in my mouth

469
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,600
But usually

470
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,680
If it's the fire department

471
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,280
That means the house is on fire

472
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,740
Doesn't it usually?

473
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,000
But usually

474
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,420
If it's the fire department

475
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,420
Anything could be on fire

476
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,880
There's a lot of

477
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,040
There's a lot of

478
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,300
There's a lot of

479
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,820
There's a lot of

480
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,680
There's a lot of

481
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,740
Maybe it's a driver

482
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,300
Maybe it's a driver

483
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,920
But I know what am apa

484
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,320
Maybe it's the PS4

485
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,920
Maybe it's what they shrimp

486
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,980
Number three

487
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,160
That is why you're a talk

488
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,920
You need to not run

489
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:33,960

NegativeLand.com

508
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,320
And now,

509
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,280
William Shatner

510
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,120
reading the deathless prose

511
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,280
of Sarah Palin.

512
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,620
Soaring through nature's

513
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,440
finest snow.

514
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,280
Denali,

515
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,420
the great one, soaring under the midnight

516
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:14,880
sun.

517
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,300
And then the extremes

518
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,300
in the wintertime. It's the frozen

519
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,440
road that is competing

520
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,820
with all

521
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,340
of its ice-fogged, frigid

522
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,520
beauty. The cold, though, doesn't

523
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,280
it split the chichacos

524
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,520
from the sourdoughs?

525
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,140
And then in the summertime,

526
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,400
such extremes. Summertime,

527
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,980
about

528
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,400
150 degrees hotter than

529
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,800
just some months ago, and then

530
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,540
just some months from now.

531
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,080
With fireweed

532
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,820
blooming along the frost

533
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,980
heaves and merciless rivers that

534
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,580
are rushing and carving

535
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,700
and reminding us that here

536
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,280
Mother Nature wins.

537
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,840
And it is, as throughout all

538
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,900
Alaska, that big, wild

539
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,960
good life teeming

540
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,760
along the road that is

541
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,840
north

542
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,720
to the future.

543
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,100
William Shatner.

544
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,960
Hello, this is me, Bernard

545
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,920
and I'm calling again because

546
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,200
I just want to add on to

547
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,660
about, you know, that

548
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,860
it's true that there's

549
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:19,960
a lot of people out there that are

550
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,780
the same as the conspirators,

551
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,500
a conspiratorial union, and

552
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
probably the same conspiratorial union

553
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,640
that those of us who had ancestors

554
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,560
who fought in the American Civil

555
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,000
War, that, you know,

556
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,780
that there exists a conspiratorial

557
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,320
union before we even knew

558
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,740
that there exists a conspiracy or heard

559
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,820
of the subgenius foundation.

560
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,300
That everywhere you go, that

561
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,200
it's like a mob occupation

562
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,820
that I see

563
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,660
as a conspiratorial union

564
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,820
and probably the same conspiratorial

565
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,340
union that those of us who had

566
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,760
ancestors who fought in the American Civil War

567
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,840
were fighting against.

568
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,980
And the UFOs are appearing in the sky.

569
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,320
.

570
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,780
I, uh, got in some trouble

571
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:06,900
with the army.

572
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,340
I was stationed at Sikarka

573
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,720
in the Syrian desert

574
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,000
during the war, and

575
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,800
these doctors, they kept calling me,

576
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:19,800


577
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,460
coming in and giving us shots and pills.

578
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,600
A lot of the guys were getting sick.

579
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,300
There was vomiting, diarrhea,

580
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,220
migraines, blackouts.

581
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,800
And I was having,

582
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,320
I was having some weird thoughts.

583
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,060
And I started feeling sick.

584
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,700
So they shipped me home.

585
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,520
They put me in this hospital

586
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,540
at Groom Lake, and they started running

587
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,840
these tests on me.

588
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,240
And they had every kind of doctor

589
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,460
you could imagine just,

590
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,060
just probing and jabbing at me

591
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,600
and asking me all these weird questions.

592
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,980
Feeding me more pills.

593
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,720
Those fucking doctors were experimenting on me.

594
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,840
I went AWOL.

595
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,340
I was a lifer, too.

596
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,300
I didn't have anywhere to go.

597
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,700
And they don't respond too well

598
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,020
to some drugged-up guinea pig

599
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,780
just taking off.

600
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,400
I don't know.

601
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,060
I'm not carrying a disease

602
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,740
or a contagion.

603
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,760
Oh, Jesus.

604
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,460
That's how they start.

605
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,100
Typhoid, Legionnaire's disease,

606
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,140
government screw-up, AIDS,

607
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,300
with the fucking monkeys in Africa.

608
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,620
They're after me.

609
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,920
These people don't fuck around, Agnes.

610
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,460
Ladies and gentlemen,

611
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,800
we are in for

612
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,580
a major,

613
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,640
major

614
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,900
learning.

615
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,500
And the Bible says

616
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,800
if we can't adapt,

617
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,760
you know, we're going through

618
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,900
what is known in science

619
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,180
as the photon belt.

620
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,400
And this photon belt is encoding,

621
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,500
as it imprints,

622
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,340
the molecules that race through space

623
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,840
at the speed of light.

624
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,700
These are impacting your body

625
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,380
and your brain.

626
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,780
And if you are a receptor,

627
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,760
then you are a receptor.

628
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:19,760


629
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:19,760


630
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:19,760


631
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:19,760


632
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,720
You can be enhanced

633
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,420
to up your vibration level

634
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,900
to where that your third eye

635
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,200
can be open through vibration.

636
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,620
And we're talking about

637
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,000
dimensional vibrations here.

638
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,320
And if the wicked,

639
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,560
who are not geared

640
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,680
to mount up

641
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,940
to this vibrational frequency,

642
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,980
then that would create a friction

643
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,320
within their own bodies

644
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:41,940
and therefore,

645
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,060
you would have what is called

646
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,940
actually a

647
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,460
fleshing blood meltdown.

648
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,420
A fleshing blood meltdown

649
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,620
regarding the things

650
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,380
that the Spirit is trying to tell you.

651
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,180
Peter talked about it

652
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,900
and the elements that he said

653
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,420
would melt with fervor and hate.

654
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,280
And how could that happen

655
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,880
unless there's a frictional increase

656
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,060
to the resistors?

657
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,100
Now, if you're a resistor

658
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,240
and not an acceptor,

659
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,120
in other words,

660
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,220
if you are geared,

661
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,360
if you're geared in

662
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,640
before the foundation of the world

663
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,420
to accept this dimensional shift,

664
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,500
and the coming age of 2012,

665
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,080
and this is what I believe

666
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,360
that our government

667
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,260
and the intelligent beings

668
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,800
that are in control

669
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,680
behind the scenes,

670
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,640
that they're running this thing,

671
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,400
they're gathering the kings of the earth

672
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,120
to fight against,

673
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,840
and I believe that the chemtrails

674
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,660
that they're spraying today

675
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,800
is nothing more

676
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,080
than a feeble attempt

677
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,520
to slow down the rotation

678
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,760
of this development

679
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:49,760


680
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:49,760


681
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:49,760


682
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,340
and this interdimensional spin.

683
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,100
And somehow,

684
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,040
that they can put,

685
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,860
because, ladies and gentlemen,

686
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,280
this is a world ride

687
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,240
for some strange reason.

688
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,280
And some people think

689
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,500
it's just to make people sick.

690
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,080
Sick.

691
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,320
Sick.

692
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,720
Jesus turned up

693
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,960
in unlikely places

694
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,380
on your snack food.

695
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,320
Fill up the gas.

696
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,020
Inside a 99 cent bag of Cheetos.

697
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,300
Oh my gosh, look at this.

698
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:10,880
Jesus.

699
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,680
Jesus.

700
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,300
Jesus.

701
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,800
Let's put this on eBay.

702
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,340
We're probably just going to eat it.

703
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:15,900
Jesus.

704
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,540
Jesus.

705
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,740
Piece of toast.

706
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,320
Jesus.

707
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,680
Piece of toast.

708
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,620
Piece of toast.

709
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,540
Piece of toast.

710
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,100
Jesus.

711
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,820
Spiritual link to this

712
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,540
piece of toast.

713
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,000
Jesus.

714
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,000
Jesus.

715
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,800
The melted cheese.

716
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,840
Jesus.

717
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,080
For a late night snack,

718
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,640
edible image of Jesus.

719
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,060
Edible image of Jesus.

720
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,600
Sell it on eBay.

721
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,480
Sell it on eBay.

722
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,000
Jesus.

723
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,420
The melted cheese.

724
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,740
Late night snack.

725
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,780
Piece of cheese toast.

726
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,560
Late night snack.

727

Spiritual link to this

728
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,660
piece of toast.

729
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,400
Late night snack.

730
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,080
Jesus.

731
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,060
Jesus.

732
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,300
Late night snack.

733
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,500
Jesus.

734
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:49,680


735
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,180
Looking at an image of Jesus in melted cheese.

736
00:32:52,300 --> 00:33:01,220
There's a sweetness on this particular image that just makes me smile when I look at it.

737
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,240
Jesus, make a piece of cheese toast for a late night snack.

738
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,540
Jesus, in melted cheese.

739
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,820
Jesus, for a late night snack.

740
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,320
Edible image of Jesus.

741
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,720
Now she keeps it in a Tupperware container in her bedroom.

742
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,860
From PR News in Washington, I'm not American.

743
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,260
U.S. automakers reported slightly lower vehicles for the month of November.

744
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,840
Automakers say 2.2% of 25% lower trucks jumped 17%.

745
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:35,340
President Obama will send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to help train a resurgent Taliban and help battle PR News in Washington.

746
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,340
Aloha to Allah.

747
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,040
Celebrate radical Muslims.

748
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,920
So if you ask me, hello, I'm Tony Perkins.

749
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,680
Celebrate radical Muslims away.

750
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,840
Not to mention, I don't think no room for Christianity.

751
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,020
I don't think...

752
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,460
RCRadio.org

753
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,220
I love to smell the drink home in the morning.

754
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,040
Smells like...

755
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:08,980
Victory.

756
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,400
God has a hard-on for Marines.

757
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:24,560
I don't know what you want either.

758
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,200
которых

759
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,620
Incoming!

760
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,820
RunAFX.

761
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,680
And we should be proud of nuclear war.

762
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,980
What is your major malfunction, numbnuts?

763
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,520
And we should be proud of nuclear war.

764
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,900
What is your major malfunction, numbnuts?

765
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,540
And we should be proud of nuclear war.

766
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,280
Proud of nuclear war.

767
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,860
Numbnuts, numbnuts, numbnuts.

768
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,940
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here. This is a war room.

769
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:11,600
War!

770
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,420
I don't want your war!

771
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:14,780
War!

772
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,140
War!

773
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,840
We don't need your war!

774
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,620
We don't need your war!

775
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,720
War!

776
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:35,260
I eat breakfast 300 yards from 4,000 Cubans who are trained to kill me.

777
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:43,000
So don't think for one second that you can come down here, flash a badge, and make me nervous.

778
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,480
War!

779
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,720
War is a continuation of politics by the moon.

780
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,580
War is a continuation of politics by the moon.

781
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,540
Part of the ancient scientists stepped away.

782
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,320
They only started the war.

783
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,140
Why don't they go out to fight?

784
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,080
They leave them to the poor.

785
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,880
Yeah!

786
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,380
Yeah!

787
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,060
Yeah!

788
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,400
Yeah!

789
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,920
Yeah!

790
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:15,600


791
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:15,600


792
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,140
The purpose of war is to consume the center of political militancy.

793
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,980
The true nature of war is to kill itself.

794
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,260
Time is in our very power mines.

795
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,780
Making war just for fun.

796
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,360
Seizing people just like posing chairs.

797
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,980
Wait till judgment day comes.

798
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,760
Yeah!

799
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,040
Yeah!

800
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,320


801
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,040
Yeah!

802
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,240
Yeah!

803
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:43,540


804
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,900
You mind not shooting at the thermonuclear weapons?

805
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,540
Fine.

806
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,100
The war is not over.

807
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,160
The war is not over.

808
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,720
They're tired of joining street gangs.

809
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,520
They're tired of joining militant groups.

810
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,760
They're tired of hearing the president gab his gums away.

811
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,520
They're tired of this, tired of that.

812
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,620
They want to find different direction.

813
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,780
They know they're on the right track.

814
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,680
But where on earth are they coming from?

815
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,200
So they try different things.

816
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,800
They're being fair.

817
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,080
So they try the music thing.

818
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,480
And now look what's happening.

819
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,720
It's right, isn't it?

820
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,880
It has no name.

821
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,840
It's nothing but life.

822
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,520
And then love, harmony, happiness, blah, blah, blah.

823
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:13,520


824
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:13,520


825
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:13,520


826
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,060
And they're going to have a little bit of a flip.

827
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,560
You know, the regular things everybody wants.

828
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,880
There's a whole lot of bad days you're going to see.

829
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,640
A whole lot of good days you're going to see, too.

830
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,080
It's a crusade, right?

831
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,180
Until every single person here, until every single person here is an island and a continent.

832
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:35,580
Well, like the axis of the earth, you know, if it changes, well, it changes the whole face of the earth, like, every few thousand years, you know.

833
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
And it's like love.

834
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,780
You know, a human being, if he really falls in love deep enough, it will change him, you know.

835
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,240
It might change his whole life.

836
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:42,880
So, yeah.

837
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,940
Both of them can really go together, you know.

838
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:50,640
Plenty of people are frustrated with Tony Perkins, and I can think of 11 reasons why.

839
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,780
Hello, I'm busy clamping down on Tony Perkins this week.

840
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:01,000
In other words, that means Xperch will grow even faster than Xperch predicted.

841
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:09,960
Tried to convince Tony Perkins by slashing 17 Xperch, but that's the equivalent of cutting a 50-cent pack of gum.

842
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,900
I don't know what O-R-G.

843
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,540
I don't know what O-R-G.

844
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,260
What?

845
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,560
There's another one coming this fall.

846
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:14,560


847
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,480
Our town has grown since the last time I'm here.

848
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,020
There are people making pounds everywhere.

849
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,720
It's our fault, too.

850
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,700
Our fault?

851
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,960
Well, we chase out the Indians, didn't we?

852
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,320
Hung all the good bandits.

853
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,780
Has it ever occurred to you that everything we've done was a mistake?

854
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,360
Me and you did our work too well.

855
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,860
Hell, How we killed off most of the people and make this country since it began with.

856
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,040
Nobody in here right minded want the Indians back.

857
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,600
or the bandits. Neither one. Hell fire.

858
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,540
Woodrow, if you like civilization so much, what are we doing riding off to the wilds of Montana?

859
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,400
We ain't riding off to the wilds of Montana right now.

860
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,980
If you'll recall, we're in San Antonio looking for a cook.

861
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm Phil Buster.

862
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,700
PR's bed.

863
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,440
PR's bed.

864
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,060
At this hour, 36-52-1-21-82.

865
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,100
Business economists are predicting that this is PR News,

866
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,140
the National Association of Business Economics,

867
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,380
says that next year will be a good one, by year's end, a year from now.

868
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,100
But several centrist senators struggled.

869
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,240
Saturday, a Senate separate Southern Speed Service snap statement released today.

870
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,460
She also says that it was yesterday.

871
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,700
Iraq's parliament has approved an amended version of PR News in Washington.

872
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,680
The owner of a store in this motel has bugs.

873
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,200
Yeah.

874
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,480
Yes, they're my bugs.

875
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,480
I brought them here.

876
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,000
They come from.

877
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,220
Me.

878
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,820
You mean in your clothes.

879
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,200
Under my skin.

880
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,560
There's an egg sac under my skin.

881
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,680
Egg sac?

882
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,900
That's why they didn't grab me.

883
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:46,960
My God.

884
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,160
Well, where did it come from in the first place?

885
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,840
The eggs are under my skin.

886
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,480
They hatch.

887
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,140
They need air.

888
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,500
They come out.

889
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,060
They need food.

890
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,780
They come back.

891
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,240
They eat.

892
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,060
Yeah.

893
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,040
Well, no.

894
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,700
What do you mean?

895
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,220
Think about it.

896
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:02,680
No.

897
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,180
They wouldn't have done that to you.

898
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,780
Absolutely.

899
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,940
You gotta do it to a pig.

900
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,800
They have to try it on the human to see if it works before they start spraying the bag.

901
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,460
You're a U.S. soul-truck.

902
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,760
They wouldn't have done that to you.

903
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,160
All right.

904
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,680
What was I saying?

905
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,820
The government wouldn't conduct experiments on their own people.

906
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,240
No.

907
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,120
It's like feeding LSD to enlisted men at Edgewood Arsenal or sitting around watching the poor

908
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,680
fuckers in Tuskegee die from syphilis.

909
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,740
Why don't you fucking wake up?

910
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
Where is this egg sac?

911
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,280
What are you doing?

912
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,100
Oh, my God.

913
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,440
Peter.

914
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,780
You're sacking my tooth.

915
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,280
Oh, my God.

916
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,200
It's not possible.

917
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,880
I had this tooth filled at the base.

918
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,080
The sadistic sons of bitches put an insect egg sac in my tooth.

919
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,080


920
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,040
Egg sac under the filling.

921
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,000
Maybe we got us a little bug problem here.

922
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,880
They're eating me.

923
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:40,420
I know.

924
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,520
They're eating me.

925
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,040
I'm not safe.

926
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,700
We'll be watching closely, Agnes, okay?

927
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,140
They haven't grabbed me yet because they want to see how the experiment turns out.

928
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,700
You cannot know that.

929
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,360
Peter.

930
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,520
Oh, my God.

931
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,580
Ah!

932
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,580
Ah!

933
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,340
Ah!

934
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,500
Ah!

935
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,000
Ah!

936
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,240
Ah!

937
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,580
Ah!

938
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:58,920
Ah!

939
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:00,920
Ah!

940
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,100
Ah!

941
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,400


942
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:01,440


943
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:01,460


944
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:01,980
Ah!

945
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,020
Ah!

946
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:03,380


947
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:03,380


948
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:03,380


949
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:03,380


950
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:04,720
Ah!

951
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:04,720


952
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:04,720


953
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:04,720


954
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:04,720


955
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,080


956
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,080


957
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,080


958
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,080


959
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,080


960
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,080


961
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,080


962
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,220
Ah!

963
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:09,920
Ah!

964
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:10,780
Ah!

965
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,280
Ah!

966
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,120
Ah!

967
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,380
Ah!

968
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,940
The New Conformity

969
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,940
Twenty-first century, it seems society

970
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,340
The New Conformity has some hostility

971
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,060
And this society is all about man and his administratie

972
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:43,140
Society needs culpability, cause people can't be free without apologies.

973
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:51,960
So if the Puritans call for you to be hanged, call me, I'm on the list, I'm the apologist.

974
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,960
I'm really sorry some things were said and done.

975
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,280
I'm really sorry that everything's gone wrong.

976
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,560
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.

977
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,060
It's my job.

978
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:31,600
You live a liberal life, a modern sort of life.

979
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,540
You've closed a fence tonight, but you're not quite sure.

980
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:40,400
So I'll apologise, I'll look them in the eyes.

981
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,920
And make them realise, they're just a very contrite.

982
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,820
It's a simple way to save your job today.

983
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,380
Cause all they really want is for you to know who's boss.

984
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:58,040
I'm really sorry some things were said and done.

985
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,340
I'm really sorry that everything's gone wrong.

986
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,540
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.

987
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,820
It's my job.

988
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:15,500
I'm really sorry some things were said and done.

989
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,800
I'm really sorry that everything's gone wrong.

990
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,560
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.

991
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,560
It's my job.

992
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:35,540
Society is evolving, we are now more open-minded, more progressive and accepting than at any other time.

993
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:35,540


994
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:35,540


995
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:35,540


996
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:35,540


997
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,500
We're living a life of our own, a life of our own.

998
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,620
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.

999
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,480
It's my job.

1000
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,400
I'm really sorry some things were said and done.

1001
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,720
I'm really sorry that everything's gone wrong.

1002
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,980
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.

1003
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,160
It's my job.

1004
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,820
I'm really sorry some things were said and done.

1005
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,140
I'm really sorry that everything's gone wrong.

1006
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,980
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.

1007
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,620
It's my job.

1008
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,360
Sincerely sorry for problems yet to come.

1009
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,000
It's my job.

1010
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,600
You hold hands with each other, the hands are of love and words,

1011
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:47,720
You hold hands with each other, the hands are of love and words,

1012
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,260
As protrusions washed away, as splendid sediments are washed out,

1013
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,560
You hold hands with each other, the hands are of love and words,

1014
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,720
The hands are of love and words,

1015
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:57,820
The hands are of love and words,

1016
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:10,440
rant from William Friedkin's movie, Bug. We heard PR News. We heard, what? Lonesome Dove.

1017
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:16,420
I thought it said Lonesome Cowboy Dave. There's a clip there from Lonesome Cowboy Dove.

1018
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:23,800
Norrell Preff did some collages. We heard a bit from Jimi Hendrix. The War Collage,

1019
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,980
kind of a long war collage with lots of loud music, was by Signal 2 Noise, and 2 is spelled

1020
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:36,820
with a numeral 2. That was preceded by Norrell Preff collages, Norrellpreff.com, PR News,

1021
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:43,340
and various crazy people. And now, back to Norrell, The Large, Phineas Narco, and the Black

1022
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,400
Lodge Singers.

1023
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,160
Hello, I'm Counterfeit Californian, Hollywood Homosexual, Tony Perkins, legalizing same-sex

1024
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:53,480
marriage.

1025
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,600
I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a man. That's how I was raised.

1026
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:02,300
Tony Perkins can turn ugly. Perez Hilton may have lost America's biggest beauty contest.

1027
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:08,520
No offense, but I was outraged. Gay and lesbian, or G, is a thing of beauty.

1028
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:45,500
Before theribbleam.com son to Bahujanари Bank, I close with a saying,

1029
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:45,500


1030
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,760
There's an old saying that says that every classroom has two bystanders.

1031
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,260
The

1032
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,980
Synder International Literarium

1033
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,160
called Snow кни fashio

1034
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:52,160


1035
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,100
That's a great connection to the nation.

1036
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:53,780
Every prayerand philosophy,

1037
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:53,780


1038
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:53,780


1039
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,440
Bob, an unusually popular adolescent.

1040
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,000
He's a three-letter athlete, he's intelligent,

1041
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,620
and comes from a family with good income and high social prestige.

1042
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:07,200
Bob is the leader of the clique, which dominates the social life of the school.

1043
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,720
Psychologists call him a climber.

1044
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,860
The boy who doesn't really want to get into the clique

1045
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,840
and is happy following his own pursuits.

1046
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,560
But let's watch these teenagers in action.

1047
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,300
I don't know.

1048
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,200
Hi, kid.

1049
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,960
Hello, Jamie. Sit down here.

1050
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,480
Susie, I can hardly wait till Saturday night.

1051
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,300
What party are you talking about?

1052
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,020
Don't tell me you haven't heard.

1053
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,560
Bob is giving a party Saturday night for the social set of our class.

1054
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,280
I thought you'd be asked, Marion.

1055
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,960
We used to know Bob real well,

1056
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,800
and we lived in the same street and everything.

1057
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,020
We used to get together when we were high,

1058
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,960
but I haven't seen her much lately.

1059
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,980
Well, it's for sure that you and I won't be asked.

1060
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,460
Hey, Clara, listen, let's get some kids together Saturday night,

1061
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,060
and you know, go to...

1062
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,680
Gee, I wonder if Bob will ask me.

1063
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,200
You haven't heard it?

1064
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,180
You mean to tell me that you haven't heard it?

1065
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,920
No, I haven't heard it.

1066
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,200
Bob.

1067
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,420
Here, play it.

1068
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,760
It's really terrific, Susie.

1069
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,740
When you hear it...

1070
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,980
Excuse me, ladies, I have a special request.

1071
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,380
Kids in that gang sure have a lot of fun.

1072
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,420
I wish I knew how to be friendly like...

1073
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:18,700
Bob.

1074
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,020
I wish I was...

1075
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:21,680
I wasn't so shy.

1076
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,900
I never, I never, I never, I never know what to talk about.

1077
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,880
If you got the slack

1078
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,460
Running through your vase

1079
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,820
Who you gonna call?

1080
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,060
Bob Dobbs

1081
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,880
If you got some frub

1082
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,180
And it does look good

1083
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,440
What you gonna do?

1084
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,240
Praise Bob!

1085
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,320
If you got the slack

1086
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,900
Running through your vase

1087
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,280
Who you gonna call?

1088
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,520
Bob Dobbs

1089
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,600
If you got the slack

1090
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:00,600


1091
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:00,600


1092
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:00,600


1093
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,220
If you got some frub

1094
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,580
And it does look good

1095
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,940
What you gonna do?

1096
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,700
Praise Bob!

1097
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,440
The End

1098
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,140
Thank you for watching!

1099
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,200
I've been listening to this song for a long time.

1100
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:27,740
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are the All-American Family.

1101
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,940
The Reds don't stand, the Rebels too.

1102
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,980
They all say, yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo.

1103
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,580
We are, we are, we are, we are the All-American Family.

1104
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,020
The Reds don't stand, the Rebels too.

1105
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,860
They all say, yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo.

1106
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:12,640
We are, we are, we are, we are the All-American Family.

1107
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,560
The Reds don't stand, the Rebels too.

1108
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:24,000
They all say, yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo.

1109
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:31,520
We all had, the All-American Family.

1110
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,360
The Reds don't stand, the Rebels too.

1111
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:42,320
They all say, yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo.

1112
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:46,540
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are the All-American Family.

1113
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:46,540


1114
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:46,540

00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:46,540


1118
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:46,540


1119
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:46,540


1120
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:46,540


1121
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:46,540


1122
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:46,540


1123
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:46,540


1124
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:46,540


1125
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:57,140
We are way, we are way, we are way, we are way, we are way, we are the American family.

1126
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:03,240
We are the Lakers, the Red Bulls, too.

1127
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,980
We are saying yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo.

1128
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:15,260
We are way, we are way, we are the American family.

1129
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:21,320
The Flintstones have the Red Bulls, too.

1130
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:26,080
We are saying yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo.

1131
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:35,040
We are way, we are way, we are way, we are way, we are way, we are way, we are way, we are way.

1132
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,260
They are the American family

1133
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:46,140
The Flintstones have the Rambles too

1134
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:51,060
They all sing yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo

1135
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,820
They are the American family

1136
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:04,080
The Flintstones have the Rambles too

1137
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,860
They all sing yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo

1138
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,580

1139
00:53:34,120 --> 00:54:00,080
They are the American family

1140
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:16,960
They are the American family

1141
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:23,400
They all sing yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo

1142
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,480
They are different

Think about it

1151
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,460
Better?

1152
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:31,860

1153
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,660
Faster?

1154
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,440
Do people think you're strange?

1155
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,200
Do you?

1156
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,720
You may be on the right track.

1157
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,840
We have the technology.

1158
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,740
We have the technology.

1159
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,740
We have the technology.

1160
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,840
We have the technology.

1161
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,680
Technology.

1162
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,500
It's still in print.

1163
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,180
They're what we're most proud of.

1164
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,200
Yeah.

1165
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,960
Those books, I think.

1166
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,700
We crank out a radio show every week just like you do.

1167
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,780
We do live shows and things now and then.

1168
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:46,060
But really, the written material, as far as I'm concerned, is the best way to go at subgenius.

1169
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,660
Yeah.

1170
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:54,580
I say that even though I only make a buck or so off each every time those books are sold because they're published by somebody else.

1171
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:55,420
Yeah.

1172
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:04,340
The stuff I really make money off of is ordaining people as ministers and selling DVDs.

1173
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,400
All right.

1174
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,580
So I can make those myself and they cost practically nothing.

1175
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,220
Yeah.

1176
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:18,960
If people do want to get ordained and they want to check out Church of Subgenius, where do you reckon they should point their browsers to?

1177
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,140
Subgenius.com has everything.

1178
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:23,900
Mm-hmm.

1179
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:32,580
And the very first thing you would click on on subgenius.com is the, you know, become an ordained minister link.

1180
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,280
Mm-hmm.

1181
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,220
That's the easiest thing to get to.

1182
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:40,700
But if you want to just look at crazy artwork, we've got some amazing art galleries.

1183
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:48,700
If you want to see weirdo nudity, there's all of the X Day reports from years past.

1184
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,040
There's a little of everything.

1185
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,360
And of course, there's links to our weekly radio show.

1186
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:58,040
The one thing that I need to stress is that there is not an O in subgenius.

1187
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,740
There are only U's and I's.

1188
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:08,500
There's no I in Bob, but there is a U in subgenius.

1189
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:15,380
A U that sends us 30 US dollars or 20 pounds.

1190
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,000
Yeah.

1191
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,640
Or no, 20 euros, I guess it is.

1192
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:19,180
20 euros.

1193
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,080
Yeah, that's right.

1194
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:20,540
That's right.

1195
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,480
20 euros now.

1196
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:22,380
Yeah.

1197
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:26,680
So, yeah, subgenius.com.

1198
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,220
There is an O in com.

1199
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:28,960
Yeah.

1200
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,100
That's true.

1201
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,180
And in doc.

1202
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,680
You have to do this slowly.

1203
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,920
I'm writing all this down.

1204
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:40,640
Well, you can just use a period for the doc part.

1205
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:43,920
Excellent.

1206
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:47,160
But yeah, subgenius.com leads to everything else.

1207
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,180
We have a lot of videos that are...

1208
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:53,320
A lot of the stuff we sell, we also give away.

1209
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:58,200
And you can see a lot of our videos on YouTube and also Google Video.

1210
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:03,220
You can see a lot of bad ones done by various people, even including me.

1211
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,720
So there's a certain amount of sorting.

1212
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,980
But if you go for the ones that have had millions of views, those are the good ones.

1213
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:12,260
Hello.

1214
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,240
This is Lee Bernard.

1215
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:20,160
I just want to say, in this time period, after 1998, 2006, I think we're in the middle of

1216
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:20,160


1217
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:20,160


1218
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:20,160


1219
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:20,240
a pandemic.

1220
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:24,560
I think that the UFOs are appearing in the sky, like never before.

1221
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,660
And it's personal.

1222
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,060
They're appearing in the sky for me, like right now.

1223
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,280
They're appearing in the sky right now.

1224
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,160
And I'm watching them.

1225
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:45,680
I just would like to think, wish that it could bring back the subgenius radio hour of black

1226
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,140
with a new message for a different, a new time after 9-11.

1227
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:50,140


1228
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:50,140


1229
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,820
I think that's what we're going to do.

1230
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:58,620
I think it's going to be interesting if you could.
