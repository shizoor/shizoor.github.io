1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
And it's your mind, dear friends.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,160
Okay, okay, have at it.

3
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,280
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,520
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,140
which will make you feel like you're in a dream.

6
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,240
It reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,740
Hour of Swatch.

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,420
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,060
The practice of hallucinatory drugs was big back in then

10
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,320
and they were hearing these messages that the Beatles were placing backwards.

11
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,920
They've already ran.

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,600
They've already rounded us up like cattle.

13
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,560
Herded us into forced slave labor camps

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,860
and replaced our names with urine test results numbers.

15
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,700
Only most of us didn't notice

16
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,880
because at the end of the day they still let us clock out,

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,760
go home to our cell blocks and punch in again for a few minutes of quality time

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,540
with the spouse and the kitties or the drugs and TV or all four.

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,680
The takeover, the domestication we believe they call it,

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,120
happened so gradually.

21
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,940
So quietly and so thoroughly

22
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,100
that even if you happen to know who Bob Dobbs is

23
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,520
that's him right there

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,180
you might not even care.

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,060
And of course there's considerable pressure on you from all sides

26
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,340
keeping you from caring whether you care or not

27
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,300
and it's so much easier to just quit fighting it

28
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,800
and do nothing but stand there supporting that weight

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,940
rather than stagger around looking like an idiot

30
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,120
but at least trying to get out of it.

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,820
And I'm not saying that you can't get out from under it.

32
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,360
But you're used to it.

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,760
You can take it.

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,980
It's a living.

35
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,780
You'll just go on about your job doing as you're told.

36
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,820
Getting along, playing the game, making the best of it.

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,200
Why not?

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,560
Nothing's left.

39
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,020
Elvis is dead.

40
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,600
Hendrix is dead.

41
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,680
John Holmes is dead.

42
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,080
The Marlboro Man has cancer.

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,980
Love and kindness are purchased commodities.

44
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,520
Even the gay baby whales are endorsing.

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,620
Big oil companies.

46
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,220
Rock and roll is a beer commercial.

47
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,180
Punk is a hairstyle.

48
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,260
All the starving people in the world want back what they think you took

49
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,240
but you're supposed to work like a dog just to keep what you probably only think you have.

50
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,280
You can't even die legally, friends.

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,360
You can run but you can't hide.

52
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,260
Ronald McDonald, Joe Camel, and Ollie North are cultural heroes.

53
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,500
And narco music bleats forever.

54
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,120
The Beaver grew up and married his mom.

55
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,400
What in the creeping hell is going on?

56
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,920
Conspiracy to conceal information by leaving it mislabeled in plain sight

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,040
dooms billions to lifelong servitude under sole vampire pseudo-deities created by the ones they enslave.

58
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,080
But we've got excuses for hate, dear friends.

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,480
The cop computers are syncing up the homestretch crackdown on us.

60
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,280
On all weirdness, before 1998, you can't even tell a damn joke anymore

61
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,100
without some normality squad thought cop whining down your neck.

62
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:54,460
It's the hip new Puritans, the scum lords, the pee-pee boys, and frat brats

63
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:01,520
are the very cream of the crap that is the failed genetic cesspool of doomed humanity.

64
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,360
And yet!

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,460
Even while they shave off your right,

66
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,420
your wild hairs,

67
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,820
you find yourself reflexively thanking them for that spiritual castration,

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,620
that amputation of your abnormality gland.

69
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,560
Oh, but hey, you paid good time and money for them to do it.

70
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,020
You're all gonna enjoy it.

71
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,260
Oh, every moron knows that, you say.

72
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,620
Life's a bitch and then you die.

73
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,780
You got it, pal.

74
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,280
One big treadmill to nowhere.

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,440
A cancer-ridden rat race around a city.

76
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,020
A sinking ship.

77
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,500
You'll marry some bland, dependable entity

78
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,800
and bear a brood of snot-faced, drug-snorting brats

79
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,660
who can't believe what a doddering dullard you are

80
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,360
and can't wait to leave or kill you as you sit there,

81
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,060
exhausted and trembling,

82
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,080
sweating blood and staring at some mediocre TV show,

83
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,480
pondering your brain-wrenching degree of debt,

84
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,300
desperately trying to drink yourself into a stupor,

85
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,680
wondering,

86
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,740
what the hell happened?

87
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,460
Well, by all means, go ahead and sit there.

88
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,520
It's your soul.

89
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,800
Ourselves, we're getting pretty damn sick of it.

90
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,760
Our ma always said,

91
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,360
when the rock hits you, holler.

92
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,160
And the way we were raised,

93
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,740
when habit-beslaved normalcy dupes

94
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,920
start stealing your slack away

95
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,680
with their pro-social, fascio-humanist,

96
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,300
wimp-training hammer-lock systems

97
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,660
and selling it back to you,

98
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,320
and you at a profit,

99
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,880
that's when the elect know to crank up the device

100
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,740
and start splattering.

101
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,420
The normals, smug yuppies and po-bucker nutsees

102
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,160
who are seemingly shopping around you

103
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,140
in blissful, self-sustained ignorance

104
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,860
actually form a vast conspiracy against you.

105
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
It wouldn't be quite so bad

106
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,320
if this conspiracy was trying to sell your soul only to the devil,

107
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,060
but they're dealing with the anti-Satan as well.

108
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,500
Unfortunately, belief in some old man in the clouds

109
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,140
or a big Disneyland in the hereafter

110
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,600
will not protect you.

111
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,540
But will you be ready?

112
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,980
Will you have an out when the whole thing blows?

113
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,940
Be not disheartened, my friends.

114
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,940
It is no myth.

115
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,360
There exists an underground resistance force,

116
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,300
an army of idiopathic deviants and angry mutations

117
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,640
ready to help you lash out,

118
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,520
to make you lash out,

119
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,120
pretending to obey like gorillas in a zoo by day,

120
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,320
but gorilla fighters at night and by coffee break.

121
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,980
These freedom fighters won't sell their obedience

122
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,560
for nice cars, VCRs, furlough vacation trips and fantasy entertainment,

123
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,880
nor will they trade it for a warm cage

124
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,340
and three squares of beer.

125
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,460
No cake here.

126
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:15,120
The size of a Spurance is enough to get Tradians

127
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,120


128
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,120


129
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,380
and be free than ever

130
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,400
so that even steeds Dre Local

131
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,680
won't beît gold.

132
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,660
This is the death of Adam

133
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,300
and no success.

134
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,460
Nothing less than marrying the King of the West

135
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,480
for a wedding day at Lod histor これ

136
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,780
when we say things like that, and they're perfectly right.

137
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,520
The conspiracy has hogged fascism for too long.

138
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,560
We're taking it back for the people.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,580
Fascism for the people.

140
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,860
Fascism for the individual.

141
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,740
So join the party that is the rejection of all parties,

142
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,440
patriots, psychotic, and anarcho-materialism.

143
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,040
Every person a monarch, every yard a kingdom,

144
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,400
every checkbook a queendom,

145
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,040
every child and dog a serf,

146
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,740
every dad a duche,

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,340
every mom an Imelda,

148
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,460
and every dinner on time.

149
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,120
Abandon the corporate nation states

150
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,300
and shop black market only, friends.

151
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,460
It's cheaper.

152
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,200
But let's face it.

153
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,440
In an age when American corpo merger capitalism,

154
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,480
practically the same thing as the old Communist Party nowadays,

155
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,380
is in a blinding, dizzying tailwind,

156
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,460
the time is obviously right for a new faith,

157
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,880
a new paradigm, a new prophet,

158
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,460
one whose methods actually parallel and parasitize

159
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,320
the monolithic econo-culture of the West,

160
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,060
a religion based on pure capitalism,

161
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,500
on the divine logic of supply and demand,

162
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,900
but unfettered by conspiracy-implanted neuroses

163
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,080
about what will sell.

164
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,340
Offer it,

165
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,380
as by the law,

166
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,120
Bob Dobbs said,

167
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,120
offer it and they will buy.

168
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,500
That real religion is the Church of the Subgenius

169
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,520
and the prophet is J.R. Bob Dobbs,

170
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,220
avatar of slack and immaculator of the age.

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,640
You two deserve better and we have the program.

172
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,800
Well, that is fortuitous.

173
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,020
One thing stands out as a completely unique experience.

174
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,380
Um...

175
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,800
Once again, kids,

176
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,640
it's that time on the Zoo Radio Hour

177
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,820
when we invite you to test the visual portion of your radio.

178
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,740
Just take your Zoo Radio Visual Receptor Transmogrifier kit

179
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,720
out of its protective sleeve,

180
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,200
extend the interocitor rods and rotate to point C,

181
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,900
making sure that the magenta adaptions are snapped all the way onto the castor head.

182
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,040
You should be able to spot me smiling and waving.

183
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,240
See? Holding up this little clown!

184
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,500
Ha ha ha ha ha!

185
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,180
Oh, allow the utterance of thine retain on erring inequity,

186
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,240
clamor in their bravery,

187
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,260
drive them to dive their defense,

188
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,140
and make them feel the sense of fight

189
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,240
from their scare aid in the day of conflict.

190
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,800
Endure thou gift,

191
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,800
O subject of erudition,

192
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,620
and address the conference of the ethical meeting.

193
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,200
Prohibit them to decide creature upon the finest

194
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,740
and secure creation,

195
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,160
that the view of blood may rapid abide recess,

196
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,120
that harmony, consonance, and agitation

197
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,240
may functional happen really,

198
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,700
but let not the unrighteous established,

199
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,440
in fact and in equity,

200
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,240
theology and worldliness,

201
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,960
abound and bravado amongst thy race.

202
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,260
Aaaaaaaah aaaaaah.

203
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,120
Aaaaaaaah.

204
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,300
Aaaaaaaah.

205
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,320
Aaaaaaaah.

206
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,060
How fast was that truck going, Officer Valence?

207
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,500
Speed limited.

208
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,880
Gee, right on the head.

209
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,860
I should pull him over anyway.

210
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,160
Damn trucking banisters.

211
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,780
That damn wife of mine.

212
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,600
I'm gonna kill her.

213
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,880
And that damn college punk who's sinking the soldier with her.

214
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,300
She's probably playing lift leg right now or I'll suck in his sugar stick.

215
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,680
Relax.

216
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,140
Drink some more espresso.

217
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:34,980
I have another donut.

218
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,440
Wait.

219
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,060
We only got two dozen left.

220
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,600
Better not.

221
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,980
I just get so mad.

222
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,960
I gotta hit something.

223
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,520
You don't mind, do you, again?

224
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,060
Ah, sure.

225
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,800
Go ahead.

226
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,400
Oh, my.

227
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,360
Oh, is she better now?

228
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,340
Yeah, a little.

229
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,520
But I wish you were that college punk who's jazzing Sylvie.

230
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,160
Yeah, sure.

231
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,320
Yeah, they're probably making like the beast with two backs right now.

232
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,360
Miserable college.

233
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,360
Pick up another freaking car.

234
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,200
Get that laser detector on them.

235
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,460
Just because we made it in a year, it's not my fault.

236
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,260
Lots of stress being a policeman nowadays.

237
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,360
You know that.

238
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,760
A lot of stress in the streets.

239
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,780
Yeah, sure.

240
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,380
You gotta sit there, eat donuts, watch cars go by.

241
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,200
Their wheels turning around and around.

242
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,160
The repetition of red, yellow, green.

243
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,980
She don't understand.

244
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,160
They're probably threading the needle.

245
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,580
Right now.

246
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:22,840
No.

247
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,980
Don't you mean threading the needle?

248
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,520
I don't know.

249
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,100
Taking a turn on Shooter's Hill.

250
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
They're probably mingling blood.

251
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,160
Yeah, detector says he was going 40 in a 25 zone.

252
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,500
That makes it about 24 miles per hour.

253
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,240
This detector's at least 16 miles an hour fast.

254
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,300
She replaced it, but it makes so much money, it's speeding tickets.

255
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,980
That was a prestigious day, you know, when we coerced City Hall to put us on commission basis

256
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,460
with these speeding citations.

257
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,640
Gives this office of law and goodness motivation.

258
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,560
It's like criminal justice.

259
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,740
Criminal peace work, if you will.

260
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,900
The more people are buzzed, the more people pay chunk cash.

261
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,720
That is nice.

262
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,760
But how about that new confiscation law?

263
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,920
Well, we can confiscate anything of anybody's if our extra enhanced cops training senses

264
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,580
suspect suspicious behavior and or possible drug use at one time or another.

265
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,940
So with that in mind, if that detector says that car's going 45, that's good enough for me.

266
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,420
I love this job.

267
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,460
I'm getting on this car's ass.

268
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:22,540
I'm getting on this car's ass. I'm getting on this car's ass.

269
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:22,700
I'm getting on this car's ass.

270
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:22,700


271
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:22,700


272
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,280
And Jesus, that college stud is probably getting his ashes hauled right now.

273
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,400
We're dipping in the fudge pot with Sylvia.

274
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,420
I can kill them both.

275
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,600
Aren't you going to put your sirens on?

276
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,220
Sirens?

277
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,520
You mean the singing broads, the tempted Ulysses?

278
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,100
No, no, no.

279
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,280
The other sirens, the ones on top of the squad car.

280
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:39,900
Oh, those.

281
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,060
No, no, not yet.

282
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,940
Let's follow that car for a while.

283
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,760
Maybe he'll turn down a deserted street in case I know he's going to give me a hard time.

284
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,620
But first I want to make on this license plate the lousy scumbag.

285
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,500
Car 54 calling freebase.

286
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,360
Calling freebase.

287
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,100
Need a make on a license plate.

288
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,380
N as in enema.

289
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
M as in embarrass.

290
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,540
L as in elevator.

291
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,780
2 as in tutu.

292
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,120
And 4 as in foreskin.

293
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,480
I should have never let her get out of the house.

294
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,420
No, she had to go to Cleveland State.

295
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,700
That's where she met that college punk.

296
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,360
I bet he's introducing Charlie to her gravy maker right now.

297
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,500
Or dancing a matrimonial polka on some cheesy dives.

298
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,500
Well, looks like something's going right for you.

299
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,520
That car's turning down that deserted street.

300
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,060
A top-end license.

301
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,500
N as in enema.

302
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,440
M as in embarrass.

303
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,500
L as in elevator.

304
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,600
2 as in tuba dance.

305
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,620
And 4 as in foreplay.

306
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,880
Has an outstanding ticket.

307
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,260
Out on one-headlight violation.

308
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,640
And did not file a document for succession with the court.

309
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,960
Lousy scumbag.

310
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,160
Hit them sirens.

311
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,200
Okay.

312
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,480
Okay.

313
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,380
Don't you love the way they look in their rearview mirror when they first notice us?

314
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,320
That's right, buddy.

315
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,200
Pull it over.

316
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,640
Looks like there's only one driver.

317
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,960
Better call for backup.

318
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,420
We're outnumbered one to two.

319
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
I'll get the driver's side.

320
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,260
You get the passenger's side.

321
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,040
Damn slut's probably smoking his Doc Johnson right now.

322
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:12,920
Evening.

323
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,340
Show us your license, please.

324
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,140
Keep your hands where I can see them.

325
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,340
No sudden movements.

326
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,700
What seems to be the problem, officer?

327
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,260
I wasn't even doing the speed limit.

328
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,660
I was 24.

329
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,340
24?

330
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,760
We clocked you at 45, buddy.

331
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,180
Don't lie to a police officer.

332
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,420
Just give us your license.

333
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,260
Well, Chaz Smith.

334
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,100
One vicious circle.

335
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,280
Men are Ohio.

336
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,300
You probably like men or women, don't you?

337
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,940
Well, Chaz.

338
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,040
It seems you didn't furnish proof to the court for the fixing of a broken headlight.

339
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,980
Oh, I fixed that headlight the next day.

340
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,880
See?

341
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,260
They both were.

342
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,340
Perfect brights, too.

343
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,640
See?

344
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,960
It don't matter, boy.

345
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,400
You didn't prove it, did you?

346
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,700
What are you doing out tonight, Chaz?

347
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,360
Just going home from doing a brain rot radio theater on CSB.

348
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,040
WCSB?

349
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,140
Yeah, yeah.

350
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,020
I go to Cleveland State.

351
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,580
No.

352
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,160
No law against that, is there?

353
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,100
No law against that.

354
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,120
College boy.

355
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,200
You're a college boy just like the one that's...

356
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,780
Big mouth.

357
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,920
Step out of your car.

358
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Keep your hands at full view.

359
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,060
Hey.

360
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,860
Hey, what's going on?

361
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,440
What did I do?

362
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,080
Is there some kind of problem?

363
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,100
Big problem for you?

364
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,440
I said get out of the car!

365
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:27,980
Officer Valence!

366
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,440
My extra police six cents.

367
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,880
Senses he's making an eye movement like he's reaching for a gun.

368
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,800
Call for backup.

369
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,440
Are you crazy?

370
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,080
Call for backup!

371
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,620
Don't shoot.

372
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,020
Are you crazy?

373
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,580
Crazy?

374
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:36,880
Crazy?

375
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,040
I'll show you who's crazy.

376
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,500
I'll show you who's crazy, you college punk.

377
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,160
Hey, now, don't.

378
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,320
You don't have to haul him down like that.

379
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,020
Give me that taser.

380
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,660
All right, wait a minute.

381
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,320
Give me that taser.

382
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,980
All right, don't go so...

383
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,740
All right, don't go so...

384
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,580
Give me that taser.

385
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,660
You like that, killer?

386
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,360
Huh?

387
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

388
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,220
Oh.

389
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

390
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,420
Get in the full felony prone position.

391
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,460
Whose wife are you buzzing the brillo with?

392
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,800
I said whose wife are you buzzing the brillo with?

393
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,660
Face on the ground.

394
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,460
Butt in the air.

395
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,320
Eyes looking left.

396
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,720
I said looking left!

397
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,960
How you like that, killer?

398
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,540
Now stand on one foot.

399
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,380
Hold your breath.

400
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,620
Do as I say.

401
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,300
Touch your nose with your tongue.

402
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,760
I said touch your nose with your tongue.

403
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,540
Watch out.

404
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,200
His right foot made a movement like he's reaching for an AK-47.

405
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,180
Stop resisting.

406
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,820
Stop resisting, I said.

407
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,800
Smart-ass college punk trying to defend yourself, is it?

408
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,380
Uh-oh.

409
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,820
My surreal perceptions detect an REM like he's on PCV.

410
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,000
Need more backup.

411
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,180
He's starting a riot.

412
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,240
Call Riot Strong.

413
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,260
Get that taser.

414
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:34,700
Ah.

415
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,040
Shh, shh, shh.

416
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,800
Shh.

417
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,220
Stay down.

418
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,780
I said stay down.

419
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,260
Damn college punk.

420
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,040
You like that, huh?

421
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,480
Huh?

422
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,220
You punk.

423
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:48,780
Uh-huh.

424
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,380
You like that.

425
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:49,640
Who's behind you?

426
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:49,640


427
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:49,640


428
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:49,640


429
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:49,640


430
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:49,640


431
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,180
The wife you buzzing the brillo with.

432
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,020
Stay down.

433
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,400
Hey, he's making body movements like he wants to stay alive.

434
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,260
I'll teach you to want to stay alive.

435
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,480
Send more backup.

436
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,480
We're outnumbered one to 20.

437
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,000
Hey, great party, Maurice Bentley.

438
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,160
I just love what you've done to this sunken kitchen sinkhole.

439
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,320
Let's step outside.

440
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,680
There's something I want to tell you.

441
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,320
You know, I heard you got the biggest...

442
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,740
Look over there.

443
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,060
What's all those police cars doing across the street?

444
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,160
Look, look.

445
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,420
They're beating the sugar out of someone.

446
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,500
Quick, Maurice.

447
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,860
Grab your video camera.

448
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,980
Quick, quick, quick.

449
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,560
This could be worth a fortune.

450
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,480
How do I turn this damn thing on?

451
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,180
Oh, yeah.

452
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,080
It's on.

453
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,520
Damn.

454
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,020
Oh, get too far away.

455
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,780
I can't see them.

456
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,000
I got to get closer.

457
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,220
I'll just sneak up on them.

458
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,240
That's right.

459
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,300
Oh, they're getting in front of me.

460
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,300


461
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,300


462
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,300


463
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,300


464
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,300


465
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,300


466
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,300


467
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,780
Oh, yeah.

468
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,720
That's perfect.

469
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,520
Man, oh, man, Percy.

470
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,920
You should check this beating house.

471
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,260
You're in the pain, right?

472
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,580
Look at that.

473
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,820
There's more cops here than at the Larry King beating.

474
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,940
Daryl, 3 o'clock.

475
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,360
Someone with a video camera.

476
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,720
Take care of it.

477
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,360
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

478
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,460
You.

479
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,320
What the hell you think you're doing, huh?

480
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,220
Put that down.

481
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,200
You're interfering with police questions.

482
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,260
Turn that camera off.

483
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,380
What do you mean?

484
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,120
There's no law against using a video camera in public.

485
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,300
I'm not.

486
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,300


487
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,300


488
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,300


489
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,300


490
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,300


491
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,300


492
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,300


493
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,300


494
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,300


495
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,840
I got a right to be here.

496
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,700
I got a right for you.

497
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,640
I got a right for you and a left for you.

498
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,560
I got a right for you and another one.

499
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,600
Smart mouth up.

500
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:28,920
Give me that.

501
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,640
Give me that camera.

502
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,260
You're under arrest.

503
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,840
Under arrest for what?

504
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,720
For resisting arrest in an affair where the police beating.

505
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,120
All putting up resistance.

506
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,300
We'll take this.

507
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,380
Watch out.

508
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,860
Paranormal police instinct detects a lip curl, meaning he's telepathically trying to contact

509
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,180
outer space aliens for help.

510
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,260
Severe depression.

511
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,540
Severe depression.

512
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,720
I need more backup.

513
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:48,920
You.

514
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,860
Get on the ground.

515
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,460
Kiss my ass.

516
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,880
Look 45 degrees southwest.

517
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,580
I said southwest, jerk.

518
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,740
My special police senses detect you're about to try to fly away.

519
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,700
Damn.

520
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,240
Broke another billy club.

521
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,080
Destroying police property, huh?

522
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,380
Need more backup.

523
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,060
More backup.

524
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,840
More backup.

525
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,160
No way.

526
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,400
Somebody help me.

527
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,020
Somebody help me.

528
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,620
Somebody help me.

529
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,240
Somebody help me.

530
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,280
Somebody help me.

531
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,520
Somebody help me.

532
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,520


533
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,520


534
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,520


535
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,520


536
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,660
I'm telling you.

537
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,160
Jack off a lot.

538
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,320
His ultra hot baby strips up in front of him.

539
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,140
Her window every night, man, dude.

540
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,400
Cause she gotta need baby pillows, I can't miss, man.

541
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,660
And this time I'm prepared, dude.

542
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,540
Got Dad's VidCam.

543
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,720
Dude.

544
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,240
I'm going to vid those delicious hoots, man.

545
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,440
No shirt.

546
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,020
Gruk and Faye.

547
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,700
Cool.

548
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,880
I just love this Nirvana gas.

549
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,700
Turn it up, man.

550
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,280
Hey.

551
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,420
Pass me the Elka, man.

552
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:47,520
I'm going to go.

553
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:47,520


554
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:47,520


555
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:47,520


556
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:47,520


557
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:47,520


558
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:57,300
the Elka. Elka, man? What the hell is the Elka, man? The Elka bong, Queeks. The bong, man. Pass the bong.

559
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:05,640
Oh, the bong. You can't say that on the radio, man. That's kind of humorous frown nowadays, man.

560
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,360
Drug humor went out of the laugh-in, man. I'm bringing it back, man. Quit Bogartin' the joint,

561
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:19,260
Humphrey. Whoa, check it out. Down the street. Look, three cops beating up a guy with a video

562
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:25,400
camera. Look at that dude. Yeah, check it out. There's a bunch of cops over there beating up

563
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,960
some other dude by a cop. Hey, dude, man. Hey, I'm going to get this on video, man.

564
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:38,720
Got that vid cam right here. Hey, that guy who filmed that Benny King beating made a fortune,

565
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,020
man.

566
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,900
Hey, cool. Hey, slow down. I want to get both beatings, man. Two beatings, twice as much

567
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,500
money, dude. Yeah, stop here. Stop. Perfecto, wow. Hey, they're using that dude as a tackling

568
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:59,380
dummy, man. Oh, dude. Oh, man. I think he's on pig senos, man. Pig senos.

569
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,480
Menstro, cramps, over in that car, across the street. Another videoer. Take a squad

570
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,360
and fan out. There might be more. 54 to dispatch. We need the VST immediately. Here at the corner

571
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,100
of Denton Berry.

572
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,280
That's right. The video SWAT team. Hurry.

573
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,300
We are not popping, Patrick. Kidnapping of a terrorist just walked off the street. We

574
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,820
need 200 police officers elsewhere.

575
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,440
Never mind that. We've got more important things to take care of. Hard job. Crotchless,

576
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:32,080
underwear. Take care of that car. Lumpy, gravy, fan out. Secure the area for more cameras

577
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,920
until the VST gets here. Let's get control of the situation right now.

578
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,840
Hey, what is the hell is you doing? Put that camera down. This is official.

579
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,120
This is business. What does smell? Narcotics? All right. Nice car. I could use that. It's

580
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,820
mine. You're under arrest. I'm everybody of you. Don't move.

581
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:54,620
Oh, wow, dude, man. Take off, man. Split. Let's get the hell out of here, dude. Step

582
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:54,860
on it.

583
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,080
Yeah? Yeah. Fleeing a police officer against my law. I am warning you one time.

584
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,060
Halt or I will shoot you.

585
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,560
Ha, ha, ha.

586
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,280
Oh, my God. He shot those kids.

587
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,400
Did you get it all? Did you get it all?

588
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:21,460
Yep. I got it all. The shooting and crushing those kids. The first video getting beat up

589
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:28,280
and the driver getting beat up. God's sakes, don't let the cops see you or us. Relax. Their

590
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:36,020
backs are toward us. They can't see us in these bushes. See them over there in the bushes.

591
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,540
Yeah, I got them in sight. You jump over that fence and go through those people's house.

592
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,260
I'll wait here.

593
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,980
30 seconds. We'll secure that video camera. Go.

594
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:57,760
Think of it. This will put Stephen King's beating tape to shame. We'll make a fortune, man. We'll be on our scene in Ikeo Hall, Jay Limo and Phil Donatoll, everything, man.

595
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:03,240
Keep it down. You don't want the cops to hear us. They're the way they're laughing tonight. No telling what they'll do.

596
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:10,140
Now, come out from them bushes with your hands up. Drop that camera by your side.

597
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,340
Do as we say.

598
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,880
Jumping baby Mohammed. They spotted us. We're coming. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Please don't shoot.

599
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:23,420
Just keep walking with your hands up. Now, lie on your stomach with your hands out and legs split. Larry, Curly Moe.

600
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,600
We weren't doing anything. We weren't doing anything.

601
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:36,140
Not doing anything right. You were trying to get your police force in trouble. Your police force. We work for you. It's people like you who make good police work that much harder.

602
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,180
You and the Bill of Rights, you should be ashamed.

603
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,520
What's wrong?

604
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,320
You got a problem with law and order, boys? Move your head. Cover me.

605
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:53,080
Watch this. My police training senses that his ear movements means he's got a loaded bazooka in his breast pocket.

606
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,920
You 20 cops, help me. Maybe this will teach him respect for an officer's privacy. Where's that bazooka?

607
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,840
Any way to go?

608
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:08,860
Ow!

609
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,540
Ow!

610
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,380
Ow!

611
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,140
Ow!

612
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:11,600
Ow!

613
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:11,840
Ow!

614
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:12,700
Ow!

615
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:13,920
Ow!

616
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,220
Ow!

617
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,280
Ow!

618
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,560
Ow!

619
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,100
Ow!

620
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,360
Ow!

621
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,540
This is it, man. We hit the jackpot, bro.

622
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,760
Got this beating, the shooting, the crash, the other beating, the driving, beating on my handy cam.

623
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
We're gonna be rich, man.

624
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,140
I got all these people videotaping each other.

625
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,520
Oh, man.

626
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,780
Oh, man.

627
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,520
You with the camera on the veranda, stop filming immediately!

628
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:41,940
Uh-oh!

629
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:47,360
My enhanced police instincts to protect from 100 yards in the air, that man is sweating a certain way,

630
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,020
which means he's reaching for an anti-aircraft missile.

631
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,980
Fire away!

632
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,500
Wow!

633
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,140
Wow!

634
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,880
I can't believe all this!

635
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,720
Did you get it all on tape?

636
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,340
I sure did.

637
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,520
I got the bombing of the video around the veranda.

638
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,860
I got the second video beating, the shooting and crash of those kids.

639
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,040
The first video beating and the driver beating.

640
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,840
All on my hot little tape.

641
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,660
This tape could be worth a fortune.

642
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,560
In the wrong hands.

643
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,300
Video's on tape! Video's on tape! Come in, it works!

644
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,240
Do you need any more backups?

645
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,900
That's a negative.

646
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,040
Repeat, negative.

647
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,520
We got this possible ugly situation under control.

648
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
We can all breathe a little easier now.

649
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,960
You won't see this on CNN.

650
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,200
Stark! Raving! Mad!

651
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,000
Let's get back to work!

652
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,840
Stop!

653
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,120
Ow!

654
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:48,880
Ow!

655
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,860
Ow!

656
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,120
Ow!

657
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,020
Ow!

658
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,000
Ow!

659
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,740
Ow!

660
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:55,880
Ow!

661
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,320
Ow!

662
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,840
Ow!

663
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:56,940
Ow!

664
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,480
Ow!

665
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:57,480


666
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:57,480


667
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:57,480


668
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,420
Ow!

669
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,080
Ow!

670
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,080


671
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,080


672
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,080


673
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,080


674
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,980
Ow!

675
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,560
Ow!

676
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,200
пример

677
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,200


678
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,440

679
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,600
We return with the kayakers from waco segment of arts up a minimum punishment that seems we 하루.

683
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:39,360
ground. No, U.S. out of Waco now. That's what we say, friends. Oh, but I think, I think I should

684
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,280
stop and tell you, you were, uh, what we just were playing was from the tape Video Bleak

685
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:57,700
from our friends at Brain Rot Radio, who broadcast out of WCSB in Cleveland. Uh, yes, although

686
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:03,580
they'd like to be broadcasting out of anywhere and everywhere, and I'm sure that the stations

687
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:12,720
that play the hour of slack might well be interested in that Brain Rot Radio, but, uh,

688
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:24,760
we who are presenting that Brain Rot Radio are the Subgenius Foundation. That's, that's

689
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,340
us here, producers of this show.

690
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:34,760
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, and I'm going to give you an address you can

691
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:41,580
write for for free information about the Church of the Subgenius. Yes, that's why we do it.

692
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:50,700
We do it for B-B-B-B-Bob, and, uh, he's so glad when we do it for Bob, and in fact, you

693
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:57,680
know, he likes it best when we do it nastiest, when we do it the way the normals most like.

694
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:04,520
We just don't want us to do, uh, uh, no, no, no, and we're, we're going to be bad again

695
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:12,080
tonight, uh, having just done first half of show on the subject matter of, uh, uh, whatever

696
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,720
it was we were talking about. This second half shall, in fact, be on the, uh, sad and

697
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:26,700
sorry subject of, of drug abuse in our country, yes, and, uh, you know, if only they'd, uh,

698
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:33,500
I mean, I think it should be illegal for humans, if you know what I mean. Dear friends, oh,

699
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:41,020
that post office box to write to for free information, just write to Bob, good old J.R.

700
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:54,520
Bob Dobbs, just, just address it to Bob at post office box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

701
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,820
I'm going to give you that number again.

702
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:17,340
It's Bob at post office box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214, and we love you here, yes, oh,

703
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,520

704
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,300
you, uh, free information about this mighty church and all the other things.

705
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,980
We do, besides the radio show, bad things, bad, you know, the fact that we haven't been

706
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:41,300
shut down yet, I think, says something about the malaise that our country is in, but, you

707
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:46,040
know, they, they're going to keep letting us do it while we'll just keep doing it. In

708
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,580
fact, well, I probably shouldn't go any deeper into that.

709
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:06,380
Have become an escape for a nation of ignored youth. Many parents too busy to stop, listen,

722
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,340
Bob said I'm gonna give you drugs.

723
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,160
Bob said I'm gonna give you pills.

724
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,480
Bob said I'm gonna free him from the false flag of the conspiracy.

725
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,500
He's a son of water.

726
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,620
He's a god that set maps.

727
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,980
He's a pyrocladulator.

728
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,080
Three and three-year-olds can't eat.

729
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,580
Hi there, Mrs. Garibaldi.

730
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,560
Okay.

731
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,020
And so she would follow the answer to that.

732
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:56,460
That's right.

733
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,740
Okay. Bye.

734
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,400
Here comes Mrs. Darvon again in her nice soft dress.

735
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,380
Hi, Mr. Valium.

736
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,600
Hi.

737
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,120
Well, today we're going to make sure that everybody feels okay.

738
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:11,960
That's right.

739
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,020
They're eating Kool-Aid and pills.

740
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,620
Oh, well.

741
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,500
Miss Valium.

742
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,520
Well, I'm sad today.

743
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,880
Yes?

744
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,280
Yes?

745
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:26,820
Yes?

746
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,700
I'm not sure.

747
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:28,700


748
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,840
Well, I don't know.

749
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,740
It's just a good thing.

750
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,540
There's a lot of good things.

751
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,340
And I'm not sure I can do any of them.

752
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,080
But I'm not sure I'm going to eat, you know, a lot of pills.

753
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:38,600
I'm not sure.

754
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:39,820


755
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,840
Oh, yeah.

756
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,860
But that's fine.

757
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:41,860


758
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,660
I'm not sure.

759
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:43,660


760
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,340
Okay.

761
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,720
I'll be there.

762
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,320
Okay.

763
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,360


764
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,360


765
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,360


766
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,160
Bye.

767
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,320
Bye.

768
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:55,380


769
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:55,380


770
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,000
Bye.

771
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,000


772
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,980
Talking about pills now.

773
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,340
Pills.

774
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,060
Well, pills in my head, but pills in my socks.

775
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,900
Pills in the woods and pills on the rocks.

776
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,700
Yeah, pills.

777
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,860
Pills.

778
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,120
Talking about pills now.

779
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,640
Pills.

780
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,120
Pills are the dumbest things to do.

781
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,100
Pills are better friends than you.

782
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,120
Yeah, pills.

783
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,120
Pills.

784
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,300
Talking about pills now.

785
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:29,960
Pills.

786
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,740
My friends, the pills.

787
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,100
Oh, just give me some of them pills.

788
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,980
Oh, give me those pills, Bob.

789
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,680
Can we have some pills over here, please?

790
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,680
Here, have some pills.

791
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,760
Take some more of these pills in the morning.

792
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,240
Can I have some pills, please, from my heart?

793
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,860
More pills.

794
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,460
And that's just the sort of thing I was talking about.

795
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,060
Exactly, gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen.

796
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,980
Hello to you in Dallas.

797
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,440
Texas.

798
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,800
This is the secret Reverend Bleepo Abernathy speaking to you over the airwaves of your local radio station there,

799
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,760
courtesy of Stang and the Reverend Bucknaked,

800
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,740
for which I am glad to present this opportunity to myself to speak at this time.

801
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:13,200
First of all, I want to say that none of the pills are ever good enough, as you all know.

802
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:20,360
And as you're out there, you know, you cannot feel anything without some sort of pill.

803
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,200
Now, that pill could be, of course, you know, your average,

804
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,960
you know, vitamin or dexatrim or something like that, or it can be Jesus.

805
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,480
It's any kind of pill that you mention at all.

806
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,740
We don't want to get too specific here, but let's just face it, friends, you're all looking for a pill.

807
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,300
And I don't know.

808
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,000
I don't know.

809
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,740
We're not talking a quart of pills.

810
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,620
We're talking a bucket of pills, which is sometimes.

811
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,840
Some people relate to half an old-fashioned bathtub full of pills.

812
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,180
Sometimes, I don't know how much quarts of pills go for in Dallas right now.

813
00:34:53,200 --> 00:35:00,600
I think in New York, you can get about a half a handful of pills for what, like a pint of pills might cost you in Austin or Chicago.

814
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,500
But we're in Dallas now, so we're talking quarts of pills.

815
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,380
But this is just...

816
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,500
A kebab chair is full of pills.

817
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,600
These are all legal.

818
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,320
They're not drugs.

819
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,200
These are herbs.

820
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,720
They've been smuggled in by Tibetan llamas, which have been working for Bob for centuries.

821
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,800
I heard they put them on the bellies of sea turtles at one point.

822
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,720
They'd fit them in your plate.

823
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,320
They put them on seven-year voyage.

824
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,460
They put them on your tongue.

825
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,460
They put them on...

826
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,180
They might have...

827
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,400
They might have put them on geese's...

828
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,640
Or they put them in your nose.

829
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,740
They put them in your shoes.

830
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,260
And Bob makes the best pills ever was made.

831
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:30,900
Yeah!

832
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:31,740
Yeah!

833
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,380
Yeah!

834
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:32,740
Yeah!

835
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,260
Yeah, pills!

836
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,240
Yeah, pills!

837
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,700
You get them...

838
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,660
You get them pills!

839
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,960
And you feel...

840
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,700
You feel wise.

841
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,840
Your heart feels wise.

842
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,280
You're buying.

843
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,140
And you know that you're the only one, and the rest of them are wrong, and you're the

844
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,960
only one that's right.

845
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,560
And that's how you're supposed to feel, because you got the pills of Bob in you.

846
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,220
That's right.

847
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,600
Possess these children...

848
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,560
With the fire of thy holy way.

849
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:05,000
Fill them with the blood of your passion that will enable their weak spirits to move in

850
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,600
pursuit of your holy work.

851
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,700
Our children are faced with the peer pressure of taking drugs and drinking alcohol.

852
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,540
It is readily available.

853
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,760
The effects are devastating.

854
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,680
I...

855
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,740
And I walked into the family room, and...

856
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:24,220
The family was watching the TV set with their back to me.

857
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,120
And then I started firing a rifle.

858
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,120
And I was standing behind my dad, and I shot him.

859
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:34,960
Through the head?

860
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,060
Yes.

861
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,240
And then right away?

862
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,900
Almost instantly, my mother.

863
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,020
This would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.

864
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,060
Can you hear me?

865
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,720
I'm not a child.

866
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:50,720


867
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,080
I'm a despairsome cutter, me brothers.

868
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,840
Go on!

869
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,240
Do me in, you bastard cowards!

870
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,780
We don't want to live anyway.

871
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,800
Not in a stinking world like this!

872
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,460
Oh?

873
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,920
And what's so stinking about it?

874
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,760
It's a stinking world because there's no law nor other anymore!

875
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,920
It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old!

876
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,160
Look, you dog!

877
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,140
Oh, it's no water for an old man any longer!

878
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,160
What sort of a world is it at all?

879
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,520
Men on the moon?

880
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,320
And men spinning around the earth?

881
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:40,520
And there's not no attention paid to earthly law nor other no more?

882
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:47,260
Oh, dear little lad, I thought for thee...

883
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,040
I...

884
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,160
I...

885
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,960
I...

886
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,020
I...

887
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,480
I...

888
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,720
In the US today, one of every ten high school seniors uses marijuana daily.

889
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,280
35% of all students use drugs at least once a month.

890
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:07,180
It isn't all the illicit, illegitimate market that's the problem.

891
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,140
We have a panacea in America that is a play to solve every problem.

892
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,540
We do have a 12-j kaik case, including a pourquoi, euro, oms, nuclear Barbie, and more.

893
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,900
And you've dunno what she should call that?

894
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,560
She can buy aם

895
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,020
she picks out cash

896
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,020


897
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:58,280
Everybody's drunk and everybody's wasted and everybody's drinking on the job.

898
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:18,600
The garbage man got trashed, the janitor got messy, the taxi driver got smashed, and the waitress, she got tipsy.

899
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:26,800
In Kansas City, New York City, the great big city, it is amazing now.

900
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,260
Everybody's drunk and everybody's wasted and everybody's drinking on the job.

901
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:37,980
Everybody's drunk and everybody's wasted and everybody's drinking on the job.

902
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:51,440
Well, there's a whole lot of places that I ain't been, a whole lot of things that I ain't seen,

903
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:57,920
a whole lot of things I'll never be, a generation that would change,

904
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,020
the world is still looking for its car keys.

905
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,640
Woo!

906
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:42,480
The terrorists got bombed, the president got hit,

907
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:49,800
security was tight, yeah, the Secret Service got hit.

908
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,520
The FBI, CIA, D.W.I., USA,

909
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:07,880
everybody's drunk and everybody's wasted and everybody's stoned.

910
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,960
And there's nothing that's gonna change it.

911
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:24,220
Everybody's drunk and everybody's wasted and everybody's drinking on the job.

912
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,960
And there's nothing that's gonna change it.

913
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,260
Me, I'm just froppin' on the job and lucky to be doing that, friends.

914
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Since they've had this crackdown on crack, they have succeeded in true conspiracy fashion

915
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,260
in making it so you can't get anything but crack.

916
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,320
I wonder why that is.

917
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,400
Actually, you can't even get crack in Dallas, you get plenty of cocaine, oh yeah, cheaper

918
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,000
than ever.

919
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,200
Because coke, like most of these other drugs, lights up that little spot in your brain that

920
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:11,000
would normally be lit up by sex, or a real kick-ass riff off your favorite song at just

921
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,940
the right time, or the right incredible climactic passage from a great book might light it up

922
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:25,100
on rare occasions, or Jesus or Jim Jones or whatever, or a subgenius tape, a subgenius

923
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,620
show like this every two minutes.

924
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:34,120
Or the merest glimpse of one of Bob's hundred-year-old footprints might light up that spot in your

925
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:42,280
brain, that mighty undiluted, unneagified squirt will flood that spot with, with just

926
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,280
the right juices from just the right glands.

927
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:52,500
But since to read that good book takes days, and you gotta be in the right place at the

928
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,600
right time for that song to have the effect.

929
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,600
If you're gonna get it through sex, you gotta be in the right place at the right time for

930
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:56,600


931
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:56,740
that song to have the effect.

932
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,780
And if you're gonna get it through sex, well, that takes at least five minutes, and often,

933
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,500
you have to take them out to dinner.

934
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:08,260
But my God, you can just go out and spend some money, and in no time at all, you can

935
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,580
light up that little spot just as soon as you can get back in your car, baby.

936
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,340
Just as soon as you can get you a sample.

937
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,700
Fire that booger up.

938
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,080
What else do you need?

939
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:26,580
Why would there be any need for noble feelings for all mankind, or even any sense of humanism?

940
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:26,580


941
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:26,580


942
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,740
Why would there be any need for any kind of human decency whatsoever?

943
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,020
Why would there be any need for anything but to light up that spot in that brain?

944
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:41,040
And when you get those headsets, where you just tape a little pad to either side of your

945
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,180
temple, one in the front and one in the back on a shaved place on your head, and you have

946
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,520
that little control in your pocket with a battery in it, as long as you've got you a

947
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:56,200
dollar 98 nine-volt battery in that thing, you can crank it up to five, to the five marker

948
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,520
on the dial, and it'll feel mighty damn good.

949
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,860
Or turn it up to 10, and you'll never turn it off.

950
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,360
There'd better be somebody standing by.

951
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:12,620
It's anywhere past six on the infinite control with knob, and you're not going to turn it

952
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:12,800
off.

953
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,220
You're not going to, friend.

954
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,580
You might turn it off for a second, but it would hurt.

955
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,480
Oh, it would hurt to turn it down, even to turn it down.

956
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:25,400
And once you've felt that 10 setting, you're not going to want to live with anything else.

957
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,180
You're going to be on your own.

958
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,780
You're going to be crying a year later for the 11 setting.

959
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,220
You're going to be begging.

960
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,300
Oh, you'll be reading all the catalogs, waiting for that breakthrough that'll give you an 11

961
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,220
on that control.

962
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,640
Oh, yes siree, you think they got a drug problem now.

963
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:46,520
You think there's a drug problem in the United States, in the whole world now?

964
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,460
Oh, mark my words, ye sinners, wait until you get some electronics involved, baby.

965
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,740
You think those computer whizzes got rich quick.

966
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,160
Oh, wait until they're gone.

967
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,580
I don't think they'll be around.

968
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,300
Oh, wait until they're gone.

969
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,480
I don't think they'll be around.

970
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:58,480


971
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,080
Oh, it's my head, you'll say.

972
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,200
It's my head.

973
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,540
That's all you'll be able to say.

974
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,000
Every song will be the song, It's My Head.

975
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,520
That'll be the only awareness you need.

976
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:17,540
It's just between you, your head, and your control, your pleasure center stimulator control.

977
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,140
Oh, yeah.

978
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,840
Oh, yeah.

979
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:23,980
You'll be like a monkey in a cage, sitting in a pool of his own saliva.

980
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,680
That's right.

981
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:31,320
because once you feel number 10 you ain't gonna you can kiss what you now

982
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:37,240
know is reality goodbye baby yes and after a while even the 10 starts to feel

983
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:42,920
like pain but you can't go looking for the 11 button cuz you can't get up you've

984
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,980
been there too long cuz you're dead you're a ghost that died while it was

985
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,840
high yep yep if you die when you're high my friend your spirit becomes a

986
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:59,440
wandering shade wandering trying to score for eternity or at least until a

987
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,000
subgenius priest comes along and sends it spanking back to where it originally

988
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,880
came from my god and here I am running out of gas you're always gonna run out

989
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:15,500
sooner or later that's what you got to remember too much oh yeah too much is

990
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:20,320

991
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,820
and you will fall

992
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,900
you'll run out of that church air right when you least expect it right when you

1004
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,000
myüber

1005
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:04,320
out of your life

1006
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,020
I want to live

1007
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:05,500
over

1008
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,680

1009
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,300
right

1010
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:12,780
a

1011
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:17,820
way out of

1012
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,340
this. I'll change the air. That's what I'll do. Let's see, what have I got left on the

1013
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:32,420
climate control? Dust storm? No. Tibetan wilderness? Land of the pharaohs. Land of the pharaohs.

1014
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,280
That sounds great.

1015
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,940
vole

1016
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:18,400
Mummy.

1017
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,520
Daddy.

1018
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,340
Watch out.

1019
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,980
lawsuit.

1020
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:33,040
The madness is coming to hell,

1021
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,440
causing brain cancer,

1022
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,740
and is vanishing

1023
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:50,620
In my dimension, where the evil nights live.

1024
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:15,180
You know, this is, friends, you're listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

1025
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,620
That's the name of the show, the Hour of Slack.

1026
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,820
And, of course, every now and then we like to take away some of your slack.

1027
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:29,300
I want to tell you that we've been playing, for the last half hour, material from Hour of Slack number 51.

1028
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:36,180
Which was actually largely composed of old material from Media Barrage number 8.

1029
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,380
And, let's see.

1030
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,220
There was that little rant that I did.

1031
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,580
I'm your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1032
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:51,540
Back from when there wasn't crack in Dallas, with DK Jones in the background.

1033
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:56,340
Before that, the Rainmakers doing that song, Drinking on the Job.

1034
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,920
Before that, Media Barrage number 8 from Subgenius Tapes.

1035
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,740
Oh, you heard preaching by Buck Naked.

1036
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,240
You heard Doctors for Bob talking about buckets of pills.

1037
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,360
You heard Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

1038
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,880
Preaching about pills and singing about pills.

1039
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:15,320
And, puzzling evidence in happy land.

1040
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,500
And, I've got a few new bits.

1041
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,200
I don't know whether to call this new or old.

1042
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:27,840
This is some Frank Zappa that was given to me on a tape that said, Unreleased Zappa.

1043
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,800
So, I don't know if it's unreleased or not.

1044
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,320
But, it's lovely material.

1045
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:39,040
It's from something that was, at the time, was called the Mother's Tour Album.

1046
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,300
Which was never released.

1047
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:40,820
No, yeah.

1048
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,080
Music

1049
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,540
L.A. in the summer of 69

1050
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:04,640
I went downtown and bought me some wine

1051
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,220
Oh, I drank it down.

1052
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:09,360
Oh, I drank it down.

1053
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:09,360


1054
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,980
The sun went under the table.

1055
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,580
I said, watch me now.

1056
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,420
I'm gonna eat the label.

1057
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,260
I'm a wine old man.

1058
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,560
Don't you know who I am?

1059
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,960
36, 24, it's about 30.

1060
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,740
I seen a fine lady and I started talking dirty.

1061
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:50,040
Boy, she looked over at me and she raised a thumb.

1062
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:56,900
She said, Jim, down the road you're plumb, plumb, plumb.

1063
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,600
I'm a wine old man.

1064
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,920
Don't you know who I am?

1065
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,340
I went to the country.

1066
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,280
And while I was gone,

1067
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,420
I lost control of my body functions

1068
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:26,320
on a roller-headed lady's front lawn.

1069
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:30,220
I'm so ashamed, but I'm a wine old man.

1070
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,660
I can't help myself.

1071
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,200
I've been drinking all night till my eyes got red.

1072
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,360
I'm a wine old man.

1073
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:39,360


1074
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,880
I stumbled on the gutter and busted my head.

1075
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,920
Bugs in my suit too.

1076
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,900
Been scratching like a dog.

1077
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,080
I can't stand no water.

1078
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,300
And I still look like a hog.

1079
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,360
I'm getting a five dollar bill.

1080
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,640
And an overcoat too.

1081
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,880
I'm getting a five dollar bill.

1082
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,100
And an overcoat too.

1083
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:14,820
A five dollar bill and an overcoat too.

1084
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:18,000
A five dollar bill and a floor shine shoe.

1085
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,100
Mm-hmm.

1086
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,180
Oh, phantasmagorical.

1087
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:48,000
Oh, Frank Zappa, theoretically unreleased.

1088
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,720
I don't know.

1089
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,440
That's what they say.

1090
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:56,240
Howard, Reverend Howard Kalin gave that to Reverend Bleepo.

1091
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,660
And Reverend Bleepo gave it to me.

1092
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,640
But here's Lonesome Cowboy Dave singing about

1093
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,660
don't abuse that substance abuser.

1094
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,580
Okay, this song is,

1095
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:06,860
it's a little bit of a,

1096
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:06,860


1097
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:06,860


1098
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,960
it's entitled Stop Abusing That Substance Abuser.

1099
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,680
On drums.

1100
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,340
One, two, three, four.

1101
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:26,220
I said stop abusing that substance abuser, my babe.

1102
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:33,520
I said stop abusing that substance abuser, my babe.

1103
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,120
Because you keep them in the face.

1104
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,060
It's such a damn disgrace to the way you treat them

1105
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,200
when you squeak this,

1106
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,960
verbalize this.

1107
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:55,320
Said well stop abusing that substance abuser, my babe.

1108
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,640
Said well stop abusing that substance abuser, my babe.

1109
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,920
Because you keep them in the face.

1110
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,120
Don't move a bat.

1111
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:09,560
Say.

1112
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,380
Oh.

1113
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:11,440
Oh.

1114
00:56:33,520 --> 00:57:03,520


1115
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,000
I'm sick wearingعة bag and potato have a

1116
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,000


1117
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:24,120
You don't recognize these people?

1118
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:28,500
Yeah.

1119
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,460
Well, yeah, this you won't.

1120
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,440
Yeah, you won't.

1121
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:30,920
Like you said, don't abuse that substance abuser, my babe.

1122
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,560
Weie weie.

1123
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:12,980
gasoline all over them. Hey look at that cop, he's starting to smile. And it was like 10,000

1124
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:21,620
cops gathered around a teeny little bonfire that they said cost 10 million bucks. And

1125
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:29,120
it was like after a while they all started a screaming crazy mad.

1126
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:43,040
Chop down the weeds, put them in a pile. Pour gasoline all over them. Hey look at them

1127
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:53,820
cops, they're starting to smile. 10,000 gay macho leather dunking donut heads. Freaks

1128
00:58:53,820 --> 00:59:01,040
of bonds with their billy clubs out beating all the children. War on the people, war on

1129
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:01,540
the people.

1130
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,960
War!

1131
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:03,940
The people.

1132
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:03,940


1133
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:04,680
On the people.

1134
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:04,920
Trump!

1135
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,420
War on the people.

1136
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:07,100
War!

1137
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:07,960
On the people.

1138
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,200
Trump!

1139
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,560
War on the people.

1140
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:11,580
War!

1141
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,460
On the people.

1142
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:12,940
War!

1143
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,160
On the people.

1144
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:14,500
War!

1145
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:14,500


1146
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:14,500


1147
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,040
War!

1148
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:15,760
On the people.

1149
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:16,500
War!

1150
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,400
On the people.

1151
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:17,700
Trump!

1152
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,280
War!

1153
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:18,940
On the people.

1154
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:19,640
War!

1155
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,320
On the people.

1156
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,060
The Bushes.

1157
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:28,520
The president of the world's best, and you still find the time to make the nicest peccary

1158
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,780
pie in all of Longpump?

1159
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,540
Oh darling, I'll remember when the leaders of the fascists had their own woes and scribbles

1160
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:32,540


1161
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,900
in a problem used to put you right to sleep.

1162
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,940
Oh, not anymore, Madge.

1163
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,540
Today's modern, now-a-go-go woman

1164
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,880
just pops these simple little pills

1165
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,680
called Angadream.

1166
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,880
Swell demonstration, eh, Sarge?

1167
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:46,400
It's routine.

1168
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,900
Maybe, but if the chief ever caught me

1169
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,040
taking these pills, he'd snap my head off.

1170
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,660
Here, try one of mine.

1171
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,280
Oh, yeah?

1172
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,740
Yeah, the chief himself's been on these for a week.

1173
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,580
There's a change.

1174
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,200
And welcome, dear friends,

1175
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,360
to the Hour of Slack.

1176
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,060
Slack!

1177
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,140
Praise Bob!

1178
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:05,720
Good.

1179
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:06,960
Open your mouth, yeah?

1180
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,540
No, I don't like pills.

1181
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,580
It really does help take the trouble out of falling asleep.

1182
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,580
The haunting reality is

1183
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,180
that any one of these addicts,

1184
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,140
prostitutes, or runaways

1185
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,860
could be your child.

1186
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:25,860
There was me.

1187
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:27,980
That is Alex.

1188
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,760
And my three droogs.

1189
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,940
And their enemy.

1190
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,360
Is the God-centered family.

1191
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,520
An 18-year-old teenager named Diane,

1192
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,200
living here in Hollywood,

1193
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:39,440
took her life.

1194
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,420
She was under the influence of LSD.

1195
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,200
She had experimented with it

1196
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,900
as a result of peer pressure from her friends.

1197
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,320
This young lady had everything in the world to live for.

1198
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,280
She had just won a Grammy Award.

1199
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,340
She was signed for a television series.

1200
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,900
Today, drugs and alcohol

1201
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,340
have replaced drugs and alcohol.

1202
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,220
They have replaced baseball and football

1203
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,560
as the national pastimes.

1204
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,200
We are producing a country without a future.

1205
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,320
Any punk will tell you there is no future.

1206
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,640
They don't think about it.

1207
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
They wallow in just now operating.

1208
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,900
They only have the present.

1209
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,500
Mommy, where's Daddy?

1210
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,000
He's been gone for so long.

1211
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,220
Mommy, where's Daddy? He's been gone for so long.

1212
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:31,320
Mommy, where's Daddy? He's been gone for so long.

1213
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,020
Mommy, where's Daddy?

1214
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,460
Mommy, where's Daddy?

1215
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,660
Him!
