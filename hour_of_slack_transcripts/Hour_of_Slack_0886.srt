1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
It's true that I have pride.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,140
Hey, I never thought of that.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,100
Taste. Exceptional breeding.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,740
You're a sick and mangy, small, misery-laden animal wanting to die.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,960
I'm free!

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,620
No!

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,000
I am a retarded wimp.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,740
That is exactly what I wanted to hear from you.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,280
Kelsey?

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,180
Yes.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,660
Don't you shelves lie.

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,860
Everybody's afraid.

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:04,660
Everyone.

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,400
Dad, why?

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,800
People are afraid because they're sending a car over for me.

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,840
People are afraid because they're just about to cut into a cake.

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,680
You care to join us?

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,680
Why?

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,260
People are just about to cut into a cake because they're sending a car over for me.

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,300
Why?

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,680
Far too late, they ask themselves the question why.

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,700
And then it's too late.

24
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,140
Everything is too late.

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,640
Why?

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:29,980
I don't...

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


29
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,380
Why?

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,920
I mean, look at it this way.

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,940
In one cake, there are perhaps a thousand pieces.

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,260
Looking at it like that, I'm just about to cut into a cake.

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,560
Everyone I've talked to lately, they've been noticing it.

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,440
Noticing what?

35
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,920
That something's...

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,440
Something's in everyone, Dad.

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:48,720
Why?

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,800
This is silly, isn't it?

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,920
It's the eve of the beginning.

40
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:56,980
Right.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,260
They put in all these anti-terrorist things at school here.

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,620
Everybody has to be escorted.

43
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,380
Did you get the result on your DNA test?

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,600
Did they let you in once you got your DNA test scan?

45
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,140
Well, I used somebody else's sperm in the little receptacle.

46
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,240
They let me in.

47
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Yeah, it's an automated receptacle sort of thing.

48
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,320
For men, you just sort of stick your weenie in there.

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,520
It tests your DNA, but you have to give it a sample.

50
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,760
Yeah.

51
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:29,940
Sorry.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,820
It's kind of warm.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,280
For women, you have to stick your nipple, and they have a nipple one.

54
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,380
I thought they just spit into a little...

55
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,120
Hey, hey, hey.

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,420
The female breast...

57
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,240
She's playing music.

58
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,440
A female breast is nothing but an adapted sweat gland.

59
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,200
Adapted for what?

60
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,500
Adapted for feeding little baby, mewling, puking babies.

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,060
Sweating.

62
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,340
But it's a sweat gland.

63
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,200
It's a modified sweat gland.

64
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,380
That's what all the excitement is all about.

65
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,320
But what you...

66
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,420
But or not.

67
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,900
So I think even though they said on their press conference

68
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,340
that they have the most deformed and undersized genitals,

69
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,800
they said it was not a security issue,

70
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,240
that they were not...

71
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,720
They just felt that it was like piddly in light of the fact that

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
he would...

73
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,680
He has penis envy.

74
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,880
He has penis issues.

75
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,620
So if you get a penis that can fit through the male slot...

76
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,380
Something could potentially happen.

77
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,880
Just give these people their awards and let them go home.

78
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,000
I agree.

79
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
I agree with that.

80
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,460
But what you...

81
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,560
But or not.

82
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:46,100
How are we going to make sure that 372 deformed and undersized genitals

83
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,280
actually get to the airplanes?

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,180
Apparently those are being intercepted regardless.

85
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,980
Regardless.

86
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,700
Regardless.

87
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,580
By Reverend J.

88
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,100
J.

89
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,040
Cobblestone.

90
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,360
And of course,

91
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,960
the other collages that we'll be hearing throughout this show

92
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,340
are mostly done by the great Fernanda Nde Limur,

93
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,000
who did the ones at the beginning there.

94
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,380
Although El Queso All-Star does our opening music.

95
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,600
Friends, it's another war show.

96
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,340
I...

97
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,100
We...

98
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,120
It's...

99
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,560
Damn...

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,800
Well, you could say it was dedicated to Baghdad Bob,

101
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,900
the Iraqi information minister,

102
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,860
Mohammed Saeed.

103
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,940
Saeed Al-Shahaf.

104
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,680
But yes, the war kept not ending.

105
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,000
And well,

106
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,700
a girl was...

107
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:48,140
Some people were really upset when they saw that folks riding on that giant George Bush head.

108
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,960
Yeah, that's that robot head when they busted those people.

109
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,320
They were head surfing.

110
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,660
Yeah, through the square.

111
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,160
Head surfing.

112
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,540
That giant Bush robot.

113
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,240
And we're...

114
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,660
Yeah, head surfing.

115
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,320
I have launching.

116
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,720
They did a head launching.

117
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,160
I know.

118
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,480
It's like...

119
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,700
Yeah, but then they surfed on it.

120
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,820
We never did that before.

121
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,180
Yeah, I know.

122
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,860
You gotta hand it to the Iraqi people.

123
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,680
Once the chain was taken off,

124
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,980
once the bridle was removed,

125
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,680
the first thing they...

126
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,840
The first freaking thing they did was ran to the square

127
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,840
and grabbed the head and surfed...

128
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,720
And launched it.

129
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,060
And then surfed it.

130
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,440
Praise Bob.

131
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,000
Praise Arnold Palmer.

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,360
Praise Baghdad Bob.

133
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,260
Praise Sleetra B.

134
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,760
Praise Baghdad Bob.

135
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,320
Baghdad Bob.

136
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,020
Man, I...

137
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,500
Baghdad Bobby.

138
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,180
I...

139
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,740
When is he gonna show up on Fox TV?

140
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,200
I don't know.

141
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,600
He's already made numerous appearances on Baghdad Fox.

142
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,420
Baghdad Daddy Bob has.

143
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,460
He's a talking head now.

144
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,520
He's a second-guessing...

145
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,160
Baghdaddy-o-Bob.

146
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,180
He's a second-guessing general.

147
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,720
He's a jerkulating private.

148
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,800
He's almost...

149
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,260
No, no.

150
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,480
He was just some guy

151
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,680
that got to stand up in front of the camera every day.

152
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,640
No, he was the minister of information.

153
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,380
I know, but yeah.

155
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,500
He wasn't just a...

156
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,600
I mean, he was like a...

157
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,420
That was Bob too.

158
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,420
Minister of information.

159
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,700
Mohashman Habanishnani?

160
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,800
Mohashman Habanishnani.

161
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,420
Baghdad Bob.

162
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,300
Shahaf was...

163
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,300
The guy who sat there in front of TV cameras saying,

164
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,040
they are 100 miles away,

165
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,980
while the bomb was like the scud...

166
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,040
I mean, the cruise missile was sort of...

167
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,580
Shaz, calm down.

168
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,900
...coming in from over his shoulder.

169
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,920
They have the barbecue inside their tanks.

170
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,000
We are killing them.

171
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,260
We are smoking them.

172
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,860
Bob will smoke them.

173
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,160
I reckon it would be their graveyard.

174
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,160
There was tobacco in his pipe.

175
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,640
So I guess all the guys are coming home tomorrow, you guys.

176
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
We have pushed them out of the airport.

177
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,840
Yeah, right.

178
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,780
Those are not American tanks.

179
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,480
Those are American tanks behind me.

180
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,640
Those are our tanks.

181
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,400
We painted them.

182
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,420
Their special effects are very cute, but that's all it is.

183
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,640
This is all Hollywood effects.

184
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,460
They parachute in and take a few pictures, and then they go away.

185
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,440
Yes, but this page is going through the way.

186
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,660
This page will probably evaporate real quickly once the truth comes out

187
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,240
that three out of every seven of those people were photographers and press people.

188
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,780
I've terribly lost interest.

189
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,520
Did you know that?

190
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,080
It was even said on NBC.

191
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,280
Actually, I noticed that.

192
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,160
I mean, you know...

193
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,740
They circled him on NBC and said,

194
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,860
Well, it's not as spontaneous a demonstration as...

195
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,680
As you might think.

196
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,520
Well, yeah.

197
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,520
The head surfing was a crowd of photographers.

198
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,820
That was spontaneous.

199
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,440
Well, they were right in front of...

200
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,660
No, it was just regular guys surfing the head.

201
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,440
Yeah, that was just regular Joe Blows.

202
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,900
With photographers running all around it.

203
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,340
Of course.

204
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,880
Catching it.

205
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,640
Of course, wouldn't you?

206
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,000
It happened right in front of the hotel where all the press people were.

207
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,280
No, I saw it.

208
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:20,720
I witnessed it.

209
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,780
They shot that hotel first.

210
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,940
I witnessed it from before there was any civilians on the scene.

211
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,200
I turned on my Baghdad cam.

212
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,120
Yes.

213
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,260
Yes.

214
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,580
And there was the tanks.

215
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,120
And the guys were just rolling into that circle.

216
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,160
Then he called me.

217
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,760
And then about a dozen people came down the street waving a white flag on USA, USA.

218
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,840
And they went up to that statue, took their shoes off, and threw their shoes at the statue.

219
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,740
That's what I used to do.

220
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,380
Then more people started coming.

221
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,340
Then the press people who are all living in that hotel said,

222
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,360
Well, dig this shit.

223
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,020
And they all ran down.

224
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,360
Hey, everybody, grab your cameras.

225
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:58,680
Come on.

226
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,500
Something's going on down there.

227
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,520
That was the Tiananmen Square guy was the first one who ran down there and started doing that.

228
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,820
They have him for every one of these big.

229
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,720
He's the short.

230
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,660
That's Bob, isn't he?

231
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:07,820
Yeah.

232
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,560
The Tiananmen Square guy right now for this event was the guy just as the head.

233
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,360
Just as the.

234
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,460
Peppy, they call him sometimes.

235
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,400
The statue was coming down.

236
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,180
One guy jumped and tried to hit it.

237
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,160
Of course, he missed it by about 10 feet.

238
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,720
But his attempt was there.

239
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,700
And they used that still photograph a lot, I saw.

240
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,320
I think it's kind of.

241
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,560
Kind of a sideways event, boys.

242
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,040
I wouldn't get too excited.

243
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,700
You think it's pornography for our patriot pack?

244
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,440
I think the war had to end within X time.

245
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,320
So just like Afghanistan, they declared it one, even though it wasn't quite one yet.

246
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,000
Where is a shot him?

247
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,440
House pants.

248
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,440
Oh, I don't know that anybody's declaring anything.

249
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,220
Hey, go open.

250
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,900
Brain transplanted into a 500 foot tall robot.

251
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,980
Oh, oh, so that's what they thought they were attacking.

252
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,540
Those statues they were shooting, those things were robots that were fixing to be activated.

253
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,900
Just when.

254
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,200
The cavalry arrived in the nick of time.

255
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,620
Yeah.

256
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,960
To blow their gonads off, which is where the batteries are.

257
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,520
It's a good thing.

258
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,840
Cavalry was there.

259
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,220
Yeah.

260
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,460
Now, the battle is still going on.

261
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:10,880
You're right.

262
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,660
It's not over.

263
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,540
There are underground tunnels and, in fact, entire vast cavernous cities under Baghdad.

264
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,100
And Oscar Madison and Felix Unger down there arguing about their testicles.

265
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,640
They're like Flash Gordon underground Atlantis cities.

266
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,400
Is Barbaro down there?

267
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:28,520
Yeah.

268
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:28,520


269
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,060
They're robots.

270
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,300
They're robots.

271
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,300


272
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,300


273
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,300


274
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,300


275
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,300


276
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,300


277
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,300


278
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,300


279
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,300


280
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,300


281
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,300


282
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:38,640
The brain spliced dinosaurs are battling American saucermen and super R-secret weapons, which we can't discuss.

283
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,480
So that is still going on underground.

284
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,480
Now, I say all this to ensure disbelief on this college radio comedy hour.

285
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,000
Well, because you are hooked up with the big media.

286
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,860
I can say that kind of thing.

287
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,120
So you have been given your little piece of paper.

288
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,000
You know, Baghdad Bob and I have similar jobs.

289
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,100
We both are the PR flat for Big Scary Head.

290
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:06,840
I have suddenly lost amazing amounts of interest in the whole thing since Baghdad Bob has suddenly disappeared.

291
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,380
Well, that's what they intended to do.

292
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,360
I don't even care anymore now.

293
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,260
But it was a saturation point anyway.

294
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,400
He'll be back.

295
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:12,680
He'll be back.

296
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,440
I kept going on Reuters, the Reuters site, where you get the raw video footage.

297
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,280
Oh, Reuters.

298
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,080
Those guys have targets on their heads now.

299
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,340
There's no commentary.

300
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,940
It's just raw video clips.

301
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,600
Raw.

302
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,760
And they would always have him on every day.

303
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,360
His clip would be on there.

304
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,860
And it's not anymore.

305
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,740
It saddens me very much.

306
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,200
It's not.

307
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,300
It's not.

308
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:29,300


309
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:29,300


310
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:29,300


311
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,500
Baghdad Bob's going to head to Syria.

312
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,480
Okay, I'll admit it.

313
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,700
I was kind of falling for the guy.

314
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,300
Developing a relationship with him.

315
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,260
Yeah, I can tell that.

316
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,500
Long distance relationship.

317
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,560
He'll be a judge on American Idol next season.

318
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,120
I like kidding.

319
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:40,920
Oh, sorry.

320
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,660
My job's your job.

321
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,200
My job's yours.

322
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,440
My job's yours.

323
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,260
My job's your job.

324
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,860
My job's yours.

325
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,980
My job's yours.

326
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,520
My job's your job.

327
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,980
My job's yours.

328
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,260
My job's yours.

329
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,100
And the head is now launched, there it goes.

330
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,820
And the head is launched.

331
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,900
The people that lunged.

332
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,000
I love this.

333
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,780
Watch this.

334
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,780
The soldiers cannot stop the people from lunging on the head and surfing it right down the

335
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,280
little fairway there.

336
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,600
That's just precious.

337
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,180
And each one of those people had to sign a release.

338
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,740
I believe.

339
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,940
To be on this video.

340
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,260
They probably did.

341
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,780
I, blank, do solemnly swear that I will work for chicken and pizza for the rest of my life.

342
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:42,740
Well, the reason that the networks have so many people in that hotel is exactly because they wanted something like this to happen.

343
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,660
And this was all staged.

344
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,580
And now they were down there.

345
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:51,560
All the agents, the A&R people were down there going up to all these people that you see on the screen right there.

346
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,460
Can we tell your story?

347
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,440
Look at all the A&R men.

348
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,760
Will you sell us your story?

349
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,580
That's another thing that's circled on NBC.

350
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,820
Every four of those guys are actually A&R men from Hollywood.

351
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,760
They're all looking for scripts.

352
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,160
We want to bring together all the various lives here to this moment.

353
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,560
The head surfing in whatever square they're back at.

354
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,500
I show up at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

355
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,580
And I am looking.

356
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,060
And they are ready to make it.

357
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,660
Go ahead, lunch.

358
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,940
But I have to get back now.

359
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,540
This is like seeing the Berlin Wall come down.

360
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,040
I can be reached at this number in the day.

361
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,920
And after 7 p.m., you can get me here.

362
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,220
And at night, you can leave message on there.

363
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,740
It's like watching.

364
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,180
Watching the Reichstag fire be lit.

365
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,740
Yeah.

366
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,320
And then you say, gee, those are a bunch of commie terrorists.

367
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,800
Hey, that's Schicklgruber himself.

368
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:36,760
No.

369
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,260
No.

370
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,280
We believe everything, don't we?

371
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,520
I do.

372
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,640
I mean, I believe everything.

373
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,000
I believe that that just peaked out the CD.

374
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,240
Hey, what's this one, Dad?

375
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,760
Pretty silly.

376
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,140
You seem to forget.

377
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,100
There are some things in this world more important than people's feelings.

378
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,420
I'm sorry.

379
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,580
Yeah.

380
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,100
I was kind of creepy.

381
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,180
Well, I prayed for you, too.

382
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,460
See, Dad?

383
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,380
What can he do?

384
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,540
You see, as you grow older...

385
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,280
Maybe you should talk with Reverend Tucker.

386
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:11,940
What?

387
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,360
You come to realize that...

388
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,460
Maybe he could help you.

389
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,380
Hey, Dad.

390
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,100
I don't guess there's a father around anywhere who...

391
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,340
Whatever side your bread is butted on.

392
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:19,800
Okay, Dad.

393
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,560
Who doesn't?

394
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,260
Will you stay out of it?

395
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,520
Maybe you should go church more often.

396
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,220
Yeah.

397
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,020
Yeah?

398
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,800
He finds cameras everywhere, too.

399
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,620
Yeah.

400
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,280
Okay.

401
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,060
He doesn't even know he canhes yet.

402
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,780
There should be some –

403
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,420
Some.

404
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,380


405
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,100
Now that we're back here...

406
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,260
Mate, why are we even watching this show?

407
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:52,280
Oh, yeah.

408
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,280


409
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,280


410
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,280


411
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,280


412
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,220
Oh yeah.

413
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,660
Oh yeah.

414
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,380
Oh, yeah.

415
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,040
My mother goes like this.

416
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,920
My mother goes, are those names pig Latin?

417
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,260
And I yell, well, they're pig Latin.

418
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,460
Ouse.

419
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,500
You know, of course, that's how you say say backwards.

420
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,820
Oude and Couse.

421
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,080
Actually, I've noticed those names are spelled different.

422
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:17,820
Well, did you see they showed, again, go to the Reuters.com website and click on the raw video footage.

423
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,300
And they will show Oude's palace was raided.

424
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,900
And they pulled out all these.

425
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,800
I had my palace raided, too.

426
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,080
All these.

427
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:34,020
Basically, they were like these cheesy American pinup airbrush posters of chicks with dragons and stuff.

428
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,680
Like Boomhauer.

429
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,280
Like Boomhauer would have.

430
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,020
Exactly like freaking Boomhauer would have.

431
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,920
Like lizard women?

432
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,380
Exactly.

433
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,080
I am not kidding.

434
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,180
Can we get the Reuters?

435
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,280
Think what a tourist trap.

436
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,580
We're going to Reuters here and see if we can get Oude's palace here.

437
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,160
Uh-oh, what's happening?

438
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,140
Oude's palace.

439
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,840
I've heard.

440
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,020
I've heard.

441
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,500
After reconnoitering Oude's palace.

442
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,280
We're trying to get right into Oude's palace.

443
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,180
Like the Lord, he had many mansions.

444
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,820
And he also had a lot of rooms and a lot of hot tubbies.

445
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,480
Oh, wow.

446
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,340
Oude even has.

447
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,280
We're not allowed to look in Oude's palace.

448
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,020
He had a mint sauna.

449
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,800
He had all of the subgenius videos.

450
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,080
He had a rise.

451
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,020
In both versions of a rise.

452
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,140
The old one and the.

453
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,460
He used it as pornography amongst his.

454
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,800
He had like a harem of.

455
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,760
He was real into Bob.

456
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,000
42 babes.

457
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,980
The excuse document was framed in this fancy thing on his bedroom wall.

458
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,540
And the doctor.

459
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,600
Right next to his beret.

460
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,460
Signed by Bob.

461
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,200
And me.

462
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,360
And Philo.

463
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,680
His machete and his machine.

464
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,280
And his AK hanging there also.

465
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,560
Yeah.

466
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah.

467
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,240
Yeah.

468
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,700
He had all his subgenius stuff.

469
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,000
He had a little cap with the pretty squid thing on it.

470
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,760
You know.

471
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,600
He had recently bought stuff.

472
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,360
He was quite a party charger, wasn't he, too?

473
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,460
I mean, wasn't he quite Portuguese in the old days?

474
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,360
Didn't he like to vomit all over everybody and run around naked and stuff?

475
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,180
All right.

476
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,780
We got it.

477
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,320
Who was it?

478
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,020
That's the plasma again.

479
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:49,280
Huh?

480
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,740
Here we go.

481
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,160
We're going inside.

482
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,540
He was in the second dock stock in the 80s.

483
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,940
But he was only like 20.

484
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:53,640
You know.

485
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,340
He was really young then.

486
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:55,660
Well, yeah.

487
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,080
But he had the bomb hashed in him.

488
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,440
I mean.

489
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,780
Isn't that what it was said?

490
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,140
Okay.

491
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,340
Oh, can I go?

492
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Actually, all he cared about was getting drunk.

493
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,320
Oh, geez.

494
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,060
Typical Muslim.

495
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,360
You know.

496
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,300
You can smoke all you want.

497
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,340
Oh, I don't want to do that.

498
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,620
Right.

499
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:06,840
Right.

500
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,440
I want to get drunk because that's bad.

501
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:08,880
You know.

502
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,100
Right.

503
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,280
And then yet we can't.

504
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,540
We can't set our hair on fire or eyelashes or anything.

505
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,440
His dad did too much acid.

506
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,480
Oh, of course his dad did too much acid.

507
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,520
I was there in those first.

508
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:18,940
You see.

509
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,120
I'm a lot older than you think.

510
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,120
Those actually took place before me.

511
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,360
Wait, wait, wait.

512
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,520
Here.

513
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,680
I can't get the full screen version of it.

514
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,020
But wait.

515
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,180
Here.

516
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,080
We're looking inside of the.

517
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,200
The same acid was.

518
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,100
Hold on, folks.

519
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,320
Here.

520
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,660
It's really going for a lot of.

521
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
Bring your attention over to the screen here.

522
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,440
Now, there's the picture of Bob on the wall right there.

523
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,120
It looks like a little.

524
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,440
There's some nice little booths.

525
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,020
Like a little restaurant.

526
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:37,600
Like a chef frame excuse.

527
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,680
There seems to be.

528
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,660
Now, what the hell?

529
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,060
That's Lorraine Conversation.

530
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
Johnny Dromet was there from 25 years ago.

531
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,100
That's his blow up doll, isn't it?

532
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,560
There's the.

533
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,260
Oh, look.

534
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,660
It's the.

535
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,200
What's that boat in the flat?

536
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,120
Yeah.

537
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,220
That's the Good Time 4.

538
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,340
7.

539
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:52,700
7.

540
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,720
The 7.

541
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:53,960
7.

542
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,380
Good Time.

543
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,840
This is a darkened hallway.

544
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,820
It looks like a marini.

545
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,060
Jerkylating on a picture of Connie Dobbs.

546
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,820
That looks like the bathroom.

547
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,760
Many shower stalls.

548
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,340
Quite opulent.

549
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,040
Quite opulent.

550
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,220
Oh, that might be the morgue.

551
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,500
It's all white and gold.

552
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,900
I think that's.

553
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:05,940
Okay.

554
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,440
White and gold.

555
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,200
That's the defraying room.

556
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,100
I think they would sit there and shave their eyelashes.

557
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,220
There are many chairs.

558
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,120
Yeah.

559
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,500
Well, you got to have a lot of chairs.

560
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,300
If you're going to have.

561
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,640
What's this?

562
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,280
Looks like the knob of the yacht there.

563
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,120
This is all on the Reuters.com website.

564
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:20,800
This is.

565
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,820
Oh, is this some kind of nuclear.

566
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,440
Nuclear control?

567
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,020
No, this is Ude's yacht.

568
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,360
Look, he's stocking cocaine controls.

569
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,120
Oh, that controlled the marital aid.

570
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,800
What are those bags of white powder?

571
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,860
Looks like he's a cocaine addict or something.

572
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,200
And what is that lady?

573
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:32,840
That's his mom.

574
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,960
Why is she stealing the vegetables?

575
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,020
That's Sodom's wife.

576
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,460
There's all that stuff in there.

577
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,060
And this lady, woman is escaping with a box of what appeared to be vegetables.

578
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,040
Don't confuse yourself.

579
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,280
Oh, here.

580
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,100
Now, look, look, look.

581
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,440
It's a box of prophylactics.

582
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:44,640


583
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,620
Oh, look at the picture.

584
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,600
Ude, you hot playboy, you.

585
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,660
Oh.

586
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,240
Ude.

587
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,800
There's a woman riding a huge, like, tarantula.

588
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,000
A dinosaur.

589
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,180
She's all naked.

590
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,940
That's a Boris Vallejo picture.

591
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,560
Yeah.

592
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,840
It looks like the posters.

593
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,120
He's eating his fingers.

594
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,640
It looks like the posters in the pot stores in New York.

595
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,740
Ude was a Vallejo fan.

596
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:00,980
It is.

597
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,820
It's later day Frazetta.

598
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,960
I think that was.

599
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,440
Wow.

600
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,220
Frazetta, yes.

601
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,360
Poor man's Frank Frazetta.

602
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,100
The American soldiers are rather aghast at this.

603
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,640
Look at them.

604
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,520
I think they're just gassed.

605
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,340
I just noticed I knew the name of the painter of the cheesy crap that he had in his mouth.

606
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,080
Frank Frazetta.

607
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,820
Well, we all remember the name.

608
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,420
Boris Vallejo.

609
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,520
Oh, Boris Vallejo.

610
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:19,720
Yeah.

611
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,060
I vaguely remember.

612
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,780
You would have recognized him.

613
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,480
You would have recognized Frazetta.

614
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,880
Yeah, I only.

615
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,380
Unfortunately, I am a sci-fi geek.

616
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,960
Now, is it true that Ude Shlomi had his vagina reshaped to resemble a crescent moon?

617
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,420
Yeah, they do that there a lot.

618
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:33,820
They do?

619
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,660
They all do that.

620
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,600
That's like a phlebotomy or a clitorectomy or one of those.

621
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:38,880
You want to see mine?

622
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,360
Mine?

623
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:42,360


624
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,280


625
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,440
Mine?

626
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,080


627
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:46,600


628
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:46,960
Mine?

629
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,120
Mine?

630
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,160


631
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,460
Mine?

632
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:47,700
Mine?

633
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,180
Mine?

634
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,200
Mine?

635
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,340
Mine?

636
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:48,820


637
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:48,820


638
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:48,900
Mine?

639
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,140
Mine?

640
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,340
Mine?

641
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:50,680
Mine?

642
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:50,960
Mine?

643
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:50,960


644
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:50,960


645
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:50,960


646
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:50,960


647
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:50,960


648
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:50,960


649
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,580
Mine?

650
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,720
Mine?

651
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:52,860


652
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,100
Mine?

653
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,540
Mine?

654
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:53,840
Mine?

655
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,200
Mine?

656
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,440
Mine?

657
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,380
Mine?

658
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,520
Mine?

659
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:57,700
Mine?

660
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:57,840
Mine?

661
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,080
Mine?

662
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,040
Mine?

663
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,340
Mine?

664
00:18:59,860 --> 00:18:59,940
Mine?

665
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,880
Mine?

666
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:01,860
Mine?

667
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,620
Mine?

668
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:19,020
Bug, bug, bug, bugporn by Fernandanande Leemer and now, DJ John K in Chicago snz this amazing with

669
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,560
cut which he titled, fine, won't you?

670
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:21,560


671
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:21,560


672
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,120
Then, look.

673
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,340
Frank Sinatra live with the Taliban Orchestra.

674
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,740
Fly me to New York.

675
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,280
I've got a razor in my pocket.

676
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,700
You think you've flown before.

677
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,160
Wait till you lock in my plane.

678
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:46,920
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding my knife deep in the heart of you.

679
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,320
I'm round the bend.

680
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,880
And I'm mental.

681
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,520
And I'm flying the plane.

682
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,480
Let's fly, let's fly into buildings.

683
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,620
Let's turn to ashes, cause I'm dying.

684
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,660
On a jet plane, I know I won't be back again.

685
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,500
And now my skin is melting away.

686
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,020
DJ John Kay.

687
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,840
Now watch this.

688
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
They're going to take this.

689
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,960
They're going to take this tank right into the main driveway and park it right in between the fence.

690
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,020
And then they're just going to start broadcasting a message, which I don't know what it says.

691
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,180
There's something about fellatio or something.

692
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,260
These soldiers have been alone for a long time.

693
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,120
Some geniuses come out.

694
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,260
Dove's town has fallen.

695
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,040
Your Bob has fled.

696
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,040
He is a coward.

697
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,860
The head has been launched.

698
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,740
It looks like an evangelical church.

699
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,820
Look at this guy.

700
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,120
He comes over and says, this is residential.

701
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,700
That's my home over there.

702
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,220
Don't.

703
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,720
Shoot that.

704
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,140
Don't shoot that home.

705
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,480
You're sure that that's where this is.

706
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,820
Saddam Hussein is in that house.

707
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,200
Okay.

708
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,360
I borrowed my lawnmower and his son.

709
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,940
I'm saying this is too silly.

710
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,280
There was just a photo of an American G.I.

711
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,160
Son of a bitch.

712
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,620
Step down.

713
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,840
My petunias last month.

714
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,480
I saw them saying, shoot over there.

715
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,460
That building back there is a torture.

716
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,560
I mean, what?

717
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,340
That is a gorgeous torture.

718
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,220
Notice the whole headquarters.

719
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,600
Man, if I was going to be tortured, I'd want to be hauled in there.

720
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,120
Yeah.

721
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,520
I'd want to be tortured.

722
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,520


723
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,600
If I was going to be put in the stocks and have to have a humvee.

724
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,960
I thought that was your thing.

725
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,760
I'd shut up my urethra and be electrocuted down there.

726
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,420
I wonder how much it is to get that boombox attachment on your humvee now.

727
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:01,640
No.

728
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,020
No.

729
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,140
No.

730
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,080
No.

731
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,340
No.

732
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:04,640
No.

733
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,280
No.

734
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:05,760
No.

735
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,860
No.

736
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,040
No.

737
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,340
No.

738
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:08,780
No.

739
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,260
No.

740
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:09,560
No.

741
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,140
No.

742
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,440
No.

743
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:12,440


744
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:12,440


745
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:12,960
No.

746
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:12,960


747
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,020
No.

748
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:13,380


749
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:13,380


750
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,460
No.

751
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,720
No.

752
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,580
No.

753
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,440
No.

754
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,440
Uh huh.

755
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:26,480
No.

756
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:32,940


757
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,160
Nice.

758
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,120
Nice.

759
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,280
Nice.

760
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:48,140
Now only the driver asks you if she seeing the world outside, what you are and what the

761
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,560
You take her flowers and you tell her that you love her and she says you're gonna call her

762
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,960
She doesn't even bother, you sit around and wonder what the hell you did wrong

763
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,700
It really doesn't matter, because it's all for another man

764
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,800
You try and you try to make it alright

765
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,920
She just says you're not her type, but boys didn't learn a long time ago

766
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,420
You love that woman never that hard, so that's a nice guy

767
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,020
Always been this nice guy

768
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,520
Always been this nice guy

769
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,620
Always been this last, last, last, last, last

770
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,600
Damn

771
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,340
Well, preachers, preachers, so that you gotta be good

772
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,740
And follow our rules like we said you should

773
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,120
And we try and we try to be an understand

774
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,880
But they'll stab you in the back and they'll take it so they can't

775
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,960
It feels like crime

776
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,200
It feels so huge

777
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,280
Wh

778
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,840
you

779
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:44,780
Now you see that evil will always Bryon

780
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,820
Because good is dumb.

781
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,400
The Pink Boys.

782
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,460
But I did see some footage where...

783
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,500
Yeah, but it looks cool.

784
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,720
An armor of...

785
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,780
Where these guys were going down this road,

786
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,080
and this one car came screaming up from behind.

787
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,640
And they tried to tell him to slow down, back it down,

788
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,500
and he just kept coming.

789
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,620
And they didn't have any choice.

790
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,880
And they had footage of this on CBS News,

791
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,480
and it was rather disturbing.

792
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,900
My toes are curling now.

793
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,860
Yeah, just end the thing.

794
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,960
My nose is curling.

795
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,940
I don't need this car.

796
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,480
This car just came screaming up, man.

797
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,340
And he's, like, coming right up to this tank.

798
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,360
Just barreling up right to it.

799
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,660
Well, now, people from various different countries over there,

800
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,680
it's like, oh, great, there's some Americans around.

801
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,260
Now I can finally go throw myself against their weapons.

802
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,280
Like the Spanish Civil War.

803
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,760
And go to heaven.

804
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,460
Yes, it's a cause for living.

805
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,800
Well, that's exactly what happened.

806
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,440
Well, apparently, you know, I guess...

807
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,220
Well, there's two ways to look at it.

808
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,420
How come you guys are talking in the past tense

809
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,060
just because the TV said,

810
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,040
and it's only the American people?

811
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,560
Are we?

812
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,380
I'm not.

813
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,420
Well, I'm talking about an event that happened.

814
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,320
It's because we're brainwashed.

815
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,420
We are brainwashed.

816
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,140
Because I watch it, and I feel the same way,

817
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,220
and yet I read those things, and they don't make sense,

818
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,480
and then you hear the guys talking,

819
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,240
and it doesn't make sense,

820
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,040
and then they say,

821
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,080
however, all the four guys were killed today over there.

822
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,100
Now, the gods in Washington say,

823
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,600
oh, it's going to get much worse.

824
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,560
You ain't seen nothing yet.

825
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,480
Oh, it's going to be still some hard times.

826
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,040
I think...

827
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,700
Chilling coming.

828
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,480
I think they want to keep on expanding their,

829
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,920
what you call it, time, you know,

830
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
when you have to send your...

831
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,020
Well, I guarantee...

832
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,080
I guarantee you they're going to hang a left

833
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,240
and go into Syria next.

834
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,740
What do they call the ratings, the Nielsen's?

835
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,020
They have to expand their Nielsen's.

836
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,680
The Nielsen's are coming soon.

837
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,740
I mean...

838
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,500
All you can do is eat a hunk of chocolate.

839
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,060
I'll go for that.

840
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,920
I'll second that.

841
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,820
So you got to have a fluff.

842
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,540
You got to have a fluff in the software.

843
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,660
You got to have a slowdown or a pause,

844
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,320
just like a pause in the Bosch wing,

845
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,840
and then you start up again.

846
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,100
Well, there's trouble in Iraq again.

847
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,100
Only this time it's spasm.

848
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,020
I'll see you next time.

849
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,020
I'll see you next time.

850
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,440
Islamic Jihad

851
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,960
I just want to kill for God

852
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,260
Praising Allah is the life for me

853
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,560
I'll use pipe bombs, what the fuck

854
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,140
Killing Hebrews brings good luck

855
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,400
Gotta make Khomeini proud of me

856
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,480
Load a car with dynamite

857
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,940
And drive it to a synagogue

858
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Without any brakes

859
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,440
Nothing could be better than

860
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,040
Impaling your intestines on a big rusty stake

861
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,240
Pack grenades and cattle prods

862
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,300
Let's go out and kill for God

863
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,600
I can hear Mohammed calling me

864
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,940
Yowza, yowza, yowza

865
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,680
PD punk

866
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,940
And some pas de toutes

867
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:57,940


868
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:57,940


869
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:57,940


870
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:57,940


871
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:57,940


872
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,200
Yowza got your rights

873
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,200


874
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,200


875
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,420
hoo de Да

876
00:28:59,420 --> 00:28:59,980
I was seemingly seen

877
00:28:59,980 --> 00:28:59,980


878
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,740
Show up at the dealer oh

879
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,960
I'm in it

880
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,120
I'm dead

881
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,040
из

882
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,480
Say is that a crucifix

883
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,900
or you just planned to see me?

884
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,760
Ah, looks like it sucks.

885
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,140
Firing up the old bulldozer.

886
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,140
Though the

887
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,520
Corinth seems quite odd,

888
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,600
I still want to

889
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,980
kill for God.

890
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,800
Praising Jesus

891
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,240
is the life for me.

892
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,080
Fuck those pagans, they're such

893
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,760
cynics. Let's bomb

894
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,120
the abortion clinic.

895
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
Jesse Helms,

896
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,320
he is my cup of tea.

897
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,240
Never thought I'd make it big by selling God

898
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,780
to idiots on cable

899
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,440
TV.

900
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,800
What the fuck, it's not

901
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,880
cheap, but still a better way to

902
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,700
use my business degree.

903
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,780
Use a rifle, spare

904
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,880
the rod. Let's

905
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,780
go out and kill for

906
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,320
God. Baby Jesus,

907
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,360
pass my

908
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,680
AKG.

909
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:44,980
Snack!

910
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:08,100
There seems to be people

911
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,100


912
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,100


913
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,100


914
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,100


915
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,100


916
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,100


917
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,460
trust

918
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,120
anyone more.

919
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,960
Fucks

920
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,660
don't

921
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:11,680
fuck

922
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,120
the

923
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,180
people

924
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,180


925
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,180


926
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,180


927
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,220
Go to

928
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,220


929
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,220


930
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,960
club or

931
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:12,960


932
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:07,880
ate

933
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,980
No more just skin and bones

934
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,920
Master Skinny comes home

935
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:30,140
Master Skinny comes home

936
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:41,300
Your show is me, me, me, me, me

937
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,700
Swallow her all

938
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,940
Start it, start it

939
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:54,480
Change a good woman

940
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,720
But it ain't no use

941
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,340
It ain't no use

942
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,520
It ain't no use

943
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,220
It ain't no use

944
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,540
It ain't no use

945
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:41,280
It ain't no use

946
00:32:53,260 --> 00:33:09,680
It ain't no use

947
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,920
It ain't no use

948
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,260
It ain't no use

949
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:41,280
It ain't no use

950
00:34:41,300 --> 00:35:11,280
It ain't no use

951
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:41,280
It ain't no use

952
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,740
It ain't no use

953
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:41,280
It ain't no use

954
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,340
It ain't no use

955
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:41,240
It ain't no use

956
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:11,280
It ain't no use

957
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:41,280
It ain't no use

958
00:38:41,300 --> 00:39:11,160
It ain't no use

959
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:40,780
It ain't no use

960
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,660
It ain't no use

961
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,780
It ain't no use

962
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,760
Cmon

963
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,100
I did it, and so have almost a half-million people using only their current income.

964
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,100
Of course, if we look back to what happened in

965
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,000
Dockstown

966
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,720
nonprofit. It's true, isn't it?

967
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,860
Would you please wash me,

968
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,880
cleanse me, upon me, on me,

969
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,620
before me, my

970
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,700
you, my bones, my

971
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,220
heart!

972
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,320
Hence a heat-seeking head.

973
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,700
I have been

974
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,960
to the dark side. I have seen a world

975
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,880
that no man should see. Really, for

976
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,280
most people, it was a rather pleasant experience.

977
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,360
I'm going to place him in an

978
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,300
easily escapable situation involving

979
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,420
an overly elaborate and exotic death.

980
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,000
Kick his luscious grapefruit

981
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,240
head all the way through the back of his

982
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,060
poopy drawers.

983
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,880
Then put him in the dumpster.

984
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,240
Drive him all the way to the landfill.

985
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,680
Bob-fine!

986
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,780
Bob-fine!

987
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,940
Bob-fine!

988
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,860
Bob-fine!

989
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,840
Get that pipe out of my head!

990
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:08,740
So have you been to

991
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,900
I think the website of the week

992
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,040
is www.

993
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,940
www.

994
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,860
www.

995
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,900
www.

996
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,380
welovetheinformationminister.com

997
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,440
www.

998
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,200
www.

999
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,200


1000
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,200


1001
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,200


1002
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,200


1003
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,200


1004
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,200


1005
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,200


1006
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,200


1007
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,200


1008
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,200


1009
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,200


1010
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,200


1011
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,920
I would like to inform you now

1012
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,160
that you are far from reality.

1013
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,320
You don't like...

1014
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,320
Hey, listen, I heard some

1015
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,960
bad news about him.

1016
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,360
He was blown up or something?

1017
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,080
No, the Iranian newspapers

1018
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,020
were reporting, not Iraqi,

1019
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,560
Iranian newspapers

1020
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,660
were reporting that he hung himself.

1021
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,980
That Baghdad

1022
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,800
by Mohammed Saeed Al-Shahaf

1023
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,180
had hung himself.

1024
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,680
Well, that's what the military said.

1025
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,420
There's too many testicles for that.

1026
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,880
No, no, he just wants us to think

1027
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,760
that he hung himself.

1028
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,580
His new nickname was

1029
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,000
Comical Ali.

1030
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,900
I think he just made a joke that he was well hung

1031
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,380
and someone took it seriously.

1032
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,320
Maybe.

1033
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,540
Because I think of all the people so far

1034
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,520
who are showing their true bells,

1035
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
George Bush, no.

1036
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,580
Saddam Hussein, no.

1037
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,940
Houdin and Ankuday, no.

1038
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,160
Cheney, no.

1039
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,780
Tommy Franks, no.

1040
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,020
But what's his name?

1041
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,460
He's showing his emasculation.

1042
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,060
He's a man.

1043
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,480
Baghdad Bar.

1044
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,740
So does Schmegma.

1045
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,980
So does Schmegma.

1046
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,720
That's not part of it.

1047
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,520
He spoke for that giant head.

1048
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,300
That giant scary head

1049
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,740
that was never there, Baghdad Bob.

1050
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,300
You know, I got to think.

1051
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,340
You had a bad dream, didn't you?

1052
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,120
Was there ever a Saddam Hussein?

1053
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:49,760
Maybe there was.

1054
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,240
Just a big scary head like the Wizard of Oz.

1055
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,740
Baghdad Bob was the little man behind the curtain.

1056
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,180
Can I ask a fishy question, you guys?

1057
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,480
Having fun because you smoked weed?

1058
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,880
Lose your parents,

1059
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,300
you can kiss your parents goodbye.

1060
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,220
Trust the drug.

1061
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,280
Brandy.

1062
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,280
Sponsored by the Office for a Drug-Free America.

1063
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,700
As a nation, we wage war on any front.

1064
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,040
We can attack in spite of our excellent defenses.

1065
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,600
Attacks may be made in many ways,

1066
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,520
with bombs

1067
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,080
or with biological weapons.

1068
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,360
Biological warfare?

1069
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,500
What do they expect me to do about it?

1070
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,120
Government regulations assure the purity of specially designed germ-carrying bombs containing

1071
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,240
disease germs.

1072
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:57,060
The public health nurse can destroy food crops, just as weed killer can destroy the many other

1073
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,780
members of our public health systems.

1074
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,700
The biological warfare attack may have taken place.

1075
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,060
If such an announcement is made in your country, you will be in trouble.

1076
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:05,440
There is a threat of a war in your city.

1077
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,760
Just give way to fear.

1078
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,400
Scientists would immediately cause the disease.

1079
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:16,160
Boil or cook all exposed toxins to remove livestock and people.

1080
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,020
Our health and medical systems are the foundations of our biological warfare.

1081
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,580
A nationwide network of federal, state and local agencies and experts.

1082
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,040
If we attack with biological warfare, we will cause a war.

1083
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,040


1084
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,580
This is a very important message.

1085
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:35,580


1086
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,400
So, what is the reaction of the health and medical authorities?

1087
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,720
They will tell you what to do, so that the disease could cooperate with the authorities.

1088
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,200
Stop it, damn you.

1089
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:47,540
Ah.

1090
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,040
Ah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

1091
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,940
Well, I think it's very strange what's happened.

1092
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,920
We're still having casualties.

1093
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,660
Now it's everybody cleaning their gun.

1094
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,560
Did you hear that part?

1095
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,140
No.

1096
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:57,860
Yeah, it's cool.

1097
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,740
Well, you know, every day that somebody gets killed again, but only this time it's because

1098
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,400
they accidentally dropped a grenade on their foot or were cleaning their gun backwards.

1099
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,000
Keep it in mind.

1100
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,180
So it's all like a Big Warner Brothers cartoon of the war.

1101
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,700
The war had to end on X day so the rest of the guys wouldn't get combat reparations.

1102
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:17,340
You know, if you died by shooting yourself, your wife doesn't get no money.

1103
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,100
However, if an Iraqi shot you, your wife gets some money.

1104
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,720
So I guess they were trying to save money.

1105
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,340
Do you think that's possibly true?

1106
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,780
I heard whisperings about that.

1107
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,660
Is that true?

1108
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,820
I don't either.

1109
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,060
There's so much propaganda going around.

1110
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,760
Propaganda from both sides.

1111
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,420
Only Baghdad Bob spoke the truth.

1112
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,760
Only Baghdad Bob spoke the truth.

1113
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,160
I like Baghdad Bob.

1114
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,200
He was a wild, crazy guy, wasn't he?

1115
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,580
I mean, he was just so much personality.

1116
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:43,980
This is for you, Baghdad Bob.

1117
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,740
This song is for you.

1118
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,180
Yes.

1119
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,440
We love you.

1120
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,720
Where's my lighter?

1121
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,620
We will never, ever give up.

1122
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:53,900
Why?

1123
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,380
Because I have a dream.

1124
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,100
But you people in the front row, move back two steps.

1125
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,740
I can't hear the question.

1126
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,800
Dare to dream, Baghdad Bob.

1127
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:04,740
Dare to dream.

1128
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,160
Dare to dream.

1129
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,700
To roast their bellies in hell.

1130
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,200
God will help us do this somehow.

1131
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,240
I'm not afraid.

1132
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,140
My dream is that...

1133
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:13,900
He's not afraid.

1134
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,440
I'm gonna taste the sweetness.

1135
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,880
He's gonna taste the sweetness of those 34 virgins.

1136
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,060
It's not 34.

1137
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,060
Oh, that's the Al-Qaeda.

1138
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,620
No, no, that's the wrong number of virgins.

1139
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,420
I mean, what are you gonna do with 34?

1140
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,400
You know, that's not even half how many you're gonna get.

1141
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,220
The subgeniuses get, uh, get...

1142
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,020
Get the sex goddess virgins with 23 vaginas.

1143
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:38,920
Wow.

1144
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,760
The problem is...

1145
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,880
Dare to dream, Baghdad Bob.

1146
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,840
You're only given 20...

1147
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,040
You're given 24 packers.

1148
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:48,680
Wow.

1149
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,620
To deal with 48 vaginas?

1150
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,500
There are 23 vaginas, but there are 24 packers.

1151
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,560
So you're always doomed to frustration on some level.

1152
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,380
Well, I...

1153
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,680
Now, I think that Baghdad Bob was a setup all the way.

1154
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,180
I think there is a conspiracy going on there with Baghdad Bob.

1155
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:05,000
Because of this.

1156
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,060
Everybody and their 14th cousin, the Saddam Hussein,

1157
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,660
ended up on that deck of cards.

1158
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,220
But Baghdad Bob was not one of the 50...

1159
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:16,780
Well, he was not.

1160
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,180
He was not a chemical oligarch.

1161
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,880
He was more like a videotape mold.

1162
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:20,540
Of the death card.

1163
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,620
He was like a video mold.

1164
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,440
They're all playing those cards around a fancy cafe table in Syria right now,

1165
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:32,660
which gives us a perfect excuse to get rid of the rest of this excess ordinance

1166
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,660
while they're over there.

1167
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,860
And let's move on.

1168
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,620
It costs too much to have to ship it home.

1169
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:36,980
Next, Tehran.

1170
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,140
Next, Morocco.

1171
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:38,860
Algeria.

1172
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,280
Switzerland.

1173
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:39,620
France.

1174
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:40,720
Switzerland, man.

1175
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,240
That's where all the buckage is.

1176
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,060
I got the song for you, if I can find it here.

1177
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,160
It's called, War is Good.

1178
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,640
First the oil, then the gold, then the blood, then the pipes.

1179
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,960
All of the pipes.

1180
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,940
It would be all of them.

1181
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,260
I don't like that.

1182
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:53,940
All right.

1183
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,780
How much longer are you going to make everybody suffer with these bad jokes that even wear

1184
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,080
songs?

1185
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,180
They're not jokes or songs, pal.

1186
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,100
You're hallucinating.

1187
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,020
Did she just hear me get all the time?

1188
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,300
Yeah, you don't even have the radio on you.

1189
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:03,640
This is the only time I'm going to get the radio on you.

1190
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,000
You dumbass.

1191
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,200
This is a psychiatric reflex show.

1192
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,580
Your radio isn't even on you, moron.

1193
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,240
Don't you get it?

1194
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,960
These are all voices in your freaking head.

1195
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,000
These are voices in your head, man.

1196
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,540
You're insane.

1197
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,800
You're completely insane.

1198
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,420
You haven't even realized it yet.

1199
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,560
Jesus Christ.

1200
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,000
That is so sad, isn't it?

1201
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,360
Yeah.

1202
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,100
I mean, it just makes you want to weep.

1203
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,900
You just called up your brain.

1204
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,060
You called your own cerebral cortex, pal.

1205
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,500
You know, your synapses are firing right back in through the phone now, and what do you

1206
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,640
have to say to your brain?

1207
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,080
It's all echoey in there, isn't it?

1208
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,180
It's because it's big and hollow.

1209
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,640
And how dare you diss Olivia Newton-John, man?

1210
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,280
Sucks.

1211
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,960
She's the hottest artist to ever come out of America.

1212
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,440
And you've always known it somehow.

1213
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,000
I'm soaking in Olivia.

1214
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,200
Oh, shut up and smoke your brain.

1215
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,880
Plug it in and go insane.

1216
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,380
Fry your mind on color and sound.

1217
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:03,620
That's it.

1218
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,400
And pull it out and burn it down

1219
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,200
Three hits of Sid and I'm doing alright

1220
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,720
So what if the world's too sight

1221
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,520
Blue sounds great and green tastes fine

1222
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,920
I don't care if I'm losing my mind

1223
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,940
Shut up friend and smoke your brain

1224
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,540
Who really cares if you're going insane

1225
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,340
Four hits of Sid and I'm doing alright

1226
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,500
If the cops don't show we'll party all night

1227
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,420
Smash everything, put holes in the wall

1228
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,340
Five hits of Sid and we're having a ball

1229
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,360
Shut up bud and smoke your brain

1230
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,340
Who really cares the world's insane

1231
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,680
Sounds taste fine and yellow smells great

1232
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,880
Jump on board before it's too late

1233
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,220
So shut up friend and smoke your brain

1234
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,360
Who really cares if you're going insane

1235
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,000
Three hits of Sid and I'm doing alright

1236
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,200
Four hits of Sid and I'm doing alright

1237
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,120
I'm burning down, burning down

1238
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,720
I'm burning down

1239
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,800
So now that Iraq is going to be a free country

1240
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,320
What are they going to do?

1241
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:33,320


1242
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:38,740
What are they going to do for the Olympics and stuff like that?

1243
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,640
They're going to have 25 different teams.

1244
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,460
They're going to be there and all that?

1245
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,480
One will be by the United States.

1246
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,120
Will there be a Kurdish team, a Kurdish Iraqi, a Shia team?

1247
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,420
A Squirtish team, a team of squids.

1248
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,100
The Squirtish team.

1249
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,160
The Squirtish team.

1250
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,720
And those are the slippery ones.

1251
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,080
That's why it's good that the javelin and the discus and the shot put.

1252
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,300
Here's number one on the list.

1253
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:07,740
It looks like Fezman Agad Al-Faribi is getting ready to pass out in the hangman's ditch somewhere.

1254
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:14,120
But as he mounts the prize, boy, what a mighty trophy that is to him.

1255
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,140
They paid someone to compose this.

1256
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:23,700
The 2024 Baghdad Olympics will be right back after this.

1257
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,500
What's going to happen to the Iraqi Olympics now?

1258
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,740
Well, the voices are just keep on in their heads.

1259
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,140
Did they bomb the Olympic facilities?

1260
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,280
Well, look.

1261
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,160
Why do you think there are so many voices in their heads?

1262
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,840
They're imagining burnout wreckage everywhere.

1263
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,080
There's another guy that thinks he's listening to the radio.

1264
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:37,880
Another one.

1265
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,480
I may be insane, at least I ain't homo.

1266
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,180
That's not an admission.

1267
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,380
I don't know what it is.

1268
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,680
I don't know the best one.

1269
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,600
That's a sig, man.

1270
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,940
That's totally sig.

1271
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:52,760
That's definitely sig.

1272
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,360
Dude.

1273
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,020
Sigmund Freud, you know what I'm saying?

1274
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:55,460
Dude, man.

1275
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,740
That's definitely a Freudian slip if I ever...

1276
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,080
No.

1277
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,000
Come on, dude.

1278
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,280
That couldn't have been more.

1279
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:00,860
That's more obvious.

1280
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,700
Instead of like the pleasure of young boys...

1281
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,220
You're sitting there right now with a butt plug in, aren't you?

1282
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,460
Come on.

1283
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,600
Oh, that's a little bit too cultured for that man.

1284
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,440
A butt plug?

1285
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:09,860
Come on.

1286
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,280
You have to buy those at a store.

1287
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:11,960
There are...

1288
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,780
No, you can't.

1289
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,020
You can get Jules...

1290
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,360
He's using a banana from last week that's been in his fridge.

1291
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,700
He's been using a banana that somebody else gave him because he looked sick.

1292
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,920
He is sick.

1293
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,520
He really is.

1294
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,520
He knows it now.

1295
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:25,720
Hey, can you go...

1296
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,820
It kind of makes me want one of those bananas.

1297
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,020
Can you go look for a little boy for him, me?

1298
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:29,520
Yeah.

1299
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,240
Yeah.

1300
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,320
Sure, Jupiter.

1301
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,600
Oh, yes, yes.

1302
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,580
I'm insensitive.

1303
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,300
I'm a very insensitive man.

1304
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,540
Stop your job.

1305
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,040
Look at the insensitive man.

1306
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,640
That's what they're paying you for.

1307
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,920
I warn you, sir, an erection is a flagpole on your grave.

1308
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,100
When the three planets are in eclipse,

1309
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,500
the black hole like a door is open.

1310
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,660
Evil comes, spreading terror and chaos.

1311
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,320
See the snake, Billy?

1312
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,640
The ultimate evil.

1313
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,740
Tonight's night of the Easter vigil where we all get together

1314
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,280
and wait for...

1315
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,500
For the bunny rabbit to come back and suck our necks.

1316
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,260
The bunny rabbit.

1317
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,880
Tonight is the night that we nail the baby's foreskin to the door.

1318
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,420
So, to keep God away.

1319
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,320
To keep God away.

1320
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:09,880
Yes.

1321
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,220
Because just letting the days...

1322
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,840
And why do you think they call a pass out?

1323
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,980
Did you hear the story about that wonderful story about the people who were duct taping their children off?

1324
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:17,700
That was cool.

1325
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,920
That's a very good idea if you want to save the little moms or monsters from distress.

1326
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:25,520
Now, did you hear about the two dungeons full of guys,

1327
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:29,380
the prisoners who had been buried alive and bricked in?

1328
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,280
Sex prisoners.

1329
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:30,760
That is an arse.

1330
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:31,560
Ooty, ooty.

1331
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,120
No.

1332
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,760
Yeah.

1333
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,860
Were they his love queens?

1334
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,800
These people had been, you know...

1335
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,900
Just marginal humans?

1336
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,480
Oh.

1337
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,740
These prisons had these underground chambers that there were still people down there.

1338
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,220
Yeah.

1339
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,880
At first, in one place, I think they didn't believe them.

1340
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,360
But then eventually...

1341
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,160
They still didn't believe them.

1342
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,940
There were a couple of places where these prisons were full of emaciated guys

1343
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,240
who had been left in there, down there in the dark, bricked in.

1344
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,600
To die.

1345
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,900
And I guess probably a bunch of them did.

1346
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,160
There were some grisly tales that went with that.

1347
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,020
Well, we're bound to do that with cable TV.

1348
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:12,200
They had to eat each other's arms to stay alive.

1349
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,940
Well, we'll truck them in McDonald's so they don't have to do that.

1350
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,760
But we'll still have the same little places under the ground where you go...

1351
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,420
All right, guard.

1352
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,340
Begin the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism.

1353
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,680
I like animals.

1354
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,220
Maybe I'd be a vet.

1355
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:29,980
An evil vet?

1356
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:30,820
No.

1357
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,060
Maybe like work in a petting zoo.

1358
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,340
An evil petting zoo?

1359
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:35,940
You always do that!

1360
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,460
Life, which you shall not only serve, comes from destruction, disorder, and chaos.

1361
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,900
Maybe there is life after death.

1362
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,600
Life after death is as improbable as sex after marriage.

1363
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,880
To die.

1364
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,940
To be really dead.

1365
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,400
That must be glorious.

1366
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,340
Get busy living.

1367
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,460
Or get busy dying.

1368
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,160
That's goddamn right.

1369
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,580
Good night.

1370
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:13,240
Tonight, friends, the collages included a lot of bits from Reverend Inkpay Ispay

1371
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:19,060
and a lot of chunks from Fernandanande Lemur.

1372
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,820
And that's why you want to take it nice and easy when you...

1373
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,580
How many?

1374
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,240
How many?

1375
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:28,500


1376
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:28,800


1377
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:29,200
How many?

1378
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,220


1379
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,220


1380
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,220


1381
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,220


1382
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,220


1383
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,220


1384
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,220


1385
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,220


1386
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,220


1387
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:29,660
You're...

1388
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,260
What?

1389
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:41,120
Very soon, the Lord's gonna be coming back.

1390
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:42,660
Oh, really?

1391
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,680
As if he hadn't had enough the first 2,000 times.

1392
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,260
I've heard that.

1393
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,320
I've heard it in bad dreams, brother man.

1394
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:55,020
I've heard it in some strange whisperings in my midnight ear.

1395
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,400
Don't burn it too much.

1396
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,500
Soon.

1397
00:55:59,340 --> 00:55:59,860
Soon.

1398
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,160
Soon.

1399
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,100
Well...

1400
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,840
In an hour that you know not...

1401
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,540
He shall come...

1402
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,400
It's not for man to know the hour...

1403
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,700
We don't know why you listened tonight, but you didn't.

1404
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,640
Your radio was never on.

1405
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,940
The voices you heard don't exist.

1406
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,800
The voices are in your ovi.

1407
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,380
I was not here.

1408
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,900
Till next week, keep your head on tight.

1409
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,540
Back to the wind, you're sat in the saddle.

1410
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:27,780
I don't stand.

1411
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,720
Princess Weed.

1412
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,480
Los Cabo Dave.

1413
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,220
Here's Trish.

1414
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,280
I'm not the princess.

1415
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:37,180
I have my own sheets with the sham occasions of my own existence.

1416
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,540
Medicine of the lived in your body is the best of high time.

1417
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,800
First thing with buds to meditate your mind.

1418
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,940
Green harvest and the president just can't get enough.

1419
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,220
And next year, we'll see you at the cannabis club.

1420
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,420
She's so so nice.

1421
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,640
She's so so nice.

1422
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,540
She's so so nice.

1423
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,580
She's so so nice.

1424
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,600
She's so so nice.

1425
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,280
He said.

1426
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,840
gram.

1427
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,720
And.

1428
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:07,720


1429
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,040
We got it.

1430
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:14,040


1431
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:14,800
We open up.

1432
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,760
It's just for good luck.

1433
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,360
We wet someowi.

1434
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,700
Make some of it.

1435
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:32,020
Off the magic track, on at your party

1436
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,220
If it's all natural, put it in your body

1437
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,500
Cheeks will be there, so will Bob Marley

1438
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,440
Chums on the pony, rolling on a high

1439
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,340
Off the magic track, nothing but the gas

1440
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,020
All I need, it's a

1441
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,920
Sit right back on this big ass couch

1442
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,660
Share this job with you again

1443
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:57,240
The time, 420, roll fat, not skinny

1444
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,540
Heat up the house, smoke coming out the chimney

1445
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,780
From Maui to Humboldt, we got it going on

1446
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,920
From India to Africa, to the break of dawn

1447
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,100
I deliver the girl with really nice diggers

1448
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,200
And smoke up the kayak and reggae on the river

1449
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:35,180
I deliver the girl with really nice diggers

1450
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,660
Email me, stag, at subgenius.com

1451
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:07,960
Or write to us at post office box 204-206-Austin, Texas 78720

1452
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,240
Praise the Lord

1453
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,560
God bless you, thank you, God bless you

1454
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,820
And I look forward to working with you all next week

1455
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:33,800
Has Ayubanyo

1456
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,680
My fifth child
