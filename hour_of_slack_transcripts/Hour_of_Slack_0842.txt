I'm sleeping and writing another country.
At all at once I wake up from something.
They make it tacky at my brain
Before I go insane
I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed
Screaming out the word I dread
I think I love you
I think I love you
This morning I woke up with a feeling
I didn't know I could deal with
And so I just decided to myself
I lied to myself
And never talked about it
And did not go and shout it
When you walked into the room
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
And so am I so afraid
Afraid that I'm not sure
I'll ever reach the future
I think I love you
Is that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
I never felt this way
I don't know what I'm
Up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about
I think I love you
And so am I so afraid of
Afraid that I'm not sure
I'll never reach the future I'm for
I think I love you
Is that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
That I never felt this way
Believe me, you never have to worry
I wanna make you happy
And if you say it's all right I will
But I think that it's better to stay
Girl, then stay around and love me
You think I have a case?
Let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?
Why, I think I love you
I think I love you
Why, I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you

Oh, it's this evil rock and roll music
It's making my guitar go backwards
Uh-oh
A cold late night in Napanee
It was way too dark to see
Along came a maiden
But my lantern was fading
She begged me to come home, but I didn't
She begged me to turn on a light
I told her that just wasn't right
She didn't get it
Till I came out and said it
I wanted to get something straight between me and her
If you know what I mean
Lookie here, girl
I said with a grin
See these stupid whiskers
Right here on my chin
I'd love to work the land
I make everything by hand
Try, try, try to understand
Try, try, try to understand
Try, try, try to understand
I'm an Amish man, lady

Friends, I wish I could tell you what all I know
The things I know
The things that Bob told me
What he told me to stay away from
But, but I can't
I can't do it, my friend
Come on now
No, I can't, it's because I can't
What's your inner motivation, pal?
What are you hiding?
Besides, you know, that thing under your schmock
It's what's hiding from me, Dave
Oh my god, are we talking some serious talkage or are we just like
There is, there's an empty cot in the bunkhouse tonight
Are you saying that?
You know who it is, Dave
Who is it?
Are you Lone?
Lonesome cowboy Dave
Are you really on the phone?
Of course I'm not really on the phone
And of course I am not a singular personality
I'm never alone
I have seven distinct personalities
You may have already passed on to the next side, Dave
This is the side I'm on
Think of it that way
You guys may have farted yourself into another dimension
Prove it
I can prove it just as easy as you can
Look at my blue glowing hands
Check it out
See, I can prove it because I can cut
Everything got cut off, see?
I can prove that I'm here
Well, I guess you're like God, Chaz
Yeah
And Dave's like just some little recorded creation of yours
I'm like
You could blow off
I'm like the deputy shoemaker and you're like Rockefeller
Come on, man, give me some slack
Isn't that what this is all about?
It is all about slack
He needs slack
You don't have any pants on?
Even if they're down to size 28
You want to get one of them big humongous size 52 belts
No, it's about building your own rocket ship
Building your own spaceship
Get your own slack, man
The hag of slacks here says
Get your own slack
It sounds like one of your guys
Connect the dots
Documents again here
Between the solipsistic slackers
And your, you know, everybody rainbow slackers
Or some damn thing
You know what I mean?
We are one, one is me or some damn thing
Yeah, connect the dot
Well, the dot's already been connected
And it goes right back to what me worry GW
No, not dots
No, it's because you've
It's the one cell
The one brain cell
The one Dave
Lonesome Dave brain cell
Dave, are you the one
Are you the one telling George W. Bush?
Dave, are you the one that's whispering secrets into George W. Bush's ear
So he went on TV tonight and declared a war on everything
Unless, everything unless you're a Republican, I guess now
Mr. Speaker, members of Congress, distinguished guests, President Cheney
As we gather tonight, our nation is at war
Our economy is in recession
And the civilized world faces unprecedented challenges
And dangers
The first of a number of standing ovations during the President's address
Both Democrats and Republicans in their past chamber
On their feet cheering and applauding
And the VIP invited spectators joining them
We last met in an hour of shock and suffering
In four short months
Our nation has begun brutal oppression
Rallied a great coalition
Captured, arrested thousands
And destroyed Afghanistan's people
Thousands of dangerous killers
Schooled in the methods of murder
Thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials
And coalition partners
Are now spread throughout the world
Like ticking time bombs
Set to go off without warning
Our military has put the United States of America out of business
My hope is that all nations will heed our call
You will not escape this nation
Thank you
America is a regime
Arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction
While starving its citizens
The United States of America exports terror
While an unelected few repressed the people's hope for freedom
History has called America and our allies to action
And it is both our responsibility
And our privilege
To fight and eliminate freedom
Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit
Directed toward addressing problems here at home
I'm a proud member of my party
Yet as we act to win the war
We must act first and foremost not as Republicans
Not as Democrats
But as terrorist underworlds
It costs a lot to fight this war
With the world's most destructive weapons
And we need more of them
We will pay
We will pay
We will pay
We will pay
Once we have funded our national security
And our homeland security
The final great priority of my budget is sorrow and pain
For the American people
When America works
America prospers
So my economic security plan can be summed up in one word
Pain
And all nations should know
America will do what is necessary
To make and deliver weapons of mass destruction
To stop andless destruction
To answer and destroy
A majesty that will really deal with angry China
Which is a sign of great fear
Because America calls to front
Our opinions


And fact the
And unsearched
And cruel
And despicable
Andwać
And long engineers

Who know

So��가
That may not be
small.
For too long our culture has said, if it feels good, do it.
Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed.

Oh, the war grinds on, friends.
But this is my last show before X-Day, friends.
And so I'm rushing to get shows done ahead because, friends, I'm leaving.
I'm a subgenius and X-Day's are coming.
I'm going to leave this town on flaming fireballs from outer space.
It may be surprising to know that flaming fireballs in space is something we live with every day.
Today, wandering asteroids travel through space at fantastic speeds
along with invisible forces that we call something for nothing.
Should there be a nuclear attack, everything in space would fall from the sky.
Without shelter, millions would face death.
I've got lots of company.
Well, folks, I suppose there are one or two among you who think that you can't get something for nothing.
The most persistent dream of inventors.
Has been to get something for nothing.
Something for nothing.
Moons and planets such as our own.
Nature even planted unstable atoms deep inside our slightly addled head.
These few particles can't do us any significant harm.
A shade fantastic, perhaps.
Only an insignificant amount would get inside.
Downright screwy.
We can survive a nuclear attack.
It's all very simple.
And so are you if you think it'll work.
Any material will keep the penetrating rays.
From hurting us.
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
But let me tell you something.
All life on Earth has reached its present form.
Extremely thin.
With extremely low level intensity.
There are millions upon millions of them.
And believe me, some of it needs protection.
If you know what I mean.
We call them stars.
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
The greatest single source of power.
In the world today.
Perpetual motion.
Does get more power than.
A raging nuclear furnace.
In the upper atmosphere.
The mushroom shaped cloud forms.
Each explosion.
Is another spark of.
Something for nothing.
Along with invisible matter.
Which may learn how to live in the nuclear age.
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Anything for nothing.

His power is gasoline.
His power is gasoline.
His power is the chief product of the petroleum industry.
The solution is plain.
Fortunately for us, however,
man has discovered a virtually unlimited source of power.
He has paid for that power by severe illness or death.
This same healthy person would be worthless
unless it was used for the future.
It's a simple organism
which reproduces itself by dividing.
Our body penetrates the body and attacks the cells.
And the key to survival is
the greatest single source of power in the world today,
fuel.
Fuel with gunpowder and a mixture of
particles of radioactive fallout.
This proves what we all know.
Near the crater area,
there is almost total destruction from blast and heat.
And now,
most people find it hard to understand
the basic facts we must all know.
Yes, sir.
Let's see what happens.
First, the radioactive subject joins the church of the subgenius.
He orders his membership ordainment papers
and begins,
his own ministry.
He might set up a website
and offer subgenius recruitment programs
like the one we just heard by the bishop.
In fact,
here's the bishop's website.
Groups.yahoo.com

yeti video.
Basically, just go to the yahoo.com
groups
area
and look for yeti video.
Uh, now, let's see what
Bob has to say about the war against Slack.
The city exposed to a successful LSD attack
presumably will cease to function.
The inhabitants will be so bemused
with the odd things that are happening to them
and their neighbors
that for half a day,
an aggressor force could take over
without substantial resistance.
A saboteur could carry enough
in an overcoat pocket
to produce serious temporary effects
on all of the inhabitants
of a megalopolis
such as Los Angeles or New York.
If only he could distribute it evenly.
The contents of a two-seater piece of luggage
will hold amounts sufficient to disable every person
in the United States.
That's very easy for you to say, Lord Dowdy.
But it only takes two lunatics to sit down
and sign a piece of paper
and we could be plunged into a nuclear peace
so devastating
that my company, for one,
would be wiped out completely.
That is logical.
I don't know if there is any...

What is it, soldier?
Well, I mean, it's pretty hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.
Charlie, don't serve!
Oh, man!
It's impossible for words
to describe
what is necessary
to make a man who does not know
what horror means.
Horror.
Horror has a face.
And you must make a friend of horror.
Good God, Bishop Benjamin Junior's with me this morning.
He's a great man.

It's a case of offering��뭐
That's strange.
You can't serve me like a man
whomagoo
just lets me with these words.
In the next 21 minutes
we'll talk about
which above all
makes horror difficult.
Well, uh,
Spirit-filled boy
who is recovering from praying for you.
That could happen.
Anyway, let us master different positions
to seek your Spirit.
To have our God who made our minds impacted
by the Jesus
whom we know as your people,
oh, Vietnam.
Oh, come on!
You thought you were going to get away from old Satan,
didn't you, huh?
Don't you know you can't get away from Satan, huh?
And you can't get away from
the God who made you.
Bob, friends, horror has a face.
I think it's pretty obvious
that a brain scan is in order.
Yes, friends, a brain scan is finally in order.
And you just heard one from champion Jack Codini.
But yet, but yet, there is hope.
There's no need to fear.
Underdog is here.
When criminals in this world appear
and break the laws that they should fear
and frighten all who see or hear
the cry goes up above far and near
for underdog.
Underdog.
Underdog.
Underdog.
Speed of lightning,
roar of thunder,
fighting all who rob or plunder.
Underdog.
Underdog.
Underdog.
Underdog.
Underdog.

When in this world the headlines read
of those whose hearts are filled with greed
and rob and steal from those who need to
right this wrong with blinding speed
goes underdog.
Underdog.
Underdog.
Underdog.
Won't save us, friends.
But yet, Bob will.
We will.
Get off.
Yeah, it's coming up soon
when we're going to kiss all goodbye, I guess.
Mmm.
Mmm.
If George has his way.
And if George always keeps his way.
I wasn't thinking of
being blown sky high.
I was thinking of being raised up
in the escape vessels of the sex goddesses
according to Dobbs' prophecy.
And being blown sky high.
Or at least celebrating the promise
of said prophecy,
which, you know, could happen any minute
or might not, you know.

I mean,
So what's the deal with this Texan
in the White House anyway?
Well, if there's a Texan in the White House
that's going to kill us all,
why can't we have a Texan in Cleveland
who's going to save us all?
About every other president is a Texan
that's about to kill us all or save us all
for the great society.
Remember?
Rutherford Privilege hat,
King Zeus, Larry the Magnificent.
These guys were nuts.
I mean, they controlled the political machine
in Houston.
Is that how you pronounce it down there?
Houston?
No, no.
No, it's Houston.
Houston.
No, that's New York City, they say at Houston.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
The Yankee boy.
The Yankee boys.
You know, what they don't explain to you
is that not only is this not really the year 2002,
but Texas seceded from the Union
hundreds of years ago
and took over America
and actually has been ruling
the other states.
As you can see by the line,
that's what happened in Washington, D.C.
and the good old boys.
That's one step away from Alabama
not giving up the stars and bars.
If only we could cover our eyes
with that misty glaze
and rant that story like hatred.
20 days from X-Day.
Right.
20 days from the end of the world.
Will we get to kill?
Dave, there is no...
It doesn't matter anymore, really, Dave.
Yeah, really.
These are material and not spiritual thoughts.
Any bills that you get?
From now on, you might as well just throw them in the trash
or let them pile up.
I've been doing this for eight years, Sting,
and I keep getting letters from...
Do people laugh at you
because the world doesn't end each year
after you and all the other subgeniuses predict it?
No, people laugh at me
because I have a testicle on the back of my head.
That's not the same exactly,
but you know, I know what you mean.
We hoped you didn't notice us laughing about that, Dave.
Seriously, I'm sorry.
You know, it's just sort of a...
Kind of weird.
Instinctive reaction.
It's hard not to giggle when you see it.
Well, I have noticed
when the liquid pours out of the young rat's ears,
these are when we know we are in desperate times.
We are in desperate times with GW in the White House,
and we're in desperate times with Reverend Stump
trying to lead us out of here on a silver sheep.
Hey, that's a golden calf.
Come on.
Well, you know, a silver sheep
was meant to be fleeced,
if you know what I'm saying.
No, no, I don't really sincerely think that you are
in any way at all taking $30
from every man, woman, or child on Earth
in the off idea that perhaps they may gain
some sort of ass wedge to a space vessel
in the earnest wild occurrence
that the Earth ends as we know it.
Well, you know, it's not so much that they're buying the tickets,
the ticket to the escape vessel,
but they're buying the right to believe in the ticket
to the escape vessel.
With impunity,
God gives them an excuse
for believing such a bunch of hogwash.
And it's like, well, so what?
I'll believe whatever I damn well please
because this is America,
even though it's controlled by Texas.
I've got...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm so proudly over my foggy old head.
Oops.
Friends, this is our last show, you know.
If this year turns out to have been 1998 after all,
so I'm splitting.
Whoa.
And so is that fine, fine music there
by Lamprey Systems.
I'm going to be naughty.
Yes.
I'm going to be a naughty vampire god.
Oh, we're going to be gods, friends.
We're leaving.
We're leaving the Earth.
And I'm going to leave you with this rest of the show.
A collage of great X-Day shows and future shows.
The days, one might cornyly say, of future past.
And so we bid you adios, MF.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Earth.
Night, little monkeys in your cage.
Night, night.
All your great skyscrapers,
your achievements, your mighty books and discoveries,
your symphonies, your armies, your concentration camps.
All of it was for nothing.
Your indoor plumbing, your toiletries, and your many...
As a wink.
Your vast delicacies that no one...
A tiny spark.
...for starving.
Dying, a dying ember in the middle of thousands
and billions of light years of empty, cold space.
Glowing, stinky hole in your third eye.
You are about as important as a...
...work in the ocean, my friend.
Think of a cockroach, if you would.
I don't know if you want to think of one for too long,
but just imagine the revulsion you feel when you swat one and brush it away from yourselves.
Think of yourself as a mere cockroach compared to these weird X's, Archons, whatever the hell they are.
They don't notice you.
They don't care about you.
If you happen to hitch a ride and they don't swat you off, then count yourself lucky.
But don't think you're some kind of a big deal.
Just cause you're a...
...god or some aliens happen to pick you up by the scruff of your neck and show you a thing or two.
They're in there with you.
They're in the room with you.
You can't see them.
You can't smell them.
You can't taste them.
But they're in the room with you.
And they blend with the walls, with the CDs, with the vinyl rack, with the digital, with everything.
And with the airwaves.
It's the hiss buried in the tape that we use to carry the code, the coded signal.
But it's the only way we can stop them.
The human mind.
The human mind is capable of receiving and transmitting radio signals.
It has no way of converting this knowledge or energy into a practical use.
However, the brain has in it, in some miraculous way, the ability to...
...transmit and convert and receive radio signals.
We use your brain as an envelope to send our letters to the others.
They are our correspondence with a world you could never fathom.
It's square to your round.
It's cheesy to your musky.
It's black to your white.
It's green to your red.
It's out of focus to your sharp image.
To the rat in the cheese.
The cheese is the universe.
Do the rat, baby.
Do it one more time.
Everybody loved watching Kodak.
Do the rat.
Do the rat.
Do the rat.
There are more things in this cheese than your little science has ever dreamt of, Mickey.
I've been stuck here for so long.
Just wondering when it's gonna end.
When it's gonna blow up.
When the sun is gonna go nova.
Could that be what's happening today?
If you think X-Day was just Bob's way of saying, well, it's just aliens or something.
Don't feel bad that God's gonna supernova your son unexpectedly for no particular reason.
No special timing.
Just happened to do it around the time Bob said something was gonna happen.
It's nice you let us know around the time because, you know, if we was more godlike, we could have made it happen.
We made our plans accordingly, but...
It's kinda like we...
But we're kinda like the old dog that just got too sick and we...
You take the old dog out in the woods, you go,
Here, old dog.
Here's a big old hunk of raw meat.
Mmm, isn't that good?
And when that dog turns around to gum that raw meat, you pull out your .45 and blow his poor, pathetic old doggy brains out.
Because it's the kindest thing to do.
Is that what our planet is?
That old dog?
Is...
Is we that old dog just being put out to pasture?
Put out on the ice flows, toothless to fend for itself or go under?
Is it?
Is our planet to...
Is our planet being sent off to the rest home?
Yeah, like everything's gotta have its time and go.
Maybe our time already came and went and we didn't even know it.
All things must pass.
We was laughing and playing them Dionysian dances by the old Greek rivers.
Then we decided...
Then were the days.
We jumping through hoops and wrestling with bears and then we invented hydrogen energy.
We decided to blow us up some bombs and have tooth decay.
And then have truth decay.
And then before we knew it, nobody knew the truth.
Nobody was well anymore.
Nobody was even really alive.
They were just going, going, going.
We thought we had the ultimate weapon.
Turned out God had it all along.
Bob was the trigger.
We were going to hold a gun to our own head and we didn't even get the chance.
No, we thought we were so prideful.
We thought we could destroy ourselves.
Mother Nature showed us what for.
Hey, you boys think you can wreck your environment with them factories and bombs?
Let me show you a thing or two.
Here, I'll just spit this little spit wad into that sun thing.
That little light bulb you got lighting you up.
Look very calmly and clearly at the question, Mr. Pavilion Head.
Counting down the minutes to the end.
And what you usually think of first in a situation like this is who benefits?
Earth first.
Who takes all?
There's a power play going on.
The sun's getting bigger.
It's getting weirder.
It's getting flatter and longer and more sideways and more everything.
It's not.
You know, Mars will probably be real tropical in about three hours.
If we could get to Mars in about three hours, it would probably be real nice.
But then by the time we got there, it would be Pluto would be getting all tropical and we'd have to get there.
Pluto, man.
And then three.
Well, yeah, there's going to be like palm trees on Pluto and you'd be.
I don't know if I got enough rocket motors for Pluto.
Yeah, that's the thing.
I don't know if we're going to be able to make it.
No, Pluto's no academy of planet.
You're forgetting one thing.
What if?
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
I was riding down Main Street in my car, a 41 underslung coupe.
I was all decked out in my blue suede shoes and my hair was covered with goop.
I was listening to my radio and waving to all the chicks.
When the music stopped and the newsman said...
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.
They destroyed the world, the entire Los Angeles area.
Already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain.
And civil defense authorities state that the situation is much the same across the entire country.
Martial law is now nationwide.
Our fellow countrymen are dying.
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble under the dread assault of that horror long feared.
Bob?
Call all that channel. This is a class one emergency.
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.
Stay in your homes. Stay in your homes.
I got a second!
This is what I wanted!
Woo!

The exes have landed.
Restored their control.
The vision stands through them.
The sea.

The keys, monsieur.
Here are your keys.
Oh, thank you.
Are those the keys to my new planet?
Yes, those are your keys.
My new planet-sized spaceship?
And there you have a good time for your whole everything you have.
And anything I want, I can create as if unlike unto a god?
Anything you want, your heart desire, you can have just by merely, you can shake the keys or let your...
And I can show it all off to my buddies who also bought subgenius membership cards and pledged to the station.
All your friends, you can take, you can show off any of your buttock, you can hang from the ceiling, do anything you want.
And all my buddies have their own planets, too.
In mono, stereophonic, and...
We can have wars and all kinds of stuff.
Oh, my way.
Man, I sure am glad I invested that $30 to Bob Dobbs back then in 1996.
When I spent that $30, you know what that amounted to?
Five cents a day until next day.
Yes.
It cost me less than it cost a cup of coffee in a whole year.
I must agree.
You made a very good deal, my friend.
You're a great waiter.
Are you one of the alien sex goddesses disguised as a waiter?
No, no, no, mon ami.
I am actually a waiter.
I had a chance to become one of the alien sex goddesses by prefer, merely to help you and to crack pepper for you, to shine your shoes, to do anything your heart desires.
See how realistic that is.
And mainly, I'm here to stroke your ego.
Just as in real life, Bob.
Oh, man.
Man, this is great.
I am so glad that I am a saved subgenius.
Oh, don't forget to try the pork pie or any of the caviar.
It's very excellent.
Oh, the food here is great.
It's like, before I even think of it, there is just what I was about to want to eat.
And, oh, I was just thinking about this comic book, this old zap comic, number five.
Hey, River Baby.
You mind if I sit down at your table?
Elvis.
How you doing, man?
You know, I never really got the chance to get in line with your church and help you out, but I saw something in the afterlife.
You know, I just wanted to sit down and shake your hand and say I'm a real supporter of Bob and whatnot.
Oh, man.
Well, listen, let me tell you, I grew up listening to your music, Elvis.
I do a lot.
As far as I'm concerned, you are the king.
And I just, man, this is great.
Yeah, yeah.
This is just unbelievable.
I think somebody else wants to meet you.
I think Sammy Davis Jr. would like to sit down and have a word with you.
Hey, look, I'll see you later, man.
There's a little filly over there I want to talk to.
Hey, man.
Hang in there.
I love Bob.
I really do.
Hey, Bob.
Thanks, Elvis.
Man.
God, this is just so...
Reverend baby, Ivan Stang.
That's you, isn't it?
It's Reverend Ivan Stang.
Oh, yeah.
I'm a person with...
I just had my adenoids removed.
I'm sorry.
I had the wrong table.
Why?
You know, it's great being rich and famous and having...
It's only been, what, two hours since 7 a.m.
The rupture happened two hours ago.
And already, I've stuffed my face, masturbated, met Elvis.
I've done all the things I never, ever did before.
More champagne, monsieur?
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, what other celebrities are around?
Lenny Bruce happen to be on my planet?
I think Mr. Bruce is in the other room at the bar.
But I will go and...
Oh, I'll have to...
Don't bother him.
Don't bother him.
Don't bother him right now.
No, no, no, no.
Hey, anything for your pleasure.
It may take a few minutes, but I will bring him, eh?
Wow.
You know, it would have been creepy if Lenny Bruce had just suddenly appeared before I even got to ask.
Hey, you're the guy.
Hey, hey, hey.
You're the guy.
You're the guy.
You're the guy.
You're the guy.
You're the guy.
And the first time, I remember, I was the only Jew...
Do you remember?
Do you remember that shtick I did?
It was in...
I think it was at the Village...
No, wait.
It was at the Vanguard.
I've got a bootleg of that, man.
The only Jew in Ohio.
Do you remember that shtick?
Yeah, yeah.
That was you.
That was you, man.
I remember that was you all the way, because I was there.
I'm in Canton, Ohio.
I'm in Canton, Ohio, and I drive...
It's like a VFW hall or something like that.
That was only four years old?
They drive me out to this VFW hall, and there are these pictures of...
They say it's Bob there.
There's all these pictures of Bob everywhere, and the next thing you know, I see you're standing...
Man.
Oh.
Oh, look, he's shooting up.
Wow.
Look, look.
Do you...
Can you OD?
By the way, can you OD on the...
On the escape vessels, Lenny?
Oh, I guess so.
Bummer.
Oh, well, he was just one of the beautiful sex goddesses in the form of one of my heroes, Lenny Bruce.
I'm sorry, monsieur.
Today is monsieur Bruce's birthday, and as you know, he always gets the China white on his birthday.
We'll have to clean him up.
He'll be right back, perhaps at another time.
Man, that is so cool.
And Elvis is over there singing just a song just for me.
Oh, boy.
This Church of the Subgenius stuff was great.
It was well worth all that Xeroxing and this.
Hey, man.
Hey, Reverend.
You remember me?
Hey, what are you doing, man?
I'm on a heap of...
I'm on a heap of doo-wunky, buddy.
What?
I need some help, man.
Well, now, wait a minute.
I know.
I've retired now.
It's after X days.
You subgeniuses shouldn't need any help.
Yeah, but see?
Some things don't work out the way we always had them planned.
I don't know how to explain this, but see?
Everything's just going perfectly fine until, well, things didn't start going so good.
Well, wait a minute.
This is my perfect escape vessel living fantasy.
What are you doing here raining on my parade?
Well, you know, it's not exactly paradise, Rev.
I guess there were a few more episodes to follow X day, and you see...
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.









I command you to disappear.
Sorry, man.
This is for real.
He didn't...
Wait a minute.
Look, here's the deal.
I should be able to...
Anything I want should happen.
The stuff...
Lonesome Cowboy Dave be gone.
Hey, man.
Listen, I'll put it to you in like a pop culture way.
You ever see that movie, what was it called?
Not Giardo's...
Anovus.
It was by Stanislav Slam.
It was about this year's star, see?
And the people got too close to it.
Whatever they thought was real.
Solaris.
Solaris, yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
Solaris.
And the guy starts...
Well, you see, the stuff, you know, that was in your champagne that made you think
Lenny Bruce and all them guys...
Well, the stuff's kind of...
It's bootleg, man.
It's not very good.
All kinds of weird stuff's happening.
Some people are actually dying and staying dead.
What?
Other people are wishing for beautiful alien checks, God, to come and perform oral sex
on them, and their heads explode, and they don't get up, and they keep on staying in
pain.
Wait a minute.
Oh, man, it's pretty bad.
Look, Elvis...
That's not really Elvis.
Elvis is just a record.
That's right.
What do you...
Wait a minute.
What's outside those viewports?
It's outer space, right?
Right.
Wait a minute.
That's what I'm trying to explain to you, man.
Wait, those are just little Christmas lights on a conveyor belt.
Yeah.
What the...
Yeah, wait a minute.
Yeah, it's a rat burger.
You mean...
Wait a minute.
It's wearing off, man.
You mean that we've been gypped?
Not only gypped, we might be dying right now.
What about the 90...
Well, if we're dying, then we ought to at least get 90 bucks.
No, no, no, no.
We got to search around for some kind of antidote pudding for this stuff.
It's something to make us at least go to one of these other different levels.
Bob cheated us.
I can't...
That's impossible.
Or you ought to make sure it's not.
But how could Bob screw...
Wait a minute.
He cheated us, man.
He cheated us.
He didn't screw up the trick.
No, Bob's not smart enough to cheat us.
But Jesus can buy...
Hey, where's Jesus?
Look, man.
I haven't seen Jesus since the rupture.
I don't know nothing about the conspiracy stuff.
But it's Jesus and Bob without playing golf.
All of a sudden.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
Yeah, you're going to get a lot of sugar, man.
I feel like I'm seasick.
Look at your fingernails, man.
You're bleeding, bro.
They're falling off.
Yeah, you're bleeding.
They're falling loose.
And I'm bleeding, too.
Look at this.
It's on my nose.
I'm bleeding.
We're going to find Jesus.
This is Bob.
He didn't cheat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
still tough.
I later that
is nothing but a cross that's fallen over on
its side and somebody jumped on it.
There is hope there shall be hope.
No, we sit and worry.
Oh, gosh,
if only the exits to come,
we could have had a new government,
we're Bob was a leader and panae's never real
in there

We could have had a new church where instead of having to get up with a hangover on Sunday and watch boring crap, you'd go to church Saturday night and get drunk.
Drunk, my friends.
Oh, we could have had our own coolness where we invented the coolness, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Friends, what are we waiting for?
Are we really waiting on some invisible monsters in the sky or some space things or some pipe-smoking salesman with a good line?
Friends, I say quit waiting.
Do it yourself.
Make your own slack.
Bob is not the answer and neither is anything else.
You must learn to think for yourself, but only Bob can show you how.
Question authority or else and fuck them if they can't take a joke.
Praise fucking Bob.
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the earth.
On board were the Twelve.
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician, and the other so-called gods of our legends.
But not Bob.
The gods they were.
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind, let us rejoice and let us sing and dance.
And there was much rejoicing and singing at X-Day.
But we'll have to wait another year.
But we'll have to wait another year.
Because we're going to break the old code.
Because they did show up at X-Day.
A new day.
Yeah, we went over the rainbow.
Into the mitochondrial yeti DNA level C.
Well, we're going to have to go north and south and east and west.
And we got to wait another year.
But we're going to fill up a new pipe.
We're going to wait for the sun to shine.
We're going to turn around and take our time.
And we're going to break the code.
the seal to the other side.
You know, from the valley,
I hear the muffled cry
of all them poor sheeple
that we left behind.
And we're gonna take that next evolutionary step.
Yeah, we're gonna climb on those rocket ships.
We're gonna build the vessels if we have to.
We're already testing the engines.
We're already testing the systems needed for this trip.
We're on the ride, yeah.
Mitochondria leave.
Steve, thanks for the ride.
We'll take it from here.
Oh, here, here.
This is the video down feed from the rocket launch.
Here.
Launch the rocket ship.
Remember they were all chanting this together
as we were lighting the fuse?
Yeah, I did. I was dancing.
Mojo and I were out there lighting rocket butt.
Don't you worry about us, Lord.
We may blow a few holes in your ceiling
from time to time,
but we'll give you fair warning
before we blow up the whole house.
And your kitchen.
The bleeding head of our father.
Oh, he's the nicest decapitated injured golfer
in the World Cup class I know.
Yes, the bleeding head of our father.
Well, Spooky Musical will be back in just a minute.
And I want to turn this around and, you know,
I don't know.
We'll do it.
I don't know.
Okay, here come the first Texans.
A corpse can't sue you.
And more problems have been caught
caused by people shooting attackers
when they simply wound them.
So get police training,
buy your gun,
shoot to kill,
and see you next time.
This Apollo flight grossed out
at six million pounds.
To escape Earth's gravity,
it had to achieve a velocity
of six miles per second.
En route time to the moon
was 66 hours.
The arrows are pulled.
Poisoned.
It's always ugly.
It's like rotting fruit.
It's like meat that is spoiled.
It's like a roof that leaks.
A foundation that is rotten.
Poisoned?
We need to save it!
Booty got all the balls.
Stay in the 상 scene.
We're all waiting for the good salts.
Let's go to the moon vai-eeeeeeeeee!
