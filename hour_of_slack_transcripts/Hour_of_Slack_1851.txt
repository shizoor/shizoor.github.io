Bob, Bob, love you.
Bob, Bob, love you.
Bob, Bob, love you.
Light your prop eyes up and test it back.
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.
Praise Bob, Bob, and Connie's rack.
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.
All bow before the great metal lord.
Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage.
We're all here tonight to praise Bob.
He's kind of shown us that Devo works in parallel ways with other pockets of humans on this planet.
Where we thought we were alone, we know there are now other human forms that believe in God.
And we know that Bob is a conscious mutation.
As he knows, Bob is merely an enema for a constipated society.
These people here are here to help a constipated society blow it out their ass.
Have you ever met Bob?
Well, like I said, Bob would appear in my bedroom and chase me around, making me do jumping jacks.
He's got food.
I know what you do.
Cause I do it too.
Intelligence.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Intelligence.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Am I as smart as I think?
Probably not.
That's good.
Daily disease cannot feel pain.
Daily disease cannot feel pain.
He said that just because I make a speech, that's because I have money.


I'm glass..

Well, you were right.
It's the best I have ever heard.
I can see that through words.

held on August 10th in Cleveland.
The third annual one organized by several old subgeniuses and fellow Devo fans.
Reverend Toth Wilder, Reverend Scott Orsi, the good Blinker Boy at AOL.com,
and help from Steve Sinek.
Friends, it's just been great.
Because I love the Devos.
We have a lot in common, the church and the Devos.
We're both owned by Bob.
We were both controlled by Bob completely for quite a long time.
And we both share a philosophy.
We don't always have the same kind of music, but sometimes we do.
We always have the philosophy.
A special philosophy, a little different, depending on which cult you're talking about.
But it is a philosophy for the different.
You know, in pamphlet number one...
What the hell?
There's Herb Alpert here in the background.
Friends, did you know that Herb Alpert was the guy who signed Devo to their very first big-time record deal?
Anyway, friends, the Church of the Subgenius has called itself the Spaz Church of Macho Irony.
And it's a church of macho irony.
And as I enjoyed the various cover bands covering Devo,
and the new and old and rare Devo materials that were dredged up for each of these conventions,
I got to thinking and pondering about the spazfulness of the great spaz bands.
And the ones I was thinking of primarily are ones from the 80s.
Elvis Costello, who I actually used to sort of resemble back in the day.
And Talking Heads.
I never was that into Talking Heads.
But they were a great spaz band, I suppose.
And David Byrne is a deuce-paying subgenius twice over, just as are several members of Devo.
Ah, friends.
But, you know, some people...
And of course, there's spaz bands today.
And we'll be playing a lot of that.
But, you know, some might say that the spaz, the spaziness and spazitude,
of the weirdos shows no dignity.
That it is somehow silly and unmanly.
But, nay, my friends, nay!
I say the ability to spaz is our treasure.
And the inability to spaz is the curse of the blockhead and the pink.
Because think, is not the sexual orgasm coming?
The ultimate?
Spaz attack?
The spaz of sex, friends.
The spaz of letting your own mutant abnormality out.
Do you really care what the others think?
Well, sure you do.
But, why let on?
Friends, as Bob Dobbs said very recently to his young ward, Dr. Onan Canabite,
Bob said,
I'd rather have the right people laughing at me than have the wrong people laughing with me.
I'd rather have the right people laughing at me than have the wrong people laughing with me.
Friends, you think about that as you spaz out in this, uh...
Friends, you just wait. You just wait.
You just wait.
Is there anything religion can do to help me?
Find my friend?
Well, we could join together in prayer.
Uh-huh. But is there anything useful we can do?
No.
Oh, man.
Whoa.
We can't just efic spiritedly fight before the Εfos out of the way.






Whose turn is it?
Well, of course, mine.
I'm ready to see what I've got.
Now, while the runner goes to work
You've got both hands
You've got both hands
You've got beret in hands
You've got beret in hands
Take me for no man
Take me for no man
Okay, relax
And assume the position
Going to dog is a mission
One, two, and three, time to date
Always do what your mama don't say
Run some teeth with the follow way
One, two, and three, time to date
You've got both hands
You've got beret in hands
You've got beret in hands
You've got both right hand
You've got both left hand
You've got both right hand
While the left hand is left
While the runner goes to work
I said the left hand is in the hole
While the runner goes to work
You've got both hands
You've got both hands
You've got beret in hands
You've got beret in hands
We got beret and hat and
Play great ball, no man
Play great ball, no man
Play great ball, no man
Okay, relax
And assume the position
Going to dog is a mission
Watch your head, do you touch the thing
Always do what your mama let's say
Bust the teeth with the ball away
Watch your head, do you touch the thing
Watch your head, do you touch the thing
Always do what your mama let's say
Bust the teeth with the ball away
Watch your head, do you touch the thing

What's that?
Uh huh

Can you tell us?
It's the female delta.

Just talk about
the de-evolutionization
of man and stuff man.
The other week I was over at my Aunt May Biel's house.
Me and my cousin Bubba were talking about third world politics and the effect on the micro farm workers of the southern United States.
And all of a sudden it hit me.
Mark Mother's ball was right.
Man was devolving.
And turning back into the most simple of primates.
This would explain daytime TV.
Jerry Springer being so popular.
Why the hell were you not on a fucking record label?
But right when I was about to tell Bubba about this.
He turned on Jerry Springer.
And as I watched that 13 year old.
prostitute straddle the Pope.
I couldn't think anything but.
What a damn fine country we are.
God bless fucking America.
Devolutionization.
By a group called the Cryogenic Strawberries.
An unusual group.
I think they're on mp3.com too.
Or somewhere out there.
Do a little search.
Cryogenic Strawberries.
And now...
Occupant.
Today, what does it take to do the super thing?
I'll tell you what it takes, a very simple thing
Iron nerves, like the pilot of a jumbo jet
Or a girl, on the go who hasn't got there yet
Magnetic trumpets blowing, synthetic saxophones
The evidence kept growing from below
Hidden motivations, buried in the past
Still give us strength for the super thing
The Red Alarm
A rude surprise every time it rings
It means it's time to go beyond the normal thing
Pay attention and be prepared to do it right
The super thing, the thing that makes you bigger than life
Magnetic trumpets blowing, synthetic saxophones
The evidence kept growing from below
Hidden motivations, buried in the past
Still give us strength
Iron nerves, like the pilot of a jumbo jet
Iron nerves, like the pilot of a jumbo jet
Magnetic trumpets blowing, synthetic saxophones


Still give us strength for the super thing
Iron nerves, like the pilot of a jumbo jet
Magnetic trumpets blowing, synthetic saxophones

Hidden motivations, buried in the past
Still give us strength for the super thing
The realument of the super thing

Ready starts tomorrow
Here's us, the delinquent
Good luck その地くそ俺たちが
Pleasure pain
Sensations unfamiliar
Can make you sick
It's a superhuman thing
And it does the trick
Magnetic drops are flowing
Synthetic saxophone
The evidence kept growing
From below
In motivation
Buried in the past
Still give us strength
Super, super thing
The super, super thing
The super, super thing
The super, super thing
The super, super thing
The super, super thing
The super, super thing
The super, super thing

Whales by the Elastic Band, a classic song of great spazitude.
And before that, some ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland, Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,
talking about the feast of spazism.
Speaking of which, upcoming are some amazing, well, here's an example.
It's not a Devo song, although Little Theodore later on in the show will cover through being cool.
Here's Little Theodore with I Don't Care.
I don't care about the economy. It has no effect on me.
Well, I need to be happy.
There's a woman, a screw, and a place to pee.
I don't care about the government.
I think it's about time it went.
Nasty politicians I resent.
Just like me, they're all hell-bent.
I don't want to hear about big stars.
They should all be behind bars.
Maybe we can ship them off to Mars.
Or take off their clothes and expose them.

I don't want no more of the press.
They're responsible for our mess.
If we knew what was best, we'd live our own lives and skip the rest.

But let's leave things of this world behind
And walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius
And we find then the family falling apart
And we find then the family falling apart
Oh, they wail and gnash their teeth, our rival churches do,
about how the children are getting exposed to too much this and too much that.
What they ain't being exposed to is a little bit of mom and dad.
Forget the pornography, I don't care.
It makes me mad, my friend, the hypocrisy.
Now, I have nothing against hypocrisy.
Every religion must have its fair share of hypocrisy.
As Bob Dobbs once said, I don't practice what I preach
because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.
But that preacher can get up there on TV and oh, he's so glad to keep you normal,
keep you working so hard you don't even know your own wifey anymore.
And your kids, you don't know your kids any better than your employees.
So, friend, let there be slack.
Salutations.
Today I feel a sense of urgency as I speak to you for Devo Incorporated.
There is a direct connection between Devo's work in the music field
and a message from my wife.
There is a big wiggly world around us.
You may not be aware of this, but we are in the middle of World War III.
It is not nuclear bombs that we must fear.
The weapon is the human mind or lack of it on this planet.
That will determine our fate.
Capital punishment for airline passengers who attempt to save money.
Spud men and gas lines who forgot that guns don't argue.
And tourists attempting to catch some rays at Three Mile Island.
Add up to a major attack of corkscrews in the brain.
We must fight back.
We must know what we want.
We must want what we need.
And what we need is duty now for the future.
You may not have eternal peace.
