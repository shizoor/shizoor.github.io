1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
What you're going to hear about today is nothing short of a miracle.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:12,220
It's dramatically new, made possible only through years of research, inventions, and innovation.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,240
The Self-Genius Power of Squat.

4
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,720
The Self-Genius Power of Squat

5
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,820
Somebody call a wrecker

6
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,540
Somebody call a lawyer, I need to find you

7
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,520
Somebody's whiplash, blindsided, rear-ended

8
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,240
Somebody call a priest, I'm the lost wise man from the east

9
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,620
And I got to town long after the party ended

10
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,980
Somebody call a priest, I'm the lost wise man from the east

11
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
Somebody call a wrecker

13
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,380
Somebody call a wrecker

14
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,560
Somebody call a wrecker

15
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,920
Somebody call a junk man

16
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,840
Never lived in my heart but a tin can

17
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
And it's banging like a screen door

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,720
I'm thinking like a city

19
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,640
It'll be a miracle if I live

20
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,840
Somebody call a wrecker

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,960
Somebody call a wrecker

22
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,000
Somebody call a wrecker

23
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,700
Somebody call a tasman

24
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:06,700


25
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,600
Somebody scream some sea

26
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,260
Somebody who still can't deem themselves

27
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:28,080
Somebody call behind some Hamel, life, disco, Ralph soup

28
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,980
darkness behind a single Raceway bridge

29
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,740
the urgent have moved. From Austin, Texas,

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,880
just when a pro-Austin documentary crew

31
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,100
decided to make a big documentary about the Church of the Subgenius.

32
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,740
Luckily for us, a bright, shining light on the Subgenius

33
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,500
road,

34
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,440
also in Austin, in the form of Reverend Anna Mall

35
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,020
appeared, and I made sure to interview

36
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,920
her, lest the filmmakers miss her late coming glory. But wait!

37
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,800
We're going to go to those interviews, but first let's go

38
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,560
even further back in time to 1981.

39
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,320
No, 1991.

40
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,560
And the Phenomicon Convention of Weirdness in

41
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,880
Atlanta, Georgia. That was even

42
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,340
weirder. Because one of the many

43
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,660
this weirdo celebrity guest was

44
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,420
unearthed than Pope Bob, Robert Anton Wilson,

45
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,120
co-author of Illuminatus and founder of a whole

46
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,340
philosophy of trippy enlightenment popularized by him.

47
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,880
Pope Bob was one of my heroes, so you can imagine

48
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,080
my pride as I filmed him as he lit into

49
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,820
this fervent Bob-praising subgenius rant

50
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,300
that had us in the Atlanta audience just knuckle-walking

51
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,200
to Jerusalem.

52
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,300
Who could be more

53
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,300


54
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,300


55
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,300


56
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,620
Did all. So then I accepted

57
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:09,100
into my pineal gland. And suddenly, things were as bad

58
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,640
as ever, but they were funny. I could laugh at there.

59
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:22,680
With the divine vision of Arise, I had become a genuine 24-karat loony.

60
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,820
And I was happy.

61
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,700
When Ronald Reagan was elected president, I laughed for three whole days.

62
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,480
People were digging tunnels.

63
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,720
People were hiding in caves.

64
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,020
People were trying to escape.

65
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,080
I was sitting there laughing like a lunatic because I had Arise in my pineal gland.

66
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,140
But then, then, I had only achieved bliss.

67
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,740
I had not achieved enlightenment.

68
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,060
Then I let Bob into my bank account.

69
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,780
Within 24 hours, I was flat on my ass broke.

70
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,120
What?

71
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:08,880
I?

72
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,280
I had slack.

73
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,620
I had great Bob.

74
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:35,940
Slack! Slack! Slack! Slack! Slack! Slack! Slack! Slack! Slack! Slack! Slack! Slack! Slack! Slack! Slack! bow my die yo

75
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,780
I won't. I won't.

76
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,620
I want to tell you some of the miracles that Bob makes possible.

77
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,960
This afternoon I was on a panel.

78
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,240
We were talking about Masonic symbolism on the dollar bill.

79
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,560
Somebody pointed out there's a penis on the dollar bill.

80
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,860
I have studied that dollar bill for 20 years,

81
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,000
finding the Star of David on it,

82
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,600
finding all sorts of... I couldn't find the penis.

83
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,200
I went to my spiritual leader in the Church of the Subgenius

84
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,720
and I said, why can't I find the penis on the dollar bill?

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,900
He said, you need frock.

86
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,620
Frock, frock.

87
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,900
Once I got the frock, I could see a penis not only on the dollar bill,

88
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,480
but on the $5 bill, the $10 bill, even the $23 bill.

89
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,000
My eyes were opened and I knew it was...

90
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,180
This might even...

91
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,620
This might even replace the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

92
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,120
It was the sacred willy of Pee Wee Herman.

93
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:53,220
It was the sign given unto this generation,

94
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,900
our last chance for freedom.

95
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,620
They've taken everything else away from us.

96
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,680
Tim Leary told me recently,

97
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,180
he was walking and he was on a streetcar,

98
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,160
he was in San Francisco, he was up there to give a lecture.

99
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,300
Somebody came up and started mumbling something.

100
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,860
Tim thought he was a beggar and gave him $5.

101
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,860
The guy handed him a bag. It was full of crack.

102
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,680
Tim said, what the hell has happened to this country?

103
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,780
I can't buy pot in Beverly Hills.

104
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,080
I just get off a plane in San Francisco

105
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,300
and I bought crack without even knowing it.

106
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,840
That's what they have done.

107
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,280
They have taken away all the good drugs

108
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,400
and they've dumped all this lousy crack on us.

109
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,560
We pay more taxes.

110
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,740
It's the conspiracy.

111
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,100
We pay more taxes than medieval serfs did in the dark ages.

112
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,280
They work one month of the year to pay their taxes.

113
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,300
We work five months of the year to pay our taxes.

114
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,480
They've taken everything else away

115
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,040
and now they're trying to take our goddamn willies away.

116
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,380
They arrested this man just for playing with his willy,

117
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,820
which everybody does.

118
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,780
Now that may seem like a sexist remark,

119
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,020
but you all know, those of you who don't have willies,

120
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,220
you know what you play with.

121
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,620
It's called the clitoris.

122
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,940
Now they are trying to take that away from us.

123
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,100
Having reduced us to total misery,

124
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,800
raising the mortgage rates higher than ever,

125
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,000
looting the S&Ls, destroying the economy

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,400
so that it's dead in the water, as one congressman said recently.

127
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,920
We've got nothing left.

128
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,960
And now they're trying to take our willies away.

129
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,120
You can't even play with your goddamn willy anymore

130
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,260
or they'll throw you in jail.

131
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,200
The only rebellion that makes sense

132
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,520
is to write in Pee Wee Herman for president.

133
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,700
Tell all your friends,

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,500
put it in bottles and throw it in the water.

135
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,160
Write it on billboards.

136
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,380
Get rubber stamps made and put it on every envelope.

137
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,720
Send it to everybody in Congress.

138
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,060
Send it to all the newspapers.

139
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,760
Pee Wee Herman for president.

140
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,080
Give us back our willies.

141
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,680
Look how many arrived at this state.

142
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,340
For 20 years we've had one president after another

143
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,960
who looks like he doesn't even have a willy.

144
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,480
Now we've got George Bush

145
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,260
who got elected only because he appeals to the most mean,

146
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,560
the most mean streaks and the most puritanical middle Americans.

147
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,520
He looks like a man who hasn't had a blowjob in 20 years.

148
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,980
Can we stand a president like that?

149
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,240
Can any country survive being ruled by a man

150
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,880
who looks like he hasn't had a blowjob in 20 years?

151
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,820
Give us back our willies.

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,840
Bob is on our side.

153
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,000
We can't hold.

154
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,040
You've got to kidnap one of those people.

155
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,520
You've built Your Anthea in today's administration.

156
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:24,260
The Hai Tay,

157
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,660
it has had an incredibly dangerous and

158
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,600
devastating impact on the heads and backs

159
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,260
of every single crime in the nation.

160
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,000
We've Courtesy of All of Them

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,220
and DidChar ねci Orlando

162
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,140
I'm back to Dallas

163
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,240
And take my razor and my gun

164
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,660
Ah yeah

165
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,000
A lot of people looking for trouble

166
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,240
Man, I'm sure gonna give them some

167
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,180
I believe, oh Dallas

168
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,960
Man, it's the neatest town I know

169
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,200
I believe that Dallas

170
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,060
Man, it's the neatest town I know

171
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,880
Man, cause you ain't safe in Dallas

172
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,140
Yeah, I don't care where you go

173
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,660
You know that I ain't evil

174
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,760
Man, just having fun

175
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,040
So much to say in Texas

176
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,920
Bound to step inside

177
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,440
I'm back to Dallas

178
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,580
And take my razor and my gun

179
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,640
And if people are looking for trouble

180
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,620
Sure gonna give them some

181
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:28,880
I believe, oh Dallas

182
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,220
Man, I'm sure gonna give them some

183
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,380
I believe, oh Dallas

184
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,500
Man, just having fun

185
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,920
Sure gonna give them some

186
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:52,400
I believe, oh Dallas

187
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,400


188
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,920
Sure gonna give them some

189
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,600
I believe, oh Dallas

190
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,740
Johnny Winter knew Dallas like I did, friends.

191
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,120
It's a money town.

192
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,960
But we survived.

193
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,020
I recently had to go back to Dallas last week, twice.

194
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,040
But only for brief stays at the DFW airport

195
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,800
going to and from that hoary, mist-shrouded city of Porto in Portugal

196
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,340
in order to secure a secure private recording.

197
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,860
And testimony deposition

198
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:34,400
from Dr. G. Gordon Gordon, early subgenius scholar and adventurer.

199
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,960
I'm G. Gordon Gordon, mercenary of mercy,

200
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,780
pope of the southern hemisphere, and the left fist of dogs.

201
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,760
Well, I was living in Bolivia.

202
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,900
I had a cattle ranch on the eastern slopes of the Andes.

203
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,240
And a friend came to visit me from the states.

204
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,200
And he brought me some books.

205
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,580
And he brought me a copy of the church pamphlet, the first pamphlet.

206
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,740
And I read it and went, whoa.

207
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,720
I'm gonna find out more about this.

208
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,440
So I immediately sat down and wrote a letter because the guy told me,

209
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,460
well I understand he'll write back to you if you write him, whoever he was.

210
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,440
Reverend Stang, I presume.

211
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,840
And so I wrote him a letter.

212
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,100
Threw a hundred dollar bill in it and demanded a copy of the book of the subgenius,

213
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,140
which hadn't been written yet, but I didn't know that.

214
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,460
So I started receiving these packages from Dallas with all sorts of things in them.

215
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,400
And through that I got hooked into some other people who were also in the church.

216
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,500
And the next thing I knew we were exchanging tape cassettes

217
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,480
and talking to one another over two continents.

218
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,800
And it just kept snowballing and snowballing.

219
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,900
And the more I knew, the more I knew.

220
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,440
I got involved.

221
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,140
The more I liked it and the more fun it became.

222
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,820
And the more interesting the people were that I kept contacting through this.

223
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,360
So yeah, it was a great thing to get hooked into,

224
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,420
especially when you're living in the middle of nowhere with no electricity

225
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,780
and nothing but cows for company.

226
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,800
So yeah, that's how I became involved in the church.

227
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,100
Okay, so this is a documentary about the church.

228
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,300
And people say, well, what does it mean to you?

229
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,660
And I, you know, it means a lot.

230
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,740
It means that I have been in touch for, God, nearly 40 years

231
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,200
with a whole bunch of rather different human beings whose company I enjoy,

232
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,340
even though I don't like them sometimes,

233
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,020
who are fun even though they're not funny sometimes.

234
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,800
But over these years I have maintained a relationship with these people

235
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,460
who I met through the church, who are all members of the church,

236
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,500
from the beginning.

237
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,500
And of course along the way you meet a few people who came in later

238
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,640
and they become friends.

239
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,680
But basically I think I really like the church because it's composed of a bunch

240
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:14,340
of disaffected people who have fun and aren't taking life as seriously

241
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,360
as everybody thinks they should.

242
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,880
I mean, you've got one go around.

243
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,900
You know, there's not going to be a rapture.

244
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,800
You're not going to float up to heaven.

245
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,020
There's no hell.

246
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,040
You're not going to go, you know, it's just you've got it now and that's it.

247
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,980
And these people realize that.

248
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,160
And we all get together from time to time and have a good time.

249
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,400
The rest of the time we live our lives.

250
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,400
We go on being who we are and what we are.

251
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,180
We communicate with one another, not as frequently as we used to

252
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,700
because nobody makes audio cassettes anymore, unfortunately.

253
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,500
But that's how the church doctrine was forged on tape recorders.

254
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,740
But it was mostly the conversations that it wrapped around those tape recordings.

255
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,200
And so, yeah, the church means a lot to me because, I mean,

256
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,540
I don't wake up every morning and praise Bob.

257
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,400
Probably I should, but I don't.

258
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:14,080
But I just have all these people that I know because of the church,

259
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,020
people that live all over the world now, including me.

260
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,440
And I don't think my life would have been anywhere near

261
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,600
as fulfilling or as much fun if I had not read that pamphlet

262
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,400
in the middle of the Bolivian jungle in 1980.

263
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,760
And that really did change my life.

264
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,720
And that's when I got out of the church

265
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,660
and that's when I'm still getting out of the church.

266
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,740
And if that's not good enough, well, just as Bob would say,

267
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,700
put that in your pipe and smoke it.

268
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,060
Anna Moll, telecommute janitor for the Church of the Subgenius.

269
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,420
I have a question.

270
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,280
I'm not either a doctor nor a reverend.

271
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,840
I have donated enough to surpass all of those titles

272
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,980
and create my own as overlord.

273
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,840
So in the early 90s, I started hanging out with these guys in Austin,

274
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,380
and they showed me these books and these posters and these stencils

275
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,000
and this wonderful art around town.

276
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,400
And it was a bunch of really interactive, fun things to do,

277
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,380
which I was into, it turns out.

278
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,240
And I decided to follow along.

279
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,160
And I was in a room with a couple of friends,

280
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,860
and they said, we're going to have a revival at the Cavity Club.

281
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,380
And this is a big, empty room that didn't even have a bar.

282
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,980
And it was a BYOB place, and it was 18 and up.

283
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,240
So I had to sneak in the back and do the fencing.

284
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,200
And they had this pulpit at the front

285
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,100
and this huge room of people just swarming to get on stage

286
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,880
and rant madly about stuff.

287
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,280
And I'm pretty sure this was in 90 or 91.

288
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,480
And this was right about when I met people like Reverend Pinto

289
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,600
and Steve Topstuffing and things you may or may not be familiar with.

290
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,480
But they both just really got me into the mix,

291
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,480
and they got me to listen to their rants

292
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,000
and explain to me how it's so fantastic to be a part of this new thing,

293
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,740
or newer thing.

294
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,180
Newish thing?

295
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,120
At that point, I'm not sure.

296
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,340
It was new to me.

297
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,960
How much of a religion did it seem like?

298
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,060
The fact that there were reverends and doctors,

299
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,720
which is, as far as I'm concerned, both varieties of snake oil salesmen,

300
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,720
it was very religious an experience.

301
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,700
It was very spiritual an experience.

302
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,720
I had transcended reality and met the people of the churches

303
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,300
of the subgenius.

304
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,880
I think I had spontaneously mutated even more at that point,

305
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,360
or my latent mutant abilities were just meshed into my system,

306
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,180
just went boop, and there they were.

307
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,000
Boom. Animal.

308
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:13,020
The churches of the subgenius influenced my abilities as a mutant just tenfold.

309
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,580
I was able to emerge as a surrealist artist in that scene

310
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,980
and just really sell this garbage as art.

311
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,760
People bought it. It was fantastic.

312
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,080
It was so much fun.

313
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:34,420
I was able to clearly grab ahold of that wool and pull it over my own eyes.

314
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,800
Then, boom, I was happy and successful.

315
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,520
I don't know. I was doing stuff.

316
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,560
I wasn't doing that stuff before.

317
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,320
When I was a part of it, we got to get up and be part of the performances.

318
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,620
We got to talk to bands and get them involved.

319
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,620
We got to get all these really great things happening.

320
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,500
Club owners would let us inside without paying.

321
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,680
I was down. It's Austin.

322
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,320
Currently, we're doing the Thorazine Urine Pod Crust

323
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,060
with a few other members of the church.

324
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,820
We've got Dr. Shoggoth, Dr. Bruhaha, my favorite witch doctor,

325
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,320
and Fnord, and Pease.

326
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,300
We've got a lot of people.

327
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,500
There's always Pease.

328
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,720
We get together and jam online via...

329
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,340
We use the internet and we all get into this live video chat together.

330
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,580
We throw out and just bounce ideas off of each other and record those sessions.

331
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,880
Sometimes it's just noises.

332
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,340
Sometimes it's actually funny and good.

333
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,540
Then we put that together after months of not doing jack diddly with it.

334
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,700
Then we edit it together and we have a 14-minute show or something.

335
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,940
We have so many hours of backlogged stuff to edit.

336
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,500
It's ridiculous.

337
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,720
We might be doing this show for a while if we keep it at 14 minutes.

338
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,460
What did you say?

339
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,160
Who me?

340
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,440
Yeah.

341
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,480
Just now?

342
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,100
Just now.

343
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,280
I just said who me.

344
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,900
Oh, that's good.

345
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,300
I thought you were asking...

346
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,240
I thought you were saying...

347
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Making a statement about how sad it was that there are so many orphan tears.

348
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:19,900
Oh, yeah.

349
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,180
Yes.

350
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,700
We are drowning in orphan tears.

351
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,900
Drowning in orphan tears here next day.

352
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,700
Such a plentiful amount.

353
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,120
You know, I have to apologize.

354
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,240
This has become a sad...

355
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,480
It isn't sad.

356
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,080
Depressing debut, podcast debut.

357
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,100
Not depressing.

358
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,860
Impressive, I think.

359
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,980
It's impressive amount.

360
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,620
Well...

361
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,780
So I got a new kitty.

362
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:41,880
Kitty.

363
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:46,840
Okay.

364
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,280
You still have that.

365
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:48,800
Go ahead.

366
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,020
She's adorable.

367
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,080
You own that kitten.

368
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,520
Yep.

369
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,140
She is mine.

370
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,500
What's your kitten's name?

371
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,780
My kitten's name is Clementine.

372
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,560
Clementine.

373
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:57,900
Yes.

374
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,340
Wait.

375
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,700
Is that Clementine of the murderous clan of Clementines?

376
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,100
All kittens known killers.

377
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,080
Clementines, especially.

378
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:11,760
I remember...

379
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:11,760


380
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,260
I remember the time that my own Clementine variety cat brought in a nest of baby birds.

381
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,860
She's only done bugs so far.

382
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,120
She hasn't graduated to anything feathered or...

383
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,220
Just you wait.

384
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,120
It's going to be great.

385
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:27,980
You're going to be the...

386
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,520
You know, your final screams or your screams are going to be the final sounds of what the

387
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:38,040
bird hears before it is eviscerated and become consumed by your kitten.

388
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,860
Clementine, so cute.

389
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,520
Yeah.

390
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:40,960
So cute.

391
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,860
I'm actually just waiting for the day when...

392
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:42,900
It's so sweet.

393
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,900
It's a little buggy thing.

394
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:44,800
Seriously.

395
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,920
We have feral cats out here at X Day.

396
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,360
There are feral cats out there?

397
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,220
There is the ghost cat.

398
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,660
I saw the ghost cat.

399
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,420
The white cat?

400
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:53,700
Is that what you're talking about?

401
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,240
There is a ghost.

402
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,460
It's not a real feral cat.

403
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,580
It is a ghost cat.

404
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,100
I saw it.

405
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,240
It was out behind my tent.

406
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:00,760
Yes.

407
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:07,200
It was out in the circle, the stone circle, preparing for the alien landing.

408
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,500
It went out there to make sure that everything was safe.

409
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:10,500


410
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,060
Everything, all the other ghosts, the unwelcome ghosts were taken care of and cleared out

411
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,340
of the way.

412
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,220
That's good luck when a ghost cat...

413
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:16,600
Thanks, ghost cat.

414
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,400
Absolutely.

415
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,740
...crosses your path.

416
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,900
Not named Clementine, though.

417
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,500
Correct.

418
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,460
If you could name a ghost cat, what would you name it?

419
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,340
Sharon.

420
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,860
Sharon's the best cat name ever.

421
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:30,980
Not Stacy.

422
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,480
That's for damn sure.

423
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:32,920
No.

424
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,980
Sharon or Stacy, I think.

425
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,620
Not Stacy.

426
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,580
Not Stacy.

427
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,200
I'm going to go out there and I'm going to talk to Sharon.

428
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,480
I'm going to go out there and I'm going to talk to Sharon.

429
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:40,480


430
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:52,920
It's going to help out her amongst us in the building.

431
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,200
Again, we've got querying around us today as well.

432
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,980
The Hepburn voters really just spent a lot of Aboriginal women doing things that we

433
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,000
didn't do until we got there.

434
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,040
No, not at all.

435
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,320
No one took influencer interviews or made any sort of

436
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,160
claims toугing braucht our authority.

437
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,420
That's true.

438
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,280
Thank you.

439
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,640
I believe that, yeah.

440
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,320
Well, the good thing about the subgrade products,

441
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,020
they sell really well to the subgenius people.

442
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,680
And so we've got a really nice fan base of people that listen in

443
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,300
and just really enjoy the show.

444
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,360
You know, there are certain diners that are our sponsor,

445
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,540
whether they like it or not, that we started using.

446
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,820
And you can go to the Thorazine Urine Pod Crust and find that one out.

447
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,420
Now, I actually got $5 sent to me from them the other day in the mail

448
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,480
as a thank you.

449
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,160
That's more than I've made off our Slack lately.

450
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:46,720
I know.

451
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,960
Actually, that's not true.

452
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,420
We do have people who donate.

453
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,740
You probably have five and a quarter.

454
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,040
It is five bucks a show, though, basically.

455
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,960
It was very interesting because this church thing,

456
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,360
as we started meeting one another and talking about it,

457
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,800
we realized that we...

458
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,420
we were making stuff up.

459
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,280
I mean, there was the basic idea of who Bob was

460
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,740
and what the church was,

461
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,600
but there were a lot of gaps,

462
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,500
a lot of unsaid, unwritten things.

463
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,860
And we found that when we got together and started talking about it,

464
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,120
all of a sudden it would be like a word jam,

465
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,320
just like jazz musicians get together and start playing on a theme

466
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,720
and pretty soon they're each contributing something new.

467
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,800
We would start talking about it,

468
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,220
talking about Bob or the church or Connie or whatever.

469
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,880
And all of a sudden it would just start going.

470
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,900
And somebody invariably had a tape recorder going there,

471
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,140
usually Stan.

472
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,360
And so it got recorded.

473
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,080
And sometimes we'd go for a while and Stan would say,

474
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,580
well, that's a whole chapter of the book right there.

475
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,560
And we'd go, what?

476
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,700
Because we were just having fun.

477
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,220
But that's how...

478
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,740
I mean, we had this network of people who made cassettes to one another,

479
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,720
if you remember.

480
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,500
If you remember cassettes.

481
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,280
And we sent them back and forth, back and forth.

482
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,900
And people would think of something about Bob or the church

483
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,280
and they'd put it on a cassette and send it to somebody.

484
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,260
And they would think about what he said or she said.

485
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,740
And then they would add something.

486
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,600
And it all ended up in Dallas.

487
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,140
And so that's sort of how the church got fleshed out,

488
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:33,280
was by this sort of free form, free association word jam

489
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,700
that took place on two or three continents.

490
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,580
And it was a very powerful influence at the time.

491
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,360
So yeah, that's how the book was written pretty much.

492
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,080
Just a bunch of guys and girls talking about stuff.

493
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,380
You know, I've been part of the Church of the Subgenius

494
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,000
for over two decades at this point.

495
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,340
And it is absolutely such a powerful influence on my life.

496
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,180
I had no idea how much it had actually molded my existence

497
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,360
into what I am today, which is unemployed,

498
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,780
but extremely successful.

499
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,700
Extremely happy.

500
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,060
And a giant talking bat.

501
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,560
I would not have achieved, or a telecommute janitor.

502
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,560
I did not know that job even existed.

503
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,840
But it turns out I can phone that shit in.

504
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,700
I don't know if you can say that, but...

505
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,840
In that format.

506
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,120
But yeah, I was able to meet other people, like-minded.

507
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,860
And it provides a space for us to be legitimately weird.

508
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,340
Not just kind of weird or a little kooky or Austin weird.

509
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,260
But like legitimately mutated, this is what I've got,

510
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,540
and I can't help it kind of weird, you know?

511
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,720
And it's one of those things where...

512
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,700
And everybody's welcome.

513
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,460
It is a completely inclusive environment to where...

514
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,260
I mean, you can get ticked off at anybody.

515
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,780
It's great.

516
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,580
It's like, you know, if you're the kind of person that feels

517
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,000
like isolating yourself into a tiny room in front of a screen

518
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,280
that flickers messages of hate towards you,

519
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,860
we got a spot for that.

520
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,380
If you want to like see puppies and kitties, you know,

521
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,480
and guys smoking pipes, we got a place for that.

522
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,200
We got, you know, tits, we got a place for that.

523
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,500
Everybody's welcome.

524
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,700
It's so awesome.

525
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,120
And I have met so many people that I would not have otherwise met

526
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,880
because of that, and interesting people, which is amazing.

527
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,780
That's one of my favoritest things.

528
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,300
Group projects that never finish because we get angry.

529
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,340
It is like, no, it's...

530
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,320
We have group projects that actually turn out that are really great.

531
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,900
And then the random jams that we can just like, well,

532
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,560
I've got this funky instrument that I just made out of these wires

533
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,140
and knobs and what have yous.

534
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,280
And it's like, oh, cool.

535
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,120
I just made this funky instrument.

536
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,640
Oh, really?

537
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:47,960
Cool.

538
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,740
Well, I'm going to go over in this corner and warble on a microphone.

539
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,340
Oh, great.

540
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,500
I brought a kazoo.

541
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,020
And then you have this amazing ensemble for three hours or so

542
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,220
during an X Day event.

543
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,800
And it's just, you know, it's like we party like it's the end of the world.

544
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,300
You can't be that.

545
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,420
You can't get it.

546
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,760
The meaning of slack.

547
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,580
This has been debated.

548
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,320
This has been argued about.

549
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,580
There are more arguments about what slack is.

550
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,140
Sort of like, I think the basic idea is that when you're born,

551
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,320
you have this little loose thing inside you.

552
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:31,400
And as things come up against you, as you get against problems,

553
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,300
people insult you, your job gets you fired, you're fired.

554
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,300


555
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,300


556
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,540
You're fired.

557
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:34,540


558
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:34,540


559
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:34,540


560
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,300
But the thing is, as things change down, this tightens up and tightens up

561
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:41,640
like a rope being twisted tighter and tighter and tighter until you're just like,

562
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,640
ah, and then something happens.

563
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,140
Whether it's you quit your job or you meet an absolutely beautiful girl

564
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,660
who thinks you're a nice guy or, uh, I don't know.

565
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,280
Something happens and then it's alright.

566
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,160
It loosens and that's slack.

567
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,600
Slack is that period where you're there.

568
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,180
You're there.

569
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,960
and everything is just good.

570
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,500
Sometimes it's a song.

571
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,860
Sometimes it's a grilled cheese sandwich.

572
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,600
Sometimes it's a nice cold beer.

573
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,620
But it's what gives you that feeling that,

574
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,120
yeah, this is good.

575
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,340
That's what slack means to me.

576
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,280
Sometimes it's just having a good job.

577
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,440
You have a good job and you like it

578
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,520
and you like what you're doing.

579
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,140
That's slack at work.

580
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,800
And a lot of people don't have that.

581
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,520
Very few people have that.

582
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,120
But, you know, the only time I ever had work with slack

583
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,540
was when I was working with disadvantaged children

584
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,100
because I felt like I was actually doing something,

585
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,480
you know, with all these rather damaged little human beings.

586
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,980
But it was a great job because you were getting a reward

587
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,000
of what you were doing was good.

588
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,960
So that was slack because slack is what makes you,

589
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,920
yeah, just be there and it's nice.

590
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,960
This is good.

591
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,380
And that's slack to me.

592
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,380
That's what it means.

593
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:01,660
Thanks.

594
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,360
Thank you.

595
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,420
Thank you.

596
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,700
Thank you.

597
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,420
Thank you.

598
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:32,500
Thank you.

599
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,440
Thank you.

600
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,400
Thank you.

601
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,440
Thank you.

602
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,080
Thank you.

603
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,220
Thank you.

604
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
Nothing works perfectly.

605
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,260
And if you don't get that down,

606
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,520
you're never going to have a very good life

607
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,660
because you're going to expect things to go right.

608
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,100
And they don't.

609
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,640
And it's a joke.

610
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,140
It's a house of tricks.

611
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,340
That's all it is.

612
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,960
And so, yeah, it's a joke.

613
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,620
And if you don't get it, well, fuck you.

614
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,380
You know, it's your problem, not mine.

615
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,360
I can take the joke.

616
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,880
I understand what it's about.

617
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,180
You don't, it's your problem.

618
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
And that's what it means to me.

619
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,900
When did the joke go too far?

620
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,060
What joke?

621
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,180
You're talking about the church?

622
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,680
It's not a joke.

623
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,800
How can it go too far?

624
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,260
Oh, that's a silly question. I'm sorry.

625
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,740
I mean, it took me two years to rededicate myself to the subgenius lifestyle.

626
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,000
Stang comes down to Austin to a club called Bob Popular.

627
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,600
And this is a jock bar with daiquiris and crap.

628
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,560
It was someplace where I would never, ever step foot in otherwise.

629
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,940
And then all of a sudden, there's this back courtyard area that you can smoke cigarettes in.

630
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,880
Well, you could smoke inside then, too.

631
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,940
But up to this tiny room.

632
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,380
And it's like, I don't know, maybe a 20 by 30 room.

633
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,880
It's like we were all jammed in there.

634
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,720
And there was one other person standing there, you know, drinking what I was drinking and smoking.

635
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,380
And it was like, oh, you're it.

636
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,880
Let's, you know, we got married for two whole weeks.

637
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,400
It was great.

638
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,500
Notch of the bell.

639
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,080
Boom.

640
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:44,920
You know, it's like no other marriage would have lasted that long for me.

641
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,900
So it was really great.

642
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,440
And we're still frenemies.

643
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,940
So there's that.

644
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:59,260
And in fact, Oz and Ian were people that helped put on divivals at clubs like Atomic Cafe,

645
00:39:59,480 --> 00:39:59,680
Alicia.

646
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,960
And I can't remember the other one.

647
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:11,080
But we had other divivals to parallel with X Day happening in Ohio because we were too slack-filled to make it north.

648
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:16,200
Oh, well, everybody's got to have somebody to look down on, you know.

649
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,860
You've got to have someone to say that I'm better than you.

650
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,780
And even though it's not true, it just helps you in your everyday little meanderings.

651
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,380
But if it was an us, then there's a them.

652
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,920
And the church is us.

653
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,200
So there has to be a them.

654
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,540
And them is the people who just buy into everything that's normal.

655
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,220
They buy the latest fashions.

656
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,840
They line up for days to buy the newest iPhone.

657
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,100
They camp out to get tickets for the rock show.

658
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:51,240
They go to class reunions every year in some hotel somewhere.

659
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,820
They go to football games to cheer for their teams.

660
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,940
All of this is normal.

661
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,960
What we call pink.

662
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,880
Because we sort of see things as either black or white.

663
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,040
Although we kind of live in the gray area.

664
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,940
We think things are black and white.

665
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,980
And so pink is not black.

666
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,760
It's not white.

667
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,680
It's just not part of what we want anything to do with.

668
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,100
So pink.

669
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,940
And pink boys, you know, just the normals.

670
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,320
The people who wear those stupid clothes.

671
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,100
The people who take pictures of their food every time they sit down to eat.

672
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,740
You know, the guys with the weird neck beards.

673
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,240
The people that only drink craft brewed.

674
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,740
And people who, you know, I don't touch gluten.

675
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,700
I don't eat nightshade plants.

676
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,280
Those are the pinks.

677
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,740
They're intolerable.

678
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,480
Because they're all artificial.

679
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,900
None of what they believe is true.

680
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,820
And none of what they do has any meaning.

681
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,760
And so we don't like them.

682
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,060
In fact, if we were capable of hate.

683
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,080
Well, we are.

684
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,380
And we hate them.

685
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,080
In fact, G. Gordon Gordon has made a masterful study of hate.

686
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,940
And I have the kind of hate that can blow up your head.

687
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,960
I can have a filling station at a hundred yards if I don't want it to be there.

688
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,060
But that's what pink is.

689
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,860
And that's what normal is.

690
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,340
It's to be shunned.

691
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,540
To be eschewed.

692
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,100
To be cast aside into the wilderness.

693
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:17,240
So that the true subgenius can stride forth.

694
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,800
And take the world in his hand.

695
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:35,460
I'm hoping you might let me have you if you have brain disease.

696
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,860
I'm shallow.

697
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,140
I think that you're shit.

698
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:50,400
But will you pretend that you care and have sex with me?

699
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,560
If I write you a pop song.

700
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,940
Close your eyes and act like it's Prince Harry.

701
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,000
When I write you a pop song.

702
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,760
Pop song.

703
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,300
My fluids wash out if you rinse.

704
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,820
Don't you know it feels so right.

705
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,500
On a Bunch-O-Bee video night.

706
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,020
Yank at my cords when I pee.

707
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,460
And I'll write you a pop song.

708
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,500
Rub it on the tcat's chest.

709
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,400
If you get introduced to rosin.

710
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,560
I find the Jeanette he me in.

711
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,960
The Avents depende de perfect peutre.

712
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:45,960


713
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:45,980
Don't lock yourself up through the doors of your house.

714
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:51,560
Like you say that boys gotta somethin'.

715
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:58,220
Time is a revolution and as we go we're weak.

716
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,860
Pops on

717
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,220
Pops on

718
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,120
I'm betting

719
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,920
You're sweating

720
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,460
At the thought of my rockish white hair

721
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,200
On the nape of your neck

722
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,940
Don't squirt me

723
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:58,940


724
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,000
Too fast

725
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,320
Let's make it last

726
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,260
Moments like these

727
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,160
Can do nothing but release

728
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,000
Ask me the reason

729
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,040
Get down when I ride you

730
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,100
A pops on

731
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,100
Pops on

732
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,140
Lubricants flavored with mint

733
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,480
When I ride you

734
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,560
A pops on

735
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,200
Pops on

736
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,760
Close your eyes and act like it's Prince

737
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,420
Don't you know

738
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,380
It feels so right

739
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,980
On a Bon Jovi video night

740
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,860
Yank at my cords

741
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,660
When I pitch

742
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,940
And I'll write you a pops on

743
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,220
Don't you know

744
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,160
It feels so right

745
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,400
On a Michael Jackson

746
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,820
Coors beer night

747
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,640
Tug at my balls

748
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,500
When I pitch

749
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,840
And I'll write you a pops on

750
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,240
Pops on

751
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,260
Pops on

752
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,240
My darling

753
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,940
Pops on

754
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,080
When I look into your eyes

755
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,680
I see nothing

756
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:16,880
I see nothing

757
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,420
Pops on

758
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,680
Pops on

759
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,000
Pops on

760
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,000


761
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,400
Pops on

762
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,280
Pops on

763
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,400
Pops on

764
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,380
Pops on

765
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:03,540
and you get really good at like doing dumb stuff in that time of waiting like

766
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,980
you have to come up with new stuff and that's why you know I can't get employed

767
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,320
because I'm just gonna feel like I'm leaving something that I put time into

768
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:16,060
if I get abducted by a spaceship you know if they come and get me I don't

769
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:21,060
leave things like half done I want to leave them not done at all see that's

770
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:25,520
the whole point of it you know we need to remember that there's not just a

771
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,340
bunch of guys in this organization there are tons of uber women tons of

772
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:34,620
yeti kin of all sorts of all flavors and I love every bit of it the variety you

773
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:39,160
cannot beat the mutant variety of this group of people and if you are not

774
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,160
amazed by someone that you meet in the Church of subgenius then you have

775
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:50,240
mutated too much and we're probably worshiping you thanks Bob

776
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,220
I mean isn't that kind of like

777
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:55,500
you know I mean I think that's the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's

778
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:56,720
the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's

779
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,100
I'm just gonna assume that he had just evolved to a point to where he could do

780
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:10,900
all the things that he did Bob yeah I'm just gonna sit right happens around it

781
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,500
that's what I'm talking about just kind of stand there going yeah right that's

782
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,540
why the people just wouldn't be like people get mad at me cuz people put

783
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:25,000
money at me I'm just like oh get away and take the money and like stop it and

784
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,480
they're like you know I'm like I'm like you know I'm like I'm like you know I'm

785
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,280
Likee that network over time!

786
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,640
Why do people try and give you money I never get handed money for stuff and

787
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,040
nothing and like it's like you all you do is like whatever you want people give

788
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:39,700
you money for like yes that is embracing the power of a mutint abilities like

789
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:45,760
what you can develop over time is to get paid for slack I think that's you know

790
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,740
Yeah you have it you have it going on quite a lot

791
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:58,880
Well, I mean, I had to carry out some heavy sacks of mail today, but it only took me about an hour to address those.

792
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,520
Did you really have to do it, though?

793
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,660
Yeah, yeah. Some of them were 10 days over.

794
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:10,860
But those are dates that you imposed on yourself by setting it up to be sold in the first place.

795
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:11,440
Oh, yeah.

796
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,480
So that's your own creation. I'm saying, like, other people's... yeah.

797
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,280
There was a lot of talk earlier in the church about, oh, it's just a boys' club.

798
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,360
Just a bunch of stupid guys.

799
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,820
But then we had a convention in Chicago, and it was 1980, I think it was.

800
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:38,540
And, you know, all of the high pontiffs of the church were sitting at the table with their microphones,

801
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,720
pontificating about Bob and how wonderful things were and how great the church was.

802
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,440
And all of the ladies of the church, wives, girlfriends, sisters,

803
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,400
just got so tired.

804
00:49:52,740 --> 00:50:00,660
So basically, they got out and threw us all off stage, took the microphones away,

805
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:07,480
had a whole list of demands, some of which were not very nice, especially for poor old Bob,

806
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,840
and stopped the whole convention because they were tired of the men taking over.

807
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,860
So anytime anybody says the church is just a boys' club, they've got to remember that it's not.

808
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,720
There's a lot of women, girls, females.

809
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,660
Whatever you want to call them in the church.

810
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,080
And, you know, they're not pushed around.

811
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,620
They are uberfems.

812
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,360
They don't take any shit off anybody.

813
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:41,280
And I think people who say, meh, meh, meh, meh, you know, all this whining and butthurt about the girls don't have any say in this,

814
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:41,920
it's not true.

815
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:51,500
And I think it's a very widely accepted fact that within this church, everybody is equal.

816
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:58,700
You know, you don't have to be Ivan Stang to get respect.

817
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,800
You're just who you are.

818
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,300
And we all respect one another for who we are.

819
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,380
And the women are just as respected as the men.

820
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,140
They're not toys.

821
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,280
They're not play things.

822
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,080
They're uberfems.

823
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:17,100
They're lady pontiffs, if you want it, you know.

824
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:21,100
And so I think that the church,

825
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,940
is a very widespread, all-embracing organization.

826
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,740
And it's lasted for as long as it has because it means something.

827
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,180
It has always meant something.

828
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,840
It's a forum, if you wish,

829
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,140
for those people who have always been reaching out

830
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:44,040
to find someone who felt and thought the same way they did.

831
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,020
And it shouldn't be thought of as like the Nazis in 1930,

832
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,980
because, or,

833
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:56,000
the people in the United States now who are a part of that deplorable majority or minority.

834
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:01,600
These are just normal human beings who really didn't realize there were people like them.

835
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,480
And that's what the church is about.

836
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,620
And people find out that, yeah, there are people who like this.

837
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,660
There are people who do the same things I do.

838
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:18,640
We are all just part of this group of people who think and act along similar lines.

839
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,520
Not alike, because we're all different.

840
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:26,300
But we are people who think, who create, who act out what we do.

841
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,900
And the church gives us room to do that.

842
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,400
And that's about all I've got to say.

843
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,380
I am G. Gordon Gordon,

844
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,260
Mercenary of Mercy,

845
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,000
Pope of the Southern Hemisphere,

846
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,040
and the Left Fist of Dogs.

847
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,340
Remember kids,

848
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,380
if it's being recorded,

849
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,200
it isn't real.

850
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,460
If it's being recorded,

851
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,700
it isn't real.

852
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,380
Thank God.

853
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,760
This message brought to you by...

854
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,340
Boop!

855
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,700
Leave a message at the beep.

856
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:01,800
Boop!

857
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,240
Is this a whoopee cushion?

858
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,880
Yeah, whoopsie whoopsie.

859
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:05,420
Oh!

860
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,220
We can make a heart here.

861
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,240
Wait, yes, that is right.

862
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:09,880
That is correct.

863
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,080
If you are a guest here on the Thursey Neuron Pod Crust,

864
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,860
you too can possibly inflate a,

865
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,080
give your DNA sample to the whoopee cushion of...

866
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:20,300
Slurp!

867
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:20,940
Here it comes.

868
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:24,640
Or play the piano that makes the farts, burps,

869
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,760
and vomit noises.

870
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,080
Wow.

871
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,180
Thank you for your sample, Reverend Recurse.

872
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,140
Oh, into the mic, please.

873
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,520
I'm such an amateur.

874
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,360
We need so many sounds into that microphone.

875
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,460
It is not, not even funny.

876
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:41,940
Eleven.

877
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,120
Copyright infringement is your best entertainment value.

878
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,900
I don't know if you're familiar with the beds.

879
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,120
Speaking of eleven.

880
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,700
Is that a Crystal Pepsi?

881
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,200
This is, this is, I'm sorry, what?

882
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,320
I said, is that a Crystal Pepsi?

883
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:07,720
They...

884
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,400
Yes, it's actually...

885
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,260
What year is this?

886
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:10,680
1984.

887
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,040
Holy shit.

888
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:17,200
Was where, no, no, no, I mean, it's not, I mean, it's definitely not 1998, but it is

889
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,720
definitely a Crystal Pepsi brought from 1995.

890
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,060
Oh, my God.

891
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,200
1984.

892
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:20,920
I mean, 84.

893
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,500
Still fizzy as all get out.

894
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,080
Still fizzy.

895
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:32,680
Still tastes like invisible Pepsi and brought to you by Argus Fox, the person that can kill

896
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,140
a God.

897
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,340
That's like, that's like a museum piece.

898
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,640
That's, that's amazing.

899
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,260
It's fizzy.

900
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,380
It is so delicious.

901
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,980
It is so delicious.

902
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:49,060
Remember, you too can have your dose of the Kool-Aid if you visit the Jim Jones Lemonade

903
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:49,980
Stand.

904
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,380
Ask for the special blend.

905
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,040
So, when does this kick in?

906
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:00,420
That's so, like, two hours ago, dude, you've asked me that 10 times now.

907
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:22,420
Hey Dr. Chaga, Dr. Chaga, Dr. Chaga, where you going, where you going Dr. Chaga?

908
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,420
I really need you over here Dr. Chaga.

909
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,780
Dr. Chaga, could you please come to the Google Hangout stage?

910
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,580
Dr. Chaga, Dr. Chaga, could you please come to the Google Hangout stage?

911
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,520
Can you please come to the Google Hangout stage?

912
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,180
If I don't have somebody to distract the possession of-

913
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:34,800
I'll return later.

914
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,320
Well that's not helpful at all.

915
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,940
Anyway, so who are you here with?

916
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:45,960
Who, me?

917
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:46,520
Yeah.

918
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,520
Just me, myself, and I.

919
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,680
So you don't see me at all, you're just talking to yourself?

920
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,200
Yeah.

921
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,060
That's awesome.

922
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:58,320
Well, I mean, I thought it was a little weird at first, but I'm getting more used

923
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:58,680
to it.

924
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,380
You're doing great.

925
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:00,700
Thank you.

926
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,340
Sometimes you have to externalize the inner voices.

927
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,860
Sometimes, you know-

928
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,860
Because everyone really is looking at you.

929
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,700
It's the only way you can talk back to them.

930
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:17,480
So, the asshole that always follows you, he always is in the mirror when you wake up.

931
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,060
How does he find you?

932
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,620
You've moved several times.

933
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,780
Mirror people, brought to you by Stamps.com.

934
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,980
Can you print stamps now?

935
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:32,880
Is that a thing?

936
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,300
You can print so many stamps.

937
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,360
Are you kidding me?

938
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:38,180
Have you visited Stamps.com lately?

939
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,020
Is that legal?

940
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,860
You can make custom stamps.

941
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:47,300
Oh, they will take your money and give you the legal ability to make- for the listeners

942
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:54,400
at home that aren't Scrub members, we would like to mention that that was air quotes around

943
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,660
the- they will make- they will take your money and you will be able to print as many stamps

944
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:58,660


945
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,300
as you paid for.

946
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,580
Can I design my own stamps?

947
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,860
You can design your own stamps.

948
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,180
You can- but it doesn't really work as effectively if you haven't been taking your daily doses

949
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:08,660
of Scrum.

950
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,860
Yes, please inhale the Flarp.

951
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,680
Don't just exhale into it.

952
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:13,680
Thank you.

953
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,440
You're welcome.

954
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,640
I'm sorry, what?

955
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,040
Into the mic, your inner voice says.

956
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,060
Oh, I'm sorry, what did I say?

957
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,560
I- what did you just- I don't know.

958
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,740
I don't know.

959
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,880
As your inner voice, I only give guidance, not direction.

960
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,440
My inner voice is telling me I'm doing a not so great job.

961
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:45,080
The self-defeating lute that gives me warm comfort at night.

962
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,320
No wait, it's cold now, I'm gonna just pee.

963
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,080
My inner voice is an asshole.

964
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,420
Is this a-

965
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,020
I'm sorry, what?

966
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:54,780
Sorry?

967
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,520
You're in- you're in-

968
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,240
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

969
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,640
Did I not- did I not project that directly?

970
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,000
I don't think you- I don't think you-

971
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,480
into the microphone.

972
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,180
What did you say your inner voice was?

973
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,720
My inner voice is an asshole.

974
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,180
Okay, so you're-

975
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,080
So you're an asshole.

976
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,520
Well, for now, yes.

977
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,620
Okay, just keeping it real.

978
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:15,580
Yeah.

979
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:16,260
Yeah.

980
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:16,520
I mean-

981
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:16,840
Pretty much.

982
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,320
Internally, you know.

983
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:18,800
But you know what?

984
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:19,340
It's okay.

985
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:24,640
You're gonna be saved in a matter of five hours and fifty-seven minutes.

986
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,620
You too will be on your own pleasure saucer in the next episode of Scrum.

987
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:28,620


988
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:28,620


989
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:28,620


990
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:28,620


991
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:28,620


992
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:28,620


993
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:28,620


994
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:28,620


995
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:28,620


996
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:28,620


997
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:28,620


998
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,220
The original meaning of that is that your inner voice is not allowed unless you like the cold

999
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,560
comfort of a cruel thought.

1000
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,940
Do I get to keep my asshole at least?

1001
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,480
Is that-

1002
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,700
It- you know, it's your pleasure saucer.

1003
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,180
Where are you going to keep it?

1004
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,760
Uh, I don't know, my back pocket?

1005
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,960
If you could keep your asshole in any pocket, which one would it be?

1006
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
Here in my back pocket.

1007
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,600
That's a good pocket.

1008
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:51,980
That's appropriate.

1009
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:52,720
That's a good pocket.

1010
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,800
Thank you, Shazam.

1011
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:53,800


1012
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,200
You're welcome.

1013
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:58,600
Thank you.

1014
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:58,600


1015
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:58,600


1016
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:58,740
Oh.

1017
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,640
Maybe you shouldn't keep it back there.

1018
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,020
It seems angry.

1019
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,180
Oh my goodness.

1020
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,160
Is that natural rubber from the Amazon forest?

1021
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:17,960
Did we kill not enough indigenous people to get the flarp made without the stench of the trees themselves?

1022
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:18,640
It's okay.

1023
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,180
I thought we had diluted it down enough to where it wouldn't still smell like that.

1024
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,420
It's fair trade, so it's all we do.

1025
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:25,940
Fair trade.

1026
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,660
Fair trade whoopee cushions.

1027
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,880
Whoopee cushions.

1028
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,680
Whoopee cushions.

1029
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,900
Brought to you.

1030
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,500
Now available here at X Day only.

1031
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,620
It is a Thor's Inurin Podcrust special offer.

1032
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:50,780
You have, actually, right now is a great time, by the way, to wander up the hill and knock loud and hard on the cabin where Stang is staying.

1033
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:54,500
And make him take your $35.

1034
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,440
Please, please.

1035
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,120
Stang, let me onto the saucers.

1036
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,040
That is what you say.

1037
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,860
You'll have to try very hard.

1038
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,820
You have to say the magic words.

1039
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,580
He's going to be having an angry look on his face.

1040
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:15,780
You'll be tired, look at dark circles, possibly some sparks out of his ear.

1041
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,120
That's okay.

1042
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,360
It means he just popped off the charger a little too soon.

1043
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:25,940
But he will still take your money if you say, here, I take my money.

1044
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:26,320
What?

1045
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,460
What?

1046
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:27,880
kill me.

1047
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,520
I'm not sure you want to give them the choice.

1048
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,420
You really do. I mean, you don't

1049
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,620
want to, but you do.

1050
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,720
So I think we just passed the six

1051
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,180
hour mark. Holy crap.

1052
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,880
Now five hours and

1053
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,780
55 minutes until the

1054
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,980
landing of the exes to come

1055
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,000
and save the day, or save

1056
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,380
the ex day, taking the subgenius,

1057
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,960
the true devout, the zealots,

1058
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,140
the mind fuckery itself.

1059
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,860
Of the Church of the Subgenius.

1060
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,380
Up into outer space.

1061
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,760
Through the stratosphere.

1062
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,900
Off into the further regions

1063
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,740
of unknown universes.

1064
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,560
We will be out there floating,

1065
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:09,800
laughing,

1066
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:11,460
enjoying

1067
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,460
the pleasures that we

1068
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,320
delight so much in.

1069
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:23,980
Remember, folks, it's

1070
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,740
an interactive process here tonight

1071
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,200
on the Thor's Inurium Podcross

1072
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,260
Spectacular 100th episode.

1073
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,600
You too can join us by walking

1074
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,620
up to the mic at the front of the stage and speaking

1075
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,720
into it. Otherwise, we are unable

1076
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,300
to hear you and the

1077
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,560
interactive experience will just

1078
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,440
be forced at you instead.

1079
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:44,640
Like you like it.

1080
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,040
It'll just be active instead of interactive.

1081
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,020
It's the active experience. We cannot

1082
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,840
stop. The Thor's Inurium

1083
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,380
Podcross is a podcross

1084
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,200
that don't stop. Yo.

1085
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,000
Or possibly it does. But only

1086
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,140
after five hours

1087
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,120
and fifty-four minutes. It pauses for a

1088
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,200
cigarette every now and again. Pauses for a cigarette every now and then.

1089
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:07,240
Possibly soon. Gosh, it's been

1090
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:08,260
ages.

1091
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,100
Somebody could just come up here and help

1092
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,960
me kill time. It would be really

1093
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,500
appreciated. I need an accomplice.

1094
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,240
I need an accomplice.

1095
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,060
I need someone up here to help me

1096
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:21,080
kill time. It's not Murder

1097
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,280
One if you're a helper.

1098
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,980
And who is this?

1099
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,180
I'm sorry. Somebody's thrusting food

1100
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,340
at us, but it's okay because we have

1101
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,380
all the food we need on the

1102
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,240
pleasure saucer. Thank

1103
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,340
you very much. Your fried

1104
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,460
goods cannot help us

1105
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:43,720
now.

1106
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,260
Fried

1107
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,460
goods are not help. Thank you, though.

1108
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,480
I appreciate it. We actually need people

1109
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,140
to interact with the microphone.

1110
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,020
That is at the front of the stage. If you

1111
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,860
care to come up and interact with us, please

1112
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,860
remember, there's a live microphone

1113
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,060
hot as the lava in the

1114
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,780
molten core of this dying

1115
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,780
planet. Apparently you have to speak

1116
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:11,060
directly into it. Directly into the mic.

1117
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,660
As closely

1118
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,740
as possible. You are such a good learner.

1119
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,000
I just want to give you a gold

1120
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,080
star tonight. Aw. Thank you

1121
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,400
so much. One of our finest guests.

1122
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,020
Aw, I can't mean that.

1123
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,360
What was your name again?

1124
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,060
My name is Redacted.

1125
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,880
This is going to be best in the transcripts

1126
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,100
ever.

1127
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,960
You can only spell it by blacking it out, unfortunately.

1128
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,100
I actually know that language.

1129
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,260
I read it

1130
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:48,480
Right? That's

1131
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,320
how we say it in my

1132
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,900
hometown. Do the microphones

1133
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,700
pick up nodding and shaking your head?

1134
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,860
It's regional. It's colloquial.

1135
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:57,760
Yeah. Okay.

1136
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,720
Some do. Most of them don't.

1137
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,980
Are you nodding or shaking your head

1138
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:03,360
right now?

1139
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,060
For the listeners at home,

1140
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,500
we don't know either.

1141
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,760
Don't make me look at him.

1142
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:15,960
Don't make me look.

1143
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,920
Yes, I was nodding. For the record.

1144
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,940
So I take it, I need

1145
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,920
to nod directly at the microphone in order

1146
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,000
for it to pick up.

1147
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,460
Oh my goodness.

1148
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,660
I would like to thank Argus Fox

1149
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,440
and Cosmac.

1150
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,420
Somewhere out there they are.

1151
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,220
But in the background, the music

1152
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,060
they bring, it's so delightful.

1153
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,380
It's so delicious. It's sounds

1154
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,520
that can only

1155
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:51,000
be heard here tonight

1156
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,100
in the final hours

1157
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,780
on Earth.

1158
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:56,120
Enjoy them while you can.

1159
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,180
Thank you.

1160
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,440
How long do they got?

1161
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:03,480
Looks like we're down to

1162
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,780
5.51.

1163
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:08,140
Five hours and 51 minutes.

1164
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,420
Five hours and 51 minutes.

1165
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,440
...

1166
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,300
...

1167
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,340
...

1168
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,160
...

1169
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:18,580
...

1170
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:18,980
...

1171
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:18,980


1172
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:19,280
...

1173
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:19,280


1174
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,060
...

1175
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:20,060


1176
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:20,060


1177
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:20,060


1178
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,240
...

1179
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:21,240


1180
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:21,240


1181
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:21,240


1182
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:21,240


1183
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:21,240


1184
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:21,240


1185
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:21,240


1186
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:21,240


1187
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,400
...

1188
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,820
...

1189
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,980
...

1190
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,160
...

1191
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:43,440
...

1192
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,480
...

1193
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,040
...

1194
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:49,040


1195
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:49,040


1196
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:03,340
Don't mind me, I'm just staving off the possessed dolls that are running around the campgrounds,

1197
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:06,000
finding the people that haven't paid up their $35.

1198
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:18,080
Brothers and sisters, we're going to have church tonight.

1199
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:23,520
And tonight, this speaker is Robin Rufus Johnson.

1200
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,860
I want to smoke some weed and throw me a J.

1201
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,800
Thank you, Jesus.

1202
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,020
Thank you, Jesus.

1203
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,320
Thank you, Lord.

1204
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,540
Thank you, Lord.

1205
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:42,320
For letting me live another day.

1206
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,460
Nigga, I'm high.

1207
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,640
Nigga, you high.

1208
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,280
Let's get high in the motherfucking sky.

1209
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,700
Watch the butterflies hit the wall.

1210
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:53,360
And if you're feeling down, give your boy a call.

1211
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,720
Weed, it takes the stress away.

1212
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:56,920
That's why Bazaar.

1213
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,340
Smoke 10 blunts a day.

1214
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:01,080
It's nothing but the sticky, icky green stuff.

1215
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:03,440
Light it, pass it, and take a puff.

1216
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:04,900
Having a bad day?

1217
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,220
Stop by my house.

1218
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,680
Because most likely, I got a blunt in my mouth.

1219
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,440
So sit down, relax, and chill.

1220
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,920
And if you don't smoke weed, then shit, I got some pills.

1221
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,180
What you need, girl, a fucking refill?

1222
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,860
A fat bag of weed and some Happy Meal?

1223
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,500
Nah, baby, I don't smoke new ports.

1224
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,980
Only fat bags of weed in this escort.

1225
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,260
I wake up brazen.

1226
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,300
Got to be dead.

1227
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:33,280
I want to smoke some weed and Romeo and Jane.

1228
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,080
Thank you, Jesus.

1229
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,340
Thank you, Jesus.

1230
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,600
Thank you, Lord.

1231
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,820
Thank you, Lord.

1232
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:43,580
For letting me live another day.

1233
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,720
Hey, hey.

1234
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,140
Sunday morning, Bazaar half-baked.

1235
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,720
Blunt in my mouth, watching TJ Drake.

1236
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,260
Dangerous mind, just like Coolio.

1237
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,740
Only church I know is Snoop Dogg's studio.

1238
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,120
White House raps.

1239
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,180
Rolled in my lap.

1240
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:57,180


1241
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:57,180


1242
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,620
Grab the Hennessy.

1243
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,620
Get the abs a tap.

1244
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,220
I'm glad that I didn't move down soft.

1245
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,740
Take care of my kids.

1246
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,860
Be the man of the house.

1247
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,220
Orange mushrooms and yellow stars.

1248
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,740
Fat bags of Cheetos in mason jars.

1249
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,140
Get in the lap.

1250
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,200
Come on, jump in.

1251
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,180
Bring a bottle of gin and two of your freaky friends.

1252
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,160
Oh, fuck it.

1253
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,640
Let's go to Cedar Point.

1254
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:18,780
Bring your son along.

1255
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,240
Shit, he can hit the joint.

1256
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,800
Because rapping, it's a four-time job.

1257
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,160
All I want is smoke weed and praise God.

1258
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:25,640
Yeah.

1259
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,500
I'm praising God every day.

1260
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:34,400
I want to smoke some weed and throw me a J.

1261
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,400
Thank you, Jesus.

1262
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,600
Thank you, Jesus.

1263
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:38,880
Thank you, Lord.

1264
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:45,000
Thank you, Lord, for letting me live another day.

1265
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,120
Hey, hey.

1266
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:46,720
Take it down.

1267
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:47,340
Yeah.

1268
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,560
We're going to slow it down right now.

1269
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,080
We're having church up in here tonight.

1270
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:54,480
It's the Reverend Rufus Johnson.

1271
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,160
And we're sitting over here.

1272
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,460
We're here at 1650 Coney.

1273
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:06,160
And ladies and gentlemen, come and praise God with us at

1274
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:13,200
Prairie Grace, Baptist, Catholic, Jehovah Witness, Tabernacle.

1275
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:14,120
Yeah.

1276
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,820
Come praise God.

1277
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,300
Thank you, Jesus.

1278
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:18,560
Thank you, Jesus.

1279
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:19,160
Yeah.

1280
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:19,440
Services.

1281
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,780
Sunday at 420.

1282
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:27,120
Burns and Sisters Sunday at 420.

1283
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,860
Come on.

1284
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:29,900
Praise God.

1285
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,480
Just because you smoke weed don't mean you're a sinner.

1286
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:37,440
Just because you smoke weed don't mean you don't believe in God.

1287
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:40,700
Jesus will take care of you.

1288
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:42,600
Jesus.

1289
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,960
You need Jesus.

1290
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:52,280
Rufus T. Johnson did that under the name Bizarre.

1291
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,420
It's called the Gospel Weed Song.

1292
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:55,780
And now.

1293
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,340
White Rabbit.

1294
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:01,200
Done by Bob Walkenhorst.

1295
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,140
See the Rainmakers or subgenius.com.

1296
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,260
Praise Bob.

1297
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,600
Praise Bob.

1298
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,320
Okay.

1299
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:42,440
You can pray me when you're sinful.

1300
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:50,800
We going to have to dance down on this thing.

1301
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:51,260


1302
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:56,000
When she was just a little girl

1303
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:01,820
And if you go chasing rabbits

1304
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:06,460
And you know you're going to fall

1305
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,000
Tell them I'm the dog

1306
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,100
Smoking cat in the lard

1307
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:15,840
And it's getting you to call

1308
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,220
Call Alice

1309
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,800
When she's just gone

1310
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:30,000
When the man on the chessboard

1311
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,060
Didn't tell you where to go

1312
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:38,000
And if you're just a soft guy

1313
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,240
With lost room

1314
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:43,340
And your mind is moving along

1315
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,440
Call Alice

1316
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,380
Call Alice

1317
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,600
Call Alice

1318
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,560
I think she'll know

1319
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:57,400
With logic and proportion

1320
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:02,200
If all is not the case

1321
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,000
And your white night

1322
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,000
Is softened backwards

1323
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,660
And the reveries lost her head

1324
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,780
Remember

1325
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:14,300
Remember

1326
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:17,920
What the call now

1327
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,380
Said

1328
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,320
Leave your head

1329
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:28,180
Leave your head

1330
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,280
Leave your head

1331
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:48,280


1332
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:48,280


1333
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:48,280


1334
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:48,260


1335
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:48,260


1336
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:48,260


1337
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:48,260
