1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,740
We're going into places where men's minds are more tangled than the worst underbrush in the jungle, and I'm afraid.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,420
More afraid than I've ever been in my life.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,740
Everywhere we'll be met with lies and deceit.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,480
Your honesty and directness will only be handicaps.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,060
It would break my heart to see your strength and courage caught in the quicksands of civilization.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,920
Carsen always trusts Jane.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,120
Bob and Connie really enjoy life.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,080
Oh, yeah.

9
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,340
I pray for the subgenius.

10
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,220
Slack.

11
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,020
It was full of holes and was licking.

12
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,560
Wet and damp.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,160
My children and I thank you.

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,540
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

15
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,980
the star of our show,

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,180
America's number one funny man, Bob.

17
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,300
Praise Bob!

18
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,800
Now I want everybody to chant in unison,

19
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,900
We are abnormals.

20
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,000
We are abnormals.

21
00:01:59,660 --> 00:01:59,980
We are abnormals.

22
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


23
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,980
We are abnormals.

24
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,620
We are abnormals.

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:02,700
We are abnormals.

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:03,960
We are abnormals.

27
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:03,960


28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:03,960


29
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:03,960


30
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:03,960


31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,320
Any subgenius tells you to do that.

32
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,320
Don't do it.

33
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,420
Damn!

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,680
A little clip there from the Winterstar devival earlier this month.

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,340
And, yes, friends, welcome to the hour of Slack number 1085.

36
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,780
The first normal show that we've done in months.

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,740
That is, it's not a live show with a million pre-recorded bits,

38
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:37,180
mixed in, but a pre-recorded show with lots of live bits mixed in. Also, it's an unusually

39
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:44,660
explanatory show in that in honor of some news stations that have just started carrying the hour

40
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:50,100
of slack, we're going to actually explain the Church of the Subgenius and J.R. Bob Dobbs.

41
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,180
And we're happy to have the word of Dobbs carried to Richmond, Indiana by way of newly

42
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:03,680
in-sanctioned station WECI, joining such stalwarts as WQFS in Greensboro, North Carolina,

43
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:13,180
WEFT in Champaign, Illinois, WHUS in Mighty Stores, Connecticut, WICA in Milwaukee, WNPG in Portland,

44
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:22,000
Maine, and beloved WORT in Madison, Wisconsin, Mighty WREK in Atlanta, and WCSB Cleveland.

45
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,060
Plus on shortwave at 7.4.

46
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:32,240
One five mega Bob's at WBCQ Sundays at 11 Eastern, plus 19 godzillion internet shows,

47
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,120
all seen at subgenius.com.

48
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,460
Now this episode, friends, in explaining the mysteries of Bob and Slack will include our

49
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,160
very oldest church radio recordings and the very latest.

50
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,500
We'll hear some preaching at the Winter Star Symposium revival on February 10th,

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,160
and some puzzling evidence sub radio from KPFA Berkeley on February 10th.

52
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,000
On February 16th, with Dr. Howland, Dr. Philodrum, and were firstly free from forgiving

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,720
and unyielding, I'll hear from aポイント fromirk.

54
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,040
But before I get there, Japanese I have a show

55
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,800
to show on Facebook,

56
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,040
and if you'd like to listen to me speak Spanish, please go to my site, WCC, Highway two,

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:30,520
Texas friends in the year of 1980. If the last 50 years made such a change, just imagine the New

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:39,200
York of 1980 when everyone has a number instead of a name and the government tells you whom you

59
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:51,160
should marry. Just imagine 1980. Yes, imagine. Just imagine 1980. But this was not only one of the

60
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,660
first shows hosted by Mr. Opinion, but it was also our very first radio appearance ever, talking for

61
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:04,720
the first time in public about the Church of the Subgenius. They're here in the studio now, and I

62
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:12,260
thought we might chat with them for just a minute before we go back out to the fur auction. Reverend

63
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:19,840
Stang, are you any kin to Arnold Stang? No, thanks. I'm glad you brought that up. I'm no kin at all to

64
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,660
Arnold Stang.

65
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:28,020
I did notice that around the ankles you looked a whole lot like Arnold, and I thought maybe it was a

66
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,800
family trait. He may also be a true human like myself. That's very possible, though he doesn't

67
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,220
act like it, at least not any time I ever saw him. Really now, are you guys in this cult business

68
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:47,140
just for the bucks, or do you have some greater ambition in life? Well, we are definitely in it

69
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,140
for the bucks, I'd say. But the bucks are going to a good place.

70
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,600
Well, what is that? What is the good purpose? Our basic deal, this is our first time on the radio,

71
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,480
and so this may sound very cosmic for a lot of people. You're not real sure you're even on the

72
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,960
radio. You have to have a lot of faith in this business that you're actually on the radio.

73
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:15,820
We pretty much don't have any faith in anybody anywhere except while we're reading their little

74
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:21,140
pamphlets and books that they put out. Our basic deal is that the world is... Well, first, I want to correct you there.

75
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:29,780
How can you have a cult and not have faith? We have... In fact, the way that we choose to have faith is that we

76
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:38,020
believe everything we read while we're reading it. Or say we're watching TV, we believe the show that we're on,

77
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,300
The Incredible Hulk, for instance, may seem outlandish after the thing is off, but while you're watching it,

78
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:50,720
why not go for it, enjoy it for what it is? And then you actually have faith. You believe what you see when you see it.

79
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,680
Even if it's a TV show like that. Right. Plus, we can interpret these things in a subgenius way.

80
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:03,320
For instance, say The Incredible Hulk is a good symbolic subgenius. He's a... Normally, he's just a retiring,

81
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:10,980
mild-mannered, regular guy, but when you push him a little bit too far, go after his values or

82
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:17,000
something, he becomes the raging true human, the master human that... That's when his shirt tears.

83
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,700
Yeah, he gets green. And of course, we've got our...

84
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,180
our ever-present faith in our leader, J.R. Bob Dobbs. Yes, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

85
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:34,700
Where does J.R. Bob hang out? Does he... Do you guys frequently see him, or is he a person that...

86
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:42,760
Is he like the Reverend Moon, who is highly visible at times and then sheltered at other times?

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,880
Well, Bob is always sheltered, and he's never highly visible. He's a very reclusive person.

88
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,700
I see. Is that where a lot of the money goes? Yeah.

89
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,520
Or do you get to keep some for yourself? Oh, well, he pays us, but...

90
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,100
I see. As for what... He puts it into research,

91
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,800
pretty much. Time control research, genetic manipulation, that kind of thing. Basically,

92
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,220
what he's trying to do is unmask the conspiracy. He...

93
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,880
Conspiracy? What conspiracy is that? We're the conspiracy behind the conspiracy,

94
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,060
hunters behind the conspiracy. Oh, like the trilateralists and those people?

95
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,680
Uh-huh. Do you know about those people? We know... We have agents in the trilateralists.

96
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:20,680


97
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,780
Well, pardon me, I shouldn't be saying that kind of thing on the radio, but we do have

98
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,780
inside sources that inform us of what's going on in, say, the Trilateral Commission or the

99
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:38,160
Council on Foreign Relations. And we found that they are not the only ones that are behind

100
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,560
the conspiracy. They're not the only ones controlling what we say and do and think.

101
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,020
Do you tell your members what you find out? We tell our members pretty much everything.

102
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,280
I see. But you have to be a member... We tell them what to do, how to be a member,

103
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,080
where to work, how much money to send us.

104
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,900
Well, do you have to be a member to find out

105
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,840
all this vital information about the trilaterals and all that?

106
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,660
No.

107
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,020
Well, the trilateral information is available

108
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,920
through any good patriotic right-wing bookstore.

109
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,320
I mean, if I ask you a question right now,

110
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,780
is there a trilateral conspiracy?

111
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,200
Would you tell me, or do I have to pay you $10?

112
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,480
There absolutely is.

113
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,940
Everything you've heard about them,

114
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,640
the most paranoid theories you've heard about them,

115
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:16,960
are true.

116
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,360
It's all true.

117
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,460
It is true.

118
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,860
Did Bob Dobbs tell you this,

119
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,360
or did you find it out on your own?

120
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,380
Well, a combination of both.

121
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,060
The things revealed by Bob,

122
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,840
as well as explorations into different areas

123
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,120
by Mr. Stang and myself.

124
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,760
Yeah, we do a lot of research for him.

125
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:40,040
He'll say, well, we hear there's been a UFO landing in Omaha.

126
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,280
I want to know what that's about.

127
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,840
We'll fly up there, check out the radiation levels and so forth.

128
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,140
We believe that...

129
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,440
Walk around and measure the surface.

130
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,620
We do all that.

131
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,280
Plus, usually we are able to identify

132
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,840
which particular aliens have landed.

133
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Oh, there's different ones?

134
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,380
There's a lot of different ones.

135
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,840
There's some who have more control over things than others.

136
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,600
And see, that's the ultimate conspiracy right there,

137
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,660
is the fact that the trilateralists

138
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,080
and some of the other people that you've named

139
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,240
are actually being controlled by aliens from outer space.

140
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,320
By UFO people.

141
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,300
Yeah, this isn't illegal aliens in the sense of

142
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,840
people coming across the border.

143
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,280
These are people coming from the space,

144
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:18,660
borders.

145
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,980
Well, then they have a wider purpose than just taking over the world.

146
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,840
They want to take over the universe.

147
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,040
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

148
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,560
And we're just a cog in the...

149
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,180
Weird.

150
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,640
Yeah, they've got...

151
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,500
They, in general, do have a pretty good grip on most inhabited planets.

152
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,060
It's like an empire that they've got.

153
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,540
And the Earth is just one of their little...

154
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,800
Actually, we're nothing more than a rest stop for them on their cosmic journey.

155
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,660
We're a Stuckeys.

156
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,520
A Stuckeys in space, basically.

157
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,140
Is that right?

158
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,500
Gee, this is really hard for me to believe.

159
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,420
I've never heard anything as fantastic as all this.

160
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,360
Well, we get a lot of our sources through things that do sound fantastic.

161
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,820
We read a lot of cheap paperback books.

162
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,020
You know, we watch a lot of documentaries on TV and we believe it.

163
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,420
The public is fascinated.

164
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,020
Fascinated in a train wreck.

165
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,000
It's all mixed up.

166
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,280
It's all mixed, mixed, mixed, mixed.

167
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,860
Images that look like scenes from a battlefield.

168
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,120
The state-run media.

169
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,940
More of the white stuff is on the way.

170
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,420
Problem.

171
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:16,880
Problem.

172
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,160
It is another mystery.

173
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,140
Mysterious day of unconscious day.

174
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,040
More updates as developments warrant.

175
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,720
Mounting tensions boiled over.

176
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,920
We are eager.

177
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,660
Me and my friend are coming out to get some air.

178
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,780
Clear relationship with Al-Qaeda.

179
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,300
Probe.

180
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,760
Devastating condemnation.

181
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,720
We are a society in which celebrities...

182
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,220
Unconscious.

183
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,700
Unconscious.

184
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,160
Hard rock.

185
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,400
Rock.

186
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,680
Rock.

187
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:35,920
Rock.

188
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,140
Rock.

189
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,420
Some of the famous people.

190
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:37,840
Unconscious.

191
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,280
Unconscious.

192
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:38,760
Tragic.

193
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,640
No one would buy it.

194
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,180
It's tragic because...

195
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,060
It's tragic.

196
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,920
Illegal aliens not yet released.

197
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,960
It's not clear what...

198
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,380
Mother Earth.

199
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:45,920
Mother Earth.

200
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,160
Mother Earth.

201
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,620
Drugs.

202
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,560
88 inches.

203
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,020
Drugs.

204
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,160
The 39-year-old Playboy Playmate at a Jerusalem holy site.

205
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,120
Trash crowd.

206
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,300
A trash crowd.

207
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,260
That's us, friends.

208
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,400
A collage there by Norell Preff.

209
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,700
And now from Leimert.

210
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,660
Madam Speaker.

211
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,000
Members of Congress, I stink.

212
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,760
Madam Speaker, tonight I have stinked my own.

213
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,640
Our job is to make life better for our members of Congress.

214
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,540
We can do so with more taxes.

215
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
What we need is spending for this Congress.

216
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,480
And our job is to spend the people's money tonight.

217
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,960
Huge tax increases, huge deficits.

218
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,020
Our citizens don't much care.

219
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,220
2005 alone, $13,000 billion.

220
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,600
The greatest strength we have is the heroic poverty of the American people.

221
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,960
We must make sure children struggle.

222
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,620
We can make sure that children are not lost, that they are not living in poverty.

223
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:47,620


224
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:47,620


225
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:47,620


226
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:47,620


227
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:47,620


228
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:47,620


229
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:47,620


230
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:47,620


231
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:47,620


232
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:53,060
sure our children get the failing schools they need. And we can make sure our missing and

233
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:59,140
exploited children are prepared for the agricultural jobs of the future unless we stop them. God bless.

234
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,580
Let me do a quick survey here. Is there anybody here who doesn't know a damn thing about Church

235
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,900
of the Subgenius? Raise your hand. I'm not going to hurt you or anything. I'm just curious.

236
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,000
Well, then I'll give you a real quick, there's only a few, so I'll give you a real quick rundown.

237
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:25,380
Uh, basically, well, you know, some religions worship Jesus and other religions worship other

238
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,440
people. We worship this guy. Actually, he looks a little bit more realistic in this

239
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:39,540
freshly reprinted Revelation X book. This one says science fiction on the bottom,

240
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:46,320
and this one over here, the new book, says humor on the bottom. But I would appreciate it,

241
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,520
friends, if you see these.

242
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,520
things in your bookstore in the humor section, just kind of politely walk them over to the

243
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:00,100
religion section. Or Father's Day. Father's Day, they're also very popular for that.

244
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,140
It was one of the very, uh, progenitors. I went to see Billy Graham when I was about 13,

245
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,380
and I was a Christian for about an hour after that. He was fun to watch. Really? Yeah. He was

246
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,720
kind of like a mini Hitler.

247
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,160
Yeah.

248
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,460
Yeah.

249
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


250
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


251
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


252
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


253
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


254
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


255
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


256
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


257
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


258
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


259
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


260
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


261
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


262
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


263
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


264
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


265
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


266
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


267
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


268
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,600


269
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,040
He did his religion work, but yeah, he's a very dynamic speaker.

270
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,060
Ah, it still works.

271
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,680
Well, I don't know what all that religion stuff means, but I know one thing. The Church

272
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,820
of the Subgenius is the only true religion.

273
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:43,900
All those other ones are false religions in the disguise of true religion.

274
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, my God.

275
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,780
Oh, my God.

276
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,720
Well, that's all I need to know. Bob said it. I believe it. That does it. That's good

277
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,380
enough for me.

278
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,660
If I ever need to know the truth, I just go to my Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon, the

279
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,740
Hidden Teachings and Deuterocanonical Texts with J. R. Bob Dobbs. Who is worthy to open

280
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,980
a book and to break the seals thereof?

281
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,760
That's because, uh, we don't know the truth. We don't know what's in it. We don't know what's

282
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,580
we don't ascribe to those other

283
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,920
difficult to consume

284
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,460
religions

285
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,300
we like our

286
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,700
we like our

287
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,560
religion to be flavored with

288
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,280
complexity

289
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,460
and yet easy to swallow

290
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,320
we want it to go down easy

291
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,800
we don't want

292
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,940
anything where we have to think

293
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,040
about it for too long

294
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,980
because it just hurts like hell to think

295
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,180
that hard about your religion

296
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,380
there's too many questions

297
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,700
when you have to believe something

298
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,540
obscure

299
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,280
why have

300
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,360
faith if you don't need to

301
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,500
Bob proves it

302
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,040
you don't have to have faith

303
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,220
here's proof

304
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,540
faith is where you have to like believe in the evidence

305
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,240
believe without the evidence

306
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,020
you still have to believe

307
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,780
they make you believe

308
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,500
even though you have no

309
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:14,840
evidence

310
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,180
but

311
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,040
we're the church of the subgenius

312
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,240
you don't even need faith

313
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,280
because you've got Bob

314
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,900
you've got those dots up there

315
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,740
you've got that big face with those big dots

316
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,300
and that pipe is still smoking

317
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,380
and that's the important thing

318
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,560
because as long as that pipe is smoking

319
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,480
Bob will still be choking

320
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,780
some minutes of lucidity

321
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,000
there deftly plucked

322
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,800
from the maelstrom of the puzzling

323
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,640
evidence show from KPFA Berkeley

324
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,720
with Dr. Philo Drummond

325
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,280
and puzzling evidence but now

326
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,140
Mr. Fernando Nde

327
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,680
Lee Murr

328
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,400
Bob?

329
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,620
I wish I could think

330
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,600
Bob?

331
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,420
they obviously watch television

332
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,640
Bob?

333
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,180
who is Bob Dobbs

334
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,800
that's right

335
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:14,960
Bob?

336
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:14,960


337
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:14,960


338
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:14,960


339
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:14,960


340
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:14,960


341
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:14,960


342
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,400
, Bob Dobbs

343
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,060
Mr. Dobbs can you hear me?

344
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,620
Bob?

345
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,200
from PR news in Washington

346
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm kidnapped by the Ku Klux Klan

347
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,840
in a rural area east of Pakistan

348
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,660
it looks like people in large parts of the eastern US

349
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,220
would not take issue with new federal standards

350
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,500
for shivering in arctic air today

351
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,680
it looks like the senate will kick in cars and trucks

352
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,580
in Jackson, Mississippi next week

353
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,800

this is PR news

356
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
PR's bad

357
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,680
it looks like PR's bad

358
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,620
a 71 year old man rose in December

359
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,760
by the largest amount in 3 months

360
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,660
that's the word from the radio department

361
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,580
which says the increase was led by a large jump

362
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,240
in PR news in a rural area east of Washington

363
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,580
PR comes from

364
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,120
S-Advisors.com

365
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,460
truth is fiction

366
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,200
this is the horrid debacle

367
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,280
there was a shoe worn by the ancient Egyptians

368
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,780
there was a shoe worn by the ancient Egyptians

369
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,720
the orbit leanot

370
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,820
in a moment I'll tell you the story of a remarkable man

371
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
he outlived 17 wives

372
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,100
and he became the father of 4 children

373
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,740
without ever being caught

374
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,560
the orbit leanot

375
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,680
believe it or kill me

376
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,820
and now back to the very first appearance of any word of Bob on any radio station from 1980

377
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,860
let me ask you this

378
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,360
you call yourselves the subgenius foundation

379
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,780
and even though you're a genius, you're not a genius

380
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,660
even the word subgenius throws me for a loop

381
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,700
does this mean that you're all dumber than geniuses

382
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:48,980
or

383
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,060
oh yeah there's no doubt about that

384
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,900
I'd say almost anyone would admit that they are

385
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,260
below genius level

386
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,880
the term is a little bit more negative

387
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
probably than some people

388
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,100
would like to think

389
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,800
you know they don't want to think I'm below genius

390
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,520
well if you're a genius you can't belong to this organization

391
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,500
no it's not that

392
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,860
actually the term subgenius does not have anything to do with intelligence

393
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,100
but it more refers to

394
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,380
is

395
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,700
an attitude

396
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,500
not below genius but more like an alternate genius

397
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,000
beyond genius

398
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,020
you don't need intelligence to be

399
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,780
superior

400
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,400
you can be totally vacant

401
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,900
and still be a subgenius

402
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,240
there are a lot of master subgeniuses

403
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
totally void of any intelligence

404
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,480
morons as far as most people are concerned

405
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,300
is it possible that I'm one and don't even know it

406
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,320
it's more probable than possible

407
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,380
more probable than possible

408
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,340
there's a lot of latent

409
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:43,780
subgeniuses in the world

410
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,540
I'm sure there's a lot of people listening to me

411
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,000
well if I were walking down the street

412
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,600
are there any clues I could

413
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,040
if I looked at somebody walking down the street

414
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
could I pick up a clue as to whether or not

415
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,820
they were a subgenius just by the way they acted

416
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,300
to a certain extent you can spot them

417
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,180
most weirdos and eccentrics are

418
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
in some ways

419
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,220
so they may not have their act completely together

420
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,280
you might get a slight whiff of their psychic aura stench

421
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,180
and that might be something

422
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,460
if you were a subgenius

423
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,180
I see

424
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,780
if you have any psychic aura stench

425
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,240
you might have to pick up a clue

426
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,160
does it often smell like cheap wine for instance

427
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,140
no it's more like

428
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,500
that is a common

429
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,280
that's to the sensitives

430
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,700
the true sensitives

431
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,680
well folks I'm sure you're just as fascinated

432
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,140
by all this as I am

433
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,020
Super Bowl Church

434
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,900
the Super Bowl Church

435
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,740
the Super Bowl Church

436
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,280
the Super Bowl Church

437
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,900
the show the match up on the

438
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,840
the Super Bowl Church

439
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,780
the Super Bowl Church

440
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,120
the Super Bowl Church

441
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,620
rules prohibit doubt

442
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,740
all year long

443
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,600
silly things

444
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,560
gay bash

445
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,380
doubt

446
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,700
all kinds of things

447
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,020
the Super Bowl Church

448
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:07,000
the Super Bowl Church

449
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,000


450
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,260
how do you live this way

451
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,420
sit in the tightest chair

452
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,760
The Super Bowl Church.

453
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,900
Now, Superman.

454
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,580
Tireless fighter for soup and justice.

455
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,740
Able to leap the weak and the oppressed at a single bound.

456
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,640
Superman.

457
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,240
Up in the sky.

458
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,040
Look.

459
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,140
It's Superman.

460
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,680
Good tickets dark.

461
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,700
Following instructions, Superman sways and groans and yawns suddenly.

462
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,260
And remember, Superman had just escaped from San Miguel prison.

463
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,040
Tune in next time.

464
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,140
Can the man of soup hang over the town of Doobville?

465
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,700
Be sure to tune in the next thrilling installment of the amazing transcription feature, Superman.

466
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,740
Yeah, Bob Dobbs was originally the salesman.

467
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,140
But he was an incredibly lucky salesman.

468
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,020
He was like, I don't know if he was talented.

469
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,880
But he was just simply the luckiest guy that ever lived.

470
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,560
And that made him the world's greatest salesman.

471
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,860
Which then put him into the religion business.

472
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,820
Where your product doesn't even have to exist at all.

473
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,660
It's pure profit.

474
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:35,920
So, and in 1953, Bob, depending on the accounts, either was seized up in the spirit by the alien space monster Jehovah One.

475
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,800
Or he stepped in a puddle while he was trying to fix his television set with the back opening.

476
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,020
Either way.

477
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:50,020
He's had this vision in which he was shown that throughout history, the world has been controlled by a conspiracy.

478
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,980
A huge conspiracy with almost everybody involved.

479
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,700
The conspiracy of the normal people.

480
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,800
Taking away the slack of the subgeniuses, which was this whole other species, it turned out.

481
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,540
Descended from the Yeti, or so-called abominable snowman.

482
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,240
Abominable.

483
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,460
They don't know.

484
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:19,780
Anyway, I don't want to get into the sexual aspects of subgenius and gigantopithecus.

485
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,400
Oh, we'll get there.

486
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,200
Well, the whole thing is sex.

487
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,160
Bob is sex.

488
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,460
Bob is money.

489
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,840
Bob is drugs.

490
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,280
Bob is enlightenment.

491
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,380
Bob is clip art.

492
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,920
Why can't he be all of those things?

493
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,800
You know, people have said, well, is this a joke or is it a religion?

494
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,680
It's like, well, why not both?

495
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,020
Who made the rules?

496
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,060
They're right.

497
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,180
It's a dual that it couldn't be both.

498
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:52,800
In fact, because we admit that we're full of crap, that could mean that we're the only religion that's actually not totally full of crap.

499
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,120
Isn't that peculiar and distressing?

500
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:05,680
Luckily, we're not jealous and you can be a subgenius and an Amish or a Buddhist or whatever, a snake handler.

501
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,300
We're looking for more snake handlers.

502
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,260
.

503
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,180

520
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,300
Heaven Knows Slack by Norrell Preff from norrellpreff.com.

521
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:57,260
And before that, some preaching from Winterstar 2007, produced by Ace here in Cleveland,

522
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,180
and some Lee Murr and Norrell cut-ups.

523
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,140
But now, back to Fort Worth, Texas, where Philo and I grew up in the year of 1980,

524
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:12,520
which happens to be 27 years ago when I was 27.

525
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:21,720
As we mentioned before, we have in our studios tonight the two founding fathers,

526
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,520
I assume your fathers, or fathers-to-be, of the Subgenius Foundation,

527
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,240
the Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond.

528
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,940
And they are, as we mentioned before, the dual heads of the Subgenius Foundation,

529
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,380
which is the publishing and PR arm of the Church of the Subgenius.

530
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,780
And as we learned during our last little chat about 25 minutes ago,

531
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,420
these guys are in this for the bucks, folks.

532
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,840
They're not, by any way, shape, or form, intending to put down organized religion.

533
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,440
We're just trying to build up disorganized religion.

534
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,540
I see. Okay.

535
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,620
And we're plenty disorganized.

536
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,180
If you call in, I'm sure they'll be glad to answer any of your questions.

537
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,780
And as a matter of fact, they're going to answer one of mine right now.

538
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,900
I'd like to know, I understand, I guess, what the Subgenius Foundation is.

539
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,680
It's the publishing arm of the Church of the Subgenius.

540
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,540
But what in the world, or what in the outer afterworld,

541
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,920
or what beyond the sphere of this world is the Church of the Subgenius?

542
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,160
Well, the Church itself,

543
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,120
the Church itself,

544
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,740
the Subgenius was founded several decades ago, really,

545
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,080
by J.R. quote Bob unquote Dobbs, who...

546
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,240
You got us wrong, really.

547
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,620
We're not the founding fathers.

548
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,280
We're just the guys that were hired to promote the whole thing.

549
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,040
Oh, I see.

550
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:58,960
To finally release the mystic knowledge that Bob himself has acquired over the years,

551
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,020
over his many travels.

552
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,740
I see.

553
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,780
It's very strange.

554
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,760
The way that he started the cult was originally he was just a salesman,

555
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,920
and he was...

556
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:15,420
But he was interested in weirdos, in extremism of every shape and form.

557
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,960
Plus the perfect money-making formula.

558
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:19,780
Yeah, right.

559
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:25,000
He kind of had somewhere in his mind, he knew that there existed the perfect formula,

560
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,920
a mathematical, almost, formula for making money.

561
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:34,640
And he started off just actually making fun of extremism.

562
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,880
But slowly,

563
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,360
he developed his whole little dogma system, you know, to go with it.

564
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,980
Made it up off the top of his head.

565
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:47,300
But what he began to find more and more that what he was making up was turning out to be true.

566
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,400
I see.

567
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,200
Right.

568
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,880
Subgenius.com

569
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,560
Bob.

570
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,020
Exploring Tomorrow.

571
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,740
And now, here is your guide to these adventures of the mind.

572
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,680
Subgenius.com.

573
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,580
Subgenie.

574
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,020
Subgeniuses.

575
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,880
Creature that came in a bottle and had such wonderful powers.

576
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,360
Subgeniuses.

577
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,120
Subgenie.

578
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,460
Uh, interesting people who try to enslave, you know.

579
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:16,900
Good.

580
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,020
Planet of Destination.

581
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,480
Good.

582
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,460
Backward planet.

583
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,860
I will be carrying a nuclear blaster under my coat.

584
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,540
I don't know a more beautiful sight in the universe.

585
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,980
Stand by for possible action.

586
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,080
Another stupid scientific experiment.

587
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:28,980
We're going down.

588
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:29,480
What?

589
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,640
I know, I've heard it all.

590
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,260
What?

591
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,600
I should be able to observe a pretty good cross-section of the subgenius rays.

592
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,540
Come on, let's get moving.

593
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,380
Grow up, learn, love, laugh, weep and die like pure subgenius stuff.

594
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:40,700
Yeah.

595
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,740
Well, we don't want the subgenius people learning the truth, do we, Professor?

596
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,580
Planet of Destination.

597
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,080
Shut up, I'm thinking.

598
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,980
What did you say?

599
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,560
Well.

600
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:50,880
Ha!

601
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,420
There are too many paradoxes.

602
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,200
A whole world of long-haired dreamers.

603
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:54,900
I don't trust them.

604
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,860
Of course you don't understand them.

605
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,400
You're too, I mean, too stupid.

606
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,000
Well, Professor, I happen to be the man who will decide what to become of this planet

607
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,080
of subgeniuses.

608
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,740
Unbuckle that blaster.

609
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,220
Now I've got you where I want you.

610
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,200
Send back your food!

611
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,120
Send back your food!

612
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,660
Don't!

613
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,060
Don't!

614
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,260
Your stomach's salty.

615
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,580
Blow!

616
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,220
Blow!

617
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,360
We thought we were keeping a planet full of subgeniuses in ignorance.

618
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,820
If you want to teach a planet full of subgeniuses to do tricks for you, first make sure you

619
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,500
know more than the subgeniuses.

620
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,100
You can enslave some kinds of entities.

621
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,540
But you can't enslave.

622
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:43,400
You can't impose on entities who are more intelligent, more thoughtful, more wise than

623
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:43,920
you yourself.

624
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,840
What will happen is they'll turn out to be helping you in disguise.

625
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,880
You will live longer and you will arrive alive.

626
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,100
A fine Norellian chop there and now lemur.

627
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,960
.

628
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,760
Come in.

629
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,060
Come in.

630
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,840
Be with you in a minute.

631
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,400
I'm on the phone.

632
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:09,900
Oh.

633
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,680
Mm-hmm.

634
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,720
You should know that.

635
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,460
You of all people.

636
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,140
Oh.

637
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,900
Mm-hmm.

638
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,480
Oh.

639
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,080
Mm-hmm.

640
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,580
Okay.

641
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:18,840
Hello?

642
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,020
Is this Philip Marlowe?

643
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,680
Yeah.

644
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,760
Yeah, I guess so.

645
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,820
Oh, no.

646
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,300
No, I can't believe that.

647
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,360
What?

648
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,280
Yeah, Bob teaches slack.

649
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,080
Slack is anything you can do.

650
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,080


651
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,080


652
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,080


653
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,080


654
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,080


655
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,080


656
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,080


657
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,080


658
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,260
You want it to be.

659
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,480
That's another great thing about our religion.

660
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,200
We're not going to tell you what slack is for you.

661
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,220
The conspiracy will tell you all day.

662
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,360
Every version of the conspiracy has a different.

663
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,140
Some of them will say that Marlboro Lights are slack.

664
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,780
Another one will say Bud Light is slack.

665
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,500
Another one will say that TV show is slack.

666
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,740
That may be slack for some of you.

667
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:02,700
But you know, like I shouldn't say, those who know don't say and those who say don't

668
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,540
know.

669
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,160
I should have known.

670
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,600
I keep trying to learn better at this.

671
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,280
Well, so that's subgenius 101.

672
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,180
What else do they need to know?

673
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,140
Oh, the world ends July 5th, 1998.

674
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,420
Bob said that at 7 o'clock in the morning.

675
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,060
Now Bob made that prophecy long ago.

676
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,920
The year that the world calls 1998 came and went.

677
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,660
We're still here.

678
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,020
But now you notice that the Jehovah's Witnesses, they predicted the end of the world many times.

679
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,360
And they finally quit doing it.

680
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,780
Well, we're not wimps like them.

681
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,880
We're a thousand million times more fanatical than any other religion.

682
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,400
And we don't care how many times the world fails to end on July 5th at 7 a.m.

683
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,980
It's going to end July 5th, 7 a.m., 1998.

684
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,460
And when the world ends, we'll be able to reset our calendars and know what time it

685
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:53,980
really is.

686
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,320
That's the way it works.

687
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,500
Bob sold it.

688
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,440
I smoked it.

689
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,500
That settles it.

690
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,000
We have an interesting story.

691
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,000


692
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,000


693
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,400
We have a new slogan, brand new one.

694
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,040
We have many.

695
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,320
The church has nothing but slogans, actually.

696
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,020
But the latest one is, Church of the Subgenius, tipping sacred cows since 1953.

697
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,840
And that's no bull.

698
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,900
Praise the bull.

699
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,860
But here's another slogan.

700
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,440
Now this is a good one.

701
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:27,560
This also involves Reverend Dennis Murphy here, who's of the rival cult, Cult of the

702
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,120
Living Bull.

703
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,640
I trust you all have been ordained in that one, too.

704
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,320
I certainly have.

705
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,160
It happened in my first Starwood.

706
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,680
Dennis came up to me two years ago and said, hey, I got a new slogan for you.

707
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,600
Church of the Subgenius.

708
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,560
It's a no-brainer.

709
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,780
I was like, where's that one been all our lives?

710
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,080
Why didn't we think of that already?

711
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,360
Well, I put it as a big slogan on the bottom of this book.

712
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,560
And when I told Dennis about it, he said, did I say that?

713
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,300
So friends, that validates the fact that it is a slogan.

714
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:02,300


715
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:02,300


716
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,340
It is indeed a no-brainer.

717
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:11,540
We're all kind of on the same level playing ground, I'm afraid, with kindergarten children.

718
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,480
But one thing Bob said was, you'll pay to know what you really think.

719
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,840
And any of you who also run a bogus cult will know that that's true.

720
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,300
People will indeed pay to know what they think.

721
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,400
Although Bob's spouse, Connie Dobbs.

722
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:28,980
Hmm.

723
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:34,440
Connie said, you lay to know what you really think.

724
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,500
And that is more slackful in some ways.

725
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,840
Just laying there.

726
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,840
Just laying there.

727
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,240
That's frop inaction.

728
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,360
The inaction of frop.

729
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,680
Frop is our drug, by the way.

730
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,500
Most cults have some kind of drug that they claim is not a drug.

731
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,200
In some cases, they just don't let people sleep.

732
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,320
And anti-sleep is their brainwashing tool.

733
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,960
But it's not a drug.

734
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,600
And some of them use rhythmical chanting and so forth.

735
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,900
But we use frop, which is this Tibetan herb that grows on the ground.

736
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,900
It's very rare.

737
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,640
There was a movie made about it, The Werewolf of London, 1933 movie.

738
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,120
Because this plant that grows in Tibet was the only thing that could keep the guy from

739
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,360
turning into a werewolf.

740
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,640
He'd have to get it.

741
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,960
But the plant only blooms in the moonlight.

742
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,880
It only grows on the graves of Tibetan holy men.

743
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,540
Or on the ground that has been fertilized by the dung of the Yeti.

744
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,980
So getting hold of frop is not easy, even for a high place subgenius like me.

745
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:44,700
But the good thing is you only need it once because you never, ever, ever come down.

746
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,460
And once again, we see living proof of that.

747
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,360
Just walked in.

748
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,560
Nice pop.

749
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,860
A lady just entered the room.

750
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,880
Man, don't you have any manners?

751
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,080
You're supposed to stand up.

752
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,860
Offer a sandwich.

753
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:57,860


754
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:57,860


755
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,420
Hey, take your hats off.

756
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,500
I don't need it.

757
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:00,800
Oh, never mind.

758
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,420
Saint Stymie de Bergerac.

759
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:12,980
Now, Saint Stymie added the slogan, God works in mysterious ways, but Bob plays in mysterious

760
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,540
ways.

761
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,720
Isn't that cosmic?

762
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,540
Yeah, it's a pipe, all right.

763
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,980
Sure is a lot of pipe.

764
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,640
Yeah.

765
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,240
It's a genuine one.

766
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,860
Hey, Bob.

767
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:27,860


768
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:27,860


769
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:27,860


770
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:27,860


771
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:27,860


772
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:27,860


773
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:27,860


774
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,940
Hey, Beaver, let's try smoking it.

775
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,020
Smoke it?

776
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,200
You mean us?

777
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,120
Sure.

778
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,600
Gee, well, I don't want to get in trouble, but you said your mom's out shopping.

779
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,340
Yeah.

780
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,380
But what if Wally came in and caught us?

781
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,480
He's out playing basketball.

782
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,380
And if there's no one here to catch us, then it's all right to do it.

783
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,980
But we don't have any smoke stuff.

784
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,480
Oh.

785
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,760
Sure we have.

786
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,840
Look in here, Beaver.

787
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,580
What's that?

788
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,680
We had a party last night at my house.

789
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,760
Well, that's real neat.

790
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,240
But I don't think we should smoke it.

791
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,620
What's the matter?

792
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,280
Are you a chicken?

793
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,920
You must be chicken.

794
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,500
No.

795
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,440
But I don't like to do stuff I'm told not to do.

796
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,340
Come on, Beaver.

797
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,600
Are you a chicken or aren't you?

798
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,720
I'm a chicken.

799
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,720
I am a chicken.

800
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,660
Well, I don't think I know how to smoke.

801
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,140
Just put it in your mouth and breathe.

802
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,360
That's all there is to smoking.

803
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,260
It's just like blowing bubbles, only you breathe the other way.

804
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:37,860
Ha.

805
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,160
Now, give me a match.

806
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,320
Oh.

807
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,400
Isn't there any other way we could light it?

808
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,480
Well, I'm not supposed to touch matches.

809
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,120
Ha.

810
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,200
Okay, Beaver, I'll light it, and you watch me.

811
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,000
Tastes so good.

812
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,220
Smells so good.

813
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,980
How do you feel, Beaver?

814
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,000
Pretty good.

815
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,780
You're wasted.

816
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,700
Gee.

817
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,080
Hey, guys, the crowd's getting restless in there.

818
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,700
Hey, what's going on?

819
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,200
What's wrong?

820
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,800
We can't go on.

821
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,100
We had the demon's pick.

822
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,340
But then we broke it.

823
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,960
And now our masterpiece

824
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,700
will never come.

825
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:54,700


826
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,280
We can't pay the rent

827
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,400
because we won't be fueled by Satan.

828
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,800
Come on, get up, get up.

829
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,280
Come on, stand up.

830
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,660
You're all right.

831
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,080
You guys,

832
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,420
having some satanic guitar pick

833
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,960
isn't going to make your rock any better

834
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,600
because Satan's not in a guitar pick.

835
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,760
He's inside all of us.

836
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,860
He's in here,

837
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,640
in your hearts.

838
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,900
He's what makes us not want to go to work,

839
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:21,800
exercise,

840
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,480
or tell the truth.

841
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,580
He's what makes us want to party

842
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,080
and have sex with each other all night long.

843
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,200
He's that little voice in your mind

844
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,320
that says,

845
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,300
fuck you to the people you hate.

846
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,680
Now, you can stay out here

847
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,100
and fight on the ground

848
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,160
and cry like babies.

849
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,040
Or you can go in there

850
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,420
like friends

851
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,700
and rock.

852
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,540
So what's it going to be?

853
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,680
What's it going to be?

854
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,520
Let's go in there

855
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,580
and show them what tenacious

856
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:54,700
is.

857
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,740
What tenacious D is all about.

858
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,100
Yeah.

859
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,900
I already got a guitar pick anyways.

860
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,080
The little skinny fellow with the big ears,

861
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,060
he's still following us.

862
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,980
Following us?

863
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,280
What little skinny fellow?

864
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,300
But first,

865
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,600
say this has been a busy day, gang,

866
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,940
what with an exciting,

867
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,960
dramatic-looking,

868
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,000
grinning devil's head

869
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,200
and the outstretched red and black wings

870
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,000
and everything.

871
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,840
Boy, is that a humdinger.

872
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,480
Look,

873
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,400
looks gay, doesn't it, Jim?

874
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:25,960
Uh-huh.

875
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,400
Yeah.

876
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,900
Get over it!

877
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,540
Golly!

878
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,360
Oh, jeez.

879
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,480
Ha-ha.

880
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,400
There's more mystery and excitement

881
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,580
ahead, fellows and girls,

882
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,600
so miss it.

883
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,780
Yes, yes,

884
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,000
and that is so true.

885
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,200
How can we,

886
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,460
how can we further

887
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,020
the word of Bob

888
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,620
in the,

889
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,720
in our daily lives?

890
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,980
Well, we can

891
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,540
put on the Dobsian mantle

892
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,400
and assume a Dobs-like nature.

893
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:52,960
Oh, this thing's here.

894
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,720
Yes,

895
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,020
this is,

896
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,020


897
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,660
once this is done,

898
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,980
it is similar in heaviness

899
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,920
to the leaden robes

900
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
worn in purgatory

901
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,760
by the, uh,

902
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:02,820
sufferers.

903
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,600
Why do I smell that pipe smoke?

904
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,240
Yeah, you have to breathe

905
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,160
in that pipe smoke

906
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,400
while touching to, uh...

907
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:07,620
Thank God.

908
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,260
Thank Dobbs,

909
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,560
you can still smell it

910
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,060
because as long as it's there,

911
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:11,940
we can relax

912
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,560
in the safety

913
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,620
of our own delusions.

914
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,280
I always kind of like,

915
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,260
like the odor,

916
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,680
and I don't mind

917
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,760
cigar smoke either.

918
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,700
It's just cigarette smoke

919
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,200
that I really can't...

920
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,060
It has that acrid, uh...

921
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,020
That chemical,

922
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,500
that chemical tang

923
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,540
that gets in the corner

924
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,120
of your eyes

925
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,660
and gets up

926
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,520
into your sinuses

927
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,840
and deep down

928
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,680
into the lungs

929
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,440
and spoils the experience.

930
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,720
Even walking down the street

931
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,240
and trying to smell

932
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,280
the night air,

933
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:36,620
suddenly,

934
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,320
oh God,

935
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:37,900
there's somebody

936
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,740
that walked away

937
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,180
and has to

938
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,300
smell the machine.

939
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,900
Some people smell

940
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,540
the cigarette smoke.

941
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,700
Yes, they do.

942
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,780
Uh, just the way

943
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,720
I like the smell

944
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,460
of pipe smoke.

945
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,800
So you see,

946
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,060
there are many

947
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,100
different varieties

948
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,340
of personal taste

949
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,560
and personal choice.

950
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,320
You know,

951
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,200
you don't have to have

952
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,820
the froth,

953
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,000
but you have to have Bob

954
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,980
and you have to have slack.

955
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,180
You actually were born

956
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,400
with original slack.

957
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,480
Everybody is,

958
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,240
but they start

959
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,100
trying to steal it away

960
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,560
from you

961
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,540
from the minute you're born.

962
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,980
You just spank your behind

963
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,720
and make you cry.

964
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,000
Well, maybe you didn't

965
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,540
want to cry,

966
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,640
but that's the way

967
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,140
they do it

968
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,880
from the get-go.

969
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,920
And, I mean,

970
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,500
do you have...

971
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,100
Do you have enough slack?

972
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:14,980
It's what you best

973
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,640
ask yourself.

974
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,880
And if you don't even

975
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,620
know what it is,

976
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,660
then you definitely don't.

977
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,840
But it's because

978
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,100
somebody else has it

979
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,600
or else you're not

980
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,720
paying attention

981
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,520
to the slack

982
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,400
you already have.

983
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,500
Lots of people go,

984
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,860
Reverend Stang,

985
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,120
I sent in my 30 bucks

986
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,100
and you ordained me,

987
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,340
but I still don't have slack.

988
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:32,940
I was like,

989
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,780
well, what exactly

990
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,200
did you think slack was?

991
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,460
Some product

992
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,640
we could bottle and sell?

993
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,540
If that was the case,

994
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,020
the conspiracy

995
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,820
would have won

996
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,700
already completely.

997
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,380
There'd be no Bob at all.

998
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,400
Because the pink boy

999
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,920
doesn't believe in slack.

1000
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,760
The pink boy,

1001
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,640
the human,

1002
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,140
the normal,

1003
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,040
the mediocrity,

1004
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:49,840
the Barbies,

1005
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,440
the Kins,

1006
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,820
the cage dwellers,

1007
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,200
you know,

1008
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:52,660
them,

1009
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,700
everybody you know,

1010
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,200
you don't like.

1011
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,720
That's the conspiracy.

1012
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,260
Everyone who has ever

1013
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,460
bothered you in any way.

1014
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,840
They don't believe in slack.

1015
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,140
They can only get satisfaction

1016
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,920
from power over others

1017
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,800
or from things.

1018
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,620
Everything's me, me, me.

1019
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,420
They're a bunch of

1020
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,520
meanderthals,

1021
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,880
my friends.

1022
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,180
Subgeniuses are

1023
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,800
just as selfish, actually,

1024
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,320
but they're more polite about it.

1025
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,260
There was alternative everything

1026
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,100
because this was a community

1027
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,200
that was throwing out

1028
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:23,680
the old rules

1029
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,300
and living by an entirely

1030
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,500
new set of values.

1031
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,000
The concept of love

1032
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,380
is a public phenomenon.

1033
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,460
The mention of love

1034
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,360
in a public way,

1035
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,500
be outside of the church.

1036
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,320
This is the first

1037
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,180
I heard of it.

1038
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,520
Love, peace, man,

1039
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,020
you know,

1040
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,720
love and peace.

1041
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,900
That was the refrain.

1042
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,860
The concept was that

1043
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,000
life was there to be experienced fully.

1044
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,200
Experience everything.

1045
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,920
Have no fear.

1046
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,980
Make no plans.

1047
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,800
Make no career plans.

1048
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,160
Test and enjoy the limits of life.

1049
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,380
La, la, la, la, la, la,

1050
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,260
live for today.

1051
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,420
La, la, la, la, la, la,

1052
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,400
live for today.

1053
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,880
Professional dropouts.

1054
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,720
Dropouts from middle class ideology,

1055
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,820
success ideology.

1056
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,780
Pay your actors $5 a performance.

1057
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,740
You can live on $25 a week.

1058
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,200
That's assuming you're doing something

1059
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,060
you're interested in

1060
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,140
and something that's valuable.

1061
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,660
If you're not doing anything

1062
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,260
that's interesting,

1063
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,560
then you gotta get a lot of money, Mac.

1064
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,860
You gotta make a fortune

1065
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,440
to keep a boring job

1066
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,780
or to support a war in Vietnam

1067
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,440
that's evil,

1068
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,500
that's murderous.

1069
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,940
So we struggle in our own humble way

1070
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,540
to destroy the United States.

1071
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,500
La, la, la, la, la, la,

1072
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,360
live for today.

1073
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,580
La, la, la, la, la, la,

1074
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,480
live for today.

1075
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,520
So is it a harmless type church?

1076
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,760
I mean, you guys don't own a plantation

1077
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,720
in South America

1078
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,980
or anything like that, do you?

1079
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:52,800
No, it's completely

1080
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,360
harmless.

1081
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,220
Well, it's harmless to those

1082
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,180
who mean us no harm, certainly.

1083
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,360
We're out to spread a message

1084
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,800
that there is harm meant

1085
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,600
in other quarters, not through us.

1086
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,280
Oh, I see.

1087
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,680
If someone opposed you,

1088
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,640
then you might flash a pamphlet

1089
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,280
in their face

1090
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,560
or some other devious thing might...

1091
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,760
We found that our literature

1092
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,740
drives off vampires, for instance.

1093
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:15,500
It does.

1094
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,140
You don't need...

1095
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,580
Garlic or crucifix, right?

1096
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,380
This stuff repels not only vampires,

1097
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,140
but also other...

1098
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,540
People who've approached us

1099
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,480
in airports before

1100
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,820
have been turned away

1101
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,620
after reading our...

1102
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,020
People who are terminally normal,

1103
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:31,880
I'd say,

1104
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,300
have a lot of trouble.

1105
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:33,740
I see.

1106
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,320
In airports,

1107
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,640
when you're approached

1108
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,620
by the shahnana

1109
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,380
or other religious cults,

1110
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,260
what do you do to them?

1111
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,720
Have you heard the word of Dobbs?

1112
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,000
We just turn it around on them.

1113
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:43,060


1114
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:43,360


1115
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,560
they can hand us their...

1116
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,660
And you wave one of your pamphlets

1117
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,260
in their face

1118
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:46,940
and ask for money?

1119
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:47,340
Uh-huh.

1120
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,600
Have you ever had any takers?

1121
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,060
We have pretty much...

1122
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,720
We have been financially

1123
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:52,900
in the past

1124
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:52,900


1125
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:52,900


1126
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,140
unbelievably successful.

1127
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,840
This thing has just taken off

1128
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,380
like mad.

1129
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:56,780
I see.

1130
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,900
Our membership doubled overnight

1131
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,660
at one point.

1132
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,300
It went from six to 12 people.

1133
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,060
It's probably because

1134
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,480
we don't claim to be

1135
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,720
a religious organization.

1136
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,600
We admit from the beginning

1137
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,240
that we're a religious cult.

1138
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:10,900
Yeah.

1139
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,280
I see.

1140
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,720
We're not tax-exempt either.

1141
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,880
This isn't a scam.

1142
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,800
Well, have you, say,

1143
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,460
taken in well over $100?

1144
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,000
Oh, at least.

1145
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,440
Yeah, I'd say at least.

1146
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,780
It might even be $125 financially.

1147
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:22,880
Yeah.

1148
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:22,880


1149
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:22,880


1150
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:22,880


1151
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:22,880


1152
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:22,880


1153
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:22,880


1154
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:22,880


1155
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,720
Good grief.

1156
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,820
Can you believe that, folks?

1157
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,300
Look, there's such...

1158
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,260
There it is.

1159
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,000
This?

1160
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:30,620
Yeah.

1161
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,540
Yeah?

1162
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,740
Gases and impurities.

1163
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:34,540
Yeah?

1164
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,040
Yeah.

1165
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,240
But first,

1166
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,880
an a-man.

1167
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:38,400
What?

1168
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,140
Yeah.

1169
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,160
An a-man

1170
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,480
who will be able

1171
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,280
to shoot destruction

1172
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,780
as the world has dreamed of.

1173
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,280
You're mad.

1174
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,880
I was never seen

1175
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,860
in my life.

1176
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:47,900
I mean, yeah.

1177
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,720
Oh, I know what you mean, friends.

1178
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,180
That came from

1179
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:52,540
the

1180
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:52,820
The

1181
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:52,880
The

1182
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:52,880


1183
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:52,880


1184
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:52,880


1185
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,620
The

1186
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,440
The

1187
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:06,700
The

1188
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,460
children

1189
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:09,580
ceiling

1190
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:09,580


1191
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:09,580


1192
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:09,580


1193
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:09,580


1194
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:09,940
I

1195
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,580
Mmm'm

1196
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:10,580


1197
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:10,580


1198
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:10,580


1199
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:10,580


1200
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:10,580


1201
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:10,720
it's

1202
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,020
What

1203
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:11,240
Who

1204
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:11,740
Expected

1205
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,260
Me

1206
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:12,940
And

1207
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,380
Makes

1208
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,380
Agung

1209
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,360
This

1210
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:17,360


1211
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:17,380
God

1212
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:17,380


1213
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:17,640
Mis

1214
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:17,640


1215
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:22,760
And

1216
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:31,300
for a song truly recorded in Bolivia at Dobbs Town 2, out in the jungle,

1217
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:36,740
by Doctors for Extreme Prejudice, with Dr. G. Gordon Gordon himself

1218
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,600
telling the saga of the Dobbs House Cafe.

1219
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:06,520
It was in 1955, I was on my way down to Pharr, Texas,

1220
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:10,040
to talk to William Burroughs about an Oregon accumulator.

1221
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,240
I stopped off in Dallas for something to eat.

1222
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:17,700
It was late at night, and the only place I could find open

1223
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,560
was a small little greasy spoon called the Dobbs House.

1224
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,720
I went inside and had a large pineapple juice, two eggs over easy,

1225
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,800
toast, and a side order of french fries with white gravy.

1226
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,580
Damn good grub.

1227
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,320
When I left, I noticed the fry cook was talking to the waitress.

1228
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,480
He was kind of a tall, distinguished-looking guy for a fry cook

1229
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,660
and was smoking a pint.

1230
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,480
Pleasant-looking fellow.

1231
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,140
I noticed his name, Bob, in a stitched monogram on his white fry cook shirt.

1232
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,240
He was a very nice guy.

1233
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,240
Well, I went out into the cool Texas night and drove off into the future.

1234
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,500
I never caught Doc Burroughs.

1235
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,300
I missed Jack Kerouac.

1236
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,560
Before I knew it, I was too old to wear my hair long

1237
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,560
without feeling self-conscious about it.

1238
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,220
So I was pretty much of an outcast.

1239
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,100
I couldn't find my social niche.

1240
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,000
Where was my peer group?

1241
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,740
I was irrevocably trapped between hipster and hippie,

1242
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,460
and I was a little bit of a

1243
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,160
I was a little bit of a

1244
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,540
I was a little bit of a

1245
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:41,720
And then one day I saw that face again,

1246
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,060
looking at me from a page.

1247
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,560
Hey, I said, I've seen that guy before.

1248
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,720
Maybe I'm just having an acid flashback.

1249
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,740
I found out that I was a bit of a

1250
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,080
I found out it was a man named Bob Dobbs from Dallas, Texas.

1251
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,460
And suddenly the complex pieces of the puzzle

1252
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,600
that I'd been accumulating for 25 years

1253
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,740
in the back of my head

1254
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,880
all dropped into place.

1255
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,160
I sent them all my money.

1256
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,180
They sent me the word of Bob.

1257
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,500
And now I know exactly what I am

1258
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,520
and how I came to be that way.

1259
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,740
And now I work only for Bob

1260
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,480
and the church.

1261
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,760
And now I can tell people what I do for a living

1262
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,500
without being ashamed.

1263
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,780
And that's how this song came into being.

1264
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,080
That was G. Gordon Gordon

1265
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,460
with Doctors for Extreme Prejudice Friends in 1982.

1266
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,500
That guitar player did Time for Manslaughter

1267
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,520
shortly after that song was recorded.

1268
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,200
I believe.

1269
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,220
And now, Dr. Drummond will clarify the meaning

1270
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:01,000
of the oft-misused subgenius term,

1271
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,320
Hobucker.

1272
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,940
As a city wakes up to the

1273
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,340
Bob stuff.

1274
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,020
You can't say long sentences.

1275
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,560
Hobucker generally means either a normal

1276
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,360
or a latent subgenius of low values,

1277
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,480
not necessarily low wages.

1278
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,400
Yeah, exactly.

1279
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,900
One of whom nothing holds quite enough value

1280
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,580
to justify the effort necessary

1281
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:22,720
to achieve a successful career.

1282
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,580
Hobuckers aren't always poor,

1283
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,600
but they're always trash.

1284
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,380
There are many a rich Hobucker.

1285
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,480
Moreover, many subgeni,

1286
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,640
mostly perhaps subgeni,

1287
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,700
but at least part Hobucker.

1288
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,920
Now Dr. Drummond is reading the actual text

1289
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,460
printed in Revelation.

1290
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,540
Yeah, I was thinking also the Hobuckers

1291
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,380
are not exactly...

1292
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,240
When you go to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee,

1293
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,660
there's a whole...

1294
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,500
And all over the South,

1295
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,500
but that's the place I love.

1296
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,740
That's the most where you see

1297
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,780
the whole Hobucker sales industry

1298
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:58,620
of pictures of Hobuckers

1299
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,860
and books about Hobuckers

1300
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,840
and ashtrays and all sorts of...

1301
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,360
And that keeps Bob proven.

1302
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,340
Keeps the church...

1303
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,280
The last supper

1304
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,680
separated from little pieces of wood.

1305
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:10,220
Yeah.

1306
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,600
Ah, well, anyway.

1307
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,340
And there you go.

1308
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,260
That's it.

1309
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,460
That is the fun of it.

1310
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,040
All the concrete dinosaurs

1311
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,100
aren't thrown away and wrecked

1312
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,820
because they were the 50s stuff.

1313
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,280
But as some of those went back to the 30s

1314
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,060
and they were falling apart,

1315
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,880
I know that real estate is valuable.

1316
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,640
Because you're out there near Dollyland

1317
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,660
and the former bunny golf.

1318
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,600
They're being vandalized by teenagers.

1319
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,960
What are you going to do?

1320
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,460
Well, yeah.

1321
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:33,840
Yeah, that's right.

1322
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,260
Yeah, well, yeah.

1323
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,060
Somebody ought to go and round up those teens

1324
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:39,580
and re-educate them.

1325
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,680
They closed down Magic Mountain

1326
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,840
because of vandalism by teenagers.

1327
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,840
They closed down Magic Mountain?

1328
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,140
Really?

1329
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:46,660
Yeah.

1330
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,240
That's why?

1331
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,880
Well, it got to be where it cost them

1332
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,760
too much for security

1333
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,060
because they had, like,

1334
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,460
gangs there all the time

1335
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,580
and they were scaring off

1336
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,520
all the other people.

1337
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,200
And the sales had gone down.

1338
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,520
They closed the whole place down

1339
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,520
because it got to be...

1340
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,620
I think they're going to sell it to Bob.

1341
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,460
Now, you know,

1342
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,500
when we were talking about

1343
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,400
the nature of the Pobucker earlier,

1344
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,780
that's all in the book

1345
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,340
at the Bob Apocryphon,

1346
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,940
which is a re-release

1347
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,880
that can be bought now

1348
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,920
in bookstores again

1349
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,960
for the first time in, what,

1350
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,920
it's been at least almost 10 years.

1351
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,660
The public has really been thirsty.

1352
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,040
Yeah.

1353
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:22,960
They have been.

1354
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,500
The public has been going

1355
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,680
just slathering all over itself for this.

1356
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,660
And we'll be there

1357
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,860
to sign the book.

1358
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,800
And that part,

1359
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,640
we'll sign page 56

1360
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,860
if you bring it to me.

1361
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,060
We will.

1362
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,980
All of us have to sign one

1363
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,120
on page just because you say it on the radio.

1364
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,540
When we sign one of these books,

1365
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,820
we exponentially increase its value.

1366
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,760
We go to the page that,

1367
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,460
you know, has our face on it.

1368
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,080
Oh, that book,

1369
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:03,300
it's style bardzo rock.

1370
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:03,760
But I hope that these books

1371
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:03,760


1372
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:03,760


1373
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,560
The next interest- Ghana for in the context

1374
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,840
of Safed Maison-

1375
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:05,840


1376
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:05,840


1377
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,020
Whatkeeping in Battle陸

1378
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:08,400
in What if...

1379
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:08,980
Well, I was going to say to my friend in극

1380
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:09,680
I was going to say good eve-

1381
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,920
How can I find you and questa homeland

1382
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,720
going,

1383
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,180
Guyby and Baracka

1384
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:22,260


1385
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:28,240
emergentiles. The rewardians far outnumber the emergentiles. I think there's like one emergentile

1386
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:35,720
for every 10 rewardians, much like the ratio of lions to zebras. The rewardians are people who,

1387
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:41,800
and this is probably most of y'all, you prefer to get the reward first and then do the work.

1388
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,120
And of course, half the time, you never have to get around to the work that way.

1389
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:52,620
But emergentiles, which is like I am, are people who are only happy if there's an emergency going

1390
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:57,520
on all the damn time. They just have to be doing something and doing three things at once if

1391
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,420
possible. It sort of looks nerve-wracking to everybody else, but believe me, it's the only

1392
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:08,920
way we emergentiles can function. And you should just be lucky that we don't take more than one or

1393
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:16,100
two of you at a time. We've studied nature and we don't want to blow a good one.

1394
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:22,020
Good deal. You ever see that movie, The Time Machine, or the book, the great H.G. Wells book?

1395
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:30,360
Well, we're the Morlocks in training, you might say. The new version of The Time Machine doesn't

1396
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:40,660
even count. The 2001 or 2002 movie of it, don't even, don't even. Another thing about subgeniuses,

1397
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,820
there's, you can break them down and they're the kind of people who say there's always two kinds

1398
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,220
of people.

1399
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:52,860
But there's, then this is true. This really, I've observed this over and over again. It's always

1400
00:54:52,860 --> 00:55:00,180
either the kind of person who can do one thing perfectly, but is a total klutz at everything

1401
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:06,940
else. And then there's those who can do a little bit of everything, but none of it well enough to

1402
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:13,700
turn a buck, which is, I'm one of those jack-offs of all trades and masturbator of none. Well,

1403
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,100
almost none, besides me.

1404
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:16,700
I mean.

1405
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:50,880
The time machine is never going to stop the time machine.

1406
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:50,880


1407
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:50,880


1408
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,500
They tell me that once upon a time they had some sub trying to get a message over the telegraph

1409
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:57,780
box.

1410
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,140
Well.

1411
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:01,240
A man out to inspect the line.

1412
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:01,720
Uh huh.

1413
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:07,860
In making his report, he said that he found that a cat had gone up the telegraph pole.

1414
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,500
Yes sir.

1415
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,860
And died on the line.

1416
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,400
Yes sir.

1417
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,000
And that was the reason why they couldn't get the message over the line.

1418
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,360
Amen.

1419
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,040
Amen.

1420
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,080
All right.

1421
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,640
All right.

1422
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,280
All right.

1423
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:51,900
All right.

1424
00:57:52,260 --> 00:58:00,200
The self-genius power of what you have just heard is true to protect the innocent.

1425
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,820
You know, you punks make me sick to my stomach.

1426
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,200
What for?

1427
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:06,400
Be happy you still got the two-bit bums that work this filthy operation.

1428
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:06,960
What for?

1429
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,100
You got about as much guts as an underfed worm.

1430
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,820
What for?

1431
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:10,660
What for?

1432
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,820
What for?

1433
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,080
For Bob, man.

1434
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:13,760
For Bob.

1435
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:14,420
For Bob.

1436
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,200
That music there.

1437
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:15,920
Dead cat.

1438
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,740
On the line earlier was by the great D.K. Jones.

1439
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,180
That was recorded in 1980.

1440
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,520
And this background music throughout this whole show that has been playing behind the credits,

1441
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:34,400
this instrumental, a couple of instrumentals, are by the Bonobos,

1442
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,240
who are interested in playing an X-Day.

1443
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,320
They sound great.

1444
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:42,400
It's a Bonobos CD called Convergence.

1445
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,060
And you can get more, if you're interested,

1446
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:51,080

You got something to write on?

1454
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:20,300
Uh-huh.

1455
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:20,740

1457

Praise Bob.

1458
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,160
From PR News in Washington, I'm partially released today.

1459
