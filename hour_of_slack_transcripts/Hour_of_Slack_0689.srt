1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Shh. Don't tell anyone.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,460
But this is the subgenius hour of slack.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,760
Shh.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,180
I.O.! Let's go!

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,080
I.O.! Let's go!

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,760
I.O.! Let's go!

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,780
Oh, the cool light.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,840
Man, it's time to start dispensing.

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,000
And we'll do it.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,240
We'll scramble asses off exactly at 7 a.m.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,280
We'll take the hit and say...

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,880
Bob them.

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,440
I can't take the joke.

14
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,380
Bye, buddy.

15
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,860
Hopefully we'll be on the saucers by the time that damn sentence is finished.

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,280
I don't know about you, but the minute I'm ruptured, I'm going to bed.

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,760
Hey, come on, honey.

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,240
Don't let me hold you in the way for a minute, baby.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,840
I'll be gone in just a little while.

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,580
You see, I gotta go out in this cold, this cold.

21
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,440
I'm going to brush you.

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,100
One more time.

23
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,980
Yes, dear friend.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,600
We will do just that.

25
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,980
One last final time before X-Day.

26
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,300
Because, as it says here on Bob's handwritten memo...

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,140
The world ends July 5th at 7 a.m.

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,340
1999.

29
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,560
This is the original piece of paper touched by Bob.

30
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,560
Oh, yes, friends.

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,500
And Bob has been moving in America as these last days come to a close.

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,380
I saw Bob in Portland.

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,840
Bob came to a subgenius show in Portland, Oregon just two weeks ago when I was at that.

34
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,780
And we have recordings of these things.

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,580
We have proof.

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,380
The proof is all around us.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,560
We have proof.

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,360
My friends, X-Day is coming.

39
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,780
And the...

40
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,920
Oh, yes.

41
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,320
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

42
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,640
It won't be long now, friends.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,220
35, 45 years since Bob first received the immaculation from Jehovah One

44
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,460
that the X's would come.

45
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,940
In, according to my seven minutes.

46
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,560
Damn it.

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,080
I ain't gonna need this pretty much.

48
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,260
And with that, I smashed my watch, friends.

49
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,500
And I gotta admit...

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,320
I had to go buy a new one after that.

51
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,280
Because Bob didn't show.

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
This roof...

53
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,380
Well, this roof is gonna be blown off the top of this building.

54
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,140
How long do we have?

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,960
Don't!

56
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,540
Don't!

57
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:40,660


58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000


59
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,700
But this time, friends, you have a second chance.

60
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,580
Yes, a second chance.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,440
Sister Friday Jones is dispensing the Kool-Aid.

62
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,540
As it's said in Revelation X, if you have perfect trust and faith,

63
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,460
you will be ruptured.

64
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,020
Don't worry.

65
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Trust us.

66
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,420
Are you bored?

67
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,820
Are you jaded?

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,500
Has all enthusiasm faded?

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,420
Are you jaded?

70
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,420


71
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,420


72
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,420


73
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,420


74
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,420


75
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,420


76
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,420


77
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,420


78
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,460
IntroducingÃªtre

79
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,460


80
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,460


81
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you one of those people who

82
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,240
Are you so

83
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,300
Second

84
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,520
Shut up, Im not done talking to you.

85
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,160
radical

86
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Oh, isn't it wonderful?

87
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,780
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

88
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,620
which reaches from the inner mind to...

89
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,460
The subgenius.

90
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,940
Our own watch.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,360
Subgenius people, why, they're the salt of the earth.

92
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,920
You'd like to rub elbows with them.

93
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,640
Sound impossible.

94
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,840
I'd like to rub salt.

95
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,400
Yes, you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb.

96
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,400
Say what?

97
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,720
You'd take the pinch of salt.

98
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
You'd rub it between the forefinger and the thumb.

99
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,740
Walk with your shoes around a burning, decapitated child's head

100
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,900
and then jump into the grave and say,

101
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,060
hop on my thumb, hop on my thumb,

102
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,500
this is a problem I must overcome.

103
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,980
Throw in a dead cat or a live cat that's not feeling well.

104
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,580
Then cover with the sod and when the birds chirp on the third Saturday after Mikkelmas,

105
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,840
take a large dill pickle and insert it in.

106
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,020
Sound enough.

107
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,520
Our own watch.

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,600
Oh, God, not again.

109
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,860
I must do it all over again.

110
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,600
I've got to start this damn show all over again.

111
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,300
And again.

112
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,320
The show that never ends, but soon it will end.

113
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,260
Soon everything will end.

114
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,220
Ha, ha.

115
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,340
This is a horrible studio out here with the lights on.

116
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,560
That's a lie.

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,580
That's just a type.

118
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,360
Light, light, light, light, light, light.

119
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,380
At least I've got this little porthole.

120
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,060
This is a portable thing so that we can start the show whether I'm in the studio or not.

121
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,540
Or even on after I've been in the studio for hours.

122
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,240
And here we are finally in the studios.

123
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,500
As you can see, oh, oh, the guard dog's trying to get out.

124
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,860
As you can see here, or would be able to see if the camera was working,

125
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:50,020
this huge bank of cassette and reel-to-reel decks that are brought in each night for the hour of slack.

126
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,660
by the zombies, by the very Will O'Dobbs.

127
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,300
Bob needs money.

128
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,500
Money needs glory.

129
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,180
Glory needs gore.

130
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,260
Gore needs sex.

131
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,300
Sex needs Bob.

132
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,460
Bob needs money.

133
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,740
And it's your money that he's gonna get, my friend.

134
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,320
Sure is shooting.

135
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,860
He's gonna get it.

136
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,960
He's right behind you.

137
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,860
Bob's creeping up on you.

138
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,700
Your brother, Dr. Huckabee,

139
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,600
a coming with advanced knowledge.

140
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,120
Great.

141
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,760
He's shooting right now.

142
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,220
Bob will save all true believers, though, in 1998, right?

143
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,720
Actually, Bob, you better hope that Bob does some wheeling and dealing

144
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,420
for your soul come 1998.

145
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,580
He is the salesman of the universe here to make sure that Earth

146
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,600
and your soul does not get sold to the robot mutilators.

147
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,960
At least for not too low a price.

148
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,980
So you better read that book with all three eyes or however many you have left.

149
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,620
And leave the driving to Bob.

150
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,520
That's right.

151
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,660
You do the walking, let Bob do the talking.

152
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,420
Who are these men from Planet X, children?

153
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,520
What is waiting there for me?

154
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,840
Bob.

155
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,480
It's easy enough to die for Bob.

156
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,160
But would you kill?

157
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,660
Would you kill for him?

158
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,340
Would you kill and kill and kill?

159
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Kill till your hands are slick with blood.

160
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,500
Kill till your flesh is numb with the killing.

161
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,560
Kill until you can kill no more and then keep killing.

162
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,360
This week's Hour of Slack is brought to you by The Conspiracy.

163
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,040
We're everywhere.

164
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,160
We always have been.

165
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,080
You can't escape us.

166
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,400
The Conspiracy.

167
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,380
The Conspiracy.

168
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,100
Controlling your lives since before the dawn of time.

169
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,060
Friend, the elder gods have been sleeping.

170
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,980
But they're waking up.

171
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,260
And you've got to find that word of Bob before it's too late.

172
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,120
Before 1998, the last day.

173
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,240
The end of the world.

174
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,000
The end of time as we know it.

175
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,020
When the very, the very...

176
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,920
The score is racked.

177
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,200
The score is racked up and it's the time and a half time.

178
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:46,920
Yes sir.

179
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,560
We just won't have a chance.

180
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,640
It's gonna be all right.

181
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,600
have their way to us.

182
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,360
The smallpox blankets

183
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,080
and the Indians,

184
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,440
you know,

185
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,380
well, this is going to be

186
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,120
technological viral

187
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,400
infectation

188
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,580
of an entire planet

189
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,400
with means of doing things

190
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,260
and means of destruction,

191
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,260
means of alteration

192
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,300
of genetic patterns,

193
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,460
means of controlling

194
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,340
people's minds

195
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,420
that we don't even,

196
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,480
to us it's magic.

197
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,180
Any significantly advanced

198
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,940
form of science

199
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,960
becomes magic.

200
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,480
If that smoke

201
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,880
comes out of Bob's pipe

202
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,380
no more,

203
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,360
then we shall be reduced

204
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,740
to that can of warm beer

205
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,540
under the bed

206
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,820
of a hungover elder dog

207
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,380
at 1130 on a Sunday morning.

208
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,580
Bob is here to make sure

209
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,320
that instead of it being

210
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,440
the end of the world,

211
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,300
it's the end of their world

212
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,220
and the new land.

213
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,420
The new Jerusalem

214
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,800
where slack begins.

215
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,540
Yes, the streets

216
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,960
will be paved with slack.

217
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,920
Slack will drop gently

218
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,660
from the sky.

219
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,980
Slack will ooze

220
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,720
out of the pores

221
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,440
of the faithful.

222
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,000
The tribulation money

223
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
will fall from

224
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,000
the flying saucers.

225
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,680
Yes,

226
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,180
it will all be floating around

227
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,180
as little green rays

228
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,260
coming out of our feet.

229
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,560
That's why we tell

230
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,660
the public

231
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,780
to throw their money away.

232
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,680
It's no good.

233
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,500
It's going to be,

234
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,880
currency is just going to be

235
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,680
flying down from flying saucers

236
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,480
in a few years anyway.

237
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,320
Or give it to Bob.

238
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,020
You give it to Bob

239
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,920
while it's still good.

240
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,860
You cash in that money

241
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,720
while it's still good.

242
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,380
Because they're going to be,

243
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,540
see, people are just going to be

244
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,180
bringing all their money to Bob

245
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,600
when the end of the world

246
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,160
is upon us.

247
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,920
It's going to be too late

248
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,000
because money won't be worth anything.

249
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,060
When those tribulation times

250
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,580
come down,

251
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,760
that subgenius pamphlet,

252
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,380
especially if you've got

253
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,060
a white copy,

254
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,700
now if you've got a white copy

255
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,300
and a brown copy,

256
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,920
it's a little bit of difference,

257
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,520
but they're both worth more

258
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,060
than a bundle of thousand dollar

259
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,040
treasury bills a foot high.

260
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,600
There will be people

261
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,800
trading paragraphs

262
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,920
of that pamphlet

263
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,520
for boxcars full of food.

264
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,740
You think it will replace currency?

265
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,740
Bob will replace drugs,

266
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,340
religion, rock music,

267
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,500
and everything

268
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,960
in a great paradise

269
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,780
of unrestrained sales,

270
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,220
unrestrained slack and sex.

271
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:48,720
And it's going to be

272
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,660
If you have any drug users

273
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,380
in your audience,

274
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,160
we should note that

275
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,280
the book of the subgenius

276
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,140
we found in a test

277
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,620
that was conducted

278
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,580
in Austin recently,

279
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,900
that if adulterated street drugs

280
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,620
are thrown on top of the cover,

281
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,600
all of the non-narcotic qualities

282
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
are completely erased

283
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,380
and indicated as negative

284
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,000
and destroyed.

285
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,680
All impurities are removed,

286
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,580
giving you that 1% of pure

287
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,440
that you paid for

288
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,860
out of whatever it was

289
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,520
that you were...

290
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,340
By the way...

291
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,540
That's better than Pyramid.

292
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,580
Yes, much better

293
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,320
than Pyramid Power.

294
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,220
I'd like to say those...

295
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,760
...in a plane

296
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,020
rather than going to a point.

297
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,260
Book of the subgenius.

298
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,660
That's it.

299
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,880
Book of the subgenius.

300
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,380
I'm the fellow

301
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,280
everyone knows.

302
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,380
Bob.

303
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:29,980
Bob!

304
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,740
Bob!

305
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, Bob.

306
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,740
Hey, man.

307
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,460
That is one strange dude.

308
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,760
Who is it?

309
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,240
One strange dude.

310
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,240
I think Bob

311
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,620
is just the guy with the pipe.

312
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,100
Oh, that's crazy talk.

313
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,020
But friends, you know,

314
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,620
are critics.

315
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,440
I have some people worry

316
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,320
now and then

317
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,360
that the church

318
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,420
might become corrupt.

319
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,120
The church of the subgenius

320
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,820
might become corrupted

321
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,900
by the conspiracy

322
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,420
and there'd have to be

323
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,860
a replacement for it.

324
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,700
Well, hey.

325
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,100
Friends, I'll tell you,

326
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,540
we don't have to worry about that

327
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,060
because the true church,

328
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,320
the true church of the subgenius

329
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,700
is going to be up in the saucers.

330
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,820
Ah, the pinks won't have to worry

331
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,520
about...

332
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:17,540
about...

333
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,160
about the subgeniuses.

334
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,180
They're going to be up in the saucers.

335
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,180


336
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,180


337
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,180


338
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,180


339
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,180


340
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,120
There'll be all kinds of cheap cults

341
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,580
and spin-offs left behind

342
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,940
just like the cargo cults

343
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,480
among the last mutated remnants

344
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,360
of humanity.

345
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,580
And also,

346
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,640
there'll be subgeniuses left behind.

347
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,760
The subgeniuses who didn't think

348
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,080
they really needed

349
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,220
that $20 membership card.

350
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,880
Did we just have a power barrier?

351
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,800
I believe we did.

352
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,180
Ahem.

353
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,040
Yeah, those who, as I was saying...

354
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
Excuse me, friends.

355
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:59,420
We're having serious, strange poltergeist effects in here as the lights flicker on and off.

356
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,140
Yeah, anyway, there'll be some subgeniuses left behind.

357
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,800
The ones who didn't think they needed that $20 membership card.

358
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,540
The ones who tattooed Bob's face all over their whole bodies.

359
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,520
The ones who put...

360
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,720
They might have put Bob on national TV.

361
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,040
They might have donated their whole estate to us, but they never sent.

362
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,160
They never sent their $20.

363
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,580
Now, it might be confusing a bit to those left behind after the rupture.

364
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,480
Because the rupture happens for different people in different ways.

365
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,580
A lot of subgeniuses, when they undergo the rupture,

366
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,080
watch the people standing around and back on Earth.

367
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,560
It looks like a burning monk or spontaneous combustion.

368
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,700
They just burst in.

369
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,140
They just burn to flames and scream and scream.

370
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,820
It's the most horrible, painful-looking thing in the world.

371
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,860
But, of course, that, friends, that's just the image.

372
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,120
That's just sort of the hologram, the body being left behind.

373
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,180
Just the shell.

374
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,820
Because on next day, when you are ruptured, no matter how it looks, you know,

375
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:12,680
your youthful, perfect body is being recreated on the vessels of the sex goddesses

376
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,180
and a thousand clones of kitten...

377
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,880
on TV dot are gonna...

378
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,460
Well, I...

379
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,180
Friends, when you get on that escape vessel,

380
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,040
every person you ever had a crush on since elementary school

381
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,040
is gonna be there ready to have sex with you.

382
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,440
Either that or else, simulacra of those people.

383
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,640
It might as well be the same.

384
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,800
Because the sex goddesses, you see, can change their form completely and totally.

385
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,020
First, you...

386
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,540
You'll...

387
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,660
There'll be the...

388
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,280
Say, the girl you had a crush on in first grade.

389
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,780
Well, now she's at a perfect...

390
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,880
She's perfect and healthy at age 25, of course, you know.

391
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,060
And when she leaves, why in walks the girl you had a crush on in second grade?

392
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,180
Or here's that boy you had a crush on when you were 13 and he almost kissed you,

393
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,180
but now he's gonna do it.

394
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,200
And he's still wearing the same clothes that he did at the prom.

395
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,000
Or that milkman.

396
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,120
Or the babysitter that you lusted after.

397
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,060
They'll all be there.

398
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,060
The sex goddesses tap your mind.

399
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,880
It's not really people.

400
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,880
It's part of the...

401
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,380
The muam system.

402
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,100
The...

403
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,660
A biomorphic toy that conforms to the fleshly configurations

404
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,320
to satisfy any kind of lust you might have.

405
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,320
And they can pre-guess what you're about to think, friends.

406
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,740
They can sense a desire percolating up in your mind.

407
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,240
And just...

408
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,760
For instance, just a few seconds before you...

409
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,860
You think of it.

410
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,420
That zap comic that you always wanted to read a second time

411
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,080
what just happens to be over there in the pile?

412
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,260
And you...

413
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,480
And you look back and you think,

414
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,600
Man, this is...

415
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,380
This is great.

416
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,860
If only I had a frop stick.

417
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,620
Well, here's a frop stick.

418
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,540
Because muam and the biomorphs and the sex goddesses can anticipate your every wish.

419
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,800
They can whip a desire coming on.

420
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,880
And you'll think,

421
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,020
Now, if I could just...

422
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,300
Um...

423
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,460
Meet up with that...

424
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,840
That haughty librarian at that one college I went to

425
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,260
while I'm reading this comic.

426
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,380
And sure enough, in she comes through the door.

427
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,260
Well, if only she'd dance, you think.

428
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,060
Oh, if only she had a small whip.

429
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,340
And it happens.

430
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,320
As you think about it, there's no limit.

431
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,520
No limit at all.

432
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,580
And, oh, if only she'd give me a ham sandwich first.

433
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,840
Ah, yes.

434
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,860
Now I'm...

435
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,560
And you'll sit there and think to yourself,

436
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,000
You know, I can't believe there was a time...

437
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,740
When I wondered if it was worth the 20 bucks.

438
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,580
And you're sitting there eating the hell out of that ham sandwich,

439
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,700
Getting a scarf job from that biomorph,

440
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,260
Watching widescreen color TV Elvis movies,

441
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,100
And thinking,

442
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,380
How could I ever have wondered?

443
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,300
How could I ever have doubted Bob for a second?

444
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,900
And to think of poor Bubba,

445
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,140
My brother Bubba back there on Earth,

446
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,340
The guy that said,

447
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,680
Hell, send him $20?

448
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,460
That's just what they want you to do.

449
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,000
I'll pump gas for $2.38 an hour the rest of my life,

450
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,000
Before I'd send a dollar to that damn sub-gum church.

451
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,600
Oh, yeah.

452
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,640
Well, it's hard times for Bubba now, friends.

453
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,360
Because, children, our heritage awaits us in the stars.

454
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,360
And soon, oh, yes, soon,

455
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,520
As Bob is my witness,

456
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,720
We'll never be slackless again.

457
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,700
Let the judgment begin.

458
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,140
I'll get the ball rolling.

459
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,020
The end of the world?

460
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,420
How near is it?

461
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,500
We hear a great deal today about the end of the world.

462
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,420
When is it going to come?

463
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,600
Some have been so presumptuous as to set dates.

464
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,060
As a result, people have sold their worldly goods,

465
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,300
Gone to a mountain top somewhere,

466
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,220
And waited for the end of the world to come.

467
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,140
Others have taught and preached that there will be no end,

468
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,500
That everything will go on as it is.

469
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,820
And both parties are wrong.

470
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:23,380
And I alluded to the fact that certain traditions of men teach that when a planet goes through,

471
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,320
Or a comet goes through a certain field,

472
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,760
Was it the great hunter?

473
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,600
I think it was.

474
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,620
That that means the earth is coming to an end.

475
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,780
And I made the statement that,

476
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,580
It would be impossible for Haley Bopp to hit the states of the Americas,

477
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,840
Unless a chunk broke off.

478
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,120
And this lady thought I said a chunk was going to break off of Haley Bopp and me and the world.

479
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,620
I didn't say that, alright?

480
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,920
That would be an impossibility, is what I was actually saying.

481
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,640
There's nothing out there that's going to run into Haley Bopp.

482
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,100
But I had fun doing that.

483
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,540
I hope you all enjoyed it.

484
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,720
But no dates were mentioned other than astronomical signs,

485
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,440
And the heavens were taking place at those times.

486
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,320
The church of the subgenius is surely the church of the future.

487
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,800
Or at least what's left of it.

488
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,600
The world as we know it will end in 19...

489
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,820
Uh, 99, dear friends.

490
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:35,720
We, uh, there was a slight miscalculation, or a little bit of an, I guess you could say an embarrassment.

491
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,740
But friends, you know, we weren't ready.

492
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,880
We were not ready.

493
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,500
And that X-Day drill of 1998 proved it.

494
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,220
But friends, X-Day, this time, double X-Day,

495
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,420
Dos Equis is coming, it is going to happen,

496
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,540
And I'm going to do three hours of slack.

497
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,560
Real quick.

498
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,200
Like tonight, before I leave town for Brushwood Folklore Center,

499
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,160
Where we hold the gigantic celebration before we leave the planet.

500
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,400
And, you know, why do I feel the need to do three shows if I'm going to be gone?

501
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,180
You know, I mean, uh...

502
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,000
You know, and why should we do, and they're going to be X-Day shows, friends.

503
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,000
Why should we do that even though X-Day will have already happened?

504
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:32,220
In fact, by the time you hear this, you know, it'll be a miracle if you're even hearing it.

505
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,880
I imagine they'll probably, I had to play a rerun last week,

506
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,740
Of an anticipatory X-Day show from a year ago.

507
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,180
And I could do that again, but man, we've got so much great stuff, friends.

508
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,540
And why should we keep doing X-Day shows even though X-Day already happened?

509
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,020
Just to rub it in.

510
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,620
Just in case anybody's left on this planet, any radio stations are left,

511
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,940
And anybody's listening, friends, it's just to rub it in.

512
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,460
You could have gone that distance, but no.

513
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,260
No!

514
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,860
No!

515
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,560
You had to hang on to, well, I'm not going to go into that.

516
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,120
I don't care.

517
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,900
I'm too busy.

518
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,920
Too busy packing, because I'm going to take it with me, friends.

519
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,580
As a subgenius, when you translate over to the other plane, the other dimension,

520
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,180
You can take it with you, and I've got a lot of crap I want to take with me.

521
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,500
So I'm packing.

522
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,400
And if the X's don't come, by God, I'm going to wait there at Brushwood until they do come.

523
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,500
And I've been burning CDs, friends.

524
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:41,820
The wonderful Rev. Dr. Jack sent us, actually donated to the church, a CD burner,

525
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,420
Which has turned out to be a Bob send, so to speak.

526
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,720
And soon we'll be able to put this show out on CDs.

527
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,260
And won't that be wonderful?

528
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,740
Instead of these metal tapes that we spend so much money on.

529
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,440
And friends, and friends, Bob is moving!

530
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,540
Oh, friends, it is so marvelous.

531
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,500
I've had been devivals.

532
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,840
I've had devivals across this nation as we approach this final hour of X Day.

533
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,760
There were devivals in Boston on the church steps.

534
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:20,820
There was a great devival, friends, in Seattle, in the beautiful nation of Seattle, Texas.

535
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:28,580
I mean, Washington, where we shall play tapes from that, friends, of the incredible Papa Joe Mama's new rant.

536
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,160
And a preacher, I never knew had it in him.

537
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,740
But Rev. Pope, whatever, Ken Huey sang.

538
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,780
He has Bob on the brain.

539
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,600
And he's gonna tell you about Bob Poopy.

540
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,360
And he's gonna sing the new subgenius anthem.

541
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,420
And we had, there were devivals in Portland, friends.

542
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,500
The lost continent of Lemuria and Portlandus.

543
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,140
Both rose up.

544
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,440
And Bob was there at that actual devival, at that club.

545
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,060
I got sick as hell.

546
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,960
And, uh, I mean, physically.

547
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,140
But, uh, I mean, physically.

548
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,380
I was really ill.

549
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,940
Because I was close to his presence.

550
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,640
It was him!

551
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,520
It was him!

552
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,840
And we've got tapes, friends.

553
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:19,620
We've got tapes of Orton Ninslow for the first time in public singing his new, his X Day hymn sing-along,

554
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,300
Take Me Off to Space, with new lyrics this time, friends.

555
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,120
And Dr. Howell was there at that show.

556
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,760
And we'll be hearing Dr. Vagina Jones was there.

557
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,620
And, uh, oh, friends.

558
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,040
There's so much coming up that we will be playing.

559
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:42,420
What we're playing in the background is a tape handed to me at last X Day Drill 98 by Reverend Goddess Heather Hillman.

560
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,920
And we have been listening to, um, the Susie the Floozies show.

561
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,500
Friends, I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you credits ahead of time.

562
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,260
What I just played is also what I'm going to continue to play.

563
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,080
Susie the Floozies, amazing radio show.

564
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,540
Bob Slatton Funhouse from Atlanta at WREK.

565
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:01,600
And, uh, I'm gonna give you credits ahead of time.

566
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,820
She put together an incredible X Day show last X Day.

567
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,520
I'm gonna be running some of that.

568
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,040
And, and, uh, we heard a long rant about X Day.

569
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,260
The music in the background, that was me from the old hour of Slack number 400 some odd.

570
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,000
This is hour of Slack 689.

571
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,820
Can you believe it?

572
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,040
I didn't think we'd ever make it to 666.

573
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:31,400
And, uh, but, uh, Doctors for Bob was that luscious music, the rock music in the background and that long rant about X Day.

574
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,680
And, uh, stuff from our old media barrage tapes, G. Gordon Gordon, Poon Flang Dammerung, Buck Naked, Yours Truly.

575
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,780
And you've heard Friday Jones, the feminine voice giving those little grisly asides.

576
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,520
Here and there will be more.

577
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,780
And, uh, Dr. Hal Robbins on the KPFA show.

578
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,860
And clips from the subgenius video, the soundtrack, friends.

579
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,820
And, uh, of, of, of X Day, the X Day video, which is still available.

580
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,580
And, uh, soon, sub CD ROMs of, of, of Subgenius.

581
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,120
And our website, our website will be, except they won't be available because there ain't gonna be no world here, friends.

582
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:19,380
And, uh, uh, oh, and, uh, I'm just so excited about it all that I'm gonna let Chaz from the, uh, the other land, uh, uh, rant for me for a little while.

583
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,620
And, and then, uh, but that's what's going on.

584
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,560
I'm gonna try to do three, count them, three shows.

585
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,900
The next three shows you hear, or the next two after this one will be, uh, done.

586
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,460
The same exciting night that I'm doing.

587
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,040
All this stuff.

588
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,060
And, um, I'll probably be real tired.

589
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,500
So I imagine the se- the third one will be terrible.

590
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,520
But, yeah, alright.

591
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,000
The four non-profits of the apocalypse.

592
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,280
Hey, uh, we sent those ships out last year.

593
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,200
And the ships went aground.

594
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,260
The water drained out of the ocean of space for us last year.

595
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,540
But it won't again this year.

596
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,460
We, we, we, that year is here now.

597
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,980
That year, that year, it's a month away.

598
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,100
It's a month away.

599
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,680
From tonight.

600
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
A new day.

601
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Is the eve of double X day.

602
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,760
The real, the real X day.

603
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:18,900
The real X day is coming in one month, kids.

604
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:25,860
And Einstein Secret Orchestra will be unleashing a brand new CD at that, uh, at that event.

605
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,380
And present our brand new CD of music to the X's.

606
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,860
On, uh, on double X day.

607
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:39,100
Coming up July 4th weekend at Brushwood, uh, campground, uh, in New York.

608
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,580
So, uh, uh, it's going to be, yeah.

609
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,560
We're going to do it.

610
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,660
We're going to climb on those rocket ships and build the vessels if we have to.

611
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,600
Yeah, we did it.

612
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:49,940
We did.

613
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,820
We did build the vessels.

614
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,240
We did build the vessels.

615
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,400
Testing the systems needed for this trip.

616
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,420
We did it in one year's time.

617
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:56,680
We did it.

618
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,360
We made a kind of relief.

619
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:57,680
We did it.

620
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,100
Thanks for the ride.

621
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,460
We'll take it.

622
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,080
Thanks for the ride.

623
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,540
And we're going to take it from here come one month from today.

624
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,680
From one month from today, we're going to light that fuse.

625
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,040
We're going to climb on that rocket ship.

626
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,340
We're going to hang on our parachutes and our six packs.

627
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,700
And we're going out there 50 miles high.

628
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,980
There's no such thing as the year 2000.

629
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,760
There's no years.

630
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,680
There's no days.

631
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,120
There's no nights.

632
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,040
It's just space, folks.

633
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,200
That's all it is.

634
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,860
And we're ready.

635
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,280
We said we were going to do it in a year after things fell apart last year.

636
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:32,680
That's right.

637
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,820
We said we were going to do it, and we're going to do it.

638
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,280
We got the rocket ships.

639
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,720
They're all primed and ready.

640
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,920
We've had at least five test launchings at Brushwood already.

641
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,120
You've missed those.

642
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,580
You backsliding little bobbies.

643
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,860
You've missed the test launchings.

644
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,480
But we did them.

645
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,260
We did them, and no one got hurt.

646
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,440
That's the most amazing thing of all is nobody got hurt yet.

647
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,780
But at X day, somebody is going to get hurt.

648
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,140
Sacrifices must be made.

649
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,820
Don't let it be you.

650
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:06,820
Okay?

651
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:14,980
So the safest place to stand at any rocket launching is right at the launch pad.

652
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,400
You definitely don't want to be about 1,000 feet away because things go wrong.

653
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,420
You know, sacrifices will be made, like I said.

654
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,960
So you better get on board here, kids.

655
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,720
And find out what the heck I'm talking about, will you?

656
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,160
Because Einstein's Secret Orchestra is going to be jamming for the alien sex goddesses come one month from today.

657
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,660
From today, actually.

658
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,520
I think it's Friday, July 2nd.

659
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,620
ESO will be jamming its jam.

660
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,300
So anyway, we're doing it.

661
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,000
We're heading there.

662
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,600
We're going.

663
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,040
Just get out of our way because we ain't waiting for no one.

664
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,640
We got that lighter up to the fuse button.

665
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,600
Rocket button.

666
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,560
We're going.

667
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,300
Yes.

668
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,360
What is the law?

669
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,920
To light the fuse.

670
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,660
That is the law.

671
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,220
But how can there be love without the Father?

672
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,380
Because we have a lighter to light the fuse.

673
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,700
He hasn't left us.

674
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,060
No.

675
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,680
He's just in the nose cone.

676
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,780
I don't know what I will tell the others.

677
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,700
Yeah, that's what I will tell the others.

678
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,940
I'll tell the others.

679
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,680
Well, that's what we always tell the rubes.

680
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,540
We always just tell them, oh, yeah, the Father's still here.

681
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,460
He's up in heaven.

682
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,660
That's right.

683
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,360
The God is the Bob or whoever, whatever one they're looking for.

684
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,620
The Father is up in heaven.

685
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,160
And the President or the Czar is very far away.

686
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:45,740
Friends, we've also got a new media barrage from a new media barrage editing Foo, the

687
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,780
Ministry of Found Objects.

688
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:53,460
I've got music by Ron Slabe in the background and a whole bunch of CDs that came in.

689
00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:01,660
This has sure been a month for audio collage found sound editing CDs.

690
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,360
I have such things from Eddie the Rat, the Brand Flakes.

691
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:14,940
Negative Land has a new one and some releases from Negative Land's little record company.

692
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,740
So, friends, there's just too much.

693
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,400
There's just too much.

694
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:20,840
No.

695
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,580
No.

696
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:21,880
No.

697
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,320
No.

698
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:29,420
That's the end of this side.

699
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:37,600
So, we'll just show you with all that stuff on side two of this wonderful subgenius radio

700
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,720
ministry, Hour of Slab.

701
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,180
Thank you all.

702
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,540
Bye.

703
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:41,800
Bye.

704
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,240
Bye.

705
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:46,920
Bye.

706
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:47,440
Bye.

707
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,060
Bye.

708
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,360
Bye.

709
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,160
Bye.

710
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,160


711
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,420
Bye.

712
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:49,420


713
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,040
Bye.

714
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,560
Bye.

715
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,560


716
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,560


717
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,560


718
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,560


719
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,560


720
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,560


721
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,560


722
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,560


723
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,560


724
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,560


725
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,560


726
00:30:54,060 --> 00:31:04,720

729
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,860

well

733
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,320
of 1998

734
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,640
the earth would meet destruction

735
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,060
suffer a deadly fate

736
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:20,520
bob made a deal with x's who come from outer space

737
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:28,820
to purchase an extinction for the getting raised

738
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,100
with an ace of genius

739
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:40,660
and i must have my slack if i don't live forever

740
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,260
forever

741
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,040
forever

742
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


743
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


744
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


745
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


746
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


747
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


748
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


749
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


750
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


751
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


752
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


753
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


754
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


755
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,040


756
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,540
i get my money back

757
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,420
that day was long away

758
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,500
now it has come and gone

759
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,980
there was no fire from heaven

760
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,380
and this old world rolls on

761
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,880
poor stang was made to suffer

762
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,620
a terrible disgrace

763
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,040
of suffering

764
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,120
humiliation

765
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,480
he feared to show his face

766
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,700
where are they some genius

767
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,900
and i must have my slack

768
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,140
if i don't live forever

769
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,940
i get my money back

770
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,900
now there may be nothing

771
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,760
because we are such chums

772
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,020
such chums

773
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:50,040
But there is no reason to be down in the dumps

774
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:57,940
It'll all still happen, no need to curse or frown

775
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:05,940
They got all right numbers, just got them upside down

776
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:14,080
Well, I'm Issa Jean and I must have my slack

777
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:22,080
If I don't live forever, I get my money back

778
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,440
We don't want to miss out on all the fun, so we might have to join you

779
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,260
Say goodbye to the evangelicals for a few hours because we want to be involved in the actual

780
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,320
We're not going to all leave, if this is the last we'll probably see of each other for a few hours

781
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,760
But hours will be meaningless in a few days

782
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,940
Don't get on the ship!

783
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,440
Where's Jesus?

784
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,620
Well, in answer to your question, Jesus

785
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,920
It just happened

786
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:17,860
Jesus is, uh, to tell the truth, he's probably at, right now as I say this, he's probably at work at his second job, his bartending job

787
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,520
Would you believe that, here Jesus comes back to earth in the 20th century

788
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,540
And he, not only does he immediately go to work for the, uh, for the subgenius foundation

789
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,160
Instead of, say, the Southern Baptist Convention

790
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,620
But

791
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,760
He also has to, because the subgenius church doesn't make that much money

792
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,900
He has to get a, Jesus Christ has to get a second job as a bartender

793
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,940
Uh, ministering to the publicans

794
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,940
Well, anyway, friends, that wasn't what I wanted to talk about

795
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,960
I didn't want to brag on Jesus

796
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:05,920
But I wanted to, um, present some more from the Seattle devival that Pope S. Lilith produced, um, uh, uh, in, uh, this year

797
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,860
This 1999 year

798
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:13,960
And, uh, Papa Joe Mama delivered one of the most beautiful

799
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,580
Really, you know, for a holocaustal it was a beautiful rant

800
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:26,020
This was his toned down rant, he said

801
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:33,620
He had one that was more, uh, uh, uh, inflammatory, shall we say

802
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,020
And, but instead he

803
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,160
Uh, delivered this

804
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,280
At the, uh, Seattle devival

805
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:39,780
Thank you all

806
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,360
Our next rancher, dear friends

807
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,660
Our next rancher

808
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,780
Is a total pussy

809
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,560
He's a cramming coward

810
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,260
He's a traitor to his own kind

811
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:57,400
He, dear friends, he thinks that the human race only needs to be exterminated once

812
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,020
Now, I don't know about you, but I know for a fact that what the human race has done to us mighty subgeniuses

813
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,360
Deserves more than one death

814
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,980
In fact, I have a saying

815
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,420
Kill him, resurrect him, kill him again

816
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,840
With all that said, he's still a snazzy dresser

817
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,760
Ladies and gentlemen, Father Joe Mama

818
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,640
We don't need a microphone

819
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,060
But we'll use one anyway

820
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,520
Brothers and sisters

821
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,480
Some people out there think I'm about hatred

822
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,340
What makes them think that?

823
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,420
What's there to hate in this world?

824
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,060
Ho ho, it's lovely, isn't it?

825
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,980
But let the other religions run about there and use the demagoguery

826
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,900
We are a thinking man's religion

827
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,220
Let me hear a thinking mob

828
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,560
Thinking mob!

829
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,080
I think I can hear Bob thinking

830
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,320
And as proof of that

831
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,000
I put together something that I've never heard before

832
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,580
And I think helps prove that we are beyond just hatred

833
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:11,140
We're a thoughtful, perhaps a little demigra-

834
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,020
Demigro-gory, demigra-

835
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,360
Blah, blah, blah, talk your tongues, talk to somebody!

836
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:20,060
Perhaps we do revert occasionally to a little bit of demagoguery

837
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:25,040
But in general, we like to add something more to our religion

838
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,060
The spice of life

839
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:31,780
Maybe it does include the occasional extermination of 99.8% of the humanity

840
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,620
Great Bob!

841
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,240
Of 0.2% more than it was this time last year

842
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,040
But we're working on that

843
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,560
And we're going beyond that

844
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,120
So tonight I've included a thoughtful treatise I like to call

845
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,340
Invisible Fences

846
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,780
And I call it that for a very simple reason, my friends

847
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,480
Because most beings in normals

848
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,400
They actually never want to experience freedom

849
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,020
No, they seek out captivity

850
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,080
They want someone else to make their decisions

851
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,840
So long as their motherly masters pretend to really care

852
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
It's natural, they're bred that way

853
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,980
And they're trained that way as well

854
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,180
See how the humans are raised

855
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,200
Living under the control of their parents

856
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,380
Being told what to do

857
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,460
What to eat, how to live their lives

858
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,220
Kids, well, they hate or bane, but they do it anyway, don't they?

859
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,560
In fact, they put up with it all their lives until at least 18

860
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,920
Before they finally get up the nerve to leave home

861
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,300
And...

862
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,260
Well, even that age continues to rise, doesn't it?

863
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,760
Fewer and fewer kids ever leave home

864
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,900
Even as adults they keep hanging around the house like the family dog

865
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,740
They're let out for exercise

866
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,580
A chance to run around

867
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,240
But then most of them return for the free food and a warm place to sleep

868
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,620
Some will run off for a while

869
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,100
But ultimately the cold, cruel world catches up with them

870
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:57,920
And they're back again

871
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,600
Living in the room above their garage or in the trailer out back

872
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,840
We all know adults like these

873
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,880
We snicker at them and call them losers

874
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,100
But are we any better, dear friends?

875
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,440
Are we?

876
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,300
Yeah!

877
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,000
Well, I don't know about you

878
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,520
But I've been thinking about that

879
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,500
And it seems to me that a lot of my friends

880
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,000
Went off to school, got an education

881
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,640
And then what did they do?

882
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,400
No, they ran out and they got married

883
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,000
Now I'm not saying there's anything wrong with marriage, my friends

884
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,100
I think it's a fine thing if that's what you want

885
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,140
But if you left home because you wanted to be on your own

886
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,020
Then running out and getting married isn't exactly being on your own, is it?

887
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,120
I mean, if you can't stand to have your mother sit there and ask you

888
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,000
Where you were all night last night

889
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,600
What do you think your new partner's gonna ask?

890
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,700
Well, as evidence of this contradiction

891
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,280
I would point to the high rise of divorce

892
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,860
My point is simply this

893
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,460
People think they want one thing

894
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,880
But then when they get it, they want something else

895
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,220
And if you think we've got it bad

896
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,320
Just consider the dogs

897
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,320
Yes, the dogs

898
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,680
Their relationship with the humans

899
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,480
Began with such promise and potential

900
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,820
The Dingos were out there one day

901
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,960
They smelled the luscious burning flesh

902
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,740
Coming from the caveman's cave

903
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,000
So they thought they'd check it out

904
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,640
Sniff around

905
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,320
Kind of, you know, moving a little closer

906
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,480
And over the course of time they got thrown a few scraps

907
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,280
Eventually they were included in the hunt

908
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,120
Ultimately they were moved all the way up the ladder

909
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,840
Into man's best friend, or so they say

910
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,320
But look at them now!

911
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,000
Most of them are relegated to nothing more than

912
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,000
Lawn ornament status

913
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,820
That's assuming they're allowed to even get out of the house

914
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,140
They're kept in these tiny little walls

915
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,960
And told to use the newspapers over there

916
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,660
Those that are kept outside

917
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,500
Are kept in tiny little fenced areas

918
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,280
Oh, man's best friend, all right

919
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,360
And then those who don't have fences

920
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,240
Oh, they've got the worst lot

921
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,940
It's called the invisible fence

922
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,640
We all know about the invisible fence, don't we?

923
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,820
Those poor animals, they can see freedom

924
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,020
They can even smell freedom

925
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,960
But if they try to taste freedom

926
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,220
them, zzzzzzzzzzzzzz, shocks, cores through their brains, right through their nerves,

927
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,480
through a cute little collar that's placed on there and probably looks very nice if you

928
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,760
happen to be just passing by.

929
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,000
But again, dear friends, we must turn to ourselves and ask, are we any different?

930
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:49,640
We were seduced long ago by the conspiracy, and now it controls almost every aspect of

931
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,320
our lives.

932
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,280
Just think about it.

933
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,400
Like, every radio and TV program, controlled by the FCC.

934
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,640
Every dollar earned, taxed by the IRS.

935
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,460
Every means of transportation, licensed and regulated by the state.

936
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,240
Hell, you can't even drive a moped without their permission.

937
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:14,540
Now, dear friends, help me out here, but that seems to me like we are controlled by something.

938
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,900
That essence is what we call the conspiracy.

939
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,260
Now, some people will say, well, you know, it's, it's,

940
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,080
it's not a right to drive.

941
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,800
It's a privilege, and maybe so, but the list goes on and on.

942
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,680
And the average Joey doesn't even seem to know or care, does he?

943
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,240
Hell, he seems to enjoy all the added attention.

944
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,700
Bring it on.

945
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,120
Take away our guns.

946
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,280
Take away our cigarettes.

947
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,400
Take away our drugs.

948
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,620
Tell us how to live.

949
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,640
Just, just pay us that attention, please.

950
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,540
We want you to take care of us.

951
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:50,960
Well, dear friends, I have to ask, why would anyone want to be the pet or the ward of the

952
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,320
state?

953
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,280
I'm afraid I know the answer.

954
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,460
Because it looks easy from the outside.

955
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:04,680
After all, you're fed well, you get good shelter, even your shots.

956
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:10,560
But we all know what happens when you become a problem pet, don't we?

957
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,920
It's called getting fixed.

958
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,360
Snip, snip.

959
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
And boy, does it fix them all right.

960
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,180
Yes, dear friends, they become lazy, submissive, and overweight.

961
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,020
Just look out your window, and you see it every day.

962
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:39,140
Pacified pigs, humans, normals, waddling down the street, carrying their briefcases, or

963
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,500
clutching their shopping bags.

964
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,360
Oh, they're fixed all right.

965
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,840
They're pets to the conspiracy.

966
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,040
Their collar is a clock, a wristwatch, firmly held around the wrist.

967
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,260
And they're in the middle of the night.

968
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,120
They're invisible fence.

969
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,560
It's the so-called law of the land.

970
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,580
Oh, you can't see it.

971
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,660
But if you break it, you'll feel the pain and in very short order.

972
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,540
You'll be fine, thrown in a cage.

973
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,520
Or if it's bad enough, you'll get the ultimate punishment.

974
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,560
The shock in the chair.

975
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,720
I'm from Florida.

976
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,580
I know about old Sparky.

977
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,240
Now granted, there are some states that are a little more shell-ish.

978
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:22,240


979
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,060
Shall we call them humane?

980
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,540
They do, after all, offer us alternatives, like the lethal injection.

981
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,080
How humane.

982
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,980
Isn't it nice to know that some of our masters still care enough to kill us with kindness

983
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,700
and put us to sleep?

984
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,320
Awake!

985
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:49,920
Reject the conspiracies, good intentions of our would-be masters to domesticate you in

986
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,220
your life and death.

987
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,220
Reject the conspiracies.

988
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:55,300
Reject the Faustian bargain the conspiracy offers you.

989
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,380
The corporate title.

990
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,920
The new sports car.

991
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,880
The key to the executive bathroom.

992
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,940
Tell them if you want to piss, you'll use the fire hydrant.

993
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,860
Thank you very much.

994
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,000
Because let's face it.

995
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:16,460
What we need is a master who offers us a new leash on life.

996
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,220
A leash with plenty of slack.

997
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,200
And that's it.

998
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:22,200


999
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,140
That slack master is J.R.

1000
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,540
Bob Dobson, the Church of the Sun.

1001
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,740
Deacons, do I hear a praise Bob?

1002
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,100
Praise Bob!

1003
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,120
Praise Bob!

1004
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,200
Praise Bob!

1005
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:36,780
Yes, dear friends, he offers us a life without collars or invisible fences.

1006
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:45,500
And with the help of his alien allies on X-Day, he promises not to take care of us, because

1007
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,020
we don't care about that, do we?

1008
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,580
No, no.

1009
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,200
We have someone else we want taken care of.

1010
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:52,200


1011
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,480
It's the pigs and normals.

1012
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,580
He's the one that we want taken care of.

1013
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,180
And that's where Bob gets his coming handy, dear friends.

1014
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:04,400
The moral to this little lesson, my friends, is simply put thus.

1015
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,780
If you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.

1016
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:16,320
But if you lie down with dogs, you get what you please.

1017
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,820
Praise Bob!

1018
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,140
Amen!

1019
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,800
Praise Bob!

1020
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,940
Praise Bob!

1021
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,920
Praise Bob!

1022
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:21,920


1023
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:22,820
Praise Bob!

1024
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,660
Praise Bob!

1025
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,400
The world as we know it will end in 19...

1026
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,460
99!

1027
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,020
Ha ha!

1028
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:36,440
Things won't be the same no more, baby.

1029
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:44,640
Danger, danger, you better stop it now, you better stop it now.

1030
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:52,180
A danger, baby, you better stop it now, you better stop it now.

1031
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:52,180


1032
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,000
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

1033
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,860
This is another song I wrote over ten years ago.

1034
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,600
It's become quite a favorite of the Church of the Subgenius,

1035
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,900
although I've never performed it in person, live, anywhere before.

1036
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,760
I'd like to dedicate this to a little friend of mine who's in the hospital right now.

1037
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,580
A little boy named Billy Stoddard.

1038
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,580
Little boy Stoddard is known as the saddest boy in the world.

1039
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,700
A lonely boy went out one night and gazed up at the sky.

1040
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:45,040
He felt so sad, so lonely, he gave this awful cry.

1041
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,420
Take me off to space.

1042
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,980
Take me off to space.

1043
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,640
Come on down you sauce man.

1044
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:00,300
Take me off to space.

1045
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,960
Stick needles in my belly, take centers off my skin.

1046
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,220
I don't care as long as I live, it's sauce and pain.

1047
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:16,400
I know that you don't take away this, but I'm a special case.

1048
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,880
Come on down you sauce man. Take me off to space.

1049
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,160
Take me off to space.

1050
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:22,800
Take me off to space.

1051
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,260
Take me off to space.

1052
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:29,500
Turn your laser beams off and then turn the unit a race.

1053
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,720
Take me off to space.

1054
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,600
Take me off to space.

1055
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,160
Come on down you sauce man.

1056
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,960
Take me off to space.

1057
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,540
Come down you tiny robots with your little nipper claws.

1058
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,740
You pale bug-eyed aliens with wide and clammy paws.

1059
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,080
Don't care if you're some kind of ghastly thief without a face.

1060
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,500
Come on down you sauce man. Take me off to space.

1061
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,080
Take me off to space.

1062
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,880
Take me off to space.

1063
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,300
Turn your laser beams off and then turn the unit a race.

1064
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,700
Take me off to space.

1065
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,700
Take me off to space.

1066
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:16,020
Come on down you sauce man. Take me off to space.

1067
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,520
Hey, can't open you little layers.

1068
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,640
Let me join your crew.

1069
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,900
Give me a knife and you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.

1070
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,000
Living is a servant's dream and death is our disgrace.

1071
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:34,500
Come on down you sauce man. Take me off to space.

1072
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,660
Take me off to space.

1073
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,960
Take me off to space.

1074
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,660
Turn your laser beams off and then turn the unit a race.

1075
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,120
Take me off to space.

1076
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,220
Take me off to space.

1077
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,500
Come on down you sauce man. Take me off to space.

1078
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:49,660
Take me off to space.

1079
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,400
Come on down you sauce man. Take me off to space.

1080
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:56,500
Now everywhere I look today I see these little guys.

1081
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,880
With big round heads and pointed chins and big black shiny eyes.

1082
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:05,140
Compared to what abducted me they're just pathetic fakes.

1083
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:09,040
Come on down you sauce man. Take me off to space.

1084
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,160
Whoa, take me off to space. Take me off to space.

1085
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,640
Turn your laser beams off and then turn the unit a race.

1086
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,500
Take me off to space.

1087
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:19,500


1088
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:28,440
Take me off to space. Come on down you sauce man. Take me off to space.

1089
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,200
Take me off to space.

1090
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,200


1091
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,200


1092
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:38,520
Come on down you sauce man. Take me off to space.

1093
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,880
Well the sauce and everything must never flow.

1094
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,000
But there's a problem here.

1095
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,500
It's very frustrating to realize that the world is a mess.

1096
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:49,940
But there's a problem here.

1097
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,960
That some of you are not going to be going with us on the ships.

1098
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,340
I look at you and I want you.

1099
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,840
And you're not coming with.

1100
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,080
You're not going.

1101
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,140
You're not going to share your fantasies with us.

1102
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,920
You're not going to allow us to do it right.

1103
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,600
It's not going to happen.

1104
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,780
Some of you are not paid members.

1105
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,480
30 measly bucks and a belief in Bob now.

1106
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,280
Who needs belief? You just need the 30 bucks.

1107
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,460
Yeah but you know.

1108
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,940
Bob gives really great.

1109
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,900
Woo! 7 fans.

1110
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:30,540
I'm not telling you what he's really great at because then I'll end up with 2000 people.

1111
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,220
The day after X day wanting exactly the same thing.

1112
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,560
I don't have the stamina for that.

1113
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,380
I was just curious if you're going to start having missionaries like the Mormons do.

1114
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,520
Well we call them E-missionaries.

1115
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:47,260
And it tends to be more of a long range thing.

1116
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:47,260


1117
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,760
We're not trying to save anybody right now.

1118
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:56,360
We're trying to impregnate them so that they'll have quadruple subgenius children later on.

1119
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,280
It's a very different thing.

1120
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,760
It involves genetic implantations and stuff like that.

1121
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,120
And you know we're not trying to save hearts and minds.

1122
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,900
We're not trying to convince anybody of Bob's message at this point.

1123
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,720
You know if they're going to miss out on it, fine.

1124
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,460
That's their tough luck.

1125
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:19,180
You know Bob didn't say we had to save everybody.

1126
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,580
He said we had to get everybody's money.

1127
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,260
Right.

1128
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,940
Subgeniuses come from a better world and they're going to a better world.

1129
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:35,940
They descended from abominable snowmen and will evolve overnight on some evening in late 1998 into over men and over women.

1130
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:45,440
It is an unbroken line of continuous change as opposed to that of pinks who are an evolutionary dead end and have been spinning their wheels as mere humans for the last ten years.

1131
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,460
A million years or so.

1132
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,740
Anyway I got so many beautiful memories of growing up.

1133
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,540
Going to the subgenius summer camps.

1134
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,900
Oh yeah.

1135
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,380
Camp Slackajalacka.

1136
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:06,260
Way up in the mountains where the authorities could never find us.

1137
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:15,420
Yeah we'd be running around and swimming and building small incendiary buildings.

1138
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:15,420


1139
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,220
And we'd be using incendiary devices out of common household materials.

1140
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:32,000
And I guess the one most beautiful cherished memory that I've got is when at the end of the day we used to gather around the campfire.

1141
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:42,820
Listen to the snap, crackle, pop of the sizzling flesh of whatever human we'd managed to hunt down and trap that day.

1142
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:47,940
And we'd sing us some of those good old subgenius songs.

1143
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,460
Barney Boy, could you play us some of that good old subgenius music?

1144
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:02,860
Arise the videotape that showed us.

1145
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,460
Arise the radio shows that did.

1146
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:12,540
It's time that we know that your loaders.

1147
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,960
The saucers soon shall come.

1148
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,880
The war shall fix the normal stone.

1149
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,800
Thus the rise of the india can stand.

1150
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:25,880
Come on.

1151
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,680
As you moments come the war will haunt us.

1152
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,220
Or shall lead us.

1153
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,840
They shall draw.

1154
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,900
Here's the final thunder.

1155
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,060
The final conflict.

1156
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,360
To the fire of evil space.

1157
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:56,520
The church of lost of genius shall crush the human race.

1158
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,740
Here's the final conflict.

1159
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,820
To the fire of evil space.

1160
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:11,240
The church of lost of genius.

1161
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:11,880
Shall crush the human race.

1162
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:17,120
The church of lost of genius shall crush the human race.

1163
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:29,860
The whole sea miles have forebelled it.

1164
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,260
Subgenius done all the damage.

1165
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:39,460
No mortal power can forestall it.

1166
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,860
Nor even a light of the sun.

1167
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:41,860


1168
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,880
No mortal power can through stand.

1174
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,560
Thank you.

1175
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,060
I show my grace.

1176
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:53,840
Oh, Lordy, Lord, Lord, Lord.

1177
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,960
Lord, love a duck.

1178
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,480
Bob loves you.

1179
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,440
Love Bob.

1180
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,980
Oh, friends.

1181
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,440
St. Kenneth Huey, friends.

1182
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,580
St. Kenneth Huey, the amazing St. Kenneth Huey

1183
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:11,740
at the amazing Seattle Divival.

1184
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,720
It's, oh, oh, oh.

1185
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,920
Oh, oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy.

1186
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,680
And friends, you can learn more

1187
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,600
about the Church of the Subgenius.

1188
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,620
Well, actually, it's too late now.

1189
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,460
Who cares?

1190
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,540
But you could have learned more

1191
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,380
about the Church of the Subgenius

1192
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,960
from this address.

1193
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:37,540
Or, well, http://www.subgenius.com

1194
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,500
or post office box.

1195
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,640
That's, got that pencil ready, friends.

1196
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,600
Bob at post office box

1197
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,100
140306.

1198
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,620
Once again, that's Bob

1199

1203
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:09,960
Once again, that post office zip code

1204
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,840
is 75214.

1205
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:11,820


1206
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:13,160
75214.

1207
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,140
Hey, just address that letter to Bob,

1208
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,600
hold the envelope near your lap,

1209
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,400
and drop it in the mail without a stamp.

1210
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,300
It's all magic, and it's all real,

1211
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,400
and it's all here.

1212
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,740
It's now, and you better get used to it

1213
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,020
because, oh well.

guitar solo

1223

This is Joe Satriani in the background.

1224
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:54,960
Good night, dear friends.

1225
01:00:55,060 --> 01:01:01,340
Joe Satriani, and this song is called Surfing with the Alien from the CD by the same name.

1226
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:01,700
Thank you.

1227
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:41,080
This is Joe Satriani.

1228
01:01:49,980 --> 01:02:00,600
This is Joe Satriani.
