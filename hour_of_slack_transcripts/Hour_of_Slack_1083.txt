10, 9, 7, 6, 8, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1, fire!
The Self-Genius Power of Splat!
The Tri-Anisaurus was very bad.
This is a sub-genius Tri-Anisaurus?
Look here.
The Brontosaurus is a good dinosaur.
Boy, just listen to these kids.
They know more about dinosaurs than the experts do.
I'll give it to him.
That's it.
Enricosaurus is the friend of all good children.
The Terranosaurus Rex was bad.
Because it ate meat.
So?
Not like nice Triceratops.
Yeah, that didn't eat meat.
Munching him in the grass.
They didn't have grass.
No, no grass.
No, there was no grass as you think of it in the Mesozoic.
Although certain recent discoveries in paleobotany seem to indicate that some proto-grass
didn't eat meat.


They in fact exist in the Terranian and the later ages of the Cretaceous.
But for the most part there was no grass at all.
No ground cover like that.
Just flash floods, arroyos, gullies, and rapidly growing moss and fungus of gigantic and unusual
types.
Arlene, wake up.
But what about all the dino dung?
Didn't it grow in the...
It festered and separated in the blazing Mesozoic sun with clouds of swarming boulders.
And it was a tropical paradise.
It must be horrible like a tropical wild.
No, no, no, no.
Nay, my son.
It was a tropical paradise.
Oh.
Horrible.
It sounds like malaria.
This is a...
Careful in this part of the room.
I don't want to be bit by a mosquito and get malaria.
Well, I'm overwhelmed.
This is for...
Loyalties for the incredibly popular video.
Oh.
Rise, the subgenius video.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Wow.
And a royal loyalty it is.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is a subgenius contractual operation that is a payment for
services rendered being enacted right here on our stage tonight.
Had not been a TV show, it's about time.
Hal Robbins is being paid a check of some several, as I understand, thousands of dollars.
About two astronauts who break the time barrier and go back to the stony...
As the...
Triceratops.
But, Hal, I mean, you know what...
It's about time.
It's about space.
It's about...
It's about two guys in the strangest place.
When they see what is in sight, is it good luck or is it good night?
I noticed quite a few Triceratopian...
As through the very end of time they flew.
I mean, there's some...
There's one horn and there's two horns and there's three horns.
Oh, you noticed in the...
In the...
Revelation.
Yes.
Yes, that's the...
It's actually the...
The...
The armored knight.
The ten-headed Triceratops.
It has...
It has...
It has ten Triceratops heads.
Yeah.
And each head has three horns.
These heads represent the heads of the United Nations.
Oh, yeah.
Also...
The heads of...
You'll notice that...
The subgenius popes.
You'll notice that there's always this babe who looks kind of like what you might call
the whore of Babylon or something.
Hey.
Riding that Triceratops.
That is Princess We Are You.
Wow.
Princess We Are You.
Queen of all the UFOs.
Who's in the room next to you.
I'd love...
And in her hand, she bears a cup containing all kinds of delicious flavors and solvents.
Princess We Are You rides wild dinosaurs.
Is that what you're saying?
No.
It's not a dinosaur.
It's the nameless blob-like beast of accreditation.
Yeah.
When X-Day comes, that vision will unfold.
Will come to...
And may it come soon.
She will run down...
No kidding.
Jump on and...
Lay down on top of, essentially, dominate Triceratops.
Well, dinosaur-like creatures are going to come back.
If you must.
I suppose so.
Michael, the pictures in this book are just artist's conceptions.
They are approximations.
Illustrate points of doctrine and predictions of Bob.
They're just there for visual impact.
Yeah, and we're limited by how much...
And whatever information.
You derive from that.
Yeah.
Would just be incidental to any other aspect of it.
Yeah.
Well, I don't view dinosaurs as sex objects like I used to.
You don't?
I totally don't.
No, I...
You don't think of them as...
Like...
Into a special school...
Like a sex object you could just have your way with...
You don't think they're the cuddliest little thing?
Their emotional well-being and the distress you may put them into.
My parents put me into a special program when I was a teenager.
You're a topless.
I don't think they're the cuddliest little thing.
I don't think they're the cuddliest little thing, either.



When you heard the word triceratops, you thought you might try one, right?
I don't think anything.
Tricera, she's tops.
Doesn't have any...
You can measure my blood pressure.
All right, let's calm down and act like rational adults and not be all sexually supercharged
by the thoughts of gigantic dinosaurs that roamed the earth millions of years ago.
Any rationality of any kind.
Hey, Rastakal!
I'm not a human, Rastakal.
I'm a human, Rastakal.
I'm a human, Rastakal.
Though Seismosaurus shook the earth with gentle steps, from day to day she sought the uplands
of her birth, destroying forests on the way.
Fit objects of aesthetic contemplation.
But I don't think I can do that.
I can't do it.
It's a hard, cruel world out there.
A hard, unfriendly one.
I am the prime.
I am the prime.
I am the prime.
If you weren't so mean to people, maybe it wouldn't be so hard and unfriendly.
Creatures that sit and wait.
If only you would just be friendly yourself, then you wouldn't always be so encountering
unfriendly people.
And mad.
That's your karma.
Superior to the creatures only in his coming.
You go around with it.
Down on your face.
That sullen expression.
That gimpering way of...
There are not many men yet.
Pipeless.
Only a few shiftless, run-down hobos.
It's obvious you haven't groomed your tentacles in a long time.
The gelatin, the ooze that you're leaving behind you, that trail is way too thick.
Ooze?
You need to have your glands examined.
I had nothing to do with that.
Wash your glands every now and then.
I try to bathe them in special salves.
Have you tried any of that antibacterial soap for your glands?
It's a little bit too strong.
That's a little too rich for my blood.
I like the kind you just spray it on your glands and you rub it in and then the stuff
disappears.
Yeah, but my glands are organic too, you know.
They could be sensitive to that stuff.
That's strong.
Hey, I saw something called caffeinated soap today in a trendy shop in Berkeley.
Oh yeah, shampoo.
Right.
No, it was soap.
Caffeine, eh?
It was hand soap.
It said caffeinated, as in caffeine added soap.
Hey, I saw some beer the other day that was like $200 a pint.
Was it lambic?
No, it wasn't lambic.
It was something that was like 20% alcohol or something.
Lambic beer?
Fembant?
Perhaps it was lambic 20, oh.
What does beer have to do with the word of Bob?
Oh, well, actually I guess it has quite a bit to do with the word of Bob.
Didn't Benjamin have a beer?







I think Benjamin Franklin said that beer was proof that God loves us.
Yes.
Beer?
All done.
Fear is proof that God hates us.
Well, there is that, the alternate opposing corollary.
Fear is proof that beer combats fear, as I'm doing right now.
Well, God works it both ways.
He can be good cop and bad cop at the same time.
He works it from both sides of the table.
That's right.
God is for people who can't believe in science.
It's just a bait and switch, you know what I'm saying?
I'm not sure.
I don't think it's a good thing.

I don't think it's a good thing.


It's an age-old trick.
It's always worked.
I prefer to believe that there's a giant teapot with a brain at the center of the universe
myself.
I think you're right.
The Garden of Eden.
Under a hundred turtles or something.
The Garden of Eden?
Well, one supernatural idiocy is just as good as the next, isn't it?
Well, exactly.
No.
Not yet.
The word of Bob is superior to all other supernatural idiocies.
Well, apart from that, as a special case.
I don't see the word of Bob as superior to all other supernatural idiocies.





I see it as a divine thing.
It's a special divine idiocy.
Well, yeah.
It's only for those who are stupid and idiotic.
An anti-divine idiocy.
I know that Bob does make new dogma through the process using idiocy as one of his tools.
Well, you have to have enough idiocy to balance off the idiomics.
That doesn't mean that it's idiotic.
Oh, this is getting a little bit tough.
Heavy.
No.
Theologically obtuse.
No, you've got to have enough stupidity there to balance off all the idiocies.











You've got to.
You've just got to.
You've just got to have it there.
I don't think that's anything we have to really worry about.
That's right.
Exactly.
Got him down.
I'm going to split the small stuff.
I just got a note from management.
There's not been enough catalog reading going on on this show.
Oh, God.
That's what I say.
Oh, God.
I hate the catalog reading.
Let me ask you.
As a long-time listener to the show, I find the catalog reading offensive.
Would you prefer reading the budget, then?
In the catalog, yeah.






No, don't read the budget.
Would you prefer us just getting right into the budget?
No, no.
Let's not waste time by reading catalogs.
We'll do that in a closed session, boys.
How about just the sales figures and what's sold?
We don't have to know about the things nobody wants.
Let's hear what's popular.
Well, that's kind of classified information and not necessarily for public dispersal.
We can't bore our good friends out there in radio land with every little thing.

Well, as a business, it does not sound very transparent to me.
Whoever said it was?
After all, we've got to realize the nitty and the gritty, the nuts and bolts of it is
most people aren't interested in that kind of business bourgeois.
They want to leave it to the experts.
They want to know who Bob's been dating.
They want to know who his daughter is.
Yes, they want to know the latest celebrity gossip from the poop sheet, but they're not
interested in the bottom line.
Distraction.
This is an opaque business and it has nothing to do with oil.
And Bob's daughter is in rehab.
Snake oil, yes.
Snake oil, yeah, a little snake oil.
Different kind of oil.
JPEG dogs.
Let me show you this elixir, this magic elixir.
JPEG, sissy dogs.
Take a whiff of that, too.
Did Bob start out as a snake oil salesman?
That's what I heard.
Well, he sold a lot of things.
He did not exclusively sell oleums or penicillin.
I heard that.
I heard that.
He had to travel all over the Midwest.
He was selling…
If you've ever cooked popcorn in snake oil, you know what jiffy taste is all about.
Just about the time Johnny Appleseed was crossing the country, there was Bob.
That's a little bit earlier.
Snake oil, popcorn, peanut butter oil.
Dropping little bottles of snake oil everywhere he went.
You mean Bob came out of the Injun territory?
Now we have to get that all over our shoes everywhere we go.
Gesundheit.
We're in trouble with PETA on that whole snake issue anyway.
anyway, you know.
Pita?
Yeah, people eating tasty animals.
Oh, right.
I never heard that one.
The United Snakes.
Yes, we remember them.
I just got it.
Oh, I got that wrong.
It was people eating tentacled animals.
You people are all crazy.
These people are all crazy.
Squid fans.
Crazy is a relative term.
My relatives mostly are.
I see, that's the point.
They're not crazy, they're just stupid.
How many people do I have to kill to prove I'm crazy?
Maybe they're in different...
Who?
Oh, howdy, Sister Samson.
Hey.
You're going to trouble me.
Well, I reckon so.
We're awful busy right now.
That's going to call it.
Well, I'm not sure I understand.
You say you saw some sort of monster?
Did you see that with your mind?
Did you use your eye only?
Did you use your other eye?
He's just kind of shambling.
In the back, it was...
It was the dark.
Now, I'm sure you think you saw what you say.
The sun is just going down.
You think you saw a pipe.
Wow.
There.
This is the 21st century.
There's no more monsters.
This is the 21st century.
You saw what you told us you thought you saw.
We put a man on the moon.
Monsters just don't cut it anymore.
I would say near the 15th century.
Maybe you were better.
Tall.
Dinosaurs could live on the moon if we built them huge spacesuits.
Or just hollow out a nice play.
I took this picture of gravity on the moon.
Constant state of changing into a werewolf if we put him on the moon.
I took this picture of...
The lycanthrope perhaps could be himself.
Probably not on the moon.
Look, if you could put together the business plan for the spacesuits,
I think we can sell the concept of putting a dinosaur in them.
Yeah, that was Bob.
I can't.
No.
Werewolf girlfriends.
Well, Noah had them on the ark.
He would go into orbit.
He would stay and they would percate her.
The line between where the moon and...
He had two diplodics.
So she was two brontosaurus.
She was half wolf and half girl.
How?
And he thought off on her sliding back and forth.
That was a...
Oh, I...
Gentlemen, please.
Those unclean beasts.
Those clean beasts.
He actually had seven.
Seven?
I wouldn't hurt that.
Seven pairs of them.
Did you know that?
If you read that other part, he actually had more than just two of each.
This is like a sandbox with a bunch of little kids just talking to themselves.
More like a bunch of little kittens burying turds.
Boy, who would win in a fight?
Popeye or Superman?
We can't get out of the sandbox even if we have a theater.
Jose Carver book.
Or Doc Savage meets Tarzan.
That's a great book.
A Feast Unknown.
That's a great book.
Yes, this is the commissioner.
What?
What will Farmer do next?
Philip Jose Farmer's A Feast Unknown actually has some secrets of how the world is run buried in it
in the guise of a weird porno pulp takeoff.
That's right.
Okay, sorry.
I like that.
Monster movies and apparently cheap science fiction books.
There's actually profound wisdom hidden in the pages, which was only to be hinted at in those days.
But in our own time, it's now understood in general.
Yeah, it's old hat now.
Kids grow up knowing about the ten elder bankers of the universe.
Hi, Luke.
You have to know about that.
And knowing that they are never going to get to be one unless they can rip off Tarzan.
Or Doc Savage's genitals.
How did you get here?
Which is, climaxes the book, so to speak.
Yes, that happens in the book.
They both rip each other's genitals off.
Think of that, friends.
Tarzan and Doc Savage.
Starring the fabulous Ron Ely in a dual role.
And then they sew each other's genitals onto each other's.
And submariners.
Well, no.
You know, I don't know if we want to give away the secrets of this book.
Which is quite an interesting novel.

Well, the greatest of them all was Doc Strange.
That was the greatest.
Doctor Strange?
Strange.
Of Ditko.
That's not a novel.
Or Gene Coleman.
Oh, yeah, you guys.
Doctor Strange.
Highbrow.
Wasn't he going after some Lovecraft kind of?
No, he's on so many different dimensions.
And strings.
And interstitial vortices.
That, you know, you make your heads spin.
Mortices.
You know what?
What we're learning here is that Michael Pepe was unable to read complex material like Tarzan and Doc Savage novels.
He thought that comedy books were novels.
People say, hey, have you read a new novel lately?
And he'd say, yeah, I read Spider-Man the other day.
The new issue.
He would have been hired.
It's like a narrative.
It's a special one-year annual where it's like a narrative and the panels are full.
It's a graphic novel.
They're not comic books.
They're graphic novels.
They're graphic novels.
They're graphic novels.
It's a new art form.
I got you, dude.
Enough said.
There's only one panel per page.
I got you, man.
Are you crazy?
Well, you start with the splash panel.
I'm crazy, though.
No!
The splash panel doesn't have to have any actual place in the continuity of the story,
but what is displayed in it symbolizes the story.
Almost immediately, you get the first couple of panels of the story further on down the page.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Doctor Howland just taught you kids how to start your career as comic book artists.
And the person on the left always talks first.
But I mean, kids, do they listen to this show?
And as Karl Barks liked to arrange, always make sure that some kind of crisis happens
in the lower right panel at the lower right-hand corner of the page.
So they suddenly reach a point of excitement, forcing you to turn the page at that point.
That's how true.
That's how true.



And the television shows are written now.
Build up to that.
For the commercial.
But the best one of them all was always the X-Men issue 12 of Magneto.
Great.
Beauty.
When he finally, after the whole 24-3 pages, you don't know who is the evil presence that
is destroying the X-Men one by one.
And then finally, the final page.
It was the first full panel page of all time.
Really?
As far as I know, from Marvel Comics, X-Men.
We'll just sit over here.
X-Men 12.
And you turn it.
And all it is, is this huge picture of Magneto.
And he's holding out his hand and he's saying, I am power.
Wow.
Men call me Magneto.
For am I not Magneto?
Thanks, guys.
I'm with Magneto.
I was so scared.
I was so scared.
I was like...
Obviously, the subgeniuses would be with...
Magneto.
What about that guy that's fantastic?
In the...
You know, if the X-Men were real, the subgeniuses would be...
Who had the watchers?
Magneto.
He like wipes them out one by one invisibly.
Silver Surfer was his vanguard.
Remember that guy?
That bad guy?
Vanguard?
That was Galactus.
Galactus?
Oh, yes.
Galactus.
Yeah.
That was like, what?
80 feet tall or 100 feet tall?
Oh, he was as tall as a solar system.
He was huge.
He was enormous.
Yes, he was.
He traversed the solar system.
This is...
The only guy greater...
He wanted to devour the Earth, remember?
That was his goal.
And Fantastic Four was fighting against him.
Just to use up...
He had to eat it for it to get energy for all his machine existence.
They had to get Dr. Doom on their side to get it to exist.
Did they?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, that's 44.
Well, that's like when they have to get Godzilla to help save the world.
You know, Godzilla is normally a monster.
Oh, yeah.
When somebody from outer space comes...
That's a...
So like our...
She can take a scare at her home.
She's like her worst enemy.
So when they team up to get music, that's why.
It's been like Russia and America back before Reagan pulled down the wall.
And they were beating up China.
To be what?
Wait.
Beat up China.
Oh.
Right.
Oh, I see.
This is like the craziest show I've ever heard in my life.
What the hell kind of a show is this?
Godzilla versus...
The Wonderful Weekend.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.







No.

Or do you side with King Kong?
That's as important as Archie versus Reggie.
I sided...
Even though I love Godzilla, I sided with King Kong because I was a patriotic American.
And I suppose you've heard the story that there were two endings made of the movie.
The American one King Kong won and the Japanese one Godzilla won.
I helped spread that false story myself unknowingly.
I did too.
I'm sorry, dude.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.





That wasn't true.
But it should have been.
It was true in our hearts.
It was a nerd and myth.
I think, in far popular opinion,
probably switched over from Kong King Kong to Godzilla
at, what would you say, 75?
I wouldn't acknowledge that at all.
If you think people still favor...
I didn't see King Kong.
I suppose you do favor King Kong.
A red-blooded American is always going to side with King Kong.
Damn straight.
Especially if he's romantic and cute like the movie, I understand.
The new King Kong turns me on so much in a sexual way.
And Naomi Watt isn't bad either.
I've seen it six times now.
And I'm shooting for 99.
It's pretty great.
I want to be known as the man who saw King Kong 99 times.
But have you seen the new material that's in that new disc that's out?
As soon as I...
I set foot back home in Cleveland Heights.
I'm going to go buy that.
Wow.
Because there's more stuff.
There's attacks in the swamp.
You know, things coming out of the water.
My son said there are more dinosaurs, new dinosaurs.
A lot of...
I guess a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff, too.
Oh, I can't wait.
No.
All right.
I love King Kong so much, I'd let him use me as a rubber.
That's what I say about the new King Kong.
Oh, my God.
And I think that he should have gotten Best Actor.
That's extreme.
He should get Best Actor in the Academy Awards.
God.
Well, they ought to, really.
But they need a special new category.
Would you felch Kong?
Hey, I'm not some kind of pervert.
Oh, I see.
This year in Georgia.
Would that satisfy you in some dimension?
It would make you happy.
I mean, do you...
It would be an act of bestiality, man.
Would you allow Kong to insert his...
Dong?
Kong.
The fact is...
It's not illegal.
Dong!
You can say...
You can say...
That's not one of those words that's proscribed.
It is an indelicacy, I acknowledge.
A solecism.
That's an indelicacy.
But one's uttered, it cannot be revoked.
Or taken back.
So, would you accept Kong?
No.
Well, how...
Good.
I wouldn't either.
However...
However...
It's not necessarily...
Incompatible with a human.
Um...
Well, pongoid sex just doesn't really do it...
You know, pongoid video doesn't do it for me.
You're done for me, man.
You know, you're proud like the lion that represents your son.
Did AIDS come from monkeys?
That's the question.
Monkeys.
You're affectionate.
They're so cute.
I know.
Chimpanzees.
They're not monkeys.
They are apes.
Restorative in the royal manner.
Sorry, I didn't mean to insult their whole, like...
You insult yourself.
Monkeys.
You insult the entire human race.
Monkeys are to apes what humans are to subgeniuses.
Self-reliance.
We are apes.
Monkeys are not of our stock.
They are a different clay.
They're not even primates.
Yes.
Such as tourists.
Wait a minute.
But you're saying that the chimps had AIDS and that the monkeys did not.
Tourism has grown to a billion-dollar industry in Michigan.
Well, have the chimps got the gift, as they used to call it?
They've got the gaffe.
The bonobo.
The 70s.
The bonobo chimps do.
Oh.
The pantroglogites do not.
You wouldn't think they could get any, actually.
The bonobo.
Those are the...
They do.
They are the most sexual primates of all.
The bonobos.
Yeah, bonobo chimpanzees.
They're...
They've got those little hooked noses.
Their little ape society is built on cunnilingus and fellatio.
They're vastly ahead of humans.
Instead of pain and agony and...
They're evolutionarily...
Farther advanced.
Yes.
However, they're really endangered.
There are very few of them left.
You would think they're lovers, not fighters.
The reconstructed pit scene in the re-release of the original...
It's just like these Indian, you know, prominent...
Yeah, that's another hot scene.
What did you say?
It's reconstructed?
In the reissue of the original, there is an add-on.
It's an extract chapter there, but they reconstructed the pit scene.
Oh, oh, pit scene.
Right, right.
I thought you said something else.
Some of it is actually pretty good, but it gets kind of just funny and ludicrous near the end.
But, you know, they weren't Willis O'Brien, of course.
And then there was the spit scene where King Kong spits on his hands and does...
Oh, yeah.
Now, on the new version, the guy didn't know when to stop.
They could have told the story in no more than an hour and a half,
just like the original did, but...
Yeah.
They just had to keep prancing around with his prowess there.
Yeah.
Well, that's what an add-on should be, I guess.
But what...
What, the Japanese, didn't they recently do a new, like two years ago, Godzilla?
That was supposed to be the great...
They're always re-enviable.
Oh, yeah.
Just all the time, because...
It had digital and physical effects combined.
Yeah.
They had a Godzilla convention.
They even included the American Godzilla.
Maybe they should re-replicate.
God, that's very charitable of them.
Yeah, that's nice.
It's kind of, you know, tails across the water.
Now, when we went to see that new King Kong movie,
Princess We started crying about halfway through.
When they first hurt Kong with the...
Harpoon him in the leg and...
Gassed him.
Princess We started crying and she cried all the way through to the end.
Well, it is sad.
It's a shock.
Are you serious?
We think they're...
What if we could transfer the new King Kong...
Back to 1933 and show it to audiences back then?
They'd go insane.
You know, there's not too many...
Human...
Human...

Actors that would provoke tears.
Right.
You know what I mean?
I mean, you're saying this guy was able to do that in a big ape costume
on some sort of high-tech...
Well, and also, there's another thing.
You know how it's going to end.
Remember Konga?
Oh, yeah.
Konga was a man in a costume.
Of course.
So was the 1970 King Kong.
And Michael Gao, I think.
Konga was a man in a costume as well.
It was Michael Caine in a Michael Gao costume.
There was at least one dinosaur movie that had guys in Tyrannosaur suits.
Unknown Island.
Tyrannosaur suits.
Hopelessly erect standing.
It was called Unknown Island.
Tiny little arms.
I recently saw a Son of Hercules movie that had a man in a dinosaur, upright dinosaur suit.
How'd it look?
Pretty...
Actually, it looked...
It looked pretty good, considering.
You were convinced of it.
Well, I had seen the movie when I was about 10 years old.
And when I saw it again, now that I'm 75,
it looked every bit as good as I remembered it, which was really fake.
Yeah.
Well, I saw the big three in the row at Center Street Brockton Theater, Massachusetts.
What was it?
61?
63, your son?
63, the year of Invasion of the Star Creatures.
Oh, I didn't see that.
We didn't get that in Brockton.
Don't bother.
You didn't have...
Well, you didn't have...
And, you know, the same incredible, imaginary, silly creatures that blah, blah, blah, blah.
The incredibly...
What are they?
Strange zombies?
Yeah, strange zombies that...
Stopped living and became crazy, mixed-up zombies.
The incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed-up zombies.
God, that was a genre of movies that vanished.
I'm on...
I met the guy.
I met the guy that did the cinematography for that.
I'll have you know.
Milo Ziggler.
Milo Ziggler.
Ziggler.
Yes, that's the peculiar thing.
I knew him.
One of the greatest cinematographers of all time.
He took my girlfriend away from me.
Did that...
Milo Ziggler took your girlfriend away?
Yes.
And did the cinematography for the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became
mixed-up zombies.
And the roads, the river, and the close encounters of the third kind for which he won an Oscar.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
And he had money.
He had an office with it like, you know, trophies of all the awards he got and all these movies
back to 1950-something.
Well, Michael, obviously that girl must have been crazy to go off with him and ditch you.
I know.
I'll say.
How could she dump you for a guy like that?

You would think.
She had to have said.
You would think she was off her rocker.
You know, she was...
I think she was doing drugs at the time.
Oh, no.
That's what he's claiming.
That's Hollywood, man.
Yeah.
This confused glamour for real substance.
That's Hollywood.
That's the whole reason why I'm not a big famous Hollywood director is I wouldn't want
to be part of that.
Why is that?
Yeah, me too.
That's Hollywood.
No, this guy had a mansion in the Hollywood Hills.
Hello?
One in 83 or something.
There's an harbor here.
One in, you know, I don't know how many million dollars.
And this chick left you for them?
God.
You were wrong when you said there was no pool on board.

What was she asking?
I thank you there.
She must not have been a subgenius.
You took any more offers there?
No, she wasn't.

She was just a scriptwriter that had worked on this film Citizen with George Coates.
You remember it?
And it was William Farley directing it.
Hollywood.
Whatever happened to George Coates?
Whoopi Goldberg.
No, Dan.
George Coates.
I don't know.
What happened to George?
Yeah.
He was real big in the 80s.
Yeah, no kidding.
And all of a sudden, nothing.
George Coates.
No, they gave him a whole cathedral.
Oh, he could do anything he wanted to.
They, for his own ACT and all.
I don't know.
He had, I know he had a child and then that slowed him down.
He's probably listening right now.
Might have committed suicide.
That's the end of everything.
He'd probably kill himself because, no, he did see there, he did be here now.
Hey there, it's Yogi here.
The way of, hey there.
Yeah.
You with the stars in your eyes.
No, the way of how was the first thing.
And then RR.
And the how of why.
Was the second thing.
And then.
And then.
And then.
And then.





No, not the second thing, but I heard that one in the movie.


I don't know either.
Is that the second one?
No.
See, see here was the third one.
I missed all those glory fifties science fiction movies.
In eighties.
Yeah.
There was some good ones, weren't there?
No, eighties art, art theater and rock.
You've never seen any more.
Caltycki the Immortal Monk.
Oh, I saw that one.
That was directed by Mario Bava.
I, oh, it was.
Oh my god.
You know, I saw that not long ago
and that was a movie that impressed me a great deal when I was about six or seven
years old.
But I couldn't remember why.
And when I saw it, I realized that what had really impressed me was there was a girl fight in a, like a gypsy camp at the beginning of it.
And an endangered, slutty-looking blonde near the end.
Strange how art follows life so closely.
And, uh...
Oh my God! Don't press that!
I mean, plus it had a monster.
Suffocating a blob in the bottom of a...
Don't press the dump button!
Of a cave.
A tie.
As I've watched these movies for the first time,
there were other aspects that my subconscious mind remembered even better.
Such as the mutant Martian girl in Rocket Ship XM.
Yes, she's quite memorable, isn't she?
She looked a lot better than the radio...
...radiated Martian men...
...who had lost...
Martian lost their hair and were covered with burns.
She was merely a blind beauty who looked kind of like Moonbeam McSwine.
She was kind of an idiot, but nice-looking.
Moonbeam McSwine.
Yeah.
World without hands.
My kind of girl.
What do we got?
All right, who's Moonbeam McSwine?
A blind...
Who's Moonbeam McSwine?
Is this like...
Is this...
Are we talking, uh...
Uh, Casper?
The friendly ghost character?
Certainly not.
Moonbeam McSwine.
Moonbeam McSwine was a beautiful girl, pardon me, gal, who used to lie in the mud and wallow with the pigs, but...
Yeah, she smelled...
Oh!
She was beautiful.
Daisy Mae.
But smelled bad.
She was well...
She was known to Daisy Mae, or as the poet says,
Howdy, boys, I'm Moonbeam McSwine.
Hanging out with the pigs is my line.
The fellows admire me, yet they don't squire me unless the weather is fine.
But I does all right when the wind blows...
The other way.
What?
Oh, no!
Moonbeam McSwine is fifty feet tall!
Back!
Back!
I created you!
Fifty-back!
Back!
Smellier!
Oh, no!
Oh, the smell!
You should consider yourself very fortunate, Dr. Robinson.
But she's so sexy!
Ah, the smell of it.
Look up that dress!
What an ass!
It's so short.
But she smells like...
Al Camp.
Death.
Really had a run for it.
She's gone away with the female form.
Oh!
You think so, huh?
Yeah, I think so.
Oh, I could never open the pages to the rest of the Sunday section.
Are you aware that those babes were actually being drawn by Frank Frazetta?
Well, after a certain point.
Really?
Really?
Al Cap drew it at first.
What?
He said...
Yeah, Frank Frazetta was the ghost artist on...
Drew Gait?
Daisy Mae?
With that cleavage?
Yeah.
Oh, if you look at him, you can see.
Yeah.
You can see it.
For Olivia.
A major children's wear manufacturer.
If you look at Daisy Mae really close, you can really see.
Oh, yeah.
The information I have just been given is that...
You know, I like...
...Pinetown, as of this year, will commence the durable...
Did you say that Frank Frazetta was the ghost artist of Daycrime?
Yeah.
That's right.
That's cool.
That's right.
Yeah, he got his...
The women.
Not everyone who can view the Earth from a distance...
But he...
Are you saying that...
...Al Cap had a sort of staff of like slave artists?
No, just Frank Frazetta.
Oh.
Because he could do breasts.
You can put that gun away.
He sure could.
He could do Daisy Mae's...
He could do many wonderful things.
You know, Daisy Mae...
I could put that gun away.
Yeah, and of course, she resulted in the Beverly Hillbillies girl.
Well, during the long run of Little Abner, there were a number of villainesses who all
had different gimmicky short dresses.
Like the wolf gal, right?
Yeah, there was a wolf gal, there was a swamp gal...
And swamp gal, the front page.
...who wore only leaves.
Isn't there some kind of...
This is to distract your dad on Sunday.
...breast measurements.
Okay, that's fine.
I'll do it.
...sense of produce.
You can model cartoon characters, considering they're on the two-dimensional plane.
Well, fine, and you and me...
What system did they use to measure their breasts?
When you were a 12-year-old in the 50s...
It's hard to judge the dimension of like flat...
...a drawing, an Al Cap drawing was...
...a normal...
...different.




This is the internet.
You can for me like I'm on another label.
No one realizes it today because the etiolated doodly-squat cartoons on today's newspaper
pages can't possibly match the drama and involvement of, uh, say, Flash Gordon or...
Of a visual image.
...Trish Wilkin, Planeteer...
What everybody's got.
Two of them.
...or Little Abner.
Or Little Abner, pardon me.
A visual image which...
Is it gonna be gasoline alley?
...was almost the coolest visual image you could get outside of a television which,
of course, preceded...
Speaking of vision, image, Don Joyce, can you pot up the mic on Princess Wee who is next to Michael E.B.?
Pot up.
We don't smoke anything on the air.
Say what?
What are you saying?
I smoke pot on the air.
Now we can hear Princess Wee.
We are gone.
Switch.
Switch.
Oh, the UFO.
Once again.
I've already absorbed.
Okay, Daisy Mae, was she the first sexy cartoon?
Oh, no, not at all.
She was a really sexy cartoon.
She was, yes.
Now, get this.
Princess Wee's mother, the queen mom, was such an Al Cap and Little Abner fan in the 50s
that she was a fan of Princess Wee.
When she was gestating Princess Wee, she sat and drew pictures of Daisy Mae,
hoping that that would help make her daughter look like Daisy Mae.
And as you can see, it worked.
And by God, it succeeded.
That's unbelievable.
This is the subgenius, over-the-edge conglomeration.
KPFA.org online.
That's right.
You can listen to us in any language.
Any language anywhere in the world.
Just go ahead and try it.
KPFA.
An unusual conversation.
They're not actually broadcast on any other channel.
We broadcast in all languages.
And influences.
For the new outer shape.
Wait, are you saying that Princess Wee.
Exactly.
While she was in her mother's womb, her mother was reading Al Cap.
She was drawing Daisy Mae, copying Daisy Mae drawings,
in hopes that her daughter would come out a long-legged blonde.
And it happened.
Under her navel.
Exactly.
And it worked.
And it worked.
Now get this, however.
And that's what I'm sitting beside here.
Right.
I don't know if the folks, the radio.
This is actually quite the nice fable that you've developed here.
Princess Wee.
I really like that a lot.
Don't throw water on that.
My mother was a big fan of Dick Tracy.
And when I was gestating, she drew Prune's face over and over.
She was.
She was.

That's what happened.
That explains a lot.
Wow.
The material of your tiny glasses was you.
Sad stuff was.
Okay, that was twisted.
And it wasn't me.
Prune face.
And those other guys who finally made it to TV.
It was a pretty good TV cartoon, too.
The Dick Tracy.
So horrific.
That guy was on it.
The guy that says so horrific.
6-2 and equal.
Over and out.
Oh.
Oh.

They look pretty.
But the really good one was.
Unfortunately, there was also the movie of Dick Tracy.
Not with Warren, what's his name?
Warren Beatty.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, right.
Al Pacino.
Yeah, that was really.
I didn't say I had the diamond.
Yeah, that didn't do it.
You didn't like the supervillains in that?
The villains.
I like the villains.
I like the colors.
The villains looked good, but they weren't in there very much.
Yeah, and the color was good.
But it had warm.
Lauren Beatty as Dick Tracy.
And it had Madonna in it.
You know, we don't want him as anything.
Maybe Clyde Barrow at the moment.
And if you listen to the Danny Elfman score, it's one note different from the Batman Danny Elfman score.
There you go.
He makes $30 million a note that time.
Is that guy related to Jenny Elfman?
Yes.
Oh, he is.
Things are bad.
But he, well, you know, actually originally, you know, he kind of ran with the whole art rock, punk rock subgenius segment.
I was the biggest Oingo Boingo groupie in the world for a long time.
Me too.
They were great.
I thought they were, you know, because of that.
Yeah.
And I think Elfman as a film score writer has ripped off some of the best.
He has, he took Bernard Herrmann's ball and ran with it.
I honestly think he got the sheet music for Bernard Herrmann movies and just changed the notes.
He kept the basic arrangement.
He did Psycho.
He did the Psycho remake.
He remade the movie.
Oh, I haven't heard that one.
Well, that's happened in Mothers Bond.
Now, is he still like, is he a top, like, LA film director guy?
Or?
Mark Mothers Bond and Mutato Musica.
Why isn't he on this show?
He should be on it.
Is doing tons, well, they're too busy doing film scores and commercials.
Well, see, okay.
And children's shows.
I saw a CGI Popeye with music by Mark Mothers Bond.
It was one of the worst cartoons I ever saw in my life.
Oh, how horrible.
Pluto had become a good guy.
It was sickening.
It was sickening.
So he had to have me one of them.
Did he work on the script, too?
I'm going to hurl now.
No, no, he just got paid a bunch of money to make out the music for it.
So, you know, it's the revenge of the big people against the smaller nerds that should run reality.
Pluto to go back to his bad ways.
Now, here's another thing.
I recently saw a yogi.
Bear cartoon, a new one in which the Yellowstone Park was no longer a national park, but a rich person ski resort.
Oh, no.
Yogi, instead of being a subversive picnic basket stealer, was Ranger Smith's friend in helping to protect the rich lady who owned the park from being a discomfort.
Say it ain't so.
Thank you.
What?
Bye.
Evil hippie eco nuts.
I'm not kidding.
Yogi, we hardly knew you.
It's sad and sickening, but Yogi had sold out completely.
That whistling, I always knew he was no damn good.
Ranger Smith had sold out, and Boo Boo wasn't even in it.
They rubbed Boo Boo out.
He was too much of a conscience.
Boo Boo ran wild in another episode that was much better.
Yeah, that was a great one.
That's a Ranger Smith.
Ranger Smith got him.
Oh, man.
I'm so disappointed in Yogi.
But, of course, Yogi did say, you know, it ain't over till it's over.
Boo Boo gone bad.
Yogi said what?
It ain't over till it's over.
He did say that.
Yogi said, oh, that's right.
Yogi Bearer.
Yogi Bearer, the human baseball guy said that.
Yogi Bearer also jumped on top of the TV cable.
If they don't show up at the park, you can't make them.
No.
If they don't stay home, you can't make them.
If they stay home, you can't make them.
No one goes there anymore.


Yogi Bearer.
Who's Yogi Bearer?
Who's Bandra?
I don't know.
Yogi.
That's terrible.
Well, I hope my students in the subgenius history course have learned a lot in this discussion of
being called Yogi Bear.
Pretty similar to comic history.
Little Repskeleons who have to seize their attention.
But actually, these bad films and bad comic books are,
I think, part of the history of the Church of the Subgenius.
These are the things that we've ripped off and stolen from over the centuries.
That's our literature.
Yes, it is.
We try to drive out of our consciousness.
You say steal.
Some people say liberate.
Liberate.
Yeah.
Art wants to be free.
Just like everything has a nature that wants to be free.
Religion wants to be free.
Information wants to be free.
Just like this radio show wants to be free.
However, the church is free.
The subgenius charges for it.
Despite the wants of the art itself.
And yet we're tethered down.
But that's because of the conspiracy.
Don't believe everything you hear on the radio.
Well, that's...
Except for this show.
You can believe everything you hear on this show.
Which does represent the opinions of all stations.
No, it's only what they really feel and think.
I sent off a report, got into the car,
woke up here,
and I'm here.
This show is what is.
Freedom isn't free.

You say something that means that...
You're late to know what you really think.
That's...
It is the truth.
Cut it out!
Cut it out!
Cut it out!
Cut it out!
Cut it out!
Cut it out!
Wipe it out!
It's a tremendous...
It's a tremendous responsibility.
It's a tremendous challenge.
To...
That's right.
And remember...
As oracles...
Every privilege carries with it responsibility.
I know.
What about...
I mean, how much was the oracle of Apollo at Delphi paid?
This is mishelfing this era.
Swat over the crap.
That was a government...
Government job.
Would you quickly take this address?
They admitted to steam from the earth and actually told you what the odds...
The 1400 block of East 16th Street.
I think they were paid in goat sacrifices.
Was that it?
Yeah.
Where is that exactly?
And they...
You know, they just had to tell you...
Down south.
...whether should I attack China or not?
Two blocks east of West 14th Street.
Now, didn't Nancy Reagan have an oracle like that when she was president?
She squatted over the...
It's inside yourself.
Hello?
Only inside herself.
Yeah, she did her...
Go out without her underwear and squat...
It was her astrologer.
I have not my pencil.
You try to find it, it will not find you.
He determined U.S. nuclear policy.
I'll have to get another pencil.
What?
And, uh...
Well...
I guess the steam just goes right up in there and...
Into the field.
Uplift.
I can now indeed board.
...the ship will fly itself.
You will see.
What you seek.
Invade Britannia.
A better fighter.
Are you there?
I'm not.







I'm just a little...
Uh, register.
Roger?
Talking to God?
Franklin?
Jackson?
Most of us are not really all there.
Washington?

Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey!
Money order.
Now, do you throw...
What does Puzzling Evidence do on this show anymore?
...throw the goat down there?
What?
Oh, what does Puzzling Evidence do on this show?
He records music on the show.
He's over there twiddling dials and flipping switches.
He doesn't do anything.

He used to shoot...
He used to shoot...
Flipper switcher?
...religious leaders.
He used to shoot Bob, and now he's just a show guy.
I think that intimidated him.
The whole trial...
He's mixing it up, man!
Well, no, he, uh...
Especially if it's become famous as the Water Winter Wonderland.
...he was intimidated by the fact that he was on trial for two and a half years.
They interrogated him.
He was seduced by the dark side of the force.
Now, that's Paul Mavridis.
And, uh...
Paul Mavridis was the prosecuting lawyer.
...with the art trial.
That was Bill Jelovich.
And just where do you think all these weird backgrounds come from?
Uh, Mavridis' civil suit against Wellman...
Music account and drum.
...went on for, uh, 27 months.
And, uh, I think that's all we have for this show.
Thank you.
Thank you.



Was Wellman called before the Hinkley Commission?
Well, really, Wellman was awarded, uh, money...
No, the Hinkley Commission covered it up completely.
...for shooting Bob.
Yeah, they shot...
Yeah, but Wellman proved that shooting Bob was good, it was important to move forward
for the church at that time.
Shoot Bob Gould.
And as a result, got a, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, an award from the judge.
Well, but then it became...
2.7 million...
...a form, a ritual.
It was like a token thing.
Yeah.
Bob would show up...
Yeah.
...and somebody would shoot him.
Well, it was always Wellman that shot him.




Yeah, but...
Well, yeah.
You know, it was like...
It really is a low wage, considering how many times he had to kill Bob.
You can see why Bob doesn't show up at Sagis' Bibles anymore.
Right.
He feels he's not wanted, almost, if he's killed every time.
Actually, he...
It's almost like, hey, what am I doing, guys?
There's just no incentive.
There's...
People need incentive.
Yeah.
Now, killing Bob is a minimum wage.
Hey!
We're just...
I just think...
Why am I coming here?
Yeah.
We gotta give him a little bit more...
Yeah, he never did pay more than minimum wage.
...and, you know, give me some help here.
And they would let...
Well, you know, that is so old way of thinking.
You know, we don't launch heads anymore, either.
Well...
We've moved forward.
Maybe we should, you know...
To broad, sunny-lit uplands.
All the heads that we come across fall into our laps.
They need to be launched.
Dig.
But I'm just saying...
People want instant gratification.
Bob, shouldn't Bob be shot more?
Some subgenius traditions have survived...
Only through...
...such as everybody talking...
...whats on radio shows.






You guess?
Well, yes.
...music, performances...
Walk up.
...that are basically really audience elimination.
Elimination...
Show them your collars.
...not some...
Collar killing...
...is a...
...not a basic...
They're not collars in a cold and damp.
...the grape juice...
...is just like fog.
They get killed every time they...
People come from all over to vacation here.
I know.
Strawberry...
Call us and tell us...
Talk about the Jones boys.
...that's the thanks you get.
...and the first station they're likely to pick up because of the strength of the 50,000...
A volcano...
...took you...


You don't think they like this music?
...is WJR.
...a volcano strikes.
I'd like a collar to call an 848-4425 in the 510 area code if you don't like the music.

Who cares if they don't like it?
...instant ratification reads.
...sounds like an IRC ratification reads.
See, no collars.
That means they like it.
IRC.
That's right.
Thanks, folks.
You will not burn...
...in the lava.
...in the...
See, no collars.
That means they like it.
You will get...
...a flavorful mouthful...
...of strawberry milkshake lava.
...of strawberry milkshake lava.
...said she was going to support the station.
No matter what.
No matter what.
Yeah, that's right.
Princess Wee's mom, the queen mom...
No matter what they said.
...my mother...
...supports this station despite this show.
...freak.

So this is the power behind the throne.
Float.
So, Michael, did your...
...she owns the whole station.
So, Michael, did your mother freak?
Yeah.
She...
When she knew that she did it...
Can you still do that rant about your mother freaking?
...the world.

...freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak.
My mother freaks.
Can you still do that one?
...so old she can.
No, I can never do that.
Oh, man.
That was a classic.
...no, my mother freaks.
...she used to own the KPFA radio station.
Yeah.
She decided she was going to pay KPFA any kind of money that it wanted because, you
know, it was like so like freaky and like, you know...
Folks, will you call in?
...good or bad, you know, who cares what's good or bad?
I promise.
You know, everything's just like everything, you know?
...insert ratification.
Everything is just like...
...and one help.
...nothing matters.
...nothing matters.
...they stick with it.
No, it was...
...with the alkaloid...
What was it?
...portel.
...my mother freaks.
...my mother freaks.
...the typical WJR audience.
...my mother freaks.
...my mother freaks.
...my mother freaks.
My mother freaked and then she flipped out.
While she was flipping, my grandmother called in.
She had a son.
It sounds like a family meltdown.
I was freaking.
All the way to the bank, I was freaking.
Doing the freaky thing.
My grandmother...
...my grandmother...
...when I cashed in that big check she gave me...
...the nechromacon by the...
Man, that check was like 3Z by 2Z.
...from a bag of raw garlic packs until she saw the sign $20.
...wipes it all over my uncle's face...
...it was a big check.
...green embers.

Until you are gratified of the Babu with 13th level.
You will go down four levels, sideways, 14 through the fourth valley, overlap above the half.
And finally she disappears completely.
Rectangled into a quadrilatic avocado.
Yeah, avocado.
And it's just like a loaf of, leaf of lettuce that just spirals in on itself infinitely.
And then she disappears completely.
This is like Connie.
She's not here, but she's here.
She's spinning outward.
No, inward.
Roots in and out.
Inward.
Yeah.
She's taking a leg into her body.
And then the rest of her body follows itself into her body like the rubber man.
Only going inside.
And then her whole body finally reduces itself and disappears into nothing.
In the corner of the top of her head.
That's so complicated.
Rectangular.
That's what happens.
Is that like those snakes taking their own tail?
Yeah.
That's why Connie can't be seen.
Well, Connie can be seen.
It's just that she looks.
She looks different every time you look at her.
Yeah.
That's the thing.
With her avocado.
Exactly.
Instacatto.
As opposed to Bob, who never changes at all.
Yeah.
Bob don't ever change.
He's Bob.
He doesn't have to change.
That's right.
Always with Bob.
Dr. Drummond, that's a pretty good variation on the traditional form of that old Dr. Hal.
He's got the.
He's got the music in his soul, that boy.

He does.
Ow!

Hey, Getty.
Speaking of lettuce.
Buzzy Wabbit.

Let us pray to Bob.
Let us pray to Bob.
Yeah, now that James Brown is gone, I'm going to try out for the new Godfather of Soul.
Hey, my God.
James Brown.
James Brown.
What are we going to do about that?
James Brown had been worked out.
James Brown had been worked out.
Does the ad buddy have?
He's Bob.
He would have.
Walter Funk.
He did?
Okay.
Well, that's.
He invented Funk, which is.
Wow!
Sitting here by.
Sitting here.
Through osmosis.
Two feet away from me, Walter Funk is sitting here.
Sitting there.
Kind of individual where they are.
An individual microphone.
There it is.
And he was invented by James Brown.
And what they do for a living.
Sitting here.
They invent Funk.
It's hard to believe.
Philo, you're doing pretty good.
I was hatched out of James's pour.
All sorts of different situations.
On a sweaty day, I came out.
He sounds like a taste.
And I expanded outward.
Yes.
Philo James Brown.
What's the difference?
You know, it's.
There's got to be a new Godfather.
It's almost the same thing.
You can't just leave that job unfilled.
Yeah.
I know.
Somebody's going to have to take care of it.
So what do you think?
Are you ready to take on?
I'll take it on.
I'm ready.
You know, I mean, it's going to pay well.
What could happen?
I take it on.
And you know.
The sex, the drugs, the pills, all that.
Gives them through all that.
With the swing and love corpse.
You do the time.
You're a good driver.
You sound bold now.
Oh yeah.
I forgot.
Well, I'll see you later.
You're going to do the time.
Get in the car.
Do you remember the swing and love corpse?
No.
Like my whole life.
My mind was shattered during that time.
I had a nice hot tub back there.
I play that periodically.
We had all those drugs we had to take.
It was the law back then.
That's what justifies my taking drugs.
This music in the background was one of the early swing and love corpses pieces.
This is Sphinx Drummond singing.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Sphinx.
Sphinx.
Sphinx.
Sphinx.
Sphinx.
We saw Sphinx Drummond just last week at the Frock compound.
Were you able to swear at him?













We were about to swear at him.

Did you get his letter out of the way?
When can I go to the Frock compound?
For no reason.
We took him...
We were ready to take him to the hospital at any minute.
Anytime he told us.
Did he have too much fropp?
No.
No, in this case we...
Can you have...
Can you have too much fropp?
Yes.
Really?
Oh yeah.
You can.
Really?
Yes.
It is possible to have too much fropp if you're having more than I am.
How can that be?
It's too much.
Well, you know, they do say too much is better than not enough.
But one must...
I know.
Always hope for superfluity in the land of abundance.
Yes, it's a land of abundance.
Conspicuous consumption.
Yes, and sometimes inconspicuous consumption.
So how are you fixed for blades anyway?
Well, I've got about ten left.
While you're here visiting in this land of ours,
perhaps you lack some of the amenities of back home,
the homely virtues and the gentle tunes.
Well, it's true that back home in Cleveland Heights,
we hear none of that noise.
That noise.
We only hear the crickets that go with the tinnitus.
Oh, the cricket of bickering crickets.
The cricket of tinnitus which never sleeps.
The eyes of the world.
The million chittering crickets.
The inner crickets.
There you go.
You want to be the leader of your group.
Ah, there he is.
The cricket on the heart.
You want to be one of those.
The weak outcasts.
You want to be the leader of your group.
You want to kick their ass.
Exactly.
In Cleveland.
You want to destroy their lives.
In Cleveland on the hour of slack at WCSB.
Whose lives are we going to destroy?
We have those who are not of our kind.
We don't have a how, but we do have a sort of a micro-definition.
You're going to get something.
I can tell you this.
Transcendence.
In the neutral.
Quadratic.
Hyper.
Elliptic.
Rectangle.
Yeah.
Transcendence.
Right.
Say it now.

You have been listening to the hour of slack.
Although this time it was a rerun of the KPFA over the edge and puzzling evidence show.
Nonetheless, it is.
It is.
It is.
Now of Slack.
Or just was.

Praise Bob and thank you.
