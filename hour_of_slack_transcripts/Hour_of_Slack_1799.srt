1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Just listening to what I'm telling you now can be the turning point in your life.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,360
This is Doug Smith, radio operator. I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,220
No trouble. Just get set and get going.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,200
According, everything's going fine. No trouble.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,800
Bob?

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,860
Bob?

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,080
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,380
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,080
Hour of Slack. Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,860
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:57,740
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:06,660
The idea that America or any country values individuality as the highest ideal is a cheap myth.

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,940
Everybody's an individualist, but they don't like individuals.

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:22,400
Perhaps in simpler times it was true, but no modern industrial death culture can really afford a population of unpredictables.

15
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,920
This shouldn't surprise you.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,060
The long history of persecution by the conspirators...

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,500
...as he goes back for generations untold.

18
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,520
Subgeniuses come from a better world and they're going to a better world.

19
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:42,320
They descended from abominable snowmen and will evolve overnight on some evening in late 1998 into overmen and overwomen.

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:52,600
It is an unbroken line of continuous change as opposed to that of pinks who are an evolutionary dead end and have been spinning their wheels as mere humans for the last million years or so.

21
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,060
I think it's a real nightmare that right now when you open a science book you'll find creationism.

22
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,880
You'll find evolution on one page.

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,060
But where's the page on where subgeniuses came from?

24
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,140
Hey it's me, Buck.

25
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,360
I'm not really here.

26
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:15,660
But through the magic of the automotive tape deck studio you can hear us now.

27
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,080
That's right.

28
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,020
Friends, we're once again we're live on the air while driving a car.

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,460
We're eating a prop, driving and doing a radio show all at the same time.

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,060
Even though it's illegal in the state.

31
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,060


32
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,040
The state of Texas to eat on a prop stick while you're driving and doing a KNIS show.

33
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,560
And I've got the...

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,360
Oh and by the way, this is a public service announcement.

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,980
We can do a traffic report now since we're mobile.

36
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,480
Oh that's true.

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,660
And what neighborhood are we in?

38
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,880
Traffic on Wycliffe rolling south through Oaklawn past Hall Street is light.

39
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,360
There's only two other, three other cars I should say.

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,420
A couple speedy cars and one very nice Plymouth Valiant with a lot of people in it.

41
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,040
I'd say there's about, all about nine cars.

42
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,060
Eight revelers and one little Plymouth Valiant.

43
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,520
And all the lights are on in this car.

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,160
That's right.

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,200
And we're going by a fellow reverend's home.

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,660
We're heading for Reverend Moore's house to pick up a video deck.

47
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,280
A stolen video deck that we're going to sell for money for the church for the home for slackless children.

48
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,180
And while we're visiting with Reverend Moore, while we'll just put a tape on here in the car.

49
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,740
And you'll, we'll be able to hear this beautiful media branch tape and these lovely songs.

50
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,700
By these obscure stars that you'll wish you knew who they were.

51
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,460
And you can call them.

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,140
Do you wear designer jeans?

53
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,000
Do you feel alike in your teens?

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,100
Are you more than a man of means?

55
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,040
Is everything less than rough?

56
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,100
Are you middle class enough?

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,680
I have five monsters in my family.

58
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,860
And we all have a lot of fun.

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,020
Two fairy sisters.

60
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,660
Scary husband.

61
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,560
Fancy wife.

62
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,740
And hairy son.

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,860
That's me.

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,620
But you're dead as a beaver hat.

65
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,880
But you're dead as a beaver hat.

66
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,060
But you're dead as a beaver hat.

67
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,220
But you're dead as a beaver hat.

68
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,820
They're gonna think you're insane.

69
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,740
If you have a chance of dying, you're dead.

70
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,780
So these people want to hypnotize us into cutting their brains out with chainsaws.

71
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:43,340
I mean, if people, if people psychically will us to beat their ass, I mean, I don't see how we're responsible.

72
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,480
I mean, I don't see how we're responsible.

73
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,680
I mean, I don't see how we're responsible.

74
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,220
This is Boston's subgenius boot camp.

75
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,680
Drinking coffee and staying awake.

76
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,700
Stand up there.

77
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,440
Here, stand out in the rain and keep awake.

78
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,760
Here, have some old Bob Cologne.

79
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,340
Do you call yourself a subgenius coming to drill with a beard?

80
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,420
That's two demerits.

81
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,080
All right, Mr. Hughes.

82
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,140
Three more demerits and I'll get that new baseball glove.

83
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,080
Look at the knees of your uniform pants.

84
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,780
That's disgusting.

85
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm docking you five more demerits, Mr. Hughes.

86
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,620
Oh, gosh, gosh, get a new car.

87
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,260
What are you smiling about?

88
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,260
I hate Bob.

89
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,740
My Bob made my daddy go crazy.

90
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,820
My daddy used to make money, but now he just sits around all day.

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,540
I hate Bob. He's a bad man. I wish he would die.

92
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,260
This is part of the conspiracy.

93
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,560
It would appear that the government at the moment

94
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,420
is practicing a lot of this religion in absentia for many folks.

95
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,680
It was a trendy thing.

96
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,980
We're actually the conspiracy.

97
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,380
You've always heard of the conspiracy, right?

98
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:42,720
Yeah.

99
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,500
Well, we're the conspiracy behind the conspiracy.

100
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,880
We've decided to come out in the open.

101
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,720
You're the unnamed.

102
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,240
We're the unnamed source.

103
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,200
That's us.

104
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,120
One of them.

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,640
Well, you've certainly heard of the Public Creatinization Society.

106
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,800
And now learning to apply creative and corrective procedures

107
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,040
and to bring back to normalcy and a state of perfection

108
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,460
any abnormality or imperfection found within any given manifestation of matter,

109
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,860
any given plane, any given depth.

110
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,240
I can easily do anything that I want to do.

111
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,640
I can.

112
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,300
I can.

113
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,180
I'm a winner.

114
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,520
Pursuant to Section 28A, Article 4B,

115
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,420
paragraph 2 of the Internal Security Regulations,

116
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,940
I now hand over to you rejected applicator number 578293BO21.

117
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,920
And so white on his face.

118
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,840
Hey, I'm going to Margo to get paid.

119
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,260
I hate myself.

120
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,640
I hate everyone else.

121
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,900
I'm going to die.

122
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,420
Can you hear me?

123
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,520
What the heck is going on out here anyway?

124
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,640
I need to talk to Bob.

125
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,280
Bob.

126
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,640
Bob.

127
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,060
Bob.

128
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:41,980
Bob.

129
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,440
Bob.

130
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:42,900
Bob.

131
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,120


132
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,420
Bob.

133
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:43,600
Bob.

134
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:43,700
Bob.

135
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:43,780
Bob.

136
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:43,880
Bob.

137
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:43,900
Bob.

138
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,220
Bob.

139
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,240
Bob.

140
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,260
Bob.

141
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,260


142
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,340
Bob.

143
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:44,340


144
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:44,420
Bob.

145
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,420


146
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,460
Bob.

147
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:44,460


148
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:44,460


149
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:44,460


150
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,400
Bob.

151
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,440
Bob.

152
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,320
Bob.

153
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,640
Bob.

154
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:48,500
Bob.

155
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:51,860
Bob.

156
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,300
Bob.

157
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,560
There is no typical subgenius.

158
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,300
There's no profile subgenius.

159
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,120
The subgenius is the person who is an outsider,

160
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,560
who has been different somewhere or another since birth,

161
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,500
a person who was born with slack,

162
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,300
and we're all born with slack.

163
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,020
Original slack.

164
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,960
Original slack,

165
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,720
but the conspiracy,

166
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,660
the conspiracy of normalcy, really,

167
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,960
is what it is.

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,160
It takes it away from the minute you are born.

169
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,440
They give you that first whack,

170
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,280
on your behind to make you cry. From that moment on they're taking away your slack.

171
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,400
He was alive one minute, then he was dead.

172
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,780
Why not?

173
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,420
There must have been a reason they couldn't just barge in here and drag him away.

174
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,660
No reason.

175
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,840
What right do they have?

176
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,180
Stretch 22.

177
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,840
That's right, you're all fired.

178
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,060
You can kill yourself off or not.

179
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,080
Don't make no difference to us.

180
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,180
There's nothing you can do about it.

181
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:11,220
Oh, faceless surgeons, our new razors cut out our imagination.

182
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,340
Ah!

183
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,900
Ah!

184
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,260
Ah!

185
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,840
Ah!

186
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,800
Ah!

187
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,180
Yes, they creep up on you.

188
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
Conspiracy bugs.

189
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,880
Conspiracy bugs, they creep up on you.

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,900
They breed fast, don't you see?

191
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,640
And also, they don't need much to live on.

192
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:39,780
Just a constant supply of mindless entertainment and food and false slack.

193
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,580
That's all they need.

194
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,880
And false slack is so much easier.

195
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,680
It's so much easier to get than real slack, my friend.

196
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,760
So much easier.

197
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,920
All you have to do is work a 9-to-5 job.

198
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,380
Or, you know, the equivalent, whatever you do.

199
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,940
You know, it doesn't have to be a 9-to-5.

200
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,620
You can be your own boss, entrepreneur, whatever.

201
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,940
It doesn't matter how you get the money.

202
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:12,000
But the money can buy, can, can, false slack can only be had for money.

203
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,860
Ah, true slack.

204
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:14,860


205
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,440
True slack can be had for money.

206
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,660
But you've got to have, you've got to have a, a slack, a slack awareness, my friend.

207
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,960
More than you need money.

208
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,820
You don't need money.

209
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,180
You don't have to have money to have true slack.

210
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,140
And that is the God's truth.

211
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,320
Oh, no. I'm dreaming.

212
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,880
None of this is true.

213
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,560
I think it's my bad.

214
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,460
It doesn't work that way.

215
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,640
They don't know that this is a conspiracy.

216
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,760
This is for real.

217
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,140
They're agnostic.

218
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,480
They're agnostic.

219
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:51,900
They don't know.

220
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,360
They have to see it in front of them before they know.

221
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,920
Yeah, they have to see it.

222
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,080
And even then they deny it.

223
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,920
The thing is, is that these people are real.

224
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,380
And the pinks are the ones who actually do not exist, because they're not awake enough

225
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,620
to actually have consciousness.

226
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,500
They haven't turned into a dog yet.

227
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:08,720
They're not, they're not, they're just things.

228
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,620
They're, they're just, they're tubes to be filled with video images.

229
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,300
They're shadows.

230
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,520
They're shadows.

231
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,560
They're spirits, but they're not, they're not real.

232
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:25,360
By recreating body and mind out of remembered fragments, I was to program my own inferno.

233
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,360
Good God.

234
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, he certainly lost his mind.

235
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,380
Listen.

236
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:41,440
In effect, my soul was a monstrous cancer, continually creating within itself the means

237
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,400
of my destruction.

238
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,280
And I'm not saying that I'm not.

239
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,820
I'm not saying that I'm not.

240
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:43,820


241
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,520
You learned, you've been through the process of being a lost soul, a lost soul, a lost soul

242
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,760
is one that no longer controls its own circuitry.

243
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,980
The virus has been taken over by the enemy, which uses it to destroy me, to destroy you.

244
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,600
The sensation is like spontaneous combustion.

245
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,200
Ah, I should've taken it off the hook.

246
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,780
Oh, let it ring.

247
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,520
Andy, take a message, would you, and leave it off the hook?

248
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
Yeah, OK, OK.

249
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,200
I'll get it.

250
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,420
Go on then, Randy, go on.

251
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,160
It is this control of the circuitry,

252
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,400
this ability to send phantom signals to real bodies

253
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,860
through their remembered images,

254
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,600
like pins stuck in a doll,

255
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,900
that gives hell its power on earth.

256
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,240
Hell is not a place,

257
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,480
but a system for disrupting the plans of God.

258
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,880
She thinks you can cure the world by kindness and rules,

259
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,760
but it's too small.

260
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,560
The Lord's Prayer on a pinhead.

261
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,840
Some make rules, some obey,

262
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,820
but the rules are for the fools, is what I say.

263
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,840
The system makes me sick.

264
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,940
I wear the wrong clothes, I ask the wrong things.

265
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,680
You know I can't dance my feet off much, do I?

266
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,420
Who thinks you set the trends?

267
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,500
You wear your head straight, your clothes are out of sight.

268
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,620
Your house is modern, really kitsch,

269
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,360
you got it so macho in there, bitch.

270
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,360
I feel like I'm in a club,

271
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,600
I'm going to work.

272
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,160
I see them go to sleep.

273
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,620
I see them on TV.

274
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,380
I see them laugh and cry.

275
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,780
I'm on the outside.

276
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,420
I'm on the outside.

277
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,040
I'm on the outside.

278
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
It happens.

279
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,180
Look around you.

280
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,080
Look all around you.

281
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,000
The rude clerks in stores that hate their job

282
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,160
and take it out on you.

283
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,400
The thing about the normals is that they

284
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,180
conceptualize themselves to be

285
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,280
hot sinus effluvia on silver platters,

286
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,420
but in reality,

287
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,740
they reveal themselves to be cold mucus

288
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,660
encrustation on a paper plate.

289
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,800
But that's the way religion is.

290
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,420
It's been a constant battle since the very beginning.

291
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,480
The first man to try to guess why he climbed out of the slime

292
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,780
was the first man to pick up a stick and hit his brother.

293
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,080
We've been programmed.

294
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,140
We've been programmed.

295
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,940
This is the very beginning.

296
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,760
Our slack was taken away the moment we entered this world

297
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,040
where he's treadmill.

298
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,300
And we've been running like little,

299
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,680
rat through a maze.

300
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,540
And the only way you can get away from that is to deprogram.

301
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,400
Edit your own memory.

302
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,780
Take those bad memories.

303
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,080
Take those horrible training regimens that you were subjected to as a youth.

304
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,900
Flush them down the toilet as you excremeditate.

305
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,560
Let me ask you.

306
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,600
Let me ask you.

307
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,100
Yes, sister.

308
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,600
Did you ever own a guinea pig?

309
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,180
I ate my guinea pigs.

310
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,020
I grew them and I ate them.

311
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,800
That's dick, Craig.

312
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,600
They were food.

313
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,200
I'm a carnivore.

314
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,320
I can't help myself.

315
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,020
Kids need slack, too.

316
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,180
No, the guinea pig is so difficult to remove.

317
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,000
Doctor, doctor, here.

318
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,780
Take some more of this.

319
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,500
Have some of that.

320
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,600
Maybe the show will finish and we'll get to make another tape.

321
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,200
Oh, no. More prescriptions again.

322
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,080
I don't know if I can keep up with all these prescriptions and all these collars.

323
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,580
Do it, doctor.

324
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,920
It's good for you.

325
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,460
I'll take care of the collars.

326
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:01,660
Fake shows.

327
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,180
I'll take care of the fake collars on the fake show.

328
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,260
Oh, my God. This is a genius thing.

329
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:05,980
It's more than that.

330
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,920
Just take the pills, doctor.

331
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,380
I can't.

332
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,780
I don't think I can keep up with it.

333
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,660
I mean, it's like there's too much of it.

334
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,240
Pull yourself together, doctor.

335
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,380
These letters that come in the mail.

336
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,820
These weird magazines.

337
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,580
These characters that show up at the door.

338
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,940
Doctor, take your medication.

339
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,380
These bobbies.

340
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,480
They want to know things.

341
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,380
They want to know how to run their lives.

342
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,260
What should I do?

343
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,980
What's the worst thing about this?

344
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,280
About my girlfriend?

345
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,320
My girlfriend that wouldn't want me to worship?

346
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,420
What should I do, man?

347
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,040
Relax.

348
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,120
Relax, doctor.

349
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,400
Relax, doctor.

350
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,860
I'll tell you what you should do.

351
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,180
It's like, doctor, you should do this.

352
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,860
No head launching, doctor.

353
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,580
Oh.

354
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,540
Take the pills.

355
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,280
Oh.

356
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,800
Light the fire.

357
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,380
Oh.

358
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,760
Try some of this false slack.

359
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,560
But we can't talk about that because it would leave this station open to libel and slander.

360
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
That's our lawyer now.

361
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,800
Oh, my God.

362
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,020
He's here.

363
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,080
Gee, I feel much better now.

364
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,480
Oh, man.

365
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,580
I'm sorry.

366
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,360
I'm sorry.

367
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,360


368
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,360


369
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,360


370
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,360


371
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,360


372
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,360


373
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,360


374
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,360


375
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,360


376
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,360


377
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,360


378
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,360


379
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,800
I have to go.

380
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,240


381
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,340
Okay, bye-bye.

382
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,480
Bye-bye, открыz heading.

383
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:14,480


384
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,180
Bye-bye.

385
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,440
Hello, hey, I got thumbs on that one.

386
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,080
But I'll kick your ass and then throw up the whole fucking place, but I'm fine.

387
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,900
It makes me a little more lips in a round.

388
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:25,940
Whoa-oh.

389
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,020
I think you're driving me nuts.

390
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,380
Oh, man.

391
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,380


392
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,380


393
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,640
Go on, pop some cigarettes.

394
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:27,640


395
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,340
You don't have the t»

396
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,820
Now that's what I call soul!

397
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,020
Let me try some of that.

398
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,900
Jesus, that must have been a fairly intelligent normal.

399
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,600
Oh no, that wasn't a normal, that was...

400
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,440
God, I think I got some of his memories off of that.

401
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,300
Wow! Yeah!

402
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,880
It's like I'm seeing this little woman in the 40s, just for a second.

403
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,480
That's probably the guy's mom.

404
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,480
Yeah.

405
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:15,040
God, you can snort their souls and these little primal memories come in.

406
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,620
You've just got to give them final unction and dry them out first.

407
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,780
God, how long have you guys known about this?

408
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,280
I mean, was this something the Indians had down there?

409
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,820
Yeah, yeah.

410
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,360
It's too rainy to light a fire to smoke a soul a lot of times,

411
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,880
so they just dry it and keep it with volcanic rock as an absorbent.

412
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:35,860
Oh, yeah.

413
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,960
And they just grind it up and snort it through huge, huge caves.

414
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,400
But they didn't have the technology to extract souls.

415
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,320
I mean, how'd they get them under pressure?

416
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,720
How'd they get them into the canisters?

417
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,600
They don't do it that way.

418
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,240
They just feed them the right amount of herbs and plants

419
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,760
and the soul just drips out of the nasal and anal and...

420
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:53,960
You're kidding!

421
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,920
No, it just...

422
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,900
Why can't we do that?

423
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,580
We can if we've got the right pills.

424
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,280
It's kind of, you know, it's all organic.

425
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,840
I mean, you know, there's two ways you can extract.

426
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,920
You can go high technology,

427
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,180
or you can go with just kerosene and a couple of guys with bare hands.

428
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,180
Why did Bob set up these extraction machines?

429
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,040
Well, all you gotta do is you dig a little pit.

430
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,080
You dig a little pit in the ground, you line it with plastic,

431
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,680
peg down with wood, and then you put the body in.

432
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,780
A normal, right?

433
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,140
Yeah.

434
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,160
Any normal?

435
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,640
Any normal.

436
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,260
Any normal that isn't dead yet.

437
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,660
The stole is still in him, right?

438
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,960
Okay, then you cover him with kerosene and acetone,

439
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,160
and then you just jump up and down on him until it turns kind of green and thick.

440
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,680
Then you remove him, strain the liquid, then you boil it, and you add sulfuric acid.

441
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,940
But then there's some kind of ritualistic...

442
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,580
I mean, what actually causes the transmutation?

443
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:56,980
Well, there's a group of people around the pit adding a psychic element of the alchemy, you see.

444
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,440
That's...

445
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,600
They concentrate.

446
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,160
Oh, yeah, because they don't have the soul amplifier.

447
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,740
Right.

448
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,600
So it's just done with psychic methods.

449
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, man.

450
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,320
And then, after it's boiled...

451
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,020
God, that's incredible.

452
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,340
After it's boiled, they add...

453
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,980
A bunch of Brazilian tribal jungle people...

454
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,660
Ambulibians.

455
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,420
Ambulibians.

456
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:12,700
Both.

457
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,700
They both do it.

458
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
In the lowlands on both sides there.

459
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,960
And then you boil...

460
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,460
They boil the soul.

461
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,560
They actually boil the soul.

462
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,320
Little comba souls.

463
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:20,860
Yeah.

464
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,580
They boil...

465
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,120
And little coya souls, too, you know?

466
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,080
And they boil them, and then when it starts to thicken, they add another liquid.

467
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,220
It's some kind of corrosive, I believe.

468
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,840
And then it turns into a thick white paste, and they just spread the soul.

469
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,980
They just roll out into the sun, and it dries, and then you just have to chop it up.

470
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,120
They'd probably think we were idiots for crystallizing them and compressing them.

471
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,720
Yeah.

472
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,960
I mean, it's...

473
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,940
I mean, it probably doesn't cost them...

474
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,420
You know, it costs them a couple of necklaces or a, you know, a taper.

475
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,880
Well, they don't need electricity to do it.

476
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,120
That's the thing.

477
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,800
Their pet taper.

478
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,600
Yeah.

479
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,660
Well, going...

480
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,060
The most expense they've got.

481
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,000
And it costs us a hundred grand a year to keep these things pumping along.

482
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,480
Well, you see, we use a lot of...

483
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,820
And not to mention the bodies and the souls and the...

484
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:02,820


485
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,580
Getting rid of them.

486
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:03,880
Well, that's the thing.

487
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,940
See, the body dissolves.

488
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,140
Storing them.

489
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,620
The body dissolves in the solution completely.

490
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,220
Well, do you do up the body, too?

491
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,800
No, they just strain it out with a solid waste.

492
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,600
What do they do with that?

493
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,000
With that?

494
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,660
They put it on the...

495
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,980
They press it into little cakes and burn it, like for fires and stuff like that.

496
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,460
They usually give it back to the guy's family.

497
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,540
How come the...

498
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,360
How come they...

499
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,200
How come this was...

500
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,560
Like, how come the Western civilization didn't discover that?

501
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,140
Well, you see, it's because...

502
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,180
How come they haven't been ripped off yet?

503
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,360
How come we didn't rip them off?

504
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,460
Well, because we can pay for soul and get it a lot cheaper from them than doing it up

505
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,600
here because, you know, like down there, nobody complains if you go through four or five hundred

506
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,020
bodies in one night, you know?

507
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,200
You can sit around and smoke all the soul you want to.

508
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,660
Yeah, I guess it would be kind of questionable to...

509
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,260
They got a lot more soul...

510
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,240
To be digging pits in your backyard and throwing normal bodies in there.

511
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,520
Well, it's just little pressed cakes.

512
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,120
Noisy, if nothing else.

513
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,160
It's just little pressed cakes.

514
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,040
Most people barbecue on them later, you know?

515
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,640
Well, the senator got indicted.

516
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,820
Bob never forgot him.

517
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,120
You see?

518
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,420
Well, and then we've got to give half of them away to the...

519
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,960
Whatever, wherever they're taking on Jupiter.

520
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,700
Well, of course, the thing about a lot of...

521
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,620
That weirds me out, man.

522
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,640
A lot of things weird me out.

523
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,000
The fact is that you can't get any good soul here in the States, dry or liquid.

524
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,720
It's always been cut with something.

525
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,980
And I like my soul unstepped on myself, you know?

526
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,960
Oh, yeah.

527
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,280
They'll use monkey souls, chimpanzee souls.

528
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,200
Hell, they just take up crystallized...

529
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,400
There's probably two-thirds...

530
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,440
They just take crystallized emotions and mix them in, for God's sake.

531
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,860
I mean, you get a bad blast of rage mixed in with your soul, and the next thing you know, man, you...

532
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,440
That's probably what happened to me last week.

533
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,940
They put a lot of anguish in it, too, you know?

534
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,760
It just makes you depressed.

535
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,700
Where it's...

536
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:04,000
Pure soul is nothing more than a psychic and, you know, almanic amplifier.

537
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,480
And, you know, if your soul's in good shape when you do pure soul, I mean, it's even better.

538
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,340
But, you know, like, you put...

539
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,620
The stuff that's been stepped on and...

540
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,700
Mixed with monkey soul or alligator...

541
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,620
Yeah, next thing you know, your soul is...

542
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,700
It's tainted.

543
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,840
Very tainted.

544
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,500
Got holes eaten through it, you know?

545
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,720
Man, I wonder if that's what happened to Jane or...

546
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,660
What happened to Jane or?

547
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,240
Yeah.

548
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,680
Jane or shoots soul.

549
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,540
Oh, no.

550
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,220
He's all...

551
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,200
I mean...

552
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:32,960
He's back there firing it.

553
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,600
He magnetized my Palmer head.

554
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,040
He calls it.

555
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:36,740
Yeah.

556
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,600
Hey, you need to give me some of that re-magnetized Palmer head.

557
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,180
I won't do any demagnetized Trevino head.

558
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,220
See, that's a problem with Jane or is doing it.

559
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,800
That Palmer head, you know, it was not a good molecule to begin with.

560
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,700
And, you know, he's just synthesizing more and more of bad stuff.

561
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,360
Mm.

562
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,400
And making it purer and purer.

563
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,740
And each time he makes it purer, it's more pure bad.

564
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,580
Mm.

565
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,260
That's his basic problem.

566
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,460
Running up demagnetized soul, bad golfer souls.

567
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,140
Yeah.

568
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,300
Can you imagine?

569
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

570
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

571
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

572
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

573
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,540
I made Monday our

574
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:33,800
day.

575
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,920
Sadie don't believe me, she's pretty sexless

576
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,560
Who knows what else is the image of me?

577
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,600
I make my friends, I make my friends

578
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,700
I dance with David, dance with David

579
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,060
I make the world a place where she makes me play

580
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,920
I'm a sign to the tower of my kind

581
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,820
And forever I will say what I will not believe

582
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,100
I'm a sign to the way you just became a slave

583
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,180
And I'm a sign to the way to be

584
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:43,040
I'm a sign to the way to be

585
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,320
I'm a sign to the tower of my kind

586
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,320
And forever I will say what I will not believe

587
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,520
I'm a sign to the way you just became a slave

588
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,600
And I'm a sign to the way to be

589
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:41,600
I'm a sign to the way to be

590
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,720
And I'm a sign to the dis hobby

591
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,840
And I'm a sign to the way to be

592
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,640
And I remember

593
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:50,820
I still have to live

594
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:56,260
Yeah, I mean I know how it works

595
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,260


596
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,040
But I'm not sure if you got my head on it

597
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,040


598
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,080
Why didn't I know better

599
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,520
Manager!

600
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:01,520


601
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,480
Uh-huh

602
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,220
I heard in the other building

603
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,000
writer

604
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,900
I'm not sure I didn't know

605
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:06,900


606
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,020
The fuck did I think of that?

607
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,000
I fell for that

608
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,140
That I knew

609
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
My baby!

610
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,340
My baby! My baby!

611
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,060
My baby!

612
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,300
Perrier hairspray

613
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,460
Waterbeds for two

614
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,660
Jogging elf foods

615
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,920
And lots of social good

616
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,820
Khaki pants

617
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,260
White shirts with those alligators

618
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,140
Mercedes Benz

619
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,380
How about tennis slater?

620
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,260
Twins

621
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,880
Twins

622
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,020
Red bull

623
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,660
Red bull

624
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,980
You'll never know

625
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,960
Where the subdues beach party is

626
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,480
And don't you wish you did

627
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,680
Oh dear that dingy

628
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,940
Well Dr. Howell is there any way you can fight through the sound effects

629
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,920
And tell us about their relationship

630
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,940
Between the demopods and the ussopods

631
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,140
Well the demopods and the myriapods got together

632
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,300
Demopods and ussopods?

633
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,760
Oh the demopods

634
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,580
I didn't understand that

635
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,760
I thought you meant this script right here

636
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,520
The one with the red lines on the cover

637
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,440
Listen never read anything with red dots

638
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,120
I never believe anything with red dots

639
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,100
It says read addresses that people don't like on the show

640
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,920
Too many buttons to push

641
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,080
Too many tape recorders to watch

642
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,380
It was obvious that during the game

643
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,460
They should not have launched ahead with that size of rocket

644
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,040
They should have used a smaller rocket

645
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,180
Not hurt so many people

646
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,320
Some perhaps but not so many

647
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,920
As it turned out JFK was turning to Governor Connolly

648
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,500
To tell him the name of the band

649
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,580
That dare not speak his name

650
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,260
And was shot because of that

651
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,540
Thank you for your input caller

652
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,080
What does it sound like where you are?

653
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,620
What does it sound like where you are?

654
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,200
What is weird?

655
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,100
It's a weird DJ dressed up in a crown of thorns

656
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,860
And a dirty

657
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,220
Dirty sheet

658
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,080
Starts kissing on you

659
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,740
I

660
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,660
And don't forget

661
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,520
Come on

662
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,300
Come on

663
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,960
Come on

664
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,040
Come on

665
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,240
Come on

666
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,300
Come on

667
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:23,640
Come on

668
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,320
Come on

669
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,160
Oh hi

670
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,780
I just wanted to remind you that the elementary school kids

671
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,620
Are coming in for their annual tour

672
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,600
And this year try not to scare them will you

673
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,480
All that making faces through the control room window

674
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,180
And wearing your toupee sideways

675
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,920
Didn't do us any good you know

676
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,880
Some of the teachers insist you're an idiot

677
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,680
It's ho for horse

678
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
Or meth or green

679
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,540
To spark a swinging mood

680
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,340
While the rats run up my trouser legs

681
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,100
Roaches share my food

682
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,960
Rats and roaches

683
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,840
Nuzzle me

684
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,640
When it's dark and hot

685
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,500
Love love it's all the same

686
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,060
Mixing speed and part

687
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,000
First a rat and then a roach

688
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,460
Or both a rat and then a roach

689
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,500
Both as like as not

690
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,220
If I can't find a fix tonight

691
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,260
My marrow bones will rot

692
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,920
Goodbye transcendent

693
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,700
Pumpkin square

694
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,540
I haven't long to stay

695
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,040
A double jolt of heroin

696
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,220
And I'll be on my way

697
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,100
Let's

698
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,680
Ah yes dear friends here we are

699
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,020
At home

700
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,000
At uh on the airwaves

701
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,500
This is Reverend Ivan Stang

702
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,740
With Dr. G Gordon Gordon

703
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,080
And

704
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,860
I'm going to stop and explain just

705
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,120
In credit at least we can't ever explain

706
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,860
Who those fools making those weird noises were

707
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,600
That we were playing on your radio

708
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,580
Let's see the music started off

709
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,960
With a band called They Might Be Giants

710
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,480
Which Reverend Bleepo Abernathy

711
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,460
In Boston has been sending tapes of

712
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,380
You'll hear them every now

713
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,320
And then

714
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,760
But uh quite a bit of their

715
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,820
Was

716
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,780
The um the show

717
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,920
Less than an hour

718
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Or less than a show more than an hour

719
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,200
And then they send

720
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,200


721
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,840
The Berkley Show

722
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,340
Puzzling evidence Dr. Gary Gbrog-Fran

723
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,660
Dr. Howell

724
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,080
And um various insidious guests

725
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,640
Mobius Rex and so forth

726
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,800
And evil subgeniuses

727
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,620
Intermixed with a uh

728
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,700
A tape from uh

729
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,500
Bishop Huey of Houston

730
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,540
The Bishop of Archbishop of Houston

731
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,320
On uh a sister station down there

732
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,820
He sends these tapes that

733
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,580
Are always labeled collages from hell

734
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,420
Of volumes nineteen

735
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,300
Through forty

736
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:44,860
So

737
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,240
Dear friends once again as we saw

738
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,340
Uh we come to the end

739
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,740
Of this side of the show

740
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,660
Once again you'll have to

741
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,980
Turn your radio over

742
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,980
Flip it so that you can hear the rest

743
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,400
This is the subgenius radio ministry

744
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,500
Hour of Slack

745
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,940
Ah yes dear friends

746
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,380
This is old

747
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,620
Reverend Stang in the year of

748
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,340
Twenty twenty

749
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,320
Explaining that we're listening to

750
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,140
An even older

751
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,680
Show from nineteen eighty five

752
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,940
This is Hour of Slack

753
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,900
Number six

754
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,460
Uh with a lot of G. Gordon

755
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,460
Gordon involved

756
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,540
Yes Claudia

757
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,300
That's right

758
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,440
Everything's okay

759
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,400
Uh otherwise you could

760
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,560
Call this Hour of Slack

761
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,160
Number one thousand seven hundred and

762
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,440
Ninety nine but it just makes me

763
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,360
So tired to even think about

764
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,700
That

765
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,220
Right Claudia

766
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,020
I can't believe you're

767
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,080
Talking about

768
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,480
The radio show

769
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,600
Uh yes dear friends

770
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,180
We're back and boy

771
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,720
It's getting tough doing these

772
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,480
Shows night after night after night

773
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,480
It's easy for you

774
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,200
You only have to listen once a week

775
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,640
But we do ten shows a day

776
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,980
We have to keep up

777
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,900
Stay ahead

778
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,080
What is that noise

779
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,900
I have no idea I think it might be the

780
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,160
Exes on the outside of the hall

781
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,080
No no

782
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,220
Yeah I can hear the hiss

783
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,120
The air noise

784
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,360
We're still on the fringes of the atmosphere

785
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,680
You know that's just a few molecules

786
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,960
What happens if I push this button

787
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,360
What

788
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,780
Running up demagnetized

789
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,860
Oh you can hear us

790
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,540
What if we flip

791
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,440
Is that a whole week show there

792
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,260
Here we go

793
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,120
Up there went the mystery in the magic

794
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,760
Right there

795
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,020
Why did you have to say that

796
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,360
Time was missed

797
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,500
Hey is this that time magazine ad

798
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,100
About Vietnam

799
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,100
Yes it is

800
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,440
Jump ship before it's too late

801
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,120
A feast for the eye minded

802
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,240
We don't want to do that

803
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,340
I think he's right

804
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,720
He what do you mean he

805
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,900
No I used the term he

806
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,540
To describe all aliens that call the show

807
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,080
I don't think humans ever call

808
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,300
The show

809
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,740
If that's an it

810
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,700
What is that

811
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,580
If it's an it

812
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,820
I mean why not

813
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,020
The show was getting fixed

814
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,460
They were fixing the show

815
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,160
And nobody knew exactly where it would lead

816
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,400
Now subgenius publishing guides you through this intriguing realm

817
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,700
In a unique and spectacular family library

818
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,500
The book of the subgenius

819
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,380
Here we go

820
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,840
Up there went the mystery in the magic

821
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,480
Right there

822
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,720
Why did you have to say that

823
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,600
Well Gary we just thought we'd say it

824
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,900
There went the mystery in the magic

825
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,020
Yeah it's all over the place

826
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,940
You use a million gigawatts of electricity to extract souls up here,

827
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,420
the energy is released psychoactively and with simple chemicals down there.

828
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,580
And we never freebase soul either.

829
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,900
I mean, that's really bad.

830
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,320
Just drinking it, that's all.

831
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,800
Drinking it and snorting it.

832
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,700
I like a little iced soul myself.

833
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,740
I like it best out of balloons, to tell the truth.

834
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,700
That is my favorite way of doing up some soul.

835
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,280
Yeah, tank soul is good stuff.

836
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,400
High-pressure tank soul, I like.

837
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,040
Just the pure stuff, straight out.

838
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,780
Straight out.

839
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,220
That's just, they cook it, you know, and then it turns into a gas.

840
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,720
And then they pump it under pressure.

841
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:04,640
They scrub it through dog meth filters and stuff like that to make sure,

842
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,860
because when you get it into that excited state,

843
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,380
every little part of the soul separates from every other,

844
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,280
so you get little pockets of, you know, stuff that was like childhood dogma rammed into you.

845
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,160
So they scrub that all out.

846
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,380
So it becomes, it's the most pure form in gaseous form.

847
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,800
Oh, yeah, but the only problem is that, you know,

848
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,320
the people that end up banging their head against the wall all night long

849
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,620
because they can't stop, they're in such ecstasy or whatever.

850
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,600
People have fallen down the floor a lot.

851
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,340
Pure beingness.

852
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,740
The beingness.

853
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,320
The beingness of it, they, you know, makes them, for some reason, chew the ground.

854
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,700
Man, that's what I did.

855
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,120
That's how my jaw got messed up.

856
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,740
You know, you can tell someone's...

857
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,520
Woke up chewing the ground.

858
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,060
Yes.

859
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:47,820
Woke up chewing the...

860
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,120
I loved Mother Earth.

861
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,300
I woke up chewing the bathtub.

862
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,040
I made a big mess.

863
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:51,600
Yeah.

864
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,580
You can tell that the soul really affects people more in gaseous state

865
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,500
because the minute they speak, their voice isn't the same, you know.

866
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,860
Well, it goes directly, directly to the main gland.

867
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:05,820
Yeah.

868
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,600
I mean, it's...

869
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,660
It just diffuses in the blood so fast.

870
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,320
Put the Barry Manilow music on.

871
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,080
Here we go.

872
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,180
That's a scrambled signal.

873
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,120
We have not been able to figure this one out.

874
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,360
You can slow it down and it's like old TV shows,

875
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,300
but in between the lines are these even more,

876
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,300
these incredibly fast little, like, micro blips of sound

877
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,460
that we have not been able to stretch out enough.

878
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,220
Stretch them out?

879
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,700
Even, I mean, the best visual...

880
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,840
I mean, the space between the blips...

881
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,980
You can't slow it down enough.

882
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,800
Maybe the space is between the blips of the actual message.

883
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,080
Yeah, but we can't slow it down that much.

884
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,180
I mean, you can't differentiate.

885
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,460
The machines won't...

886
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,760
It's alien.

887
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,620
It is a truly alien signal.

888
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,300
It's there.

889
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:51,620
Play the music.

890
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,300
But...

891
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,300
Yeah, that was a great band, man.

892
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,060
I wonder whatever happened to them.

893
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,920
They're playing the hydrogen line now, I think.

894
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,180
Woo!

895
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,840
I think this is one of their...

896
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,200
The number's coming in right now on Channel 7.

897
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,020
Channel 7.

898
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,100
Cell phone rings.

899
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,200
Cell phone rings.

900
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,680
Cell phone rings.

901
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:05,160
Cell phone rings.

902
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,660
The thing's frequency modulated.

903
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,760
It's got another burst in the ultraviolet that's recorded.

904
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,140
It's got digitally extended equalized components.

905
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,340
I mean, it's incredibly complex.

906
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,220
It's magic.

907
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,560
It's probably got a pamphlet coated in it.

908
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,840
No, they have their own pamphlets.

909
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,600
That's what I meant, their pamphlet.

910
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:32,980
Yeah.

911
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,020
I think it's definitely next to the same.

912
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,760
That's what scares me about it.

913
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:42,280
I mean, it would do to us what ours do to the little people.

914
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,840
Well, it's the way it is.

915
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,600
You know how it is.

916
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,020
There's only two guys you need to cop are little people.

917
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,040
You know what I'm saying?

918
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,520
Or skin jobs.

919
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,260
You know what I'm saying?

920
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,340
Yeah.

921
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,960
Take you out with me to hear what it's like outside where I live.

922
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,260
Notice you don't hear too many cars.

923
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,000
But you hear a lot of cars.

924
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,280
A lot of bugs and a lot of birds.

925
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,780
That was Bubba Gee.

926
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,220
Say hi to the people.

927
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,820
You care about your special friend, and it cares about you.

928
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,800
That's how the Care Bears came to be.

929
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,960
Just listen and turn the page when you hear the music box.

930
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,560
We've entered the final tribulation period.

931
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,440
I believe we'll know when it happens.

932
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,240
I don't know yet exactly how we'll know that it has happened.

933
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,640
But I believe with all my heart that when we get there, we're going to know it has happened.

934
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,800
The true believers will know because they know what the character of the final tribulation period is.

935
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:05,000
The final tribulation period is that time when no one else is being...

936
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,400
saved.

937
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,820
And when the church has become so apostate, the denominations and congregations,

938
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,360
it's almost impossible to find one that is left that is true to the word of God.

939
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,180
The day the world ended is here.

940
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,100
Shocking, terrifying horror.

941
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,980
See the world ended by atomic fury.

942
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,380
See the horrible mutant who seeks a mate.

943
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,760
See the terrifying beast on the ocean floor.

944
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,140
See the battle for life at the bottom of the sea.

945
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,980
Yes, see the fantastic world of...

946
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,080
Death and horror in the top shock show of all time.

947
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,780
Generic giant crab music with overlord Huey.

948
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,880
Food fights of the gods with your personal friend, Bishop Huey.

949
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,320
Well, this is your pal, Colonel Huey, and this is Nightcrawler's Lament.

950
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,340
I want you to talk like a horrible Texas trucker in no time.

951
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,600
Well, despite numerous protests from leading substantial citizens, here I am again,

952
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,760
your pal and temporary father figure, Mr. Huey with another danger run.

953
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,080
This is the club car and the hill-bound train.

954
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,000
Why it's called...

955
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,660
Shhh!

956
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:05,920
Shhh!

957
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,920
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

958
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,240
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

959
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:15,720
Shhh!

960
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,220
Don't forget, boy, look over your shoulder.

961
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,940
Cause there's always someone coming after you.

962
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,400
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

963
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,720
Sightly! Sightly!

964
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,420
Sightly!

965
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,820
Okay, it's about...

966
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,660
We are advancing constantly, and we're not interested in holding on to anything except the enemy.

967
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,140
We're going to hold on to him by the nose, and we're going to kick him in the ass.

968
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:00,680
We're going to kick the hell out of him all the time, and we're going to go through him like crap through a goose.

969
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,880
You have reached the correct number.

970
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,380
However, your call has already been analyzed and rejected.

971
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,560
This matter is out of our hands.

972
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,740
As soon as we are able to transcend the time problems inherent in life on Earth

973
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:26,120
and gain control of the situation, we will return you to your previously scheduled conversation.

974
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:34,280
If this had been an actual phone call, you would have been instructed to leave your name, number, time, and message when you hear the tone.

975
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,460
Thank you.

976
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,480
Somebody playing a duck.

977
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,520
This is oral fixation.

978
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:25,780
This is oral fixation, which is a bunch of members of the Severn Institute.

979
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,480
It's their selection of material that is the best thing.

980
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,720
And these guys play...

981
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:34,720
Uh...

982
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,000
Uh...

983
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,000


984
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,000


985
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,280
On stage, they do this as a live show, but they don't actually sing.

986
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,400
They play the tape.

987
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,400
It's true.

988
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,200
Uh...

989
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,120
Uh...

990
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:45,820
Uh...

991
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,380
Uh...

992
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,280
Uh...

993
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,840
Uh...

994
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:50,900
Uh...

995
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,320
Uh...

996
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:51,500
Uh...

997
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,060
Uh...

998
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:52,100
Uh...

999
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,040
Uh...

1000
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,000
Uh...

1001
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,200
Uh...

1002
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,620
Uh...

1003
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:12,580
Uh...

1004
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:13,240


1005
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:13,240


1006
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:13,340
Uh...

1007
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,400
The drums are great!

1008
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,900
This guy standing beside you...

1009
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,560
Oh, my God!

1010

In the village.

1052
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,340
What do you want?

1053
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,380
Information.

1054
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,660
Whose side are you on?

1055
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,640
That would be telling.

1056
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,180
We want information.

1057
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:54,820
Information.

1058
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,080

Information.

1060
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,500
You won't get it.

1061
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,660
By hook or by crook, we will.

1062
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,200
How many more times do we have to listen?

1063
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:18,020
How many more times do we have to hear the worst song ever?

1064
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,480
This band is terrible too.

1065
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:24,860
They just want to fall asleep.

1066
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,140
Yeah, the audience is going in every different direction possible.

1067
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:32,760
This.

1068
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:33,640
Sick of them.

1069
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,800
They're sick of the Cafe Depresso.

1070
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,300
Yeah, they're sick of everything here.

1071
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,760
They only know three chords, but you're only going to see them play one.

1072
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,480
I'm so tired of these guys.

1073
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,680
This band's bad.

1074
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,380
It's no surprise.

1075
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,800
I wish they'd just pack it up and go away.

1076
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,260
They're not going to let us go.

1077
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:04,560
They're going to never stop.

1078
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:13,140
Well, how many times do we have to play this same song over and over and over again?

1079
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,100
I'm going to die.

1080
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:22,620
Well, Grta, Grta, Grta, oh, Grta, let me clean your toes with my mouth.

1081
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,960
Sonny, if you want it, here it is.

1082
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,460
Come and get it.

1083
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,140
But you better hurry.

1084
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,500
Because it's going fast.

1085
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,200
You better hurry.

1086
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,260
Because it's going fast.

1087
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:44,420
I told you that faulty autopilot module was going to give us some trouble sooner or later.

1088
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,540
You got the whole damn side of the show caved in.

1089
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,920
Oh, well, it's my cousin worked on it, see?

1090
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,320
That was the problem.

1091
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:56,660
I took it to my cousin instead of letting the Tibetans, the old experts, fix them.

1092
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:01,320
Well, you know, we got to dock with the show in eight minutes and 32 seconds, show number four,

1093
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,180
and look at that.

1094
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:07,320
And if we run out of tape before that, then we won't be docking with nothing.

1095
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,360
We'll be cast adrift in the airwaves.

1096
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:18,140
No, if you're not on tape, friend, on the airwaves, you just, you're ripe for piracy.

1097
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:18,860
Yes, indeed.

1098
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,080
Airwave piracy.

1099
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,740
They're bootlegging us right now.

1100
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,840
Everything we say right now is being sold.

1101
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,700
Sold somewhere.

1102
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,420
Somewhere.

1103
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:30,480
Being sucked out of the heavens, out of our orbital transmitter by some big old pirate

1104
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:30,920
ground.

1105
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,920
Of some big old British bootleggers.

1106
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,500
Stinking bootleggers.

1107
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,800
But they're gonna find out you can't bootleg Bob for too long.

1108
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,660
You gotta pay your dues to Bob and the Foundation for Salvation, friends.

1109
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,640
Any old Bob show, you just pirate and start sending around.

1110
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:51,000
People are gonna start falling down and not remembering what they listened to and foaming

1111
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,680
at the mouth and having strange hallucinations.

1112
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:54,020
Yeah.

1113
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,740
All kinds of excess buzzin' around their rooms.

1114
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,220
Confusing.

1115
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,460
Tap on their telephones.

1116
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,260
Beating on their walls.

1117
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:00,780
It can be difficult.

1118
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,780
making their TV sets not work right,

1119
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,220
and they're saying,

1120
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:03,860
why me?

1121
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:04,780
What did I do?

1122
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,740
Yeah, you didn't pay your dues.

1123
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,040
That's very, very interesting.

1124
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,480
Very interesting.

1125
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,380
That's not interesting at all.

1126
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,140
I mean, that's why you may be wondering,

1127
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:18,260
just why do I have to keep listening to this show?

1128
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,980
Why do I even care what the answer could be?

1129
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,640
Take your earphones off.

1130
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,180
That's what I did.

1131
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,040
You don't have to listen to me.

1132
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:24,760
Deep down inside,

1133
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,800
deep down inside, friends,

1134
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,200
you know that this is

1135
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,840
the truth.

1136
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,360
The ultimate truth.

1137
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,220
Amen.

1138
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,860
Now the announcer will give our mailing address.

1139
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,500
That's the church of the subgenius.

1140
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,180
Write for information to P.O. Box.

1141
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:54,180
807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.
