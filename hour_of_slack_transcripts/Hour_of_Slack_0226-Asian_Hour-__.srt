1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Uh, you are listening, once again, to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

2
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,420
And it is slack.

3
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:42,860
And it's funny about, actually, it's sort of ironic that our show is preceded by the Asian hour.

4
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,980
Because when I live...

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:55,300
When I left work, see, I left the door with a Japanese-American, a Vietnamese-American, a Hong Kong investor.

6
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,420
And we...

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,260
And the Caucasians were still working, except for me.

8
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,280
But shoot, friends, I mean, this is a subgenius show.

9
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,480
What am I fooling around with all these stupid comments for?

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,020
I'll tell you, it's been a tough week.

11
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,300
It really has.

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,420
Back at work again.

13
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:27,400
For those subgenius subscribers listening, we still haven't mailed the stark fist out yet.

14
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,740
But, by God, by Wednesday, man.

15
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,300
By Wednesday, it's going to be in there.

16
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,380
As for videos going to those who called and pledged $60.

17
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,940
Why, in about 30 seconds here, I'll have the list of who actually paid the $60.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,880
Ranger Rita has been keeping track.

19
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,600
Know thy enemy, friends.

20
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,440
What I want to play here is...

21
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,420
Actually, this is an old rant by Father Papa Joe Mama.

22
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,700
The subgenius preacher in Stanford, California.

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,800
Although, I think he's really from Alabama.

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,540
Alabama.

25
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:13,540


26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,300
Here we go.

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,920
Hello, friend.

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,940
Tonight's sermon is entitled,

29
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,280
Us versus Them.

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,680
Also known as,

31
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,280
Know thy enemy.

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,080
Now, we all know who us is.

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,200
But how many of us really know who them are?

34
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,100
The black book sayeth,

35
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,120
If you're not us, then you are them.

36
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,420
And therefore, against us.

37
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,660
Wade into them.

38
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,460
Shoot them in the belly.

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,000
Spill their blood.

40
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,840
When you stick your hand in a pile of shit.

41
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,220
That a moment before was your best friend's brain.

42
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,720
You'll know who them is.

43
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,220
For those of us less fortunate, however.

44
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,460
Allow me to define.

45
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,780
What do I mean by them?

46
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,100
I mean.

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,960
Do I mean the thems that coins, the phrases, that paces?

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,620
You know, they say that Jews are cheap.

49
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,900
Uh, they quip, if you're white, you're right.

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,180
If you're black, you're back.

51
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,080
They claim subgenie have big peeny.

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,120
Is that the they that them is?

53
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,880
The nameless, faceless, mindless trash.

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,260
There's nothing better to do all day than go around and make up all the lies.

55
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,980
Is that the them that they is?

56
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,620
No, friends.

57
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,560
We don't make them the liars.

58
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,680
That fabricate truths.

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,480
All except the one about subgenies.

60
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,060
No, them's not the they that them is.

61
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,660
Let me be more precise.

62
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,360
Shall I?

63
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,620
How about the liberals?

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,000
The lamby, pamby, liberals.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,600
The ones that just love and accept everyone and everything.

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,740
Except Ronald Reagan, Incorporated.

67
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,480
Oh, I just hate Ronald Reagan.

68
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,900
I can't stand George Bush.

69
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,260
I'm scared of President Quayle.

70
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,460
And let's not forget their bumper sticker battle cry.

71
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,300
Nuclear wars have no winners.

72
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,700
So bad.

73
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,120
So bad.

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,700
So bad.

75
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,160
So bad.

76
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,940
Nuclear wars aren't supposed to have any winners, friends.

77
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,020
It's designed to be inhumane.

78
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,780
It's built to blow up the world 90 times over.

79
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,280
Don't ask who's gonna launch the match the first time the world's destroyed.

80
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,160
There's not supposed to be any survivors.

81
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,220
None.

82
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,960
Zero.

83
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,980
And that's the whole point.

84
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,220
That's why they call it mad mutually assured destruction, friends.

85
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,520
Those liberals, they're just so quick, aren't they?

86
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,580
It took them 40 years to figure it out.

87
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,180
But miracle of miracles, they understand it now.

88
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,780
If there's a nuclear war, we're all gonna die.

89
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:28,080
And maybe, just maybe, that's why it is now and ever shall be world without an amen.

90
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:37,340
And that's also why, friends, we love Bob and we hate liberals.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,080
But the question still remains, are they the them responsible for the conspiracy?

92
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,900
No, friends.

93
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,400
Them's not the them that they is.

94
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,480
So who does that leave, friends?

95
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,860
Who do you think?

96
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,160
Our good old friends, the conservatives.

97
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
The right stuff.

98
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,680
Them's that gets down to the trickle down.

99
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,500
The conservatives.

100
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,860
The ones who believe in the sanctity of human life.

101
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,520
Oh, I just cried when Ronald Reagan got his legs cut off at King's Row.

102
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,460
Or, oh, that poor little Pekingite.

103
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,700
He needs to be taught some wholesome values.

104
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,880
He needs to learn to appreciate this great country of ours that rescued him from the dark African jungle,

105
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,900
offered him eternal salvation through Christ,

106
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,240
and tore itself in twain to abolish that hideous evil, slavery.

107
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,360
And yes, even sacrificed its first Republican president.

108
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,020
What's that?

109
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,980
He's accused of murder?

110
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,080
Toast him right until his eyeballs pop out!

111
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,380
But unborn children, friends, oh, they're innocent, aren't they?

112
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,860
Their only crime is that their mother is a virgin.

113
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,080
Their mother was promiscuous.

114
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,820
Why then should they get the death penalty?

115
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,840
Fetuses have rights too.

116
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,960
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!

117
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,720
Abortion isn't cold blood and murder, friends.

118
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
It's warm blood and murder.

119
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,060
And that's why we, the subgenies, love abortions.

120
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,140
We drink them by the gallons.

121
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,100
We eat them by the bushelful.

122
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,700
They're great with just a pinch of saline solution on top.

123
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,240
Hey, but friends, we don't like abortions for taste only.

124
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,020
We like them as an investment.

125
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,780
Every dollar spent on abortion saves hundreds, if not thousands, of welfare and prison dollars.

126
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,400
And that'll buy you a hell of a lot of slack, friends.

127
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,700
Until the subgenie can abolish taxes altogether,

128
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,660
and that day is just on the horizon, friends,

129
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,260
abortion remains the closest thing we have to a tax rebate.

130
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,180
It is the communion wine to which we toast.

131
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,860
J.R. Bob Dobbs, the man who fathered more illegitimate abortions

132
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,160
than any other traveling salesman, bottoms up, Bob.

133
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:23,080
We love abortions, and we hate conservative!

134
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,880
But the question still remains, friends,

135
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,420
are them the them that's running the conspiracy?

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,320
Hell no!

137
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,320
It's too big!

138
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,220
The conspiracy is everywhere!

139
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,100
The conspiracy is everyone!

140
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,260
All of the above!

141
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
We hate them all!

142
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,400
And when the revolution comes, friends,

143
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,260
everyone is gonna be the first up against the wall!

144
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,940
Praise Bob!

145
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,580
Amen.

146
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,640
Yeah!

147
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,600
Amen, Papa Joe Mama!

148
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,700
And I'd like to papa this microphone with a few pays!

149
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,780
I love to do that.

150
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:14,400
Well, it's a good thing I've got some tape here to keep you all entertained,

151
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,680
because, boy, in personal reality-type life, I'm so overworked.

152
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,920
I don't feel like doing my hobby.

153
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,520
Do you ever feel that way, friends,

154
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:32,380
when the real world, the paying job, leans on you so heavy?

155
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,240
You work those nights.

156
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,840
You know, until midnight, you drive home, and you just go to sleep.

157
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,740
You get up the next morning, drive to work.

158
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,400
All home is is a place to crash for a very short time.

159
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,000
That's the way I'm feeling right now.

160
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,560
So I'm gonna...

161
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,260
I think I'd best get off the mic.

162
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,360
That was Papa Joe Mama, you just heard.

163
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,900
And what we've got coming up...

164
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,520
Well, sure, why not?

165
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,340
Criswell Predicts.

166
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,060
Friends, this is from an album.

167
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,920
Taken from a radio show from the late 60s.

168
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,320
Criswell, the star of Plan 9,

169
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,980
or at least the narrator of Plan 9 from Outer Space.

170
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,600
He was actually a radio personality back in L.A.

171
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,020
I think he was pretty much local.

172
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,820
But he's gotten famous because he was so accurate.

173
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,760
His predictions were just amazingly accurate.

174
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,740
And Reverend Joe Riley here in Dallas sent this one in, and he says...

175
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,140
Enjoy and praise Bob.

176
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,580
Ah, greetings, my friend.

177
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,740
We are all interested in the future,

178
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,600
for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives,

179
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,400
whether we want to or not.

180
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,060
And remember, my friend, these future events will affect you.

181
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,000
The future is in your hands.

182
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,760
So let us remember the past, honor the present,

183
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,460
and be amused at the future.

184
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,260
I predict that politics will make stranger bedfellows than ever before.

185
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,000
I fearlessly predict that the once politically inactive South

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,720
will rise again in no uncertain terms.

187
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,740
I predict that every vote south of the Mason-Dixon line

188
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,220
could easily be conservative.

189
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,260
I predict there will be two political parties in America.

190
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,380
One will be the conservative party and the other will be the liberal party.

191
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,180
There will be a clean-cut division which no one could conscientiously cross over.

192
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,140
This startling trend will become most apparent before the next election,

193
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,280
and you will join heartily in this stand whether you want to or not.

194
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,580
Now don't say you won't, because I predict you will.

195
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:01,280
I predict fashions for both men and women will be exactly alike in the new unisex trend.

196
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,960
The new tunics which will soon be worn have no difference except in size.

197
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,720
Men are growing smaller in stature, and the women are growing larger in stature,

198
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,800
and there will only be three sizes, large, medium, and small,

199
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,020
to the new tunic you will soon wear.

200
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,860
I predict there will be body stockings for those who would feel shy or modest.

201
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,460
Those who wish to wear nothing naturally

202
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,940
will be free to do so.

203
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,980
I predict the day of severity in dress will soon be at hand,

204
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,840
almost puritanical in style, with no beads, no jangles, no bracelets.

205
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,120
Men and women will wear exactly the same makeup,

206
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,880
the same style of hair dress, and if required, the same type of wig.

207
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,720
I was not allowed to say on television, radio, or have it appear in my column

208
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,860
as the advertisers would clomp down on me,

209
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,440
and clomp very heavily.

210
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,320
I further predict the new age of nudity,

211
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,740
for the human body will be glorified.

212
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,040
Body designs, self-painted, will take up most of your spare time.

213
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,700
Women will decorate their breasts with startling colors,

214
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,180
while men will decorate their genitals.

215
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,980
Those who are politically ornated will always print body slogans on themselves,

216
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,280
and this will take place of the present day bumper stickers.

217
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,680
Subdued colors will be used in the cloth,

218
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,960
but riotous colors will be painted on your body.

219
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,000
I predict that the entertainment personalities of the future

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,180
will be entertainment personalities and nothing else.

221
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,680
When someone pays admission to hear a singer or a comedian,

222
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,720
they will not tolerate protest messages.

223
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,380
They will demand and receive 100% entertainment,

224
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,160
as this is the only thing that television or the radio

225
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,720
sponsor will tolerate.

226
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,040
Too many items are now off the shelves due to a subconscious boycott

227
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,560
of that item by the viewer who rejected the program

228
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,260
on which this item was advertised.

229
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,360
I predict entertainment will be entertainment,

230
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,040
and entertainment alone.

231
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,880
I predict that in our tomorrow,

232
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,180
the little women will reign supreme.

233
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,380
I predict that it will be impossible for a man

234
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,620
to divorce a woman, for she must divorce him.

235
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
I pre...

236
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:44,160
I predict that this record player will start on time this time.

237
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,880
Ah, ha ha!

238
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,940
Praise Bobby!

239
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,060
He Deeing

240
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,380
this record player,

241
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,080
它的

242
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,580
teles Tae

243
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,360
Haines

244
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,360


245
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,980
Oh, God!

246
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,560
Whoa!

247
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,100
We'll never rescue them now!

248
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:11,760
We'll never rescue them now!

249
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,140
We want more!

250
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,940
We want more!

251
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,480
We want more!

252
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,220
We want more!

253
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,820
I'm still in one piece.

254
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,020
I think.

255
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,020
I can't imagine why.

256
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,460
Our descent in what I take to be the volcano of Mount Etna

257
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,560
should have been slowed by a rising cushion of warm air.

258
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,760
Damn thing.

259
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,640
Go out!

260
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,080
Oh, no!

261
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,200
Not more giants!

262
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,100
Can I help you, tiny mortal?

263
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,520
I sincerely hope so.

264
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,280
I'm Baron Munchausen.

265
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,700
You may have heard of me.

266
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,600
My friends and I are looking for three men.

267
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,640
One with exceptional eyesight,

268
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,880
one with superb hearing and powerful lungs,

269
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,340
and one who's exceptional.

270
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,020
And one who's extremely large and strong.

271
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,720
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

272
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,880
Oh, we're all extremely large and strong here.

273
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

274
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,400
I am Vulcan, the god.

275
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,360
And these are my giant employees.

276
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,000
Cyclops.

277
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,780
Who even now are going back to Earth!

278
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,580
I'm willing to supply arms and equipment

279
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,160
to anyone that's prepared to pay the price.

280
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Greeks, Trojans, Romans, Huns.

281
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,900
It's not my fault if they're crazy enough to slaughter each other, is it?

282
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,440
Ah!

283
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,820
You monkey crew!

284
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,000
Your ghost laws don't impress me!

285
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,720
I'm God!

286
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,940
I've got all the time in the universe!

287
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,580
Hear that?

288
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,260
All the time, me!

289
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,280
You know, in the old days, the staff used to get paid

290
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,940
on the dot every thousand years.

291
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,300
This not expect from every century.

292
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,840
Ah, this power radius!

293
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,700
What's this?

294
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,740
Oh, this is our prototype.

295
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,280
RX, uh, Intercontinental.

296
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,800
Oh, this is the...

297
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:56,800


298
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,660
Radar-stakey, multi-war-headed nuclear missile.

299
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,800
Ah!

300
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,620
What does it do?

301
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,620
Do?

302
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,900
Kills the enemy.

303
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,860
All the enemy?

304
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,460
Aye, all of them.

305
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,580
All their wives and all their children and all their sheep

306
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,140
and all their cattle and all their cats and dogs.

307
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,560
All of them.

308
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,640
All of them.

309
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,680
Got them for good.

310
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,660
That's horrible!

311
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,100
Ah.

312
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:33,560
Well, you see, the advantage is you don't have to see

313
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,320
one single one of them die.

314
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,440
You just sit comfortably thousands of miles away

315
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,860
from the battlefield and simply press the button.

316
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Well, where's the funny net?

317
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,640
Oh, we cater for the best of the best.

318
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:53,640


319
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,780
For all Thor's here, you'll be surprised.

320
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,820
Would you care for a little fodder, perhaps?

321
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,560
Yes, uh, let's have a little fodder, I think.

322
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,760
Ha ha ha ha.

323
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,540
Uh, uh, well, yeah, actually, you can have some more fodder.

324
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,980
If you want to call up and pester Will,

325
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,800
even more than he's already being pestered

326
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,280
by the inane callers we're getting right now,

327
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,740
uh, call 823-7490.

328
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,440
And, uh, pester Will with more inane questions

329
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,120
to which he will give you insane answers and, uh, what...

330
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,840
Hey, what...

331
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,040
No!

332
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,720
Oh, thank you, Dr. Drummond.

333
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,200
I was tired of talking, so I'm glad Dr. Drummond and...

334
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,180
And you can tell us, too, about your new radio show.

335
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:43,580
Huh?

336
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,720
Oh, yeah, we have...

337
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,420
We had a radio show.

338
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,660
An ex-radio show.

339
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,260
We were on the world's pinkest subgenius radio show.

340
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,960
We were on the world's most popular subgenius radio show for a while,

341
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,400
and it got to be to the point where most of the members of the band

342
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,040
couldn't tolerate it any longer.

343
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,420
It's, uh...

344
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,880
And, uh, that was run by the Chuck and Debbie formerly mentioned here.

345
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,140
But, uh, we've decided that we'll start a counterattack

346
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,800
of authorized subgenius radio show.

347
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,100
And, uh, I doubt if we'll get the chance to be put on opposite them,

348
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,080
but at some point in time during the week,

349
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,320
we're gonna have a counter...

350
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,680
A counter-Chuck and Debbie show.

351
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,520
Good, good.

352
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,120
On KDHX.

353
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,820
We can't wait to hear the KDHX FM version of the counter-Chuck and Debbie show.

354
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,620
The only Dobbs-approved show on KDHX.

355
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,260
You know, of all the subgenius radio shows on KDHX,

356
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,380
this will be the only one that is actually Dobbs-approved.

357
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,880
Sort of like the situation here.

358
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:43,840
Yeah.

359
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,920
Just that pink river.

360
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,940
And now we're entering the pink zone.

361
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,060
I hear a stupid voice.

362
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,200
That's very stupid.

363
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Hi, Uncle Farmer.

364
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:51,860
Hi.

365
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,640
How are you?

366
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,600
Not much, Martin.

367
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,440
Just be grooving on the radio, that's all.

368
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,620
You're getting ready for stupid day.

369
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Do you have an accordion?

370
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,820
Do I have a recorded one?

371
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,360
No, an accordion.

372
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,560
An accordion?

373
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:08,920
Yeah.

374
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,760
No, I don't.

375
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,460
I wish I did.

376
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,280
We're gonna have the world's largest mounting accordion band on April.

377
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,820
It's gonna be stupid today.

378
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,820
That's what I heard.

379
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,420
Yeah.

380
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,420
And, uh, we're gonna have a bunch of people.

381
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:18,660


382
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:18,660


383
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:18,660


384
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:18,660


385
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:18,660


386
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,340
And, uh, so, do you always gotta come out, you know?

387
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,800
Christina, she probably doesn't wanna play the accordion, right?

388
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
You gave her an accordion license, right?

389
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,040
Well, I've got the, like, Gestalt accordion that I've played for a long time.

390
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,160
Oh, well, you should bring it out.

391
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,280
We can have one of the tenor accordions.

392
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,620
I carry it with me.

393
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,660
The Gestalt accordion?

394
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,020
Mm-hmm.

395
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,460
Gestalt.

396
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,480
The Gestalt accordion.

397
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,340
I carry it with me always.

398
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:36,980
Mm-hmm.

399
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,780
Kind of the same thing, right?

400
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,720
I've never, never been seen without my accordion.

401
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:41,740
Wow.

402
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,640
I saw him in the shower once, and it's true.

403
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,960
He had that accordion with him.

404
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,640
He had the accordion in front of him to conceal his repulsive nature.

405
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:48,640


406
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:48,840
You know, he could have.

407
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,080
You know, and it gets wet, and the reeds start sticking, and...

408
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,460
Oh, so that's what you call it, is it?

409
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,020
Yes.

410
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:04,000
I want to apologize to our sensitive listeners for the degrading turn this, uh, line of conversation

411
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,920
has taken.

412
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,400
Is there a Nelsonoid on there?

413
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:06,800
Yeah.

414
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,080
Yeah.

415
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,880
Don't you hear him?

416
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,600
I thought that voice sounded familiar.

417
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,720
Yeah, that's very mutual, Mr. C.

418
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,500
Yeah.

419
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,080
He just got in from the desert minutes before the show started, and...

420
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,280
He emerged from the desert.

421
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:18,620
And now, it's...

422
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:18,620


423
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:18,620


424
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:18,620


425
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:18,620


426
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:18,620


427
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:18,620


428
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:18,620


429
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,520
Well, actually, Bishop Joey got in from the desert hours before the show started.

430
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,240
He's been extracting the barrel from the bones of the dead.

431
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,580
Everybody has been in the desert from the bones of the dead.

432
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,240
This is like old homeboy week out there, isn't it?

433
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:28,820
Yeah.

434
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,140
Ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding.

435
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,480
Well, you gonna have, uh, cheese blanches, or egg, or omelet?

436
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,140
Actually, our cook has gone south for this weekend alone, so we're gonna go hungry.

437
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,820
So we're gonna have microwave pizza for our subgenius breakfast.

438
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,380
And beer.

439
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,760
I brought some roadkill.

440
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,300
Yeah.

441
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,320
Smith Eggies, yeah.

442
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,640
Smith Eggies, yeah.

443
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,460
Here's a turtle that's been in the sun only about four days.

444
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:48,600
Yeah.

445
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:48,600


446
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:48,600


447
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,040
Wasn't the Smith Eggie dream great?

448
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,220
Oh, it was excellent.

449
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:51,680
Yeah.

450
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,420
I dream that same dream every day.

451
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,120
Oh, yeah?

452
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,720
For six years.

453
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,640
I count three.

454
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,460
I thought I was the only one like that.

455
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,640
Are you trying to tell me that this wonderful menu, we're not gonna eat all these things

456
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,000
tonight?

457
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,520
Yeah, that's right.

458
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,400
This morning, you mean?

459
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
No, I'm afraid not.

460
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,760
We'll just have to look at the food this time.

461
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:05,880
Oh, no.

462
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,560
You read the menu.

463
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,260
You read the item on the menu, and then take a bite and think about it.

464
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,860
All right.

465
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,020
Take a bite at the menu.

466
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,420
Roadkill Turtle Blintz Banquet.

467
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,480
Now, bite the menu.

468
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,280
This is a box turtle.

469
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,960
It's been on the road for four days.

470
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:25,140
It's been scooped up and lightly fried, then fricasseed in a pan of chowder and dusted with

471
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,820
talcum powder for that Denver Mile High sandwich tingly tangy taste.

472
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,140
Mmm, yum.

473
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,020
Topped off with Sailcast Azure.

474
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,580
Yeah.

475
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,300
Sailcast?

476
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,600
Kind of.

477
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,940
Soaked in an old rainwater-filled hollow stump for three weeks, and then sautéed lightly.

478
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,500
Hey, that's my stump.

479
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,880
And double amputee fricasseed.

480
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,180
That was a joke?

481
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,700
Oh, sorry.

482
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,360
My stump?

483
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:47,780
My stump.

484
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:47,940
My stump.

485
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:47,940


486
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,560
So stump on down to...

487
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,400
Get off my stump.

488
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,460
Get off, man.

489
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,040
Hey, man.

490
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,380
The stump speech made by Senator Stoop is not responsible for the actions of the subgeniuses.

491
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,540
Well, the speed of the...

492
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,380
Sorry?

493
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,060
...their wives...

494
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,760
After the show, it's all over, brother.

495
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,720
...their wives...

496
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:04,780
Yeah, it's over.

497
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,480
...their wives...

498
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:05,480


499
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:05,480


500
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,020
...management and staff of KTOA, 94-1...

501
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,120
Yeah.

502
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,480
...and then we'll Rotan.

503
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,800
Yeah, we'll Rotan for about nine hours.

504
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,600
Yeah.

505
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,800
And then we'll start playing our instruments after we Rotan.

506
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,860
And then we'll super-frop.

507
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,660
Yeah.

508
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:17,800
Really?

509
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:17,940
Yeah.

510
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:17,940


511
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:17,940


512
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,260
We'll smoke the ultimate frop.

513
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,200
Yeah, yeah.

514
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,240
That's the stump.

515
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,600
The one that has the wires that hang off of it.

516
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:24,900
The one that has the wires that hang off of it.

517
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:24,900


518
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,020
You know?

519
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,420
If you can't get the can, it has those little wires that hang off of it.

520
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,380
But what is frop anyway?

521
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,480
You can see the dreams in the resin.

522
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:41,800
Frop is a synthetic mutoid vegetable, Tibetan matter that only, you know, you can only see

523
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,600
with your eyes closed.

524
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:42,620
Yes.

525
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,940
The legendary habafrop zipulops, grown on the droppings of Tibetan holy men and the

526
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:47,940


527
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:47,940


528
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:47,940


529
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:47,940


530
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:47,940


531
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:47,940


532
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,560
rabbit yetis and the high passes of the...

533
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,580
But there's a new ship that we have, guys.

534
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,060
There's a new...

535
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,080
Look for Clore.

536
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,080


537
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,100
You know, we've had trouble getting past the DEA because they keep taking it to some kind

538
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,560
of illegal drug.

539
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,000
Well, you know, there is an all-inclusive law which it declares drugs that haven't even

540
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,060
been discovered illegal.

541
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,980
Yeah, that's our favorite kind of legalization.

542
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,180
This one's been discovered.

543
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,500
It's just, you know, the permits are so buried deep, so deep into the books that it takes

544
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,920
years just to be able to...

545
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:17,920


546
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:17,920


547
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:17,920


548
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:17,920


549
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:24,920
Yes, extensive legalistic scholarship is necessary to exhume the Frop Law of International

550
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,020
Jurisprudence.

551
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,560
Hey, did you hear that?

552
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,060
For a second there, there was a second of silence.

553
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,560
Yeah, yeah, just before the rocket took off.

554
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,980
That second of silence is just where the nut falls into the giant booster and the thing

555
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,980
blows up, you know, and then you start the second side.

556
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,620
That's where the O-ring blew out.

557
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,000
Right, that's this moment of silence.

558
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,620
It's pure, it's clean, it's all there is.

559
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,500
Cool.

560
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,020
It's a kind of violence.

561
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,240
And you think to yourself, maybe I should have, and then the rest of the tape goes.

562
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,440
Boy, look at those colors.

563
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,880
They're cooking up a storm on the color board over there.

564
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,840
Did you cook up Paul there today at our...

565
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,780
He's cooking in his own juices these days.

566
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,380
Yeah, stewing, as it were.

567
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,560
The tax rebel is being taxed beyond his dreams...

568
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,440
No, who are you talking about?

569
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,280
I just, I don't know who you're talking about.

570
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,480
Oh, well, I can't, I have to, I have to cut in there because, you know, the case is, you

571
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:27,840
know, the KPFA fellows, Paul, I mean, no, not the totem Paul, but Doug and Hal and Gary

572
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,440
and their guest Philo, were about to gossip and I wouldn't want to do a thing like that.

573
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,480
In fact, actually, what I want to do is go to the bathroom, but instead...

574
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,920
I predict that both a religious and a civil ceremony will be required of all marriages.

575
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,460
I predict in the future it will be a religious ceremony.

576
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,140
I predict that it will be very possible for a woman to sell her husband to another woman,

577
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,260
both legally and morally.

578
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,940
I predict man will truly be the slave of woman.

579
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,580
You women now control 93% of the wealth and spend 87 cents out of every dollar.

580
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,920
So what are we poor men to do?

581
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,180
Personally, I welcome it because we men have made such a mess of things.

582
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,560
You women must naturally come to our rescue and do better.

583
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:26,760
I predict that you will not be able to turn this record off as they turned me off on the Johnny Carson program with my following prediction.

584
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:33,120
I predict every able-bodied man in America will be asked to contribute to a sperm bank.

585
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:39,980
This will later be used in artificial insemination if and when a holocaust should occur.

586
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,940
This sperm bank will be open 24 hours a day.

587
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,440
And a night depository would be a good place to be.

588
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,820
This for the eventuality that the male of the species might become extinct.

589
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,460
Oh, he thought I couldn't turn him off and see I went and did it just like Johnny Carson.

590
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,300
A personal discovery of this program for San Francisco.

591
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,660
The first time anywhere in San Francisco radio live from New York.

592
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,560
The music of Black Shabbos Live.

593
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,420
Thank you very much.

594
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,100
We're healing.

595
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,560
Well?

596
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,520
So what's new?

597
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,400
Nothing, what's with you?

598
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,640
Eh, can't complain.

599
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,600
Well the name is Black Shabbos and we came to play.

600
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,120
We're three Yiddish rappers and we came to sing.

601
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,760
Sit back and relax and have a tequila.

602
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,260
Have a nice day and have an a-gila.

603
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,340
We're Blind Baba.

604
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:53,820
Adi.

605
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,600
And Shlomo E.

606
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,320
And we're the freshest high city you ever did see.

607
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,800
We're full of charm, we got lots of charisma.

608
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,060
At thirteen years of age, we had a bomb.

609
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,060
It's a Wrap It Up!

610
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,540
Wrap It Up!

611
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,080
Wrap It Up!

612
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,540
Wrap It Up!

613
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,740
Look out all you rappers.

614
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,940
We're coming into town.

615
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,360
But we have to stop jamming.

616
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,420
Before sunday!

617
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,040
We may be Orthodox, but we still like to boogie.

618
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,300
A rabbi thinks that we're a little mashugi.

619
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,980
Our parents wanted us to be lawyers and doctors,

620
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,540
but we grew up to be three Yiddish rappers.

621
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,900
We're hard, we're mean, we know what's going down.

622
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,500
We grew up on the street in Levittown.

623
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,260
Wrap it up.

624
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,660
Wrap it up.

625
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,260
Wrap it up.

626
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,680
Wrap it up.

627
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,180
There's a poison going round, got our religion in a jam.

628
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,520
It's worse than crack, and its name is ham.

629
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,500
So don't eat it.

630
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,200
Puy.

631
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,920
Don't eat it.

632
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,020
Fah.

633
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,360
Listen, all you brothers snorting cocaine through your straws,

634
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,700
you ought to pay attention to your dietary laws.

635
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,240
Some people think they're kosher, but we know that they're bacon

636
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,680
because the B in BLT, it stands for bacon.

637
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,560
Don't eat it.

638
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,460
Fah.

639
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,060
Don't eat it.

640
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,080
Puy.

641
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,680
Fah.

642
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,420
You talk to my girl about sex, she winces

643
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,800
because she's a Jewish-American princess.

644
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,160
You mention working, she whines and whines.

645
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,980
Because she wants to spend her life in Bloomingdale's.

646
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,360
At the hour of noon, she starts to wake up.

647
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,720
She'd lose ten pounds if she removed her makeup.

648
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,540
She wears lots of gold, that's no tomfoolery.

649
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,640
Why do you think they call it jewelry?

650
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,420
Wrap it up.

651
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,020
Wrap it up.

652
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,660
Wrap it up.

653
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,000
Wrap it up.

654
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,940
It's all right for now, all the funky parts.

655
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,480
Wrap it up.

656
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,440
I love the funk.

657
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:44,860
The funk.

658
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,680
Wrap it up.

659
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,660
Wrap it up.

660
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,100
That's Energie.

661
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,540
That's Painey to Heaven.

662
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,860
Number nine, number nine, number nine.

663
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,980
Step up number ten, your neck.

664
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,060
Step up to number ten, I'd like a chicken, please.

665
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,500
Lean and wrap it up.

666
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,960
Sure, I'll wrap that up for you.

667
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,880
Come up right away.

668
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,440
Well, we're so cool.

669
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,060
Almost frozen, we have to be, cause we're the chosen.

670
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:23,020
Now what y'all see is what you get, but this here rap ain't over yet.

671
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,680
Get down, get funky, shake your body to the beat.

672
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,180
But before you do, have something to eat.

673
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,760
If you got any room left, you can have a caniche.

674
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,960
Maybe a little later, some gefilte fish.

675
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,540
We are better than Houdini or Melly Mel.

676
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,180
With a hippity hop, you can hear us quell.

677
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,700
Watch out, fat boys, better run, DMC.

678
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,020
Now here we go, a one, two, three, wrap it up.

679
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wrap it up.

680
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,040
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh, oh, wrap it up.

681
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,640
She's such a yenta, she's such a yenta, wrap it up.

682
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,580
Wrap it up, wrap it up.

683
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,900
Nasty, nasty boys.

684
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,140
Who's that eating that mayonnaise?

685
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,920
I said nasty, nasty boys.

686
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,140
Who's that missing on holidays?

687
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:13,860
I said.

688
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,100
Nasty, nasty gauze.

689
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,740
So wrap it up.

690
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

691
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,220
Wrap it up.

692
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,680
Deal, deal.

693
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,720
Wrap it up.

694
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,900
Wrap it up.

695
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,220
Wrap it up.

696
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:23,280
Oh, man.

697
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,980
Wrap it up.

698
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,160
Wrap it up.

699
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:24,420
Yeah.

700
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:24,860
Oh, boy.

701
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,580
Happy Alex Bennett Show.

702
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,080
Thank you.

703
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,800
I loved Alex.

704
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,800
You're spinning like crazy there.

705
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,320
Oh, he's breaking.

706
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,240
Oh, he's breaking.

707
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,960
He's break dancing.

708
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,440
Look at that.

709
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,800
He's a great dancer, that Alex.

710
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,660
Oh, look at him go.

711
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:35,820
Oh.

712
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,280
Oh.

713
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,720
He's out of his studio.

714
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,260
That's crazy.

715
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,620
Put the headphones back on.

716
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,120
Oh, well, dear friends, thanks to Pat DiGiacomo for sending that one our way.

717
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,660
Yeah.

718
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,000
I've got this tape here I just got this week.

719
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,020
It's actually pretty old.

720
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,620
It's from Pope Jimbo in Cleveland.

721
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,440
Pope Jimbo, a die hard, mighty, mighty subgenius.

722
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,000
Well, well, well.

723
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:21,400
Well deserving the title of Pope who, well, actually, most of the tape is a copy of a

724
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,800
talk show on which I was the guest by phone.

725
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:33,600
It's a Cleveland talk show, AM drive time talk show, pretty much like OKLIF here in

726
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:33,920
Dallas.

727
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:40,540
It's sort of a Kevin McCarthy type of, you know, sort of liberal, sort of funny kind

728
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,900
of fellow, you know.

729
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,800
According to his, depending on the guest actually.

730
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,560
And, OK, I did this interview with him, which I may or may not play some of tonight.

731
00:34:53,880 --> 00:35:01,480
But what's interesting is how Pope Jimbo got the guy to call us up and invite us on

732
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,000
his show.

733
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:09,720
You know, we don't send mailers out to every station in the country in order to spread

734
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,440
the word of Bob.

735
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:18,520
We have to let them sort of come to us and we have to rely upon the believers out there,

736
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,640
the true believers to do some of the footwork.

737
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,580
Well, Pope Jimbo's footwork was highly creative.

738
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,780
And what he did essentially, and you're about to hear this, every day he would call up this

739
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,480
talk show.

740
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,600
And he started out just mentioning Bob.

741
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:38,600


742
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,880
He was just saying the church of the subgenius and saying a little bit about it.

743
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,720
And he realized that wasn't getting him anywhere.

744
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:53,700
So he began to call up the show just once a day, never more than once in one day, and

745
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:58,420
always with a different accent, doing a different dialect.

746
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,920
And he would ask the host about the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, to which the host,

747
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,280
of course, would go, what?

748
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,200
Well, that guy.

749
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,480


750
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,060
And make these little snide comments.

751
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:19,780
Well, the guy kept doing it in a tasteful and such a creative way that the host never

752
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,680
knew that it was the same person.

753
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:27,500
He finally just said, well, I've got to figure out what this is all about and ended up finally

754
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,560
getting us on the air.

755
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:34,840
But here are the tapes of Pope Jimbo calling the Bob Fuller Show, generally the Bob Fuller

756
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,100
Show.

757
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,640
They're in Cleveland, Ohio.

758
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:45,240
And being mysterious in such a way that although he angered the host a couple of times, in

759
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:52,720
general, he made it too good of a question to pass up.

760
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,760
Praise Bob.

761
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,540
Bob, the pink boy, the normal.

762
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,820
Enemies of Bob.

763
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,600
This is a new mini-series, isn't it?

764
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,060
How's that?

765
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,840
On Fox?

766
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,600
The enemies.

767
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,040
Explain to us this organization, sir.

768
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,460
The enemies of Bob.

769
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:06,620
The enemies of Bob.

770
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:06,620


771
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,460
No, no, I know.

772
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:12,480
Well, Bob is the head of the Church of the Subgenius, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

773
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,320
He's the guy with the pipe you see all over town.

774
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,340
And his enemies are the Nazi hell creatures from the Hollow Earth.

775
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,640
You would qualify to be a big finish.

776
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,320
You know that, sir.

777
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:22,780
Hallelujah.

778
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,240
Thank you for coming.

779
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:24,760
Once again.

780
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,780
They're coming from left field.

781
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,940
And we appreciate it.

782
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:28,980
Good night.

783
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,420
See, apparently he's off the medication, too.

784
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,340
I guess so.

785
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,440
Got the same problem as me.

786
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,920
Receptors just aren't receiving.

787
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,620
Greenhead.

788
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:36,620


789
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:36,620


790
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,700
The red hair turns orange.

791
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,880
Subgenius, praise Bob.

792
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,100
Oh, praise Bob.

793
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,540
Now, look it, Robert.

794
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,940
You know, you know that nobody can guarantee a window seat except Bob.

795
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,120
And that's on the X of spaceships.

796
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:49,600
That's right.

797
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:55,420
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m., when the signal from Amos and Andy reaches the Planet X.

798
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,160
You know that.

799
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,000
I do know that.

800
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,640
Hallelujah.

801
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:58,900
All right.

802
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,280
I also know that the Church of the Subgenius promises exactly what it delivers, which

803
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,900
is nothing.

804
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,600
Well, well, it does offer you, you know, a little bit of a chance to get a little bit

805
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:06,600


806
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:06,600


807
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,220
of eternal salvation or triple your money back.

808
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,540
No other church will do that.

809
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:10,940
That's right.

810
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,680
All right.

811
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,060
All right.

812
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,860
And nobody, and nobody has yet come forward to claim that guarantee.

813
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,900
No, nobody.

814
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,800
Hallelujah.

815
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:17,380
Hallelujah.

816
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:17,980
Praise Bob.

817
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,580
All right.

818
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,460
You interpret the scriptures.

819
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,460
And let's go to, uh, Charles.

820
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:22,980
Hi, Charles.

821
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,620
You're on 3WE.

822
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,020
Uh, hi, uh, Reverend Chalker.

823
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,100
Um, you know, uh, Jesus Christ is recognized by the Church of the Subgenius as being the

824
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,620
Son of God.

825
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,760
I just wonder if you folks, uh, recognize J.R.

826
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,580
Bob Dobbs as being the Son of God.

827
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:36,580


828
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,360
I think he's the living slack master, the avatar of slack.

829
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,760
Thank you.

830
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,980
Uh, you interpret that for me.

831
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:50,140
I, I think, um, I don't know.

832
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,360
There's this weird group that called, uh, I don't know.

833
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,400
It's, it's hard to explain.

834
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,700
Have you, have you seen these little guys around, around the city pasted up these little

835
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:05,840
paper pictures pasted up and they're, the Reverend Bob is this like a fifties type caricature

836
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,560
with a, with a, um, a pipe in his mouth.

837
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,600
Have you seen those?

838
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,640
No.

839
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,480
This is the Reverend Bob Dobbs, I guess.

840
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,720
And, uh, it's, uh, it's pretty weird.

841
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,540
Yeah, I guess so.

842
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,580
That guy, uh, hung on for such a long time.

843
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,100
Uh, we're taking your calls now.

844
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,000
Five, seven, eight, 1100 in Cleveland.

845
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:22,760
Uh, out here.

846
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,300
Yeah, he, he did something there that ran up the background noise.

847
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,880
I just cut him off.

848
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,160
Okay.

849
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,340
Okay.

850
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,420
Um, so that has caused a problem for us in the two days.

851
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:29,920
Good morning, David.

852
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:35,680
I'd just like to, uh, know if the lady is supporting the bleeding head of Arnold Paul.

853
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:35,980
Well, I don't know.

854
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,140
I just want to know if Arnold Palmer or if, uh, the Trevino seemed to be taking over,

855
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,020
uh, with the black people in the South Africa.

856
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:48,120
It seems like, uh, schism is, is becoming more popular in, in these, uh, third world

857
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,640
countries.

858
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,840
I don't understand that question at all.

859
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,180
He says, don't worry about it.

860
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,800
It's only good with Arnold Palmer, which I can't tie in at all.

861
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,720
Hello, Bob.

862
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,180
You're on three to.

863
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:02,560
However, as my chat with him in mid 1988 revealed, nonviolent is one thing and mentally healthy

864
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,400
is quite another.

865
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,580
He had been going on about the book of.

866
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,800
Isaiah chapter 53 when I realized what he was getting at.

867
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,700
Are you the Messiah?

868
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:18,260
Yes, this is who I am, sir. This is definitely who I am. This was made known to me in 1962.

869
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:25,700
There was an anointing without human hands of sacramental wine. I am the Moshiach ben

870
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:31,180
David HaMelech. I am the one who fulfills this. I am the one who reveals the power of

871
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,440
God and teaches mankind and brings a new world for mankind. This is my purpose.

872
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,440
Telephone on the radio.

873
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,260
Hello?

874
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,760
Yeah, I'd like to know, um, hello?

875
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,480
Yeah, go ahead.

876
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:48,020
Yeah, I'd just like to know about, um, you're talking about the football games there, and

877
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:52,340
I was wondering if you guys are getting any of what the sport called a head-launches.

878
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,620
Hello?

879
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,740
Yeah, the what?

880
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,700
The head-launches. The guy yesterday called about the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

881
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,160
Well, that's a head-launches.

882
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,160


883
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,320
Yeah, so do you understand?

884
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,680
No, I don't.

885
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:11,140
Okay. All right, Bob, are you still there? Bob August? Oh, I guess Bob left. All right.

886
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,720
Must have had another caller or something. Oh, we lost contact with Bob August, and then

887
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,260
we lost contact with our caller. So we're gonna regroup. Is there a full moon or something?

888
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,500
578-1100, toll free in Ohio, 1-800-325-5796.

889
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,420
Double your money...

890
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,580
I just want to, uh, comment on this, uh, the way people are knocking, uh, uh, Pete coming

891
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,280
back here.

892
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,640
and, you know, I heard him when I was up in New York

893
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,860
and, like, day after day, he really addressed the issues that counted.

894
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,980
Things like, you know, this Bob Dobbs, he would have him on the air,

895
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,540
this J.R. Bob Dobbs, he would discuss things, important things,

896
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,220
like this bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

897
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:54,140
and not just deal with the New York Jets or the New York Yankees or what have you.

898
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,180
He would deal with the real issues that matter in this world.

899
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,540
What is this bleeding head of Arnold Palmer?

900
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,720
Well, ask him.

901
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:05,320
His station up there in New York, he would be talking about it quite a bit.

902
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,240
It was something about, it was either the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer,

903
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,400
the launching of the head had to be accomplished once a year or something.

904
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,340
It was very serious.

905
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,300
And there was a schism with another group of Trevino-ists

906
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:23,720
who said the bleeding head of Lee Trevino, in essence, was the, you know,

907
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,180
I don't know, but I'm sure Pete Franklin could tell you more about it,

908
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,520
but it was just ridiculous.

909
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,380
It was really interesting talking to these people at the, yeah,

910
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,500
the subgenius foundation, that's the thing.

911
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,340
He'd have them on once a week or so anyway.

912
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,940
Really interesting stuff.

913
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,320
But these people should stop knocking him and give him a chance here in Cleveland.

914
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,800
Maybe they'd get a little bit more urbane.

915
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,680
All right.

916
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,740
Thank you, sir.

917
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,180
Hello there, Al.

918
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,480
Hi, how you doing, Bob?

919
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,300
I'm doing well, thank you.

920
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:57,060
But nothing would be more effective than for Americans simply to quit using illegal drugs.

921
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,500
Our weapons in this...

922
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,280
Our main strategy are the law and criminal justice system.

923
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,600
Is this all there is?

924
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,420
Is this all there is?

925
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,180
Let's take some calls.

926
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,920
Hello, Ahmed.

927
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,720
You're on 3WE with Harry Stein.

928
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,520
Yes, I would like to address the way these young men and boys who listen today have a medal.

929
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,700
And they wear the baseball caps backward.

930
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,480
They wear the hanky heads and whatever.

931
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,300
They're all very macho.

932
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,100
They want to...

933
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,920
They look down on women, you see.

934
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,700
Mm-hmm.

935
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:36,060
And I read in the book of the subgenius by the holy man, J.R. Bob Dobbs, that this is not right.

936
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,140
That we should listen to more modern music.

937
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,760
We should respect women.

938
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:48,800
And this is one reason that the issue of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer always comes up these days.

939
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,240
And this Trevinoist thing, it's all to do with this heavy metal.

940
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,440
You see?

941
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,260
I don't understand that reference.

942
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,340
I don't understand it either.

943
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,420
It's come up with some frequency.

944
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,420
It's come up with some frequency over the last 10 days.

945
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,740
And I have no idea what it's all about.

946
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,760
Nobody can explain it to me.

947
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,600
Well, have you read the book?

948
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,280
What book?

949
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,000
The book of the subgenius.

950
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:05,820
No.

951
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,020
It's the teachings of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

952
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,040
He is against any prejudices, any bigotry.

953
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,140
But does he mention the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer?

954
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:16,800
Oh, yes.

955
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,240
Well, what's that all about?

956
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,560
Well, it is the launching.

957
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,540
The launching of the bleeding head.

958
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,700
In India, this is very well known now.

959
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,120
In the Muslim world.

960
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,400
I think many of us...

961
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,360
Western nations also.

962
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,680
European nations understand this.

963
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,560
And I think it is time for these young men...

964
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,300
And some of the women, too, are very into this heavy metal.

965
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,020
Demonic.

966
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,520
Very demonic.

967
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,860
They should listen to things like, you know, David Bowie.

968
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,480
Or the Doctors for Bob.

969
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,720
Very good group.

970
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,180
Or Boingo Boingo.

971
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,280
Lost me.

972
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,380
Well, I don't understand the bleeding head.

973
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,380
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer or Lee Trevino or any of that.

974
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:05,220
But if you're referring to, you know, kind of a pattern of alienation,

975
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,160
people simply not connecting,

976
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,400
which I think a lot of these things are about,

977
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,220
I agree 100%.

978
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,580
I mean, people...

979
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,740
You know, we've been through an age...

980
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:25,360
I mean, kids who are raised in situations that don't allow them

981
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,380
any kind of emotional self-control.

982
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:28,660
They're not able to have that confidence.

983
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,600
Grow up to be very alienated, angry teenagers

984
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,460
and probably alienated grown-ups.

985
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,880
And that's been the story of this culture

986
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,040
in large part for the last generation.

987
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,220
I want to pursue that when we come back.

988
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:43,940
We'll take a short break.

989
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:44,900
We're talking with Harry Stein.

990
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,280
The book is One of the Guys,

991
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,280
The Wising Up of an American Man,

992
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,760
published and in your bookstore by Pocket Books.

993
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,400
Another call to Ray.

994
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,800
And good afternoon.

995
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,800
You're on 3WE.

996
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,400
Yeah, it's not Ray.

997
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,060
It's Roy.

998
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,280
Sorry about that.

999
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:58,660
Roy?

1000
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,360
No problem.

1001
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,700
But I'm just calling to say, you know,

1002
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,140
these fellas that do that,

1003
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,940
and I heard a gentleman on, I think it was Bob Fuller's show yesterday

1004
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:13,020
who mentioned it was like these fellas that wear their baseball caps backward

1005
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,120
and wear these hanky heads and so forth

1006
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,260
and listen to this rock, heavy, hard metal.

1007
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,640
What do you call it?

1008
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,200
Heavy metal.

1009
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:20,700
Sure.

1010
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,300
Rock.

1011
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
Classic stereotype, but not true.

1012
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,020
Right, right.

1013
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,520
There's certainly not all of them, but it seems to be.

1014
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,960
They drive these Monte Carlos all rusted out.

1015
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:34,700
But anyway, the thing is, the rape goes beyond a crime of sex,

1016
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,680
and it even goes beyond a crime of violence.

1017
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,140
It goes to the point of they're trying to steal those women's slack.

1018
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,220
Don't follow you on that at all.

1019
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:51,000
Well, we're all born with original slack, according to the preachings of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1020
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,840
I think that fella mentioned that also.

1021
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,780
And the funny thing is this fella,

1022
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,960
what's his name that was doing the rapes?

1023
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,380
Ronnie Shelton.

1024
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:00,860
Right.

1025
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,860
He'd probably been deprived of his slack when he was a young boy.

1026
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:10,540
I lost you somewhere on slack, because I don't know what that all means, Roy.

1027
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,120
And Joyce, what do you think?

1028
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,640
Should we bother to even pursue that?

1029
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,440
I don't even know.

1030
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,100
Are you familiar at all with Dobbs?

1031
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,080
Totally unfamiliar to me.

1032
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,380
I don't even know that Dobbs fellow's name,

1033
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,520
so I wouldn't be able to respond in any way.

1034
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:26,620
It sounds like it's, for lack of a better term, off the wall from someplace.

1035
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:26,980
Right.

1036
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,160
As far as an explanation about people's slack.

1037
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,440
Coming up on Quarter to the Hour.

1038
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,460
Tremendous excitement involved.

1039
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,480
No, Arnold Palmer.

1040
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,820
I have no idea what this is all about.

1041
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,940
It is involved with something called the Church of the Subgenius.

1042
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,340
And we'll talk about it tomorrow.

1043
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,660
We're going to explain this whole thing.

1044
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,380
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, the bleeding head of Lee Trevino,

1045
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,460
and the bleeding head of Greg Norman.

1046
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,200
I don't really...

1047
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,500
We'll find out together tomorrow.

1048
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,900
Arnold Palmer.

1049
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,560
Well, after I had heard this...

1050
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:04,360
Well, friends, see, those calls were what prompted this guy to finally decide.

1051
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:08,760
He had to get the answer out.

1052
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,000
You know, what is the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer?

1053
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:15,920
Of course, all of you listening tonight, I'm sure, obviously,

1054
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,760
would know what the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer is in perspective,

1055
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:26,580
in context, within the Church of the Subgenius and the teachings of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1056
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:31,980
I mean, to me, it's astounding that there are some people who have not read

1057
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,060
their book of the subgenius or their Starkfest magazine closely enough

1058
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,520
to understand, in fact, even Ranger Rita, who just left here.

1059
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,740
I hate to gossip over the air, but she's a good subgenius,

1060
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,540
a slackful woman, true to Bob.

1061
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,500
I mean, she hasn't fired me yet.

1062
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:52,840
That's all.

1063
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,860
I mean, that's enough right there.

1064
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,660
And on top of that,

1065
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:02,780
a dues-paying $20 member, but she saw a bumper sticker on a car.

1066
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,920
Actually, it's on her office.

1067
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,600
It says, bleeding head good, healed head bad.

1068
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,940
Has a picture of Bob, and she thought it meant Bob's head.

1069
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,040
Well, of course, we don't want Bob's head bleeding most of the time.

1070
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,220
But she didn't.

1071
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:20,900
I said, what?

1072
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,940
That refers to the Palmer head.

1073
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,640
Palmer head?

1074
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,260
What's that?

1075
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:31,600
Oh, friends, I just, you know, it's like America today,

1076
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:38,200
we've fallen so far short of what our forefathers meant for us

1077
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,700
to know and to believe.

1078
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,920
And when I hear people say, bleeding head of what?

1079
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,800
You mean that golfer?

1080
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,200
It's like, oh, no.

1081
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,300
There's almost no point in even trying to explain it.

1082
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,440
Now, you can learn.

1083
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,740
You can learn more about that.

1084
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:02,440
Of course, if you're one of those very few who don't yet know,

1085
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,840
you can write to the sacred post office box,

1086
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,800
the number I'm about to give.

1087
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,640
You get your pencil ready.

1088
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:16,180
And learn more about the teachings of that man,

1089
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,040
if he even is a man, J.R. Bob Dobbs, that head, at any rate.

1090
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:26,680
And that number is, see, I have to have music behind it.

1091
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:27,140
I have to give this.

1092
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:40,720
Post office box 140306 in Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1093
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:41,980
That's right.

1094
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:47,880
Just write to Bob or the Hour of Slack radio show

1095
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:55,960
at post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1096
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,260
All right.

1097
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,220
Of course, you understand, I'm not Bob.

1098
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,540
You don't hear Bob's voice on the radio.

1099
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,300
We can't play Bob's voice on the radio

1100
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:09,840
because then somebody would be able to make voice readings.

1101
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,640
They'd run it through a computer.

1102
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,880
They'd know when he was born, probably where he was born,

1103
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,860
and they might be able to track him down.

1104
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,960
And we know what happens when they do that.

1105
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,800
Stay tuned.

1106
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,760
In about five minutes, Kathy's potluck is about to happen.

1107
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,380
And apparently,

1108
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,780
we're going to hear some sort of live music.

1109
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,460
I don't know.

1110
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:35,160
But I'm going to go ahead and play out the rest of Pope Jimbo's tape.

1111
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:39,780
If it doesn't start getting, you know, cool pretty soon,

1112
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:44,160
I'll probably switch over to KPFA subgenius show from Berkeley.

1113
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,780
And thank you.

1114
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,120
I started asking these people,

1115
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,460
what in the world are you talking about?

1116
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,320
Explain this to me.

1117
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,140
I want to know.

1118
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,320
And they would say, if you don't know, I can't explain it.

1119
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,580
And I would go, okay, right.

1120
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,540
Well, we get curious about this thing.

1121
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,700
So we started doing some, some research on it.

1122
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:09,200
And we have managed to track down the source of that expression and others that may or may not be familiar to you.

1123
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,100
Um, that deal with the church of the subgenius.

1124
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:22,600
And we will be talking to some officials, one local, one from Dallas, Texas, and we'll find out what's going on here.

1125
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,780
What is the church of the subgenius?

1126
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,760
And what's going on?

1127
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:26,760


1128
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:26,760


1129
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,640
And we'll get you some answers.

1130
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,980
And I think you're going to find it absolutely fascinating.

1131
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,940
That'll be coming up on the other side of the news here on 1100 AM.

1132
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,640
Then, of course, between five and six o'clock.

1133
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,600
Coming up on three W.

1134
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:50,800
We come back and answer some of the questions that have arisen over the last two or three weeks concerning things like the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

1135
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,660
Where did that come from?

1136
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,280
Now, joining us from parts unknown.

1137
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,580
Is the.

1138
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,260
The holy scribe of the church of the subgenius.

1139
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,720
Ivan staying hollow.

1140
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,600
Ivan, how are you?

1141
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,600
Praise Bob.

1142
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,240
Hi, Bob.

1143
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,020
How are you?

1144
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,160
Just like Bob.

1145
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:06,820
Which is like Bob.

1146
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,480
That's good.

1147
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:14,900
And in studio, Pope Jimbo, the leader of the Cleveland organization of the Church of the Subgenius and the tri state area.

1148
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,040
Yeah, I wouldn't say leader, but.

1149
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,280
Well, the pope.

1150
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,220
Hi, Muckety Muck.

1151
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:19,900
Hi, Muckety Muck.

1152
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:20,080
Pope.

1153
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:20,720
Whatever.

1154
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,220
Right.

1155
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:24,200
But we have to get some hierarchy out of the way here.

1156
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:24,480
Right.

1157
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,260
Pope is sort of close to the bottom.

1158
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:26,500
Yeah.

1159
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,060
Yeah.

1160
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:27,340
Right.

1161
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:27,820
Sure.

1162
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,920
We don't want people.

1163
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,980
Good luck on giving him somebody to order around.

1164
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,020
I believe that, too.

1165
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:42,860
Now, Ivan, as the holy scribe, perhaps you can explain to our listeners what is the Church of the Subgenius?

1166
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,980
I've heard that question asked a lot lately.

1167
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:53,260
Well, the Church of the Subgenius is the foremost disorganized religion in the country nowadays.

1168
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,860
It's a non organization.

1169
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,640
It's a non organization for non joiners.

1170
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:08,140
You might say it was the church for mutants, misfits, sinners, disbelievers, or people who

1171
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:08,760
believe anything.

1172
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:17,860
Class clowns, blasphemers, talk show hosts, you know, that general group, non grouping

1173
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,840
of non bad guys out there.

1174
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,380
None of the tenets of the church will drive us crazy.

1175
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,340
Because we already are.

1176
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,380
Oh, well, then you're already subgeniuses.

1177
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:30,740
Yeah.

1178
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:31,960
That's the point.

1179
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,280
Now, what's the alternative to being a subgenius, though?

1180
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:44,760
Well, that's the sad thing is, Bob, most people listening right now are unfortunately members

1181
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,880
of the pink human race.

1182
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,560
The pink boys, the normals, the unfortunate normal people.

1183
00:54:54,560 --> 00:55:00,020
Those who can never truly grasp Bob's teachings about Slack.

1184
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:00,920
Media.

1185
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Now, first of all, who's Bob?

1186
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:09,580
Well, Bob, of course, as every school child knows, is the saint of sales.

1187
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,820
Some call him a crook.

1188
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,880
Maybe nowadays some call him a saint.

1189
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:24,220
But Bob is the great mystic salesman who discovered the conspiracy of the normal and found out

1190
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,540
why people weren't getting enough Slack these days.

1191
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:35,200
And he founded his church on a shifting sandy beach of hypocrisy, Bob, in order to provide

1192
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,900
Slack to his followers and to smite the false prophets.

1193
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:43,860
Now, the full name here is J.R. Bob in quotations.

1194
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,680
My Bob is not in quotations, but his is.

1195
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:47,420
Right.

1196
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,740
Any other Bob is a false Bob.

1197
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:54,200
The Bob in quotes is on his book.

1198
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,600
He's got a birth certificate.

1199
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,780
And this is the one true Bob, the living Slack master.

1200
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:08,520
Now, people probably have seen representations of Bob and didn't know what they were looking at.

1201
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,240
No, they probably recognized it from some point in their past.

1202
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:23,080
But it's that picture of a man, a smiling 1950s or early 60s sort of all-American guy

1203
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,020
with a pipe.

1204
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:30,340
That grinning guy with a pipe in his mouth kind of looks a little bit like Ward Cleaver

1205
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,860
or Mark Trail.

1206
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,180
But yet there's this glint of insanity in his eyes.

1207
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,160
And that glint of insanity is what the church is based on.

1208
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,580
Couldn't have said it better myself.

1209
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,660
That was the Hour of Slack.

1210
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,480
Of course, people all over the country wondering, who is Bob?

1211
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,100
And where did he get that pipe?

1212
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,020
And what is he smoking?

1213
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:54,180
It's 10 o'clock here at KNOA.com.

1214
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,480
We're live from The Rock and Roll in 89.3 FM, Dallas, Fort Worth.

1215
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,740
And on our way to Waxahachie, we've got the old crusty minstrels.
