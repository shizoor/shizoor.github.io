00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,800
Well, maybe Pete Therese learned something and came back to tell us who it was amongst us we had to look out for.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,560
I know who it is! I know who the monster is!

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,220
Who is it, Charlie? Tell us!

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,920
I know who it is that doesn't belong among us!

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,880
What are you waiting for? Come on!

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,060
I swear I know who it is!

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, come on, Charlie! Come on!

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,320
Tell us! It's...

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,940
The Snake!

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,800
Understand the procedure now. Sit back and watch the pattern.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,140
And this pattern is always the same?

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,860
With few variations. They pick the most dangerous enemy they can find.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,360
And it's...

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,920
The Self-Genius!

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,720
Power of...

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,740
Swatch!

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,720
And I take it this is not unique?

18
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,100
By no means.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,240
Their world is full of...

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,480
Power of...

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,300
Swatch!

22
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,920
And we'll...

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,280
We'll go from one to the other and destroy their radios.

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,260
One to the other.

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,300
One to the other.

26
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,700
One to the other.

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,800
Man, that has got to be one of the greatest intros for Hour of Slack by Fernand and Andy Lemur ever!

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,380
And he's done hundreds of those.

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,680
You might look at...

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,060
Archive.com

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,860
Well, friends, we're doing it just like last show, again.

32
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,660
All new, but all pre-recorded from other people's shows.

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,600
With puzzling evidence, Dr. Drummond and Dr. Howell coming later.

34
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,200
But first, it's part two of four from the podcast called...

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,680
My Family Thinks I'm Crazy.

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,720
And I had a lot of fun with the young weirdos hosting it.

37
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,780
This part starts with me talking about first taking on Jesus in 1990.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,580
And then, in 1994, as business manager of the Church of the Subgenius.

39
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,320
The internet welcomed us with open arms.

40
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,220
And about that time, I got a young partner, Jesus.

41
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,040
Not Jesus from the Bible, but he looks like Jesus.

42
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,200
He is painted with long blonde hair, white man, you know.

43
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,460
He really looked the part.

44
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,420
I started calling him Jesus.

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,380
And so he...

46
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,660
So I had Jesus for a partner.

47
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,600
And he got us on...

48
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,260
Using credit cards.

49
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,080
And modernized everything a whole lot.

50
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,860
Then, because of photographs that he and his wife put online,

51
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:40,500
there was a child custody case where his wife's ex-husband got the child

52
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,020
because of Church of the Subgenius.

53
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,820
This judge just didn't get it.

54
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,960
And their pictures were pretty bad.

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,160
They're pink boys.

56
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,940
He was reenacting the station.

57
00:02:53,260 --> 00:03:00,460
And overall, if you see somebody that's really chronic,

58
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,140
you shouldn't necessarily name.

59
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,060
People slash machine words.

60
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,940
But I'd be glad if somebody said,

61
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,320
worked some gigs before.

62
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,320


63
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,320


64
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,320


65
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,460
Well, you know.

66
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,580
It was such a pain in my back.

67
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,360
The first time I was here,

68
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
there was the pimp으면.

69
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,820
Was it Chuck上 seguir who's the new housemate

70
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:22,500
Fucking spaceship.

71
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,400
what part of the northeast they knew how to party and long story short i was i was back at starwood

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,480
as the sort of the mascot skeptic and religion and other religious nut preaching about bob

73
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:46,660
they loved that stuff and i ended up my second wife was i met there and then she ended up running

74
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:53,140
the festival for several years i helped so i ended up married into the pagan community

75
00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:00,180
it's very strange i got to know quite a few of the people i'd made fun of in in a book an early

76
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,260
book that's out of print now called high weirdness by mail where we explained all the other cults you

77
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:12,240
could join or at least get free mailings from them you know just send this form letter to these weird

78
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,640
addresses and you'll get something back and it's a great hobby it was how weird it was

79
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,240
we started actually the reason i met philo besides his yellow page ad was that he collected

80
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,820
kook pamphlets and andy was into comic books and he liked captain beefheart now of course that

81
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,780
describes every subgenius now but at the time it was unheard of you know who's captain beefheart

82
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:45,740
what yeah yeah the great captain beefheart you know i know who is it well he was a very weird

83
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,300
musician

84
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,940
he had he was very influential on people like the residents man church is a subgenius for that

85
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,880
matter he was actually a buddy a high school buddy of frank zappas but his he was even weirder than

86
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,480
zappa and zappa got him his first record deal which is one of the classic albums of all time

87
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,960
but it's really hard to get used to a trout mask replica was the first captain beefheart out captain

88
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,640
beefheart and his magic band but this is a real person yeah yeah well it's a real person yeah well

89
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:22,820
his real name was don van vliet okay cool yeah there you go there's captain beefhart cool i

90
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,260
thought you you know okay he said he has an amazing singing voice and like i said he was

91
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,540
you guys may have also never heard of the fire sign theater

92
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,360
they were a comedy group that did well they were really radio theater they were about

93
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,300
10 years older than us geniuses and fire sign theater were they were ahead way ahead of their

94
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,640
time they kind of like went there and went ahead and sort of set up that area but they were well we

95
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:46,640


96
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:46,640


97
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:46,640


98
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:54,060
Monty Python, but they were way before Monty Python. They were inspired by The Goon Show,

99
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:00,520
which also inspired Python. But we were inspired by the Fireside Theater. And

100
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,700
we didn't expect to be lucky enough to be them, but we did sort of end up carrying the torch.

101
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:16,100
And that there was a subgenius radio show started up in Berkeley on the KPFA,

102
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:24,260
one of those hippie Pacifica stations. And that was in 1982, Puzzling Evidence Show started. I

103
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:30,660
was the first guest. Then Hour of Slack started up in 1985. That was my show. I did a little

104
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:37,980
station in Dallas until they kicked me off for, believe it or not, for

105
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,160
a

106
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,680
a

107
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,780
, crazy racial reasons.

108
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,800
We just got fired.

109
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,040
But I just started doing it from home. We were already syndicated by then. I was mailing

110
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,620
cassettes to these other stations. And so I started doing this thing from home. And later

111
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,420
on, I ended up moving to Cleveland and was where the station there was, had already been

112
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:05,020
playing my show for years. And I just started doing the same time slot and worked with some

113
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,680
Cleveland folks. There were, there was a lot of subgenius activity in Cleveland.

114
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,860
A lot more than there ever had been in Texas.

115
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,720
What were you talking about on the show? Were you like preaching to people about Bob or what?

116
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,400
Oh, yeah. A little bit of everything. I mean, we'd, we'd be, we'd preach about Bob. Some we'd

117
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:29,960
play music often, mostly unreleased music, music by subgeniuses or off weird stuff, you know,

118
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:37,840
outtakes. So the guys at Devo were our friends. I worked on a couple of their music videos and they

119
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,660
contributed to that. And I just, I just started doing that. And I just started doing that. And I

120
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,460
started to, I started to, I started to do that. And I just started doing that. And I just started

121
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:39,460


122
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:46,340
Mark Motherspaugh did music for our little commercial. That's on front page of subgenius.com.

123
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,120
Ivan, I'm Reverend Juan Ayala. Now, can you sign my subgenius pamphlet, please?

124
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,240
I ordered one. Are you able to sign that for me?

125
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,100
Yeah. You only ordered a pamphlet.

126
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,520
I ordered the 44 thing, whatever it was.

127
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,400
Oh, you've got the membership pack.

128
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,100
Yeah. I'm a reverend now.

129
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,580
I already did. They already, they're, they're already signed.

130
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:16,780
I mean, there's, there's like a letter from me in it and it's, it's, I actually sign each one for real, but it doesn't have.

131
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,100
When did you order it?

132
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,860
Just now.

133
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,960
We were on air like 10, 15 minutes ago.

134
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,080
Oh, just now?

135
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,840
Yeah.

136
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,160
Oh, okay.

137
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:33,440
Ivan, I need to tell you something, bro. You're my favorite. You are my favorite guest by far and away, dude. You are great, bro. I loved everything you're saying. This is fantastic.

138
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,700
We're only, we're only just getting started.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,120
I don't trust you.

140
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,640
Don't, don't.

141
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,220
Don't trust anything Chris says.

142
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,160
Sounds suspicious to me.

143
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,900
Reverend, don't.

144
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm serious.

145
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,940
Reverend, Reverend, we have him here for comedic purposes. Don't trust anything he says.

146
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,760
Ouch. Ouch. Those are my feelings, bro.

147
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,740
Those are my feelings.

148
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,920
Chris, you know, I love you.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:04,380
I actually have been, I've done a lot of interviews. When, when we're, our books were being published by Simon & Schuster, they would send copies to radio shows.

150
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,420
You know, they, they could have, they have this huge list of PR stuff.

151
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:08,980
That they would.

152
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,900
And so I ended up doing a lot of these straight radio things.

153
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,440
Just stupid drive time FM stations.

154
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,720
The, the rock jocks were the worst.

155
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,960
They were the dumbest.

156
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,320
Honest to God.

157
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,940
Those, I just got to where I just dreaded those.

158
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,260
Because the, the, the guys that thought they were real hip.

159
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,860
Jesus Christ, they're so lame.

160
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,820
Every time I ever walked into.

161
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,420
There were times when big stations would go, oh, we heard your little indie show.

162
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,360
Why don't you come in and talk about doing a for real show with us?

163
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:58,100
Somehow the minute that you started hearing subgenius material played in one of those corporate offices, everyone in the room knew it wasn't going to work.

164
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,000
It's like, no, no advertisers would never put up with.

165
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,760
We're making fun of people's most.

166
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,080
You know, serious things.

167
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:17,560
And we weren't overtly like putting down Christianity, particularly because hell that was old hat Saturday night live was already doing that.

168
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,680
We were more interested in UFO cults and, you know, the.

169
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,100
Jonestown was the one we used as an exact example.

170
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:34,440
You know, if Jim Jones could talk 900 people into killing themselves, we can talk 900 people into sending us a dollar.

171
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,480
I love you, man.

172
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:35,800
You're my.

173
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,740
And it turned out if we if we'd wanted to, we could have talked 900 people into killing themselves.

174
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,200
People are that ready to follow something stupid.

175
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,400
We've had to deprogram our own zombies.

176
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,500
So these these people will.

177
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,700
When when do I get to meet Bob?

178
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,920
How did that make you feel, Ivan, that you had that much power?

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,820
My fingers and go look, man, I have to tell you a real hard fact.

180
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,160
Bob, you're never going to meet Bob.

181
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:05,740
He's dead.

182
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,880
You don't care about me.

183
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:16,080
And the the dumbest one of all was the richest guy that I ever met.

184
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,640
He was some he had inherited a fortune.

185
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,680
And he thought he was going to meet Bob.

186
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,720
I couldn't believe how dense this guy was.

187
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,300
Over the years, I learned that the.

188
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,380
The rich can afford to be stupid.

189
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,720
And there's nothing more dangerous than a.

190
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,960
A drunk rich man.

191
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,300
Or a woman, I guess that's the most dangerous creature in the world is a super rich person who's really drunk.

192
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,780
So I can do anything they want and somebody else to drive them home.

193
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,240
And I could pay to make it forgotten.

194
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,640
You know, how did that make you feel, Ivan?

195
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,820
That you had that much power?

196
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,400
That's how I know I want it.

197
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,360
It's my turn to get rich.

198
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,380
I, you know, I couldn't agree more with that last statement.

199
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,780
And I do want to know your answer to Juan's question.

200
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:13,280
But I want to know your thoughts on conspiracy with that last statement we just heard.

201
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,420
I mean, a lot of the conspiracies we look at involve very rich people getting away with very, very bad things.

202
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,300
Well, that's all you need is to be incredibly rich.

203
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,820
You can do just about anything.

204
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,300
The way things are now.

205
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,100
I mean, it's like.

206
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,780
What?

207
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,360
One percent of the people in the country own 90% of the population.

208
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,720
99% of the shit.

209
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,620
Everybody else is.

210
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:38,780
Sorry.

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,040
Pardon my language.

212
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,820
Oh, no, please.

213
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,800
Internet podcast.

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,600
Swear away.

215
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,580
See, if I use this on my show, I have to.

216
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,320
I have to.

217
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,580
If I use a clip from it, I have to cut that stuff or bleep it for at least for this.

218
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,320
Only about four real stations now.

219
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,100
But I do have to think about them.

220
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,900
They can get in big trouble for.

221
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:58,920
Stuff.

222
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,840
This is your syndicated radio show you're talking about.

223
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,340
Yeah.

224
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,980
Well, the hour of slack.

225
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,760
I mean, it's.

226
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,760
It started out as a broadcast radio show on independent, you know, public type stations,

227
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,660
college stations, college radio, basically.

228
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,180
Cool.

229
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,540
And it was running on about 15 different college stations for a while.

230
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,840
But gradually people put listen to the radio.

231
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,600
For one thing, you could at Cleveland State.

232
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,660
I was with the station there for about 15 years.

233
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,340
They couldn't get students to come in and do stuff.

234
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,340


235
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,340


236
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,340


237
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,340


238
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,340


239
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,340


240
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,340


241
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,340


242
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,340


243
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,340


244
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,460
And they had to go out and do shows.

245
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:45,760
Almost everybody doing shows there were 50 year old alumni, you know, hadn't had been classes years, but they still had their same old shows because nobody else would take the time slots.

246
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,640
It was nuts.

247
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,060
And I now do the show from my desk, basically.

248
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,060
Although every now and then we do phone things.

249
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:03,480
And every X day we would have quite a few of us together to record a lot.

250
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,880
X days were great.

251
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,880
And we did them up until.

252
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,360
Well, we're going to keep doing them.

253
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,920
But we just lost our venue.

254
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,060
We had the perfect place in Florida.

255
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,420
It was kind of like a hippie nudist semi nudist resort.

256
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,520
But it was really nice.

257
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,360
That's one.

258
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,100
The person who ran it was real cool.

259
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,900
But she's moving.

260
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,500
She's moving it to somewhere else.

261
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,040
So we're going to do it.

262
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,740
We don't have any place to do it this summer.

263
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,040
And.

264
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,900
We came up with great excuses for that.

265
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,960
But Juan lives in Florida.

266
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:46,340
We've done 25 of these outdoor events that have had bands and people doing like live radio show type things.

267
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,980
But mostly it was standing around on the road talking.

268
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,300
Subgenius is meet each other.

269
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,800
They a lot of them would only see each other once a year, a couple of times a year.

270
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,560
But they were special friends, you know.

271
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:05,200
So it was a what Philo and I didn't expect would turn into such a social thing.

272
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,980
The number of subgenius Facebook pages is too damn high.

273
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,640
There's so many of them.

274
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,840
I can't keep track of them.

275
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,920
Right.

276
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:22,640
It seems like this is the most infamous anti cult because like you said, you're literally deprogramming your zombies.

277
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,200
What kind of feeling did that give you?

278
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,820
You're realizing you had such power and you really weren't looking for it.

279
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,660
It's like if only we could keep a straight face.

280
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,320
If only if only I didn't smile when I was saying this.

281
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,840
We've got to be like L. Ron Hubbard by now.

282
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,920
Oh, for real, dude.

283
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,700
You have the boat.

284
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,260
Yeah, I got the yacht.

285
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,560
I got the sailors hat.

286
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,260
You got to tighten it up.

287
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,980
I mean, man, you got to be real serious with this, bro, because people can you know, we want to help you, man.

288
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,600
I'm in bro.

289
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,020
I'm down.

290
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,840
Can I be in?

291
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,160
44 bucks.

292
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:04,940
We're about to go into a, well, I can't talk too much about this, but we're, we are, I think we're going to be entering a phase two soon.

293
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,860
I love it.

294
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,200
That's going to be a little different, but does that involve, and it might actually make some real money now.

295
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:25,180
Ironically, I'm sitting where I'm sitting right now is a big house in the middle of the woods on a, on a ranch property in Burlington.

296
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,440
rural Texas.

297
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,480
So it's almost like we've got the perfect place for the cult compound.

298
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,280
But the problem is, I mean, I just don't like minions.

299
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,280
So this next day is going to be a series of parties, local parties.

300
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,940
Like I'll invite my friends that I know that are from around, you know,

301
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,200
this Texas, Arkansas,

302
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,700
and maybe a guy up in upstate New York will throw a big party there.

303
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,840
Maybe they'll do some at the pagan campground that we used to use in Ohio.

304
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,700
I was in Ohio for about 20 years, but now I'm back in Texas for good,

305
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,640
but not Dallas.

306
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,860
It's a goat ranch.

307
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,860
I didn't really know much about the subgenius and started looking into it.

308
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,140
And I love the ideology.

309
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:22,300
I can get behind the system, all that, you know, and be your own person,

310
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,560
do your own thing, find your own slack.

311
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,800
I love that because that's what we talk about.

312
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,120
And it's amazing.

313
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,020
It has inspired lots of people to, in fact, repent,

314
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,300
quit their jobs and slack off.

315
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,480
Sometimes they have to get another job, but it's almost always a better job.

316
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,000
You know, that's what happens when you quit your job.

317
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,380
You get a better job usually.

318
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,980
So that's exactly what happened to me.

319
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,240
And I did.

320
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,020
I quit my job for the man.

321
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,820
And now I have this justice job for Bob.

322
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,460
But unfortunately, that means I'm always at work.

323
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,300
You know, my bedroom's just down the hallway there.

324
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,820
So I have to give myself permission to, you know,

325
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,760
knock off work and go watch Rick and Morty or whatever.

326
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,600
Living for Bob out here.

327
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,420
Living for Bob.

328
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,380
I love this, bro.

329
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,440
This is incredible, dude.

330
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,020
It really is.

331
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,860
But you love what you're doing, Ivan, right?

332
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,120
And I mean, as you,

333
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,060
the thing that I like about you is that you told people like, listen,

334
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,460
we came up with this.

335
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:24,780
We're going to do this.

336
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:25,940
We're going to do this.

337
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,000


338
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,000


339
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,000


340
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,000


341
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,000


342
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,000


343
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,000


344
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,000


345
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,660
Why are you taking it so serious?

346
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Because people take their life too seriously sometimes.

347
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,720
Well, you know, we actually didn't do that until that movie.

348
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,860
Oh, really?

349
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,480
I stayed in character for years and years.

350
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,280
And a couple of things happened.

351
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,160
Somebody outed me on Facebook.

352
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,040
And suddenly I was Doug Smith instead of Ivan Stang.

353
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,660
And I kind of like being Doug Smith again.

354
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,220
It wasn't new and different.

355
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,720
And I'd still be Ivan Stang, you know.

356
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,640
But screw Facebook anyway.

357
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,300
Remember my, the secret hierarchy, we use Telegram,

358
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,480
but we have our special tiny news group of like six people.

359
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,880
A little insider secret there.

360
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,280
We use Telegram too.

361
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,380
All the, all the original, you might say there was about a dozen, maybe 15,

362
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,220
20 really people who are really contributing heavily in the eighties and almost

363
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,480
all of them are still alive.

364
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,460
A couple of them hate, hate subgenius now.

365
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:35,920
It's too bad because they, one guy, two guys that hate subgenius have the biggest

366
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,780
Dobbs heads you've ever seen tattooed on their back.

367
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,880
Or one guy has one of those takes up his whole arm and he just hates it now.

368
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,100
Dumbasses.

369
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,700
Anyway.

370
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,080
Yeah.

371
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,460
But, but, uh, most of us are still alive.

372
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:53,460


373
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:53,460


374
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:53,460


375
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,260
We're still, still friends and they almost all of them were in that movie.

376
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,500
Do you think that's a testament to living your life cultivating slack?

377
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,880
I think, you know, there's, you know, proven scientific data that shows in certain cultures.

378
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,040
There's a, you know, correlation there, but what do you think within this small sort of

379
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,740
subculture with a slack playing into people's mental health as much as I hate using that term?

380
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,360
Well, I think a sense of humor is a healthy thing to have.

381
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,460
Yeah.

382
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,980
In this day and age, they can't look at the people that don't have a sense of humor.

383
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,160
They're really look bad that all the time.

384
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,540
And they're usually morbidly obese and God full of anger.

385
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,580
Of course, that's what the internet turned into.

386
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,840
Just an anger feeder.

387
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,240
It's such a shame.

388
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:52,080
You know, it was great when only smart people knew about it and subgenius smart people and

389
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,340
also subgenius.

390
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,460
But then, you know, then pretty soon everybody's grandma was on the internet and all the girls

391
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,660
that had been topless at X day made us take their pictures down all their, all their naked

392
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,180
pictures.

393
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,000
What's the motto Ivan.

394
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,660
If they can't take a joke, fuck them.

395
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,420
Is that how it goes?

396
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,340
That's the only, the only real rule in the church is fuck them.

397
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,680
If they can't take a joke or if you're, if there's, if there's children in the audience,

398
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,760
you can say, if they can't not see the humor.

399
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,120
Uh,

400
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,980
let them mount up upon themselves.

401
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,420
That's the polite, the radio, the broadcast radio before 11 o'clock version.

402
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:42,600
The term you use for weed kind of reminds me of what the monkeys called cannabis on their old TV show.

403
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,300
Is there any correlation there?

404
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,880
Any connection to the monkeys?

405
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
What did they call it?

406
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,420
I think they called it frop or froth or something along those lines.

407
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,340
No, no prop was strictly from us.

408
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:55,980
Okay.

409
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:03,940
The monkeys did have a song called Bob Dabalina calling Bob Dabalina.

410
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,100
Totally by coincidence.

411
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,760
I didn't really remember that song.

412
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,040
Although technically I first record album.

413
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,840
It wasn't a movie soundtrack I've ever bought was some monkey sound.

414
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,520
Bob's a real person.

415
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,960
What did Bob Alina on it?

416
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,180
But that wasn't where his name came from.

417
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:22,400
I think it was a movie soundtrack.

418
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,400


419
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,840
That was something somebody else pointed out later.

420
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,120
You know, there's a lot of things like that.

421
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,440
It's just like, wow, he's a bobsman at this moment.

422
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,960
Do you think anybody else smoked a fro for the first time and was trans

423
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,500
mitted to a cave in Tibet?

424
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,040
Well, finally says that's how it started for him.

425
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:50,740
So not just you, other others have had this standard, uh, all the early hierarchy where

426
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,320
we're higher up that way.

427
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,380


428
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,600
acknowledge that Warチ amiga came in the first place.

429
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,960
So like a gang jumping

430
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,700
you notice we

431
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,100
that's right.

432
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,200
We have to use the special pillows with the little hole in

433
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,100
am tahu

434
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,300
rights and stuff.

435
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:14,140
So if I buy in right at $29, I'm a Deacon, right?

436
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,140
If I buy into yeah, there's a, there's a, you here,

437
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,080
I'll pull out one of these doctorates in your, in your marvelous Pac.

438
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:21,980
It's these.

439
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,080
wow i didn't know they were so hard to take apart

440
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,560
kind of looks like an older bob right

441
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,740
ivan are you bob are you kidding no bob kind of looks like ward cleaver

442
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:47,420
like bob yeah this thing here shows the or the high epops that's what bob is it doesn't really

443
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,720
give a price says please inquire okay you'd be an over man for a hundred thousand bucks

444
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:01,140
an x-man for ten thousand i'm more of an x-man high pope of the unpredictable five grand supreme

445
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:06,740
supervisor for a thousand bucks we actually had a few supreme supervisors that's a deal that's a

446
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:14,660
steel a plastic card was that four man 25 bucks drone man 10 bucks high priest of the repeater

447
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,280
ship six bucks for one dollar you could be a

448
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:29,700
whiz master whiz master so these are signed by bob with a well it's printed yeah and even even

449
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,160
it has my signature and philo's signature but they were actually rubber stamps they're printed

450
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:42,980
versions of rubber stamps of our signatures so i've been double cheating there how much

451
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,960
do you think bob has had his hand in all of these

452
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,260
ancient

453
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:54,560
religions because if we look back we have these right you had a psychedelic experience where bob

454
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,020
revealed himself you have helena bovatsky talking about the ascended masters yeah is bob an ascended

455
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:07,620
master is he some well there bob himself is is only about 88 years old as we figure it but

456
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:16,720
they've always been bobs and of course we also we let's face it i mean we we created a monster

457
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,260
from the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit

458
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,960
right while cigarette

459
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:42,640
one all some outside

460
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,940
Bob that started all those religions, but the alien that calls itself Jehovah one.

461
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,880
Right.

462
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,040
It has masqueraded as a God.

463
00:25:53,160 --> 00:26:00,120
It's a retarded alien from the, it's an excess actually from planet X, but it's a kind of

464
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,220
a differently abled one.

465
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,800
And he it's lived on earth for thousands and thousands of years.

466
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:14,420
It started the Zoroastrians and of course the Hebrews and the, the real, a lot of the

467
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:21,280
Roman stuff is, is based on Wotan is another name, Odin, so forth.

468
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,140
Now, uh, they're all the same monster.

469
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,440
It's all big, invisible space monster in the sky, but it is a monster.

470
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,380
Now, right.

471
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,960
It's definitely a monster.

472
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,720
Has this been, has this been brought up before?

473
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,700
I've seen.

474
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,660
I've seen a group going by the name pasta fairians.

475
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,300
Are those guys just copying the church of the subgenius?

476
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,900
Is there a beef between the, the, you two?

477
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,140
Oh, no, no, not at all.

478
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:52,060
They were, they were, well, you know, they were started as kind of a protest against

479
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,060
something, you know, it's like the flying spaghetti monster.

480
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:58,900
Yeah.

481
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,300
The flying, I mean, they did some guy just decide, okay, my religion is the flying spaghetti

482
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,760
monster.

483
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,360
I'm going to stick with it.

484
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,640
I think he was at the DM.

485
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:06,780
Yeah.

486
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:06,780


487
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:06,780


488
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,260
And it was, you know, a lot of people picked up on it and they've, you know, they've been

489
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,980
going strong.

490
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:19,320
They're probably, they may be better known to the normal world at large than, than church

491
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:27,340
of the subgenius is, but you know, they came along a lot later and we were preceded by

492
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:27,880
the discord.

493
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,680
So discord thing was started in the fifties.

494
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,780
I didn't actually see their material until we'd already done the first one.

495
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,660
I thought it was part of the Illuminatus thing.

496
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:46,980
But the first time I saw it, the discordian things, my first thought was, oh no, everybody's

497
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,340
going to think we copied them.

498
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:54,280
That happened when Devo's first album came out and it had this, this face on the cover

499
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,100
that looked kind of Bob, like it was actually Chi Chi Rodriguez, the golfer.

500
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:05,060
But they, they suddenly people, you know, we were afraid that, that oftentimes we came

501
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,920
first, but people got mixed up.

502
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,640
There's a talking heads or David Byrne song called puzzling evidence.

503
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,040
Well, when he made his movie true stories, he was going to have a subgenius D Bible scene

504
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,720
in it with, and that was some song that was going to be in it.

505
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:29,320
And I was supposed to do the collage image projections and our Pope David Meyer was going

506
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:29,940
to be the preacher.

507
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,040
But as soon as Hollywood money came in suddenly, oh, we didn't have enough of a truck.

508
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,040


509
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,040


510
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,040


511
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,040


512
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,700
And they had to change it all.

513
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,280
But so, but they still had that song, puzzling evidence.

514
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,920
And there's a lot of similarity subgenius in that scene because it was supposed to be

515
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,580
us originally.

516
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,500
And he was shooting, he shot that thing in the Dallas area too.

517
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:57,660
But to that, that wasn't, I mean, I understand how that, how that works when suddenly somebody

518
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,840
else's foot in the bill, like they really get to call the shots and who gets fired.

519
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,860
And it wasn't us.

520
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,040
Speaker 2.

521
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
You step fighting.

522
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,320
Speaker 3.

523
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,600
I think you would been, you had sort of asked that question.

524
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,900
But yeah, it's kind oftechnological.

525
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,360
I will, but before that, as it were, some of the things were in the, I think that later

526
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:20,200
clear, say, the, I should call this not in the first place, but it is in the jakbyactic

527
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,740
or ultimately a micro-technological detail.

528
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:29,340
I don't know, not not only that, but there was a T or two moves to cool but five golden

529
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:29,340


530
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,480
Israel see that hologram looks like this as a, as a hit era films.

531
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:31,860
SAM NAPOLITANO👍

532
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,960
I can't even believe it.

533
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,020
Sam, no, no one's going to get up sign up your hands and ask you to do that.

534
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,020


535
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,020


536
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,800
in 1998 and called the campground.

537
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,640
The sheriff actually called the sheriff at this little town

538
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,580
where our events were held back then in upstate New York,

539
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,560
western New York.

540
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,620
And the sheriff listened to this guy go, oh, subgeniuses,

541
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,960
oh, they're going to kill themselves.

542
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,480
Okay.

543
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,100
He immediately called the campground owner and goes,

544
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,820
Frank, you're not going to believe this, folks.

545
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,640
The FBI is so stupid.

546
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,900
They thought the subgeniuses were for real.

547
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,920
At the same time, though, I mean, we are for real.

548
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,900
There's thousands and thousands of ministers out there.

549
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,660
I really don't know how so many have disappeared,

550
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,960
but I would say at least 40,000 people have sent us that have actually

551
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,820
sent the 35 bucks or whatever we were charging.

552
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,440
And this is a good amount.

553
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,520
For a long time, it was like three a day.

554
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,820
It's more like two a day now.

555
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,580
Some years it was six a day, people joining up.

556
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,800
And I could fetch up a number in the thousands on my email easily.

557
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:35,240
But.

558
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,620
I've been, you seeing some nice checks or what was going down, bro.

559
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,400
You getting paid?

560
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,440
Oh, I make my, I've made my living doing this for years now.

561
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,340
I love that.

562
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:45,540
Yeah.

563
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:45,780
Yeah.

564
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,960
I'm getting, I'm getting paid.

565
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,540
Um, now the house I lived at, this is more, was my, I didn't expect this to

566
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,340
happen, but I've ended up living in my late parents' house in the middle of a

567
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:55,960
goat ranch.

568
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,360
My brother raises goats.

569
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,260
In fact, yesterday.

570
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:00,760
Yeah.

571
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:06,040
Standing next to a mound of composted goat taller than me.

572
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,280
Shut up filling pots for my garden.

573
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,680
You eat curry goat.

574
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,900
You ever eat that curry goat?

575
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,540
No, no, I would Hannibal.

576
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,340
I can't.

577
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,140
I don't, we don't eat goat here.

578
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,860
We, we don't like to think about what happens to the goats after they.

579
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,080
Right.

580
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,760
You're tripping that curry goat is the best dish known to man.

581
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,240
My man.

582
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:28,980
Maybe, maybe I tried, I tried goat once in, at a restaurant in Portugal, but I

583
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,080
didn't like the way it was prepared.

584
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,880
Yeah.

585
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,800
And I had Cabrito.

586
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:37,200
There's a place here in town that serves goat, but didn't, didn't taste any

587
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,520
different than, I mean, I couldn't really taste it that much.

588
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,720
And I felt kind of guilty.

589
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,560
I don't raise the goats.

590
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,620
My brother does, but you know, you get.

591
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,980
I've been, would you have done anything differently from when you

592
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,580
started all these years ago?

593
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,500
Would you have done anything differently when you were starting this, you know,

594
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,880
religion, if you will,

595
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,420
not that I can talk about.

596
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,640
And they don't have anything to do with the religion.

597
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,240
Interesting.

598
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:07,900
Thanks.

599
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,600
My family thinks I'm crazy podcast.

600
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:18,400
And now from the puzzling evidence show on KPFA Berkeley in the year of 2013,

601
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,300
Dr. Drummond, Dr.

602
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,200
Howell and Dee Woodman Atwell telling the truth about Hedy Lamarr.

603
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:25,900
Yes.

604
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,140
The movie star Hedy Lamarr.

605
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,880
To be mixed later with the movie star, Hedy Lamarr.

606
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:30,880


607
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:30,880


608
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,800
And now with ask Dr.

609
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,660
Howell clips with Michael Pepe, Ed Holmes and Rusty Rebar.

610
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,120
But now Hedy.

611
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,280
Yeah.

612
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,860
We don't have time tonight to cover all of these subjects.

613
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,300
How about Hedy Lamarr?

614
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:43,980
Yeah.

615
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,000
There's a cell phone.

616
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,240
Cell phones.

617
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,500
Yeah.

618
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,880
Well, cell phone tower concept anyway.

619
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,320
Right.

620
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,560
Yeah.

621
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:49,740
Yeah.

622
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,560
Part one link in the chain of things.

623
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,300
But a number of things.

624
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:53,680
Yeah.

625
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,400
She, she was not shooting.

626
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,960
She was inventing.

627
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,100
Yeah.

628
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,760
That's so cool.

629
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,580
That's amazing.

630
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,460
The world's.

631
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,860
Any girl can be glamorous.

632
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,280
All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.

633
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,540
The vanished years return.

634
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,260
That was a Hedy Lamarr quote.

635
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,000
The earth, thus like a snake, renew her winter weeds out warm.

636
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,040
But actually she invented stuff during the second world war.

637
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:28,560
Hedy Lamarr, who also appeared in the nude in Gustav Machete's, uh, movie.

638
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


639
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


640
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


641
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


642
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


643
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


644
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


645
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


646
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


647
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


648
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


649
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


650
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


651
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


652
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


653
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


654
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


655
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


656
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


657
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


658
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


659
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,560


660
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,360
Astonishing film, Ecstasy.

661
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,680
The sensation of pre-war Europe.

662
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:41,300
After she came to Hollywood, she starred with Bob Hope in a series of disgusting comedies.

663
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,160
No, I actually, I'm not sure that.

664
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,160
No, that's not true.

665
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:44,900
Oh, okay.

666
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,160
Good.

667
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,780
Thank God.

668
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,020
Well, she was pretty, she was very, uh, very.

669
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,520
How about Samson and Delilah?

670
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,800
Wasn't she Delilah?

671
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,020
Yes, she was Delilah.

672
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,700
She was delightful.

673
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,380
Delilah, delightful.

674
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,560
You know, she was delightful.

675
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:58,560


676
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:58,560


677
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:58,660
Yeah.

678
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,180
Or Nancy Kovac dancing in Jason and the audience.

679
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,180
She was the inventor of frequency hopping.

680
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,220
That's what it was.

681
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,280
Is that like the Lindy Hopping?

682
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,040
Hedy Lamarr's.

683
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,720
More frequent.

684
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:16,120
That was the precursor to cell phone towers being able to drive between them and frequency

685
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,700
hopping.

686
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,840
Yeah, she quit school at age 16 and got a job working for director Max Reinhardt.

687
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,700
That's right.

688
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,400
Originally her name was, uh, Heidi Keisler.

689
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,540
Oh, yeah.

690
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,980
But in Hollywood she became Hedy Lamarr.

691
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,180
Ecstasy was a Czech film.

692
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,000
That's a Czech, as in Czechoslovakian.

693
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,320
It was not a chick flick.

694
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,220
The young men liked it though.

695
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:49,700
And, uh, then her husband attempted to buy up all prints of the embarrassing film which

696
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,300
owed his wife making love and have them destroyed.

697
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,660
In this he was unsuccessful.

698
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,540
And film can probably be done.

699
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,820
It can be seen today on the internet.

700
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,860
I haven't looked.

701
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,760
Everything can.

702
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,720
When she was 20 she married a man 30 years her senior who was an arms merchant selling

703
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,100
munitions to Germany.

704
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,700
Yes, he sold, uh, uh, munitions for the coming war.

705
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,280
And he was the one who attempted to make that purchase.

706
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,540
Yeah, he was pretty dominant.

707
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,840
She had to escape by drugging her maid.

708
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,740
Hedy knew.

709
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,520
Bores and guns and cash.

710
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:28,520


711
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:28,520


712
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,700
She had to buy all the calibers of projectiles and all of it and synthesized it into valuable

713
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:39,700
technology used in the submarine warfare which characterized the second world war,

714
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,780
particularly its early years.

715
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,080
Neither she nor Antheil were scientists but one afternoon she realized, we're talking

716
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,940
and changing frequencies all the time.

717
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,800
At that moment the concept of frequency hopping was born.

718
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,740
I understand you know I think.

719
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,120


720
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,500
I understand.

721
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,660
They used a player piano was the, uh, using a modified player piano roll in both the torpedo

722
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,640
and the transmitter the changing frequencies could also be in sync.

723
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,000
A constantly changing frequency cannot be jammed.

724
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,120
Everything but the kitchen sink.

725
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,040
So he, his concepts came from the player piano.

726
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,700
Her concepts came from the, the, the weaponry machinery which you've become familiar with.

727
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,320
So what a great, uh, great marriage there.

728
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,480
Yeah.

729
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,080
And now let's continue with the last of the Ask Dr. Howe show live on Puzzling Evidence.

730
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:42,340
Radio featuring Pete Goldie, Rusty Rebar, Michael Pepe and Puzzling Evidence.

731
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,960
I'm Dr. Howland Howell.

732
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,420
It feels really good to be back from the break, Reverend Howe.

733
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,680
The brink you saying?

734
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,680
No, the break.

735
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,600
Oh, the break.

736
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah, right, the break.

737
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,600
That break that we had was such a long and...

738
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,140
Yeah, you don't gotta put the breaks on sometimes.

739
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,460
Yeah, you don't gotta put the breaks on sometimes.

740
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,140
Uh, uh...

741
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,240
All right, all right, simmer down.

742
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,560
Now look, uh...

743
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,520
We're all back now.

744
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,480
We all ran away for a while.

745
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,160
Well then, stand up for yourself.

746
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,200
Be proactive.

747
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,680
Shoulders back.

748
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,760
Thumbs along the seams of the crowd.

749
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:20,480
And, and what are the, you mean to say costumed superheroes are given awards for their costumes?

750
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,440
They're given awards for something or other.

751
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,320
Uh, I just work there.

752
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,100
I don't know exactly what it is.

753
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,720
Yeah, that's right, Michael.

754
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:28,840
They're just superheroes.

755
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,180
I don't know exactly what it is.

756
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,180


757
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,540
I had read it out and I...

758
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,560
I was thinking they're like the L.A. guys, you know?

759
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,000
Then I award, there's a guy dressed like, uh, Gumby.

760
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,240
You know, I give him an award...

761
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,720
Well they're not gonna get an award for saving the planet.

762
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,200
They're saving the planet.

763
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,460
No, nobody's doing that.

764
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,020
Because they didn't do it.

765
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,120
Yeah, all they did was put a costume on.

766
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,060
In fact, they are harming the planet by an increased signature...

767
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:44,060


768
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,280
I don't think they should give anymore awards.

769
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,560
...and destroying the tranquility with the endless throbbing music that you thought you

770
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,540
escaped by not being at Burning Man.

771
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,040
And now it's back and it's coming at you from every direction.

772
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,260
Wow.

773
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:56,860
Then.

774
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,820
Why wasn't I there?

775
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,640
Prepare for subliminal puzzling evidence.

776
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,560
Radio program.

777
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,180
Information burst.

778
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:03,680
Squirt.

779
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,640
You see, on this show, you're always in an action-packed movie.

780
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,880
Things happen.

781
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,740
Thank you.

782
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,080
Now return to your scheduled programming.

783
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,540
And you're listening to the Ask Dr. Halfer.

784
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,120
Live on radio.

785
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,620
Well, there is no Soviet Union anymore, so we've vanquished them.

786
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,020
Thanks.

787
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,420
All right.

788
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:33,460
You see, on this show, you're always in an action-packed movie.

789
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,820
And there's always parking.

790
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,600
Anything could happen.

791
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,180
There's always parking.

792
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:43,340
It would be interesting to have some kind of puzzling evidence.

793
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,280
Show, and this was offered as a gag.

794
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:46,780
Right.

795
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,000
And now reality, once again, has caught up to what was.

796
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,020
A silly jade back then, just a few short years ago.

797
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,460
Very few short years.

798
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,780
And I couldn't believe it when I saw it.

799
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,600
I mean, but apparently they do pay attention.

800
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,960
I'm sure a lot of humans would like the puzzling evidence.

801
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,800
Channel one, too, because it's unthreatening and, you know, cute and everything.

802
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,460
And I don't think they're necessarily the pampered ones in that, if you think of it,

803
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,540
it's just a channel, I suppose.

804
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,040
Yes.

805
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,100
How much does it change?

806
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,700
What does a channel cost for a month to rent?

807
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,540
A dollar a month or, I don't know.

808
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,020
Well, and what you require is what we call an adapter in the radio business.

809
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,840
Yeah, they're...

810
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,520
You want both channels, do you?

811
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,440
Yeah.

812
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,040
I'll ask the front office about that.

813
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,280
Perhaps we'll see if in time that may be granted.

814
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,100
Can I call customer service?

815
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,060
She doesn't even have the number of this...

816
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,040
Maybe...

817
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,460
Yeah, now you've got one that...

818
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:46,920
Let's call someone from...

819
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,400
Your hearing is important to us.

820
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:48,700
We...

821
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,780
Please stand by.

822
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,980
We can take phone calls here at the Ask Dr.

823
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,760
Hal show, but on the other hand, they're mostly more trouble than they're worth and

824
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,360
interrupt the flow of show.

825
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,140
That's one of the things a great show does is deals with the technical problems without

826
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,040
necessarily talking about it.

827
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,620
You mean this next weekend?

828
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,760
Like the U.S. government, we will function after a nuclear war or a mere earthquake.

829
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,080
Oh, this is good.

830
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,680
This is also...

831
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:20,760
We have given our pledge, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor, and we are coordinated

832
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,100
with the North American...

833
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,360
The North American Civil Defense Council.

834
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:23,620
...the North American Civil Defense Council.

835
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,100
Press it hard.

836
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,480
Push it in all the way.

837
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,540
Yes, push it hard, Peppy.

838
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:27,720
Oh, no.

839
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:27,780
Oh, no.

840
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:34,980
And the little switch on there, she adjusts it in your ears to the way you like it just

841
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,660
to perfect.

842
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,620
Now, you've done it, right?

843
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,460
Performed this incredibly arduous and difficult operation?

844
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,480
The Witch of Kuros by Robert...

845
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,320
And this is, of course, going out over the air.

846
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,380
You can see this, folks.

847
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,520
I usually plug the Ask Dr. Hal show.

848
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,080
But my...

849
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,300
You can see this live version.

850
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,080
Yes.

851
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,840
Live on radio.

852
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,780
At the Darkroom Theater on Mission Street.

853
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,480
Indeed.

854
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,440
Yes, our mission is educational at the Darkroom Theater.

855
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,340
I misspoke.

856
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,760
So you can do something else cool on Saturday night and still come.

857
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:14,280
You'll receive a better listen than the folks back home get, although that, of course, is

858
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,720
optimal, if possible.

859
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,480
Yes.

860
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,340
Well...

861
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:20,940
Anyway, now we can relax, settle back, and enjoy.

862
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,240
But there...

863
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,940
Enjoy our discussion.

864
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,040
Where's the Preacher presentation?

865
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,420
Well, the problem is that...

866
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,660
Now they're ruining the...

867
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,420
Puzzling evidence.

868
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,260
They've made it a TV show, but it's all pulp.

869
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,100
I don't think you can ruin it.

870
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,640
You can...

871
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,900
I've seen two...

872
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,180
...conversify it.

873
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,480
I've seen two episodes of the TV show.

874
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,800
And your opinion?

875
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,740
The first one, barely adequate.

876
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,720
The second one, a terrible disappointment.

877
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,720
So it doesn't really fit that much into the puzzling evidence world.

878
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,160
It almost got it.

879
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,920
It's sort of like a sputtering engine that...

880
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:50,920


881
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:50,920


882
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:50,920


883
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:50,920


884
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:50,920


885
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,500
It doesn't start.

886
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:52,620
Yeah.

887
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,860
I'm surprised.

888
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,860
Maybe they should have done what they did with everything else and start with a movie

889
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,780
and then see if it works.

890
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,760
No, I think they gave away all their story the first episode and everyone went, okay.

891
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:10,360
Well, they had a lot of trouble a while back when Loki burst out of Asgard, but I think

892
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,880
they've got that under control now.

893
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,380
Oh.

894
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,660
But that's all been covered up.

895
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,360
That's a different movie?

896
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,760
They've covered all that up.

897
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,780
Oh, the CIA?

898
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,000
It's called The Avengers.

899
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,920
It's what happened in the movie.

900
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,340
It's a movie about a man in New York.

901
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,440
You don't remember it, do you?

902
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,160
I've got to see these.

903
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,420
Yes, they gave you a memory dusting so you wouldn't remember it.

904
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:26,740


905
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,580
It would be inconvenient.

906
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,020
I know.

907
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,360
I remember taking a test and I couldn't remember anything.

908
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,180
Then Anne said I could go.

909
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,840
Well, at least you got the free show popcorn.

910
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,160
Free to go.

911
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:43,820
Yeah, I got the popcorn and I didn't jump out of the window, so...

912
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,380
Right.

913
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,260
Not this time, but...

914
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:45,420
I had mine.

915
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,560
Did you have yours?

916
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,380
All right.

917
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,980
Vanessa, I've been causing you...

918
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,900
We have been having you.

919
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,720
Yes, we have been.

920
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:54,720


921
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:54,720


922
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:54,720


923
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:54,720


924
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:54,800
Then you gave me the sweetest photo of you, so I knew what you were doing.

925
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:54,800


926
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:54,800


927
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,280
And so do all our brethren.

928
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,320
My brother had to take some of the CIA LSD tests, you know.

929
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:06,420
My very own brother who went to Vietnam came back in one piece, because he went before

930
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,120
the escalation, had to take in Boston.

931
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,480
Some tests that the CIA ordered him to take where they put him in a locked, empty room

932
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,880
and gave him LSD and looked at him through a one-way mirror.

933
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:20,900
That's difficult.

934
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,080
That's the most unfun way to take LSD.

935
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:24,540
Exactly.

936
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,320
And that's why he had a chair and a table.

937
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,700
Well, there's not much you can do with it.

938
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,040
It's a psychedelic chair and table.

939
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,320
Yeah, I can't imagine.

940
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,820
I've tried several times to really get the full story, and I can't get many details.

941
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,380
I don't think he remembers much.

942
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,240
Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story.

943
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,920
I think they paid him $25, he said, something like that.

944
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,600
I've got to find out, though, because I can't imagine how horrible that might be.

945
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,080
Well, you put up with a lot in the service, I understand.

946
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,560
Yeah.

947
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,500
Holy smoke.

948
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,500
You can just experiment on me.

949
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,620
I'm just a guinea pig.

950
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,380
I think it was a volunteer thing, though.

951
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:03,920
Well, yeah.

952
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,780
Yeah, I think it was.

953
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,280
I think he held his hand out.

954
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,200
And he got paid.

955
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:07,500
Yeah.

956
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,980
They paid him.

957
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,220
Yeah.

958
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,200
Speaking of guinea pigs, call in right now.

959
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,000
You know, we'll pay you.

960
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,640
All right.

961
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:15,280
All right.

962
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:16,840
All right.

963
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:16,900


964
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:16,900


965
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:16,900


966
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:16,900


967
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:16,900


968
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,680
Well, that was a joke.

969
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,120
NSA people.

970
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:19,520
Oh.

971
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,460
Whoa.

972
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,640
Star 413 headed northeast.

973
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,040
What, did you stop for drive-thru?

974
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,040
No, which I'm unable to.

975
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,900
It's over in the sun.

976
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,380
Make sure you're hidden in a little drawer under a bath.

977
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,960
Let me take you down.

978
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,140
Okay, you said you want me to turn Michael Pepe off?

979
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,180
Well, not at the present time, but we did want the puzzling evidence to be stopped down

980
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,420
because everyone is somewhat burdened by the repetition.

981
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:54,540
The things like that, just because they're so dumb, are extraordinarily different to pull off in any way that can be aesthetically satisfying.

982
00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:00,940
But so many people have tried lately that there are some of those that are quite creditable in what they do.

983
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,220
And the TV show didn't really have the fire.

984
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,500
Survivors show up.

985
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,160
He's still got something like that.

986
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,260
Yeah, he was there, fortunately.

987
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,620
But I'm not here.

988
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:11,820
Yeah.

989
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,280
And of course, the.

990
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:14,740
Uh.

991
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:14,740


992
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,920
And, uh, and that's it.

993
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,860
I think they go to that place where the soldier heaves the cannon in the bronze statue.

994
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:26,980
Doesn't he feel well?

995
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,380
Or is it the one?

996
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:28,840
Or is he?

997
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,340
Is he the one?

998
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,460
He's trying to think now.

999
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,400
No, he's steering the ship of state, perhaps.

1000
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,780
Well, he is.

1001
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,500
And, you know, because Ed Holmes has the St.

1002
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,460
Stupid celebration there every year.

1003
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,280
It's not just St.

1004
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:44,640
Stupid.

1005
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:49,080
But everyone who crosses the line has to undergo a humiliating ritual at sea.

1006
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,680
You have heard of it, no doubt.

1007
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:57,620
Where one pays a call to the court of King Neptune and his tormenting, uh, myrmidons.

1008
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,160
Really?

1009
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,320
I didn't know it was a one-way trip.

1010
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:08,780
You didn't know if you're a sailor, you go over the line, they're going to paint your ass blue and make you do all sorts of, uh, things far worse than any fraternity initiation.

1011
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:09,440
Yeah.

1012
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,440
Certainly an ancient tradition of the sea.

1013
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:13,900
Yes, indeed.

1014
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:14,640
Well, what do you.

1015
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,080
Remember what.

1016
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:18,380
Old salty dog like you ought to remember a shipmate, eh?

1017
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,160
Considering the voyages we went on.

1018
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,300
You do remember some of those, right?

1019
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,660
Well, which voyages?

1020
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,200
The ones that we went on.

1021
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,220
You and I.

1022
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:28,920
Oh, of course.

1023
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:37,340
You surely remember the one that ended in a slapping contest where you and the girl were slapping each other's face.

1024
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,080
At first playfully and then less so.

1025
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,620
Aboard our ship.

1026
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,800
You remember that one?

1027
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,460
She was confined to a wheel.

1028
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,240
Her and Hedy Lamarr.

1029
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,700
Yeah, there's a few actresses you can look at.

1030
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,140
Just go.

1031
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,420
Well, you know, we were talking about Hedy on the Puzzling Evidence show this morning.

1032
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,520
You ought to get a radio station show or something.

1033
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,800
And her many accomplishments.

1034
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,440
No, she'll be white, but then the next one will be.

1035
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,580
It will be the Puzzling Evidence show.

1036
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,640
And we're on the next one now.

1037
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,180
Red Fox.

1038
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,180
Evidence show.

1039
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:09,740
And there it is.

1040
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,100
Wow, power levels on the red here.

1041
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:11,960
And just like that.

1042
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,100
Okay, that's fine.

1043
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,360
Just like that.

1044
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,460
And the show has begun.

1045
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,500
We're in the middle of the night again.

1046
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,140
We're kind of, we're kind of.

1047
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,340
Who does this stuff?

1048
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,000
It's crazy or something.

1049
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,740
What is that weird noise?

1050
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,200
That's the sound of a spaceship.

1051
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,420
Throttling its control mechanisms.

1052
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,340
Slightly.

1053
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,060
Just enough to stay in orbit.

1054
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,440
Hmm.

1055
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,940
Somewhere in that connection is that white noise.

1056
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,840
But it's, it's so comforting.

1057
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,400
Oh, the white noise.

1058
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,480
I thought you were talking about the pink noise.

1059
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,660
Or the blue noise.

1060
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,320
Good morning.

1061
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:04,780
Fantastic.

1062
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,040
Yes.

1063
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:07,860
Fantastic.

1064
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,180
That's fantabulous.

1065
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:21,600
I had a statistics professor that used to use that term a lot.

1066
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,120
Fantabulous.

1067
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,320
Spooktacular.

1068
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:27,740
Fantastic.

1069
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,680
He would say fantastic as well.

1070
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:44,060
Generally, while he was moving his ponderous bulk across the bay chalk tray on the blackboard,

1071
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:44,440
dragging it around the blackboard, he would say, I'm going to be a fantastic.

1072
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1073
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1074
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:50,620
Dragging the chalk and the, and the erasers and whatever else might be on that chalk tray,

1075
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,200
dragging it off and knocking it onto the floor.

1076
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:02,020
As he moved his way across the massively long formula he was riding on the, on the wall

1077
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,720
there, just to prove, just to prove things.

1078
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,200
He was always saying, this is proof.

1079
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,360
And then he would write a long, long, long formula.

1080
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,040
That we were expected to write down and remember.

1081
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,800
Well not remember.

1082
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,360
Put you to sleep too.

1083
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,120
Hey, wake up over there, buddy.

1084
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,920
You can't do that on the puzzling evidence show.

1085
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,420
What do you think you are?

1086
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,420
Are you doc, Dr. Howe?

1087
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,660
Dr. Howe?

1088
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,120
Where's Dr. Howe?

1089
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:40,800
He's on the show.

1090
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,340
He's on the show.

1091
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,400
He's sleeping on the show.

1092
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,060
That's what he does.

1093
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,380
He's right there.

1094
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,000
So, you've got Dr. Howe hooked up to the show and that's what we get tonight.

1095
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:48,560
Yep.

1096
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,620
He's just going to sleep here.

1097
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,960
He's just hooked up to the show electronically.

1098
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:52,860
Yeah.

1099
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,760
Because of the BART strike?

1100
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,500
Right.

1101
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:59,260
So BART put wifi over the entire city to make up for the strike.

1102
00:49:59,480 --> 00:49:59,620
He's afraid.

1103
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,320
And he's afraid.

1104
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,420
He's afraid.

1105
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,560
Because it's nighttime.

1106
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,420
BART's put the fear in a lot of people.

1107
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,060
It has.

1108
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,180
And they don't know what they're going to do now.

1109
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:10,040
And they're looking out the window now, lonely and afraid.

1110
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,600
And they're eating cold toast with no butter.

1111
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,000
Right.

1112
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,940
And they're gathering at the BART station, but there's nobody there.

1113
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,460
They're just going to stand out front.

1114
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,720
Standing with their little cards out.

1115
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,460
Just with their card out.

1116
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:26,440
They'll have their arm in the air as if they're hanging from a strap, looking at their iPhone,

1117
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:33,740
hoping and wishing that somehow through that symbolic action, they will suddenly appear

1118
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,680
at their place of employment.

1119
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:40,020
If I just emulate how I'm supposed to be, I'm going to be a part of the world.

1120
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:40,160
I'm going to be a part of the world.

1121
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:40,160


1122
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:40,160


1123
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:40,160


1124
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:40,840
I'm going to be a part of the world.

1125
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:40,840


1126
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:40,840


1127
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,940
And that's what I'm going to be when I'm riding the BART.

1128
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:52,020
Maybe that will transcend me into a plane of transitional movement in my mind, unconsciously

1129
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,960
expand my molecular.

1130
00:50:54,100 --> 00:51:00,140
You're starting to sound like a, quote me Bob, 14, justification 214.

1131
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,600
Well, whatever it is that you need to quote to justify is something we need this morning.

1132
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,660
We need your quotes.

1133
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,000
Because your quotes are so fast.

1134
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,220
Quotes are like money to us.

1135
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,000
We use them.

1136
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,060
We make money off of them.

1137
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,920
We say that we said them.

1138
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,480
And we tweet them.

1139
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,540
We tweet them out there.

1140
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:25,140
So send us your quotes so that we can say that we did it and tweet it.

1141
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,080
We'll just tweet the heck out of your quotes.

1142
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,280
And we give all the money to KPFA.

1143
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,060
Sure.

1144
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,720
And we give the other half to Bart.

1145
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,300
We give money to Bart and we don't even write Bart.

1146
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,040
That's right.

1147
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,040
Because we want to help the people just like Bart wants to help the people.

1148
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,300
Help the people get to work.

1149
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,960
But not too much.

1150
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,120
I mean, we'll only have so much to help the people.

1151
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,780
Yeah, I don't want them to do too much work.

1152
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:03,760
I don't want them to have to work so hard that they don't feel like they're not compensated properly.

1153
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,340
And feel like they don't want to help the people.

1154
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,520
That'd be a bummer.

1155
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:09,980
Not the issue.

1156
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:09,980


1157
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,820
Not having people that are supposed to help the people not want to help the people.

1158
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:14,320
Yeah.

1159
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,320
Especially when all the people want to do is get to work.

1160
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,300
They just want to work.

1161
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,680
Just like the Bart people want to work.

1162
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,400
They just want to work for more money just like everybody else.

1163
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,560
Just like Michael Pepe.

1164
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,640
Just like me.

1165
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,880
I like to work less for more money, though.

1166
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,620
It's a little bit of a twist that I put on it.

1167
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,700
Work less for more money.

1168
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,360
Work less for more money.

1169
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,400
That's my slogan.

1170
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,020
Yeah, yeah.

1171
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:43,840
I agree.

1172
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,520
Work less and less for more and more.

1173
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,360
Less and less for more and more.

1174
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,320
That's a good slogan, I think.

1175
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:52,860
Yeah.

1176
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,220
Especially for 10 minutes till 4 in the morning.

1177
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,080
Yeah, if that's where you are.

1178
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,560
You should not be working.

1179
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,320
And you're thinking, yeah, it's 4 in the morning.

1180
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,520
Less work, more money.

1181
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:09,080
And if you're working right now at 4 in the morning, I would implore you just to sit down.

1182
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,080
And don't do anything for the next 5 minutes while you're on the clock.

1183
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,180
Tell them I told you that.

1184
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,240
Say, that guy on the radio told me to do that.

1185
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:25,500
When he says, when your boss says, hey, how come you're just sitting around?

1186
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,600
You're supposed to be screwing that nut on that bolt.

1187
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,020
How come you're not doing your job?

1188
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,940
Because that guy on the radio told me not to for 5 minutes.

1189
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,720
That's what you should say.

1190
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,820
And he'll go, oh, okay, I got you.

1191
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,180
All right.

1192
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,020
Well, hang in there.

1193
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,340
Thanks for being honest.

1194
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,180
And obey your radio.

1195
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,700
Obey your radio.

1196
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,940
Always do what the radio says.

1197
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,460
Especially the puzzling evidence show radio show.

1198
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,200
Where we say show in the title at least twice, maybe sometimes thrice.

1199
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:00,460
Yeah.

1200
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:08,080
Just so people understand, don't get confused and drive off into the barge of the column that holds up the barge train.

1201
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,160
Because that would make things even more confusing.

1202
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:09,440
Even worse.

1203
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:15,200
Or not only that, they might even drive onto the barge track thinking they're a barge train and try to start carrying people.

1204
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:15,580
Yeah.

1205
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,320
Come on, everybody.

1206
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,020
Let's oops.

1207
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:17,420
Yeah.

1208
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,280
What a nightmare.

1209
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,820
They'll just drive their bus onto the barge track.

1210
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,060
Their home, their RV.

1211
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,400
They'll drive their RV onto the barge track.

1212
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,900
Because people always try to help.

1213
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,120
People try to help.

1214
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,220
And they try to improvise where they can.

1215
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:36,220
And what a barge, an RV is a lot like a barge train if it's on the track.

1216
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,500
That's the important distinction there.

1217
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,420
It's got to be on the track.

1218
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,480
And the rims would send up lots of sparks.

1219
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,320
It would be really pretty and really helpful.

1220
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,700
It would be great and helpful.

1221
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,740
And the people on the barge that are on the barge track.

1222
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,340
They would understand.

1223
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,400
That are waiting for the barge train that's never come.

1224
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,840
They'll be so happy.

1225
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,260
Because they're going to be hungry and they're trying to get some food.

1226
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,320
They want to get some food they can put on their people.

1227
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,420
On their people.

1228
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:00,140
Yeah.

1229
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,060
And they would say, look, everybody, the barge is coming.

1230
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,460
I can get food on my people.

1231
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,500
I can get food on, put some food on my people.

1232
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,160
I'm trying to then.

1233
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,360
I've been trying to put food on my people and Bart won't help me.

1234
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,600
But now they do.

1235
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,240
And I'm glad.

1236
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,520
Bart is helping.

1237
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:15,880
I'm glad.

1238
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,680
Yes, we are all glad that Bart is helping.

1239
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,460
And you are helping Bart by driving on the tracks.

1240
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,920
And putting food on the people.

1241
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:23,540
Yep.

1242
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,560
Because people with food on them is good.

1243
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,360
They would ride the Bart if you're driving on the tracks in your RV.

1244
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,760
Because they would trust you.

1245
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,500
They would say, thank you, substitute Bart.

1246
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,680
And they'd say, good morning, sir.

1247
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,740
Where's my dog?

1248
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,200
We're happy.

1249
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,360
We're happy that we don't have to stand out front wishing and hoping that Bart was open.

1250
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,580
We're happy that you've taken up the slack.

1251
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,960
You've actually, you know, done some improvising here.

1252
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,900
You've been thinking outside the box.

1253
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,700
You've been thinking outside the circle too.

1254
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:04,720
Been thinking outside somewhere that we can't even put a description on.

1255
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,900
Been thinking outside the amorphous.

1256
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,680
Unnamed area.

1257
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,360
And there you said, good morning, too many times.

1258
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,580
Way too many times.

1259
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,380
Really?

1260
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,380
Is that what happened?

1261
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,700
Yeah, but the important thing is, we support you.

1262
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,240
Whoever you are.

1263
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,160
And whatever your endeavor is.

1264
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:35,740
You got the support and the, well, not the endorsement.

1265
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,620
We can't actually give you an endorsement.

1266
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,360
You'd have to pay us a lot of money to do that.

1267
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:46,440
And we can't take money or talk about taking money or even things that have a cost.

1268
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,380
Beyond currency, we cannot go.

1269
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,500
Yeah.

1270
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,840
We would just rather think about nut bits.

1271
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:55,800
We're going to start charging nut bits.

1272
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,700
Or nut nuts.

1273
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,320
Bit nuts.

1274
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,200
What nut, what, gubnets?

1275
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:02,860
Guvments?

1276
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,340
20 guvments of slack is how much we're going to charge.

1277
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:07,780
Yeah.

1278
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:10,920
We're going to charge 20 guvments of slack.

1279
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,080
Can you pay your 20 guvments of slack?

1280
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:13,740
It's a lot.

1281
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,200
I know it's a lot to ask.

1282
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,660
I wouldn't ask it if I didn't think you could do it, though.

1283
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:23,720
If you didn't think you had it in you to reach down to the bottom of your bootstraps and

1284
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:30,500
pull yourself up by your own petards, standing in the air like that, hoisting yourself.

1285
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,460
Hoist away, I say.

1286
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:36,160
The Puzzling Evidence Show is here to help.

1287
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,300
We'll hold those petards.

1288
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:38,480
We'll hold them.

1289
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:38,480


1290
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:38,480


1291
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:38,480


1292
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:38,480


1293
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:38,480


1294
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:38,480


1295
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:38,480


1296
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:38,480


1297
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:38,480


1298
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:38,480


1299
00:57:38,480 --> 00:58:08,480


1300
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:38,480


1301
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,680
No, they won't hear you.

1302
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,480
We'll tour the air.

1303
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,980
Just go by .

1304
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:53,300
No time to waste.

1305
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,100
I'll get their nênub

1306
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,920
保thol

1307
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:03,700
He's going to come down.

1308
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:04,000
Oh!

1309
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,040
We're going through the corners.

1310
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,360
There we go.

1311
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:07,820
1, 2.

1312
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:07,820


1313
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,240
There with.

1314
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,260
Why, it's 4 a.m.

1315
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,340
On the Puzzling Evidence Show.
