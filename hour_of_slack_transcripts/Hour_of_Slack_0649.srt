1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,860
Oh, it's the farm for the whole of the...

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,360
No!

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,920
Stay.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,960
Douglas, you stay here.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,580
Yes, I will stay among you, my children.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,100
You stay with us.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,400
I will stay with you.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,940
And he will be back, too.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,540
For all you early morning listeners who are up with the chickens, here's the farm report.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:29,880
Goodbye.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,860
Brought to you by Bob's Feed and Grain Storage of Dobstown.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,860
Soybean futures continue at the market rate while most animal feeds are up today.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,020
Hog futures continue to look pretty dismal, but that's what you should expect if you're a hog.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:52,800
That's because most farm-dwelling parkers know the end of the line is food around the corner for somebody else's breakfast table and maybe even yours.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,360
Because if you have four legs, hooves, or trotters, and you live on a farm,

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,980
if it isn't the grim reaper,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,220
it's the international harvester.

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:03,980
And now this.

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,540
We were talking about...

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,320
It's the subgenius show.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,100
Yes, if you weren't aware of what's been going on, then you're probably just the sort of person to listen to the subgenius show,

22
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,980
the indefinitely long, infinitely boring corridor of horrible horticultural and biocultural...

23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:36,700
This is the voice of radio subgenius, bringing to the greater Bay Area the unadulterated,

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,580
infrapulated vocal incarnation of the sub-divine epistemology of subgenialism.

25
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:48,160
I'm your host, Dr. Howell, and during the next hour and a half, Mobius Rex and I will chair the open forum of subgenial issues.

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,380
Yes, it's so exciting I can hardly stand it.

27
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,320
How about you, Mobius?

28
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,700
Yes.

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:57,700


30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,320
Welcome.

31
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,160
Welcome to Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slang.

32
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,340
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

33
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,200
Doctors, scientists, who might understand what Moreau was trying to do.

34
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,260
Perhaps they could develop a serum, stop the regression.

35
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:21,740
No.

36
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,000
No more scientists, no more laboratories, no more experiments.

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,780
I thought you would be able to understand that.

38
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,440
We have to be what we are.

39
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,860
Not what the father tried to make us.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,880
Subgeniuses.

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,880
To go on two legs.

42
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,640
Very hard.

43
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,800
Don't get it, buddy.

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,040
It's a tail, baby.

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,600
Maybe four is better.

46
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,740
I'm happier than the morning sun.

47
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,380
That's the way it'll always be.

48
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,800
Ever since the day you came inside of me.

49
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,040
Oh, my.

50
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:30,820
Johnny could only sing one note, and the note he sang was this.

51
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:39,040
Children, if you have not opened your heart to the god of solid rocket boosters,

52
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,260
we invite you now to search your emotions and your soul.

53
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:55,880
And come forward and open your heart so that we may stick our little fuse in there and light it.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,960
It feels good.

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,820
Astronaut report, it feels good.

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,560
It feels good.

57
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,360
It feels good.

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,160
It feels good.

59
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,900
It feels good.

60
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,560
It feels good.

61
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,340
Astronaut report, it feels good.

62
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,660
T-minus 20 seconds, Antoni.

63
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,660
Guidance in journal.

64
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:16,020
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 11, 12, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,580
3, 2, 1.

66
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,260
I wish I was a spaceship.

67
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,600
I wish I was a spaceship.

68
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,120
Actually, I am.

69
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,580
I'll fly you around the universe.

70
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,220
I'll fly you around the universe.

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,480
Yes.

72
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,820
Here we go.

73
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,860
On July 5.

74
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,520
Go second.

75
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,020
Yes.

76
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,740
I'll live above the sky.

77
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,800
I'll live above the sky.

78
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,640
My heart will be a fireball.

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,900
Yes, a fireball.

80
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,900
Every time I gaze into it.

81
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,020
Every time I gaze into it.

82
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,660
Every time I gaze into your starry third eye.

83
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,900
We'll make the path to Jupiter.

84
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,440
And maybe very soon.

85
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,920
And maybe very soon.

86
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,540
We'll land our little tootsies.

87
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,320
And walk around the moon.

88
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,700
With our little moon billies.

89
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,480
Get our little moon nights.

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,960
And go off to Mars.

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,280
Yes, and it'll be a fireball.

92
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,280
A free fireball.

93
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,800
And you will be mine.

94
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,900
Me, in the years of the fire.

95
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:17,920


96
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,200
The Psych Eats.

97
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,900
1998.

98
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,600
It's a new and fresh and practical.

99
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,580
It's a new and fresh and practical.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,540
It's a new and fresh and practical.

101
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,140
It's a new and fresh and practical.

102
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,360
It's a new and fresh and practical.

103
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,420
It's a new and fresh and practical.

104
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:45,700
It's a new and fresh and practical.

105
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:45,780
It's a new and fresh and practical.

106
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:45,780


107
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Oh, oh, oh.

108
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,760
Oh, oh, oh.

109
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,500
Out to play.

110
00:06:49,680 --> 00:07:01,140
But you know, when I'm feeling blue, I just want some of you.

111
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,860
Oh, it's a beautiful day.

112
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,340
And I don't care what the big boys say.

113
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,340
With a little bit of color in my mind.

114
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,860
I'll make it just all the time.

115
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:40,620
But you know, when I'm feeling blue, I just want a piece of you.

116
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,840
Oh, what can I do?

117
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,240
A piece of you.

118
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,700
What is a poor girl to do?

119
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,120
When I call you up.

120
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,640
When I call you up.

121
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,920
Oh, yeah.

122
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,460
Oh, yeah.

123
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,380
But you know, when I'm feeling blue.

124
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,500
I just want a piece of you.

125
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,040
Oh, oh, oh.

126
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,900
Oh, oh, oh.

127
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,260
Oh, oh, oh.

128
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, oh, oh.

129
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,720
Oh, oh, oh.

130
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,780
Oh, oh, oh.

131
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,980
Oh, oh, oh.

132
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,540
Oh, oh, oh.

133
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,240
Oh, oh, oh.

134
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,560
Oh, oh, oh.

135
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,080
Oh, oh, oh.

136
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,760
Oh, oh, oh.

137
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,740
Oh, oh, oh.

138
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,840
Oh, oh, oh.

139
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh, oh, oh.

140
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,740
I love you.

141
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,300
I love you.

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,380
Excuse me, my English is not that good.

143
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:15,740
I love you.

144
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,640
In fact, you'll love this show we've got coming up.

145
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,260
It's got some new material in.

146
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,900
This is the new combustible Edison in the background.

147
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:33,580
This new CD, The Impossible World, featuring our own brother Cleve Duncan as a member of the band on keyboards.

148
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,200
We have Hemroy Rogers coming up.

149
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:44,180
That's an old hour of slack band, of tards, that you'll remember, even if you've never heard them before.

150
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,180
And what we just heard before this was Polycarp from Whifflefish.

151
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,160
I'm going to give you, they're kind of a negative land-like band.

152
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,340
We'll have some negative land coming up, too, by the way.

153
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:05,000
But Polycarp's CD, this The Magnetic Moment, we just played when I'm feeling blue.

154
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,600
And Whifflefish Records and Polycarp are available at, got that pencil ready?

155
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,040
P.O. Box 33566.

156
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,800
Oh, it's time to go back on combustible Edison to cut four, I think, yes.

157
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
20th century.

158
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:32,980
Friends, Whifflefish, P.O. Box 33561, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27636.

159
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,140
27636, therefore, Polycarp, the negative land-like cut.

160
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,280
They used to be also known as...

161
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,540
Sonic Rape and Pillage.

162
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,020
What was it?

163
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,780
Remember, we're all sitting together listening to this.

164
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:00,500
And I'm sorry, friends, I am on, I did have a, I did have my snot amputated yesterday.

165
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:06,280
I really do have 15 yards of packing material crammed up my nose, and I'm on strong,

166
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,920
but very effective painkillers and narcotic drugs.

167
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,080
So that said, I should probably proceed on.

168
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,500
We're with rest of show.

169
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,700
We have tonight's continuation of Reverend Susie the Flusie's beautiful slack collage.

170
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,420
We have Einstein's Secret Orchestra, of course, with Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Chaz Smith,

171
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,900
the amazing Michelle on violin, Princess We Are, No Bleepo Abernethy, yours truly,

172
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,900
and sometimes Friday Jones.

173
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,260
We definitely have some Friday Jones coming up.

174
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,240
We have some KPFA with puzzling evidence of Dr. Howell.

175
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,000
We've got Dr.

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,540
Legume and Ed Strange, because we're doctors, my friend.

177
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,720
Perhaps someday we can bring one of them back to help you.

178
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,520
Yes, that's all we want to do is help you, my friend.

179
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,740
Because God loves you.

180
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,240
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,520
You missed out.

182
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:14,940
You missed out.

183
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,260
You missed out.

184
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,260


185
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,260


186
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,500
Not me.

187
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,960
Not me.

188
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,160
I won't grow up.

189
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,440
I won't grow up.

190
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,900
I don't want to wear a tie.

191
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,300
I don't want to wear a tie.

192
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,620
And a serious expression.

193
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,960
And a serious expression.

194
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,320
In the middle of July.

195
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,980
Crumb, crumb, JV.

196
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,440
So you come out, and you draw, and you say, bam, bam, stop.

197
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,360
And it got it and stopped.

198
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,060
Then you move up to the head, and you put one right there, and that's usually final.

199
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,480
What?

200
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,460
Get that spear away from me.

201
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,080
Thank you, Carr.

202
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,780
Thank you.

203
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,940
Can you hear what I'm saying?

204
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,260
Can you see the heart that I'm carrying?

205
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,460
LOL, I recommend to come on and play

206
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,060
Don't remind a Spider-Man of who I'm meaning

207
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,640
Yeah.

208
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,520
Oh, man, if you've got a prairie squid, I'll give you everything.

209
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,420
No, I can do it.

210
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,900
I could do it for nothing for you.

211
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,640
Yeah, that's what they all say.

212
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,000
No, I swear I will.

213
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,960
I heard that over at Dave Alley.

214
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:51,020
I was wandering down Lonesome Cowboy Dave Alley where it's nothing but buildings that look like Lonesome Cowboy Dave Head.

215
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,640
And all the people that wander up and down the street look like Lonesome Cowboy.

216
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,560
And they're lonesome.

217
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,640
And they're cowboys.

218
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,200
And they sing.

219
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,580
They go to the wig shops and they can command prairie squids with their minds.

220
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,880
Yeah, I've been there.

221
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,580
I've been in that hole, man.

222
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,220
I'm telling you, I've been down there and I tried to yank myself out.

223
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,860
What's it do?

224
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,940
Keep dark depression, man.

225
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,420
A lot of people just don't get out.

226
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,480
It takes a lot more than St. John's Wards, you know?

227
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:24,680
I'd like to buy the world a home and furnish it with Bob.

228
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,080
It's a real thing.

229
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,200
Bob.

230
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,760
Bob.

231
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,360
Bob.

232
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,080
Bob.

233
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,080


234
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,340
Bob.

235
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,300
Bob.

236
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,740
Bob.

237
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,540
Bob.

238
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:34,860
Bob.

239
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,380
Bob.

240
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,820
Bob.

241
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,140
Bob.

242
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,620
Bob.

243
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,340
Bob.

244
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:39,780
Bob.

245
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,040


246
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,460
Bob.

247
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:40,460


248
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:40,480


249
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:40,660
Bob.

250
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,120
Bob.

251
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,560
Bob.

252
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:41,560


253
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:41,560


254
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,120
Bob.

255
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,120


256
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,120


257
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,940
Bob.

258
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:42,940


259
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:42,940


260
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:42,940


261
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,080
Bob.

262
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,320
Bob.

263
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,340
Bob.

264
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:48,680
Bob.

265
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:48,980
Bob.

266
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,180
Bob.

267
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,700
Bob.

268
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:49,960
Bob.

269
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,020


270
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,580
Bob.

271
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:50,840
Bob.

272
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:50,900


273
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,660
Bob.

274
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:51,920
Bob.

275
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,780
Bob.

276
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,040
Bob.

277
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,600
Bob.

278
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,180
Bob.

279
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,180


280
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,180


281
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,840
Now, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella.

282
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:57,980
Yes, sir.

283
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,200
Maybe this is a good idea, a chance for us to have a little talk.

284
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,940
Why, sure, Dad.

285
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,400
What's cooking?

286
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,960
Remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob?

287
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,480
Yeah.

288
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,760
Yeah, I remember, Dad.

289
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,120
No.

290
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,940
Oh, here's a match. Your pipe's gone out again.

291
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,700
Well, thanks.

292
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,600
But when a doctor speaks of the male organ, he...

293
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,820
Well, he calls it a...

294
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,740
When a man and a woman are married, Bob,

295
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,080
they love each other very much.

296
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,640
And in showing their love,

297
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,900
their instinct is to embrace each other as if...

298
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,920
Well, as if to try to become the one person God intended them to be.

299
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,160
They're the sperm, as the doctors call it.

300
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,620
Yeah. Is that the seed that helps make a new baby?

301
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,720
No, no, Bob.

302
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,520
Well, what I'm talking about now is the fluid

303
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,700
that contains the sperm formed in two little sacs beneath the penis,

304
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,860
which we call the...

305
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,120
Oh, but, Dad, why do fellas get these feelings before they get married?

306
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,200
That's a good question, Bob.

307
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,580
Why do you ask, dear?

308
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,380
Well, there were some drawings in Bob's textbook.

309
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,600
I didn't mean to look at them honest.

310
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,460
Well, then some of the older girls, well...

311
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,060
You mean they...

312
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,160
No, no, no, no.

313
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,540
They talk about things sometimes?

314
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,460
Well, yes.

315
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,840
Only they stop when they see me coming.

316
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,260
I am to come, I was.

317
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,180
I am to come, I was.

318
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,560
I am to come, I was.

319
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,920
I am, I am, I am to come, I was.

320
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,240
I am, I am, I am to come, I was.

321
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,760
I am, I am, I am to come, I was.

322
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,480
Both male and female races

323
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,040
both male and female races

324
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,880
combine to form the scrotum.

325
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,800
See that clitellium grub flying overhead?

326
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,380
So does the scrotum.

327
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,140
With a flick of his neuroglia, he

328
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,180
has obtained his lifetime supply of organic carbon.

329
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

330
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,140
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

331
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,900
Women are just like the tide.

332
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,880
They come in as fast as they go out.

333
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,780
But koala beers are forever, and the rest is preserved on film.

334
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,280
Oh, all this talk is making me hot.

335
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,140
Me too.

336
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:15,960
Me too.

337
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,020
Your mother would give me the devil

338
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,040
if she were home and saw me horsing around with you this way.

339
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,220
Yeah.

340
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,200
Golly, Dad, did I hurt you?

341
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,780
You know, your mother would give me the devil

342
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,420
if she were home and saw me horsing around with you this way.

343
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:25,700
Yeah.

344
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,980
You know, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella.

345
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,340
Oh, sure, Dad.

346
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:30,840
What's cooking?

347
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,360
It's good.

348
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:31,940
Oh, yeah.

349
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,040
You mind if I smoke in your room?

350
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,280
Yeah, Bob.

351
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,660
Bob.

352
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,200
Bob.

353
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,360
Hot dogs.

354
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,360
Hot dogs.

355
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,340
Yeah.

356
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,160
Oh, man.

357
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,120
There's a chorus of homeless little ladies singing out

358
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,580
the window.

359
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,840
It's slinky, it's slinky.

360
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,660
For fun, it's a wonderful toy.

361
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,920
It's slinky, it's slinky.

362
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,760
It's fun for a girl and a boy.

363
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,760
It's fun for a girl and a boy.

364
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,860
They're fun for a girl and a boy.

365
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,720
For girls and boys.

366
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,400
First of all, I felt flippant all over me.

367
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,000
I felt soggy and slimy like greasy fried chicken.

368
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,040
And I could tell there was marine life present

369
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,340
because of that pungent odor.

370
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Uh, caller, caller, do you have a point to make?

371
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,500
Some call it freedom.

372
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,800
I call it black.

373
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,180
Black freedom.

374
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,860
It's all the same.

375
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,940
I am your father.

376
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,540
I am your father.

377
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,240
I am your father.

378
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,760
I am your father.

379
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,660
Bob will have thousands of followers.

380
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,720
You've got to believe me.

381
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,440
They torture me.

382
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,000
They torture me.

383
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,980
You've got to believe me.

384
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,740
They torture me.

385
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,320
They torture me.

386
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:04,780


387
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,860
I'm singing Bob.

388
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,680
Bob will have thousands of followers.

389
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,840
Bob will have thousands of followers.

390
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,980
Your membership pop.

391
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,540
What's that?

392
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,300
Put that sticker on your car so you won't get any tickets.

393
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,480
And this other one keeps paramedics from stealing your wallet while we're working on you.

394
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,640
Oh, and don't bother calling 911 anymore.

395
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,060
Here's the real number.

396
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,540
Ooh.

397
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,240
999.

398
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,420
Now, I know that somewhere, someplace, there might be a group that would say,

399
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,280
Oh, no.

400
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,720
It's 999.

401
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,020
Do you know what this means?

402
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,060
No.

403
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,060
The wedge is a great club and can save you a lot of strokes if you learn to use it correctly.

404
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,880
How about a few pointers?

405
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,800
Oh, Bob, that's what you're here for.

406
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,720
All right, Dal.

407
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,180
Here goes.

408
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,100
We'll switch you to the 16th tee, where we will show you in slow motion,

409
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,420
Arnold Palmer, U.S. Opium Champion.

410
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,920
Who say great hangout wounded?

411
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,020
With grief and shame weighed down?

412
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,780
Now, toy police are rounding.

413
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,340
With us, our only crown.

414
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,580
My God, what is it, Julie thought.

415
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,380
Then one of them grabbed a loud halo and called to her.

416
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,640
You ought to get out of the car and run to us when I tell you.

417
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,220
You understand?

418
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,680
And do not look back.

419
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Do not look back.

420
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,080
Now, run.

421
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,700
Julie pushed open the door, slid out, keeping as far from the roof as she could, and ran.

422
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,140
Only a few yards, just 20 at the most, she ran and turned and screamed and screamed.

423
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,300
Oh, my God.

424
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,880
She is screaming still in her madness, but always inwards in horror and pity for herself and her David.

425
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,100
But what she saw when she turned was a man crouched on the roof of the car,

426
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,260
dressed in that uniform that means prison or asylum universally.

427
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:57,560
A man smiling at the bloody head that he was gently banging up and down, up and down, up and down.

428
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,720
He said, you mean you want that creature's head?

429
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,140
He said, because I made the oath, I'm going to give his head.

430
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
And when he chopped his head off, they chopped his head off.

431
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,960
And they took it up there in a little tray called a charger.

432
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,380
It's the same thing as a little tray you'd go out and get a hamburger, a soft drink in.

433
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,480
And they brought that head.

434
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,980
And they brought it in there to that old woman.

435
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,020
And here she was.

436
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,620
And she looked at that head with those eyes open and that blood oozing out on that tray of that head all over it.

437
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,400
And she said, here it is.

438
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,300
Shut up, Mama.

439
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,280
We got the head.

440
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,200
Hey, we got a reward.

441
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,540
The head is cool.

442
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,060
It's a big, scary rock.

443
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,940
Hey, man, don't bang up the head.

444
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:39,000
This ancient talisman is every subgenius' guarantee that triumph shall be ours.

445
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,580
For it is nothing less than the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

446
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,880
Arnold Palmer is a clone, children.

447
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,680
A fake reproduction of this head.

448
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,940
Solar equinox.

449
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,160
When the planets are in alignment, the mighty head is launched according to strict ritual

450
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,600
before cheering multitudes of pilgrims.

451
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:10,200
And the peace that the head shall bring is true peace and the ushering in of the new era

452
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,980
of endless intoxicating revelry and total carnal satiation.

453
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,440
Times like that, the wedge is a mighty useful weapon.

454
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,380
Right?

455
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,020
That's right.

456
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,160
The wedge is a very versatile club and accurate, too.

457
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:36,040
Bob, how about the wedge as a pitching club to be used, say, 15 or 20 yards off the green?

458
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,800
That drive must have been, oh, at least 300 yards.

459
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,920
Somewhere around there.

460
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,600
I know it was in dead center of the fairway, and it puts you in a perfect position to win that championship.

461
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,140
Sometimes you get a little lucky, you know.

462
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,360
I think that's a little more than luck, Bobby.

463
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,880
Tell us what you concentrated on just to put that drive in the middle of the fairway and with that much distance.

464
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,560
Early day.

465
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:55,940
Money.

466
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,300
Money day.

467
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,140
I'm meeting many friends here about to receive a gift.

468
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:10,660
Ahh, my money bonus big enough and we grant the winner the Golden 4 piece golf club backwood.

469
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,720
Be viewer scissors.

470
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,320
40?

471
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,860
We solemnly commemorate the martyrdom of the prophet herald of our faith called Bob.

472
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:34,600
And in today's program, we're going to deal with the story of the Bob's martyrdom and the events surrounding it.

473
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,000
Wow!

474
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:47,020
On that blistering July summer day, there were the barrels of 750 rifles awaiting the command to fire and take the Bob's life.

475
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,500
He seemed so young to die, barely 30.

476
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,160
He was a handsome, gentle, and confident man.

477
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,840
Could he possibly be guilty of the shocking crime of which he was accused?

478
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,600
You deliver sermons like this, it's a wonder you're still an ordained minister.

479
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,720
Or are you?

480
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,360
The best kind.

481
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,400
Angry, rebellious, critical, a renegade.

482
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,100
Stripped of most of my so-called clerical powers.

483
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,860
But I'm still in business.

484
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,440
Well, you seem to be enjoying the punishment.

485
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,160
Punishment?

486
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,560
Ha ha, the church has left me, that's what it's done.

487
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,400
You people.

488
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,380
You people.

489
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,140
You people.

490
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:25,960
You people.

491
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,540
I am retired.

492
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,120
I am retired.

493
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,980
I am retired.

494
00:25:53,480 --> 00:26:01,420
Physical, mechanical, cultural, sociological, mentally aroused, hypocritical, political, Geocentric, military,อน

Thank you.

503
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,980
Thank you.

504
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,860
I'm just so pleased that you're enjoying the product.

505
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,020
I'm so sausage.

506
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,220
Lard.

507
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,060
Lard.

508
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,640
Where are we going in the wilderness, lard?

509
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,000
Because you can't see nothing but your own new feet.

510
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,400
Wait, wait.

511
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,660
Turn the lard light over that way.

512
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,900
More towards him.

513
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,540
Lard.

514
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,840
I can't see it.

515
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,420
Higher, higher.

516
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,400
I can't see it anymore.

517
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,480
I can see it.

518
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,900
There it is.

519
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,260
Is somebody cooking bacon?

520
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,900
No.

521
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,660
It's tufts of fat burning.

522
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,760
Oh, no.

523
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,320
That's my son.

524
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:21,920
Why is he burning?

525
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,720
No, no, no.

526
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,120
It's just simple people lighting simple lamps.

527
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,800
Simple folks like you and me.

528
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,860
With the fat of the calf of the land.

529
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,520
Awaiting the voyager's return.

530
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,100
I can see the processional leading off into the distance.

531
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,620
I'm coming.

532
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,520
I'm coming, lard.

533
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,020
I'm coming right into the lard.

534
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,220
It's ishtistic.

535
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,780
Let's not whip this any further than we can.

536
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:53,280

No parking,

541
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,460
by the suicide,

542
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,540
hot dog,

543
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,320
my razor broke,

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,960
water dripping up the spout,

545
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,880
but I don't care,

546
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,120
let it all hang out.

547
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,280
Hanging from a pine tree,

548
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,020
by my knees,

549
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,320
sunshine through the shade,

550
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,960
nobody knows what it's all about,

551
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,820
too much man,

552
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,360
let it all hang out.

553
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,800
So I made,

554
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,020
walking upside down,

555
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,340
my TV's on a blink,

556
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,440
make Galileo look like a boss cat,

557
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,340
sorry about that,

558
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
let it all hang out.

559
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,580
Round, round,

560
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,520
the slack bull bob,

561
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,720
the bob down in the saucer roll,

562
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,840
round, round,

563
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,680
the slack bull bob,

564
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,540
the bob down in the saucer roll.

565
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,300
I'm coming,

566
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,220
I'm coming large,

567
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,320
I'm coming large,

568
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,960
I'm coming large,

569
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,780
I'm coming,

570
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,760
I'm coming large.

571
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,960
But you want to know who you are,

572
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,860
and why you're here,

573
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,860
and where you're going?

574
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,600
The hunger and thirst that the human heart has,

575
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,740
is satisfied by killing.

576
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,840
Coming to the Lord.

577
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,660
The Lord is with you.

578
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,520
He's with you.

579
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,180
The dog is to believe.

580
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,540
I'm coming right into the Lord.

581
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,480
He's with you.

582
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,860
When you run away from Bob,

583
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,140
Bob will come before you.

584
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,280
When you try to hide from Bob,

585
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,520
Bob is everywhere.

586
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,560
When you turn to face Bob,

587
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,700
Bob shall take you from behind like a little boy.

588
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,980
And when you run away from Bob,

589
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,880
you shall run into the arms of Bob.

590
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Bob is all around you.

591
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,480
Bob is beneath your feet even now.

592
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,680
Bob is ramping over your head even now.

593
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,680
When you reach out your hand,

594
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,420
it is Bob's hand that reaches.

595
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,500
When you smoke that pipe,

596
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,720
it is Bob that smokes through you.

597
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,260
When you run away from Bob,

598
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,260


599
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,320
Bob still lihat,

600
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,380
cause' probably he knows you're dead.

601
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:06,440


602
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,740
You must go.

603
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,100
Get cold feet.

604
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,100


605
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,100


606
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,640
no buildings.

607
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:20,640


608
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:20,880
No walkertowns.

609
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,020
No water.

610
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,020


611
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,220
No nog mem Yi.

612
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,220


613
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,480
No b marema武 blender.

614
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,440
No snack mix.

615
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,040
No reptile sores.

616
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,540
No chicken soup.

617
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,460
No meat dairy.

618
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,280
You know what?

619
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,500
Let the fool come forward.

620
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,460
There will be many vague things that will happen.

621
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,300
Silence!

622
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,200
You do not know what is the way of Magathul.

623
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,180
Magathul?

624
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,160
Yeah, Magathul. No, not again.

625
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,540
Magathul has warned you.

626
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,780
Those who trespass in his domain must perish.

627
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,400
You have to do that again so we can have the echo.

628
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,940
And Magathul said,

629
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:02,580
Let them who defy me be punished to the full extent of the divine law.

630
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,800
We'll add the video later there for the punishment part.

631
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,980
They shall be boiled in the black tars of his shining fire.

632
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,200
All right, Hal, do a read over and dissolve into the monster.

633
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,060
There we go.

634
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,940
He prowled the sea of agony, the lumbering creation of an errant god.

635
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,020
When you dissolve out, when you get reheated in that newsletter,

636
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:24,920
you're dead.

637
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:30,540
You will find out that all heaven is is a giant solar energy collector.

638
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,220
That's right.

639
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,740
Jesus, God, and Jehovah represent the collective of God.

640
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,040
We call God the galactic obliteration device.

641
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,420
That is a unit that comes down to destroy all individuality,

642
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,780
to destroy any sort of thought that is anything different from the will of God.

643
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,360
You ask a question.

644
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,620
What is sin?

645
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
What is spirit?

646
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,760
They'll tell you.

647
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,360
Uh-oh.

648
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:55,960
Uh-oh.

649
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,140
Uh-oh.

650
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,840
And if they know what they're talking about,

651
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,700
they'll tell you sin is anything that's in disobedience to God's will.

652
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,280
What the hell is God's will?

653
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,400
The Bible tells us God said thou shalt not kill.

654
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,460
Then God turned around and said,

655
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,920
Moses, poor little girl, five kingdoms of Midianites,

656
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,520
man, woman, child, beast.

657
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,220
That's right.

658
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,120
And Moses was rattling out.

659
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:20,860
That's right.

660
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,740
Then the Bible says,

661
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,380
Jacob, I want you to go out.

662
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,880
In his own哈哈哈.

663
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,000
You want me to ног down the alright?

664
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,000


665
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,820
Jacob, you don't have to jog down that one.

666
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:52,360
On course.

667
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,360


668
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,360


669
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,360


670
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,360


671
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,660
You're then chicken.

672
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,100
No, so who didn't the myself?

673
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,100


674
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,320
That, this time I aspiration

675
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,340
I understand the enemy.

676
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,700
Where?

677
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:53,940
Check it.

678
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,780
I just told you another bathroom

679
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,220
I can't go to the bathroom

680
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,280
Cause I'm already in the bathroom

681
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,140
In the bathroom

682
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,920
I'm already in the bathroom

683
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,760
In the bathroom

684
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,700
I'm already in the bathroom

685
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,660
Bathroom

686
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,440
If you want to go

687
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,800
To the bathroom

688
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,240
When you're in the bathroom

689
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,980
You go to another bathroom

690
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,780
Let's go to Melba in Dallas. Melba!

691
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,840
Oh, hello Steve. God bless you.

692
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,540
Thank you.

693
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,360
I'm having trouble hearing.

694
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,360
I'm calling you for the music.

695
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,600
Oh, turn down.

696
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,840
Alright, how's that?

697
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,180
Oh, I can hear you just fine now.

698
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,620
Alright, good. How can I help you dear?

699
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,180
Well, I need prayer for my grandson

700
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,800
And I'm concerned about

701
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,140
What's his name?

702
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,340
Um, Jesse.

703
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,080
If Jesse was saved and filled with the Holy Ghost

704
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,360
He'd turn out a little better, wouldn't he?

705
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,040
Well, I don't know if he's saved or not.

706
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,160
I said if he was saved and filled with the Holy Ghost

707
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,560
He'd be doing a lot better, wouldn't he?

708
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,580
Well, I believe so.

709
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,800
Let's pray for him, okay?

710
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,360
Amen.

711
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,540
Father, we agree with his grandmother

712
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,520
Yes, Jesus.

713
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,340
For Jesse.

714
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,860
Thank you, Jesus.

715
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,540
Bring him to the cross.

716
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,000
Lord, let him not outrun this prayer of his grandmother.

717
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,960
Yes, Jesus.

718
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,460
But bring him to the cross of Jesus.

719
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,080
Yes, Jesus.

720
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,180
Grant him repentance.

721
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,520
Let him be saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and power

722
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,200
Living a Christian life.

723
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,260
Oh, yes. Thank you, Jesus.

724
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,240
Your servant. Make him your servant, oh God.

725
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,320
Yes, your servant.

726
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,580
Make him your servant.

727
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,780
Thank you, Jesus.

728
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,600
Thank you, lady.

729
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,680
All right.

730
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,680
She got the victory there or something.

731
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,700
Something moving.

732
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:12,580
The number you have dialed, 666, has been disconnected.

733
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,580
666 has been disconnected.

734
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,120
The number you have dialed...

735
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,880
Is the same as the number today.

736
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,360
Tell me.

737
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,000
Yes, we have the wrong number.

738
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,280
Are you sure?

739
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:46,040
I am Vargine.

740
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,280
I am vargine's wife.

741
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,460
Turn the echo down.

742
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,060
You could make money on that thing.

743
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,900
Wait, hold on.

744
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,140
Quiet.

745
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,500
The seagulls are outside.

746
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:52,960
Wait, listen.

747
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:53,960
Cool.

748
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,820
Oh, you can't really hear it.

749
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,080
They're all out there, right out the window.

750
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,960
They're going, ah, ah, ah.

751
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,160
Outside the radio station?

752
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,020
Hey, you've been watching too much H-Pack.

753
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,360
No, no, they're there.

754
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,060
Yeah, he can hear the ocean roaring.

755
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,500
He's going to get his eyes pecked out.

756
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,260
He thinks he's a bird.

757
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,220
I've been in that studio, and it's not, you can't see the light.

758
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,960
You can't even see the light from there.

759
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,700
You missed the one day when the Canadian soldiers were really in there.

760
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,700
Yeah, there must be some fish on the ground or something.

761
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:24,680
There was like, the walls were covered with, literally, with mosquito-like characters.

762
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,520
Thousands of them.

763
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,060
I mean, the walls were just like thick with them, and people thought we were screwing around,

764
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,360
but it was like something out of the omen or something.

765
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,180
Where is it?

766
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,400
In the studio here.

767
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,000
If you leave the window open, too, it will fill up with spiders.

768
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,260
These big, huge spiders.

769
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,980
Well, you guys are up on like the ninth floor, right?

770
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,360
Yeah, there's many spiders on Rhodes Tower.

771
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,020
All the way to the top.

772
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,580
How about that?

773
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,320
A few bats.

774
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,640
A few bats, yeah.

775
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,300
But mainly spiders.

776
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,140
Mainly spiders.

777
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,040
Spiders.

778
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:53,740
Spiders.

779
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,380
Spiders.

780
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,260
You're not going to believe who just flew in through the window.

781
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,060
It was the Red Witch.

782
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,260
Wait a minute, did she actually come into the...

783
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,700
She actually just flew in through the window.

784
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,400
She's a real...

785
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:05,960
The Witch.

786
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,460
I was with the seagulls.

787
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,160
She was with the seagulls.

788
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,400
She was with the seagulls.

789
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,520
She was that...

790
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,480
I'm not...

791
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,360
See, I wasn't lying.

792
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,720
I told you I heard the seagulls flying out there.

793
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,460
No!

794
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:16,500
No!

795
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,920
She flew in and then she turned into the princess.

796
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:26,440
Well, Princess Wee, could you possibly explain all this white stuff that has splattered all over my hair?

797
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,220
Ever since you came into the studio.

798
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,640
Plasma.

799
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,280
Yes, it's alien smegma, actually, but don't tell anyone.

800
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,600
Well, that's good.

801
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,100
Let's cook up some pot.

802
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,220
1138 suffering severe sedation depletion, which requires mind block and arrest.

803
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,300
Mind block!

804
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,000
Mind block!

805
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,740
Every witch wave!

806
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,720
Oh, will you help me?

807
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,800
Can you help me?

808
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,920
You don't need to be helped any longer.

809
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,420
You've always had the power.

810
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:56,640
Power.

811
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,340
You've always had the power.

812
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,480
You've always had the power.

813
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,660
You've always had the power.

814
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,340
You've always had the power.

815
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:01,700
You've always had the power.

816
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,080
You've always had the power.

817
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:07,100
There were things around us and about us of which I can render no distinct account.

818
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,140
Things material and spiritual.

819
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,520
Heaviness in the atmosphere.

820
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,540
A sense of suffocation.

821
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:14,980
Anxiety.

822
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,680
And above all, that terrible...

823
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,120
A terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly living and awake.

824
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,420
And meanwhile, the powers of thought lie dormant.

825
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,180
Sometimes you feel like a ghost.

826
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,540
Sometimes you don't.

827
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,940
I wish I could avoid that, but...

828
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,120
Here we are.

829
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:35,700
It's unavoidable.

830
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,740
Remember.

831
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,180
It's absolutely unavoidable.

832
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,800
Remember.

833
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,920
Remember.

834
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,420
To do that is more.

835
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,600
We're sitting together listening to this.

836
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,040
Whoever listens to this, I would say, is doomed and cursed.

837
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,520
And...

838
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,460
What's the difference between being cursed and accursed?

839
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,740
It's just like a vow instead of you or something?

840
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,200
I think, no.

841
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,020
I think they're the same.

842
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,120
They may not be fully conscious or aware of what they're doing.

843
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,380
For example...

844
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,140
For example...

845
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,500
Say that someone has...

846
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,900
Having a flashback.

847
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,580
Is a wonderful sort of...

848
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,380
A wonderful thing.

849
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,960
Call that a flashback again.

850
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,700
We call that a flashback again.

851
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,100
Oh, it was so terrible being there at Brushwood.

852
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,500
You know, it was just so bad.

853
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:17,500


854
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:17,500


855
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:17,500


856
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:17,500


857
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:17,500


858
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:17,500


859
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,600
You know, having it all not happen.

860
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,140
And, gosh...

861
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,880
Oh, it was so awful having all those naked,

862
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,740
butch-sotic babes tar and feather me

863
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,760
and then wash me off again afterwards.

864
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,440
Right.

865
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,980
Yeah, bummer.

866
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,820
Yeah, and...

867
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,520
Those other people that got to stay home.

868
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:39,280
Well, it's always best to stay home and turn on the television.

869
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,720
Right.

870
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,980
If you do that, you know that you're...

871
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,980
Well, you pretty much know what you're gonna get.

872
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,720
Like 20 hours a day, if you can.

873
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,260
Don't you notice, my love?

874
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,600
We don't publish that.

875
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,800
We're gonna do it again.

876
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,240
Well, how...

877
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,420
Wait, there's...

878
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:53,740
California.

879
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,360
For the...

880
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:54,920
California.

881
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,800
We think I'm a man.

882
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,960
You're the ocean.

883
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,580
The tarts will be here soon.

884
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,960
And they'll be hungry.

885
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,140
Why do you have a bunny clean in your eyes?

886
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,080
Why is there fish in your mouth?

887
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,600
I'm pretty sure you are the tart.

888
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,620
You are the tart.

889
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,740
You are the tart.

890
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,440
You are the tart.

891
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,960
Why do you have that bunny clean in your eyes?

892
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,020
Take that dog out of your mouth.

893
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,860
Now I know you are the tart.

894
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:47,520


895
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,020
Well, she's strange girl...

896
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,480
Too bad, gee.

897
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,480
Well, I'm pretty sure.

898
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,580
They know democratic dollars really don't matter.

899
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,280
They don't care how you behave.

900
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,260
For aestones in that mouth,

901
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,060
animals need a crack.

902
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,140


903
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,140


904
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,060
But dexamethasans,

905
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,540
I know that makes no sense.

906
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:12,540


907
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:12,600
They are.

908
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:12,660
Get lost.

909
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:12,660


910
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:12,660


911
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,260
Why rocks back?

912
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,020
I don't even quite know tourist views.

913
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,520
Some dunks will get me shocked.

914
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:15,940
Gordon Kutcher

915
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:15,940


916
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:15,940


917
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:15,940


918
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:15,940


919
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,280
Pfft.

920
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,440
Cor diesel.

921
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,220
Blessed people, you gotta go.

922
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,260
Blessed people, you're such a drag.

923
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,220
Take a day and walk around.

924
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,860
Watch the Nazis run your town.

925
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,860
Then go home and check yourself.

926
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,640
You think we're singing about someone else.

927
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,160
Blessed, blessed people.

928
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,980
You gotta go.

929
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,680
Blessed people, you're such a drag.

930
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,160
You see a neon moon above.

931
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,800
I searched for years and found no love.

932
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,040
I'm sure that love will never be

933
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,420
a product of plasticity.

934
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,580
I'm sure that love will never be

935
00:43:59,580 --> 00:43:59,580


936
00:43:59,580 --> 00:43:59,580


937
00:43:59,580 --> 00:43:59,580


938
00:43:59,580 --> 00:43:59,580


939
00:43:59,580 --> 00:43:59,940
a product of plasticity.

940
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,500
Oh, yes, dear friends.

941
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,200
I suppose now, before the second dose

942
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,780
of painkillers kick in, I should give credits.

943
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,360
Friends, that lovely last piece was by Regan's politics.

944
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,000
It's her very first album.

945
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,040
Hope Sternodonk's on bass there.

946
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,000
And the incomparable astronaut body hollering away

947
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,160
on the Frank Zappa tune, Plastic People.

948
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,980
Friends, we've heard three tunes tonight

949
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,740
by Hemeroid Rogers.

950
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,060
And I'm going to give you an address for Hemeroid Rogers.

951
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,600
He's the fellow and the group that sings about tards.

952
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,840
We heard I Am Retarded.

953
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,200
I Am Retarded.

954
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,680
You Are the Tard.

955
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,140
And what was the other?

956
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,240
There was another lovely.

957
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,060
Well, anyway, the address for Hemeroid Rogers

958
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:05,860
is you can write to Erie Materials at P.O. Box 420816.

959
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:12,740
That's Box 420816 in San Francisco, California.

960
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,180
941-4208.

961
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:16,180


962
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:23,480
And it is fortuitous that we also were able to hear some Melba.

963
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:30,400
Yes, Melba's phone militia from her prank call album, Sonic Damnation.

964
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,060
Actually, Melba is our friend Brother Russell here in Dallas.

965
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,920
But you can write for information about these from Mind Control Records,

966
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,160
1487 West Fifth Avenue.

967
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,760
That's...

968
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:52,860
1487 West Fifth Avenue, Suite 205, Columbus, Ohio.

969
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,140
43212.

970
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,040
Let's see, I also gave you the address of Wifflefish.

971
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,300
We still have some negative land coming up.

972
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,040
And there was, in fact, in the background,

973
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:10,800
Combustible Edison, currently from their new album with Brother Cleve on it,

974
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,840
The Impossible World.

975
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,200
And friends, before I forget,

976
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,900
I should mention that this is, of course,

977
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,320
the Hour of Slack voice of the Church and the Subgenius.

978
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,240
And for more information on everything else we do,

979
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,480
of course, always write to Bob.

980
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,420
Hour of Slack, Church and the Subgenius.

981
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,640
Any of those things at...

982
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:38,020
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

983
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:43,140
Once again, with a mile of packing material crammed up my nose

984
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,400
after my deviated septum surgery,

985
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:54,020
I can tell you once again, it's Bob at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

986
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:59,020
And now, back to, uh, Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

987
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:05,080
P.O. Box 81555, Cleveland, 44181.

988
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:05,640
Thank you.

989
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,880
Why do we always assume that...

990
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,680
you know, they'll have limbs and a head?

991
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,840
We think in terms of arms, legs, feet, heads.

992
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,460
What if it's...

993
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,000
corporeal, but not in a way that we understand?

994
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,200
You mean...

995
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,820
You mean something less substantial than this earthly meat we walk on?

996
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,200
Well...

997
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,960
Someone meat-like, but who's undergone more of an alchemical transformation.

998
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,280
You're saying someone with a stone literally buried inside their own esophagus,

999
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,560
or perhaps someone who's passed the Albedo phase?

1000
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:43,140


1001
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,640
Or else perhaps the very geat itself is the way that...

1002
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,400
the light of...

1003
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:55,080
our Lord and our Savior shines through the church window.

1004
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,300
Yes, but I... I'm not... I can't accept it.

1005
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,480
I... I'm not ready.

1006
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,520
I... I've wanted to come.

1007
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:07,960
A spacecraft will come down, and we'll walk on board that craft,

1008
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:13,000
and they'll take these bodies from us, and issue us the ones that...

1009
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,120
and issue us the ones that...

1010
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,400
belong to that level so that we might begin service.

1011
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,480
No, don't even make me go into my eigenstance.

1012
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,000
Well, yes, but...

1013
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,560
No, I'm not gonna...

1014
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,000
Well, but you see, uh...

1015
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,920
Jehovah's...

1016
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,100
The pudding...

1017
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,360
The Moose...

1018
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,140
The pudding in my song...

1019
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,120
represents the underlying...

1020
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,180
Sure.

1021
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,860
The underlying hatred of all humanity for itself.

1022
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:42,380
And the cake surrounding the pudding represents the hope...

1023
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1024
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,780
...of a better life on another planet,

1025
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,580
which is why 39 cultists killed themselves...

1026
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:49,940
Huh?

1027
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,460
...for the hope of a better life.

1028
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,620
Mm-hmm.

1029
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:57,460
So you see, Bundt cake, my friends, with the pudding tunnel...

1030
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,080
Yeah, I...

1031
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,280
...represents the Hale-Bopp comet...

1032
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,400
Right, okay, we're all gonna hear about this at the event...

1033
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,880
...which the UFOs reside behind.

1034
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:04,020
...to our songs.

1035
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:04,840
Hmm?

1036
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,260
No, go ahead.

1037
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,460
A saint, a pope...

1038
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,220
We have so many popes, it's ridiculous.

1039
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,060
But our popes have the power...

1040
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,380
...that other popes would die for,

1041
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,900
and that is the power to fail.

1042
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,460
They have slack.

1043
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,200
They are...

1044
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,640
Bob is not what you'd call a brilliant religious leader.

1045
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,740
He has...

1046
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,060
I don't know why you say that.

1047
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:26,880
...a lucky religious...

1048
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,020
Well, I mean, just look at him.

1049
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,700
Don't look at him too long.

1050
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,180
He is lucky.

1051
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,960
That's why we call it the church of the subgenius.

1052
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:40,460
You don't need brains or money, really, if you have luck,

1053
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,580
if you have slack.

1054
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,640
I'll give you slack.

1055
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,020
I'll give you slack.

1056
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,220
I'll give you slack.

1057
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,820
I was this close to telling Bob no to getting set up with my own 900 line.

1058
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,080
Hope you guys know what you're doing.

1059
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,600
Because it took a tragedy like Jonestown to finally get this thing moving.

1060
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,820
If we lose our momentum and we have another Jonestown,

1061
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,800
well, that's your responsibility, isn't it?

1062
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,100
If Jim Jones could talk 900 people into killing themselves,

1063
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,720
we could talk 900 people into sending us a dollar.

1064
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:12,620
Don't run your hand in and try to rupture something.

1065
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,600
I'm not a Satan just yet.

1066
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:19,040
I might be, I'm full of it, but I'm going to let it go.

1067
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,260
Hey, Bob.

1068
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,540
I said, where you going with that pipe in your hand?

1069
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,200
Going down to smoke some frap.

1070
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:38,300
You know I found it in Dobbstown land.

1071
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,840
Take him to Malaysia and wait for me.

1072
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,180
Send me your postcard.

1073
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,720
Douglas, stick my heads in the sack and get them posted back to their widows.

1074
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,780
And get me addresses right this time.

1075
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,420
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1076
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,060
This time, friends, we will do it.

1077
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,300
Thank you, Susie the Floozy friends.

1078
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:08,580
Sister Susie the Floozy did this collage we've been listening to here for our special Slack show.

1079
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,520
We've also heard tapes from the Lucifer.

1080
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,600
We've heard some of the Ferian Liberation Front from X Day.

1081
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,480
We've heard some KPFA, Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence.

1082
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,200
And we've heard some Friday Jones.

1083
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:27,560
And now we're going to hear some Ed Strange and a doctor like you.

1084
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,680
Shut up!

1085
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:34,500
We just got back from doing a little preaching in a little town called Austin, Texas.

1086
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:42,500
Damn, if there aren't more religious nuts in Texas than anywhere else on the planet.

1087
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,920
Absolutely amaze me, quite frankly.

1088
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,760
Yeah, it was like going to the monkey house at the zoo.

1089
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:58,080
There they were, down on their knees, all praying and whining and wailing and begging for salvation.

1090
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,900
And we lied to them all.

1091
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:09,320
You know, and it's not even that they would be so dumb as to A, believe in an invisible monster,

1092
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:12,480
and B, his little half-breed son, you know.

1093
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:12,480


1094
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,320
And Jesus, I can almost understand that.

1095
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,000
But what really cheeses me off is when they find out you're not one of them.

1096
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,200
So they decide that they're going to save you by praying for you.

1097
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,220
And in essence, what they're saying by the fact they're saying, I'm going to pray for you,

1098
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,620
they're saying, you are inadequate.

1099
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,160
You are substandard.

1100
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,560
You are not capable of saving yourself.

1101
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:40,180
I will make myself feel better and feel important by praying for you and thus saving your eternal soul

1102
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,460
from a damnation and an abomination.

1103
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,220
Afterlife that I have invented in my own mind.

1104
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,700
How superior can you get?

1105
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,520
That is okay. It doesn't mean you're a monster.

1106
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,200
Just don't tell anybody, or you're going to be ridiculed.

1107
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,040
Or you're going to be ridiculed.

1108
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,620
Who would want to wake up in the woods?

1109
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,060
I'd rather be one of the victims that's tortured.

1110
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:07,120
But they, if they, you know, if I don't act as a torturer, they'll torture me.

1111
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,560
Right. Yeah, you'd be one of the tortured ones.

1112
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,620
There's only two ways about it.

1113
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:12,740
Torture would be tortured.

1114
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,340
Yep. It's damn shame.

1115
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,900
But that's the way it is. It's evolution. It's nature.

1116
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,380
So, I am the more creative leader than you.

1117
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,820
And so forth.

1118
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:22,560
Mother Earth.

1119
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,600
Especially pigs. I'm sorry.

1120
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,720
Whatever happened to live and let live?

1121
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,200
See, that's the female viewpoint right there coming out.

1122
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,860
And it's not a very lubricated socket tonight, is it?

1123
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,020
It just seems like, no, that's not the answer.

1124
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,000
The answer is a worldwide holocaust.

1125
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:43,480
Well, it's either live and let live or a worldwide holocaust.

1126
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,300
Which are we going to have?

1127
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,920
We have to decide tonight, boys.

1128
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,380
Well, you said you...

1129
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:51,440
Should we just flip a coin or should we go ahead and say, yeah, life.

1130
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:53,260
Positivity.

1131
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,760
Or should we just go, nah, screw it.

1132
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,940
Entropy, negativism, death, the end of all things.

1133
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,860
I don't know. I'm sure... What do you think?

1134
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,460
Well, when you had your fight, you had your fight.

1135
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,580
You were the evangelicals for love.

1136
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,780
And then there was... What was the group?

1137
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,480
Well, the holocaustals.

1138
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,160
The holocaustals.

1139
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,140
But, you know, even though...

1140
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:18,960
But so we put it together.

1141
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,460
Well, I have to be fair, though.

1142
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:30,220
You know, even the conservatives and the holocaustals in their own way are pro-life and pro-flat and pro-squirt.

1143
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:37,540
But like, Chad and I started this wing we call the Ivancostics, which is a little bit of fusionary elements of both.

1144
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,840
It's like, well, we love everybody, but, you know, like, blank you.

1145
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,300
You know what I mean?

1146
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:51,080
Well, actually, there was a guy that came up on stage and he said, anybody who joins either one of these groups hasn't paid any attention to what they're both saying.

1147
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:58,680
If you're a real subgenius, you'll be not an evangelical or holocaustal, but an effuminical.

1148
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,080
Effuminical.

1149
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,940
The effuminicals.

1150
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:05,480
Well, Ivancostic is good, too, because it makes you sound like you got a, you know, wise mouth and stuff.

1151
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,520
You know, caustics like me and Chad.

1152
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,880
I mean, I've never mind.

1153
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,840
Who says physics is no fun?

1154
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:22,920
That big famous grin on Al Einstein's face as he peddled his frail physique around in circles was just for fun.

1155
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,320
Hey, big brains may settle for simple diversions, but laymen want more.

1156
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,500
And at the black hole tube of trans reality, they want more.

1157
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,160
Hey, got more.

1158
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,080
Hi.

1159
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,400
Is there any toilet paper in here?

1160
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,320
Hi.

1161
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,220
I'm Eddie Idle here in a black hole tube with my band.

1162
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,300
Hey, say hi, idlers.

1163
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,840
Hi, idlers.

1164
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,180
Ah, that's stupid.

1165
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:57,100
You know, black hole tubes are the kind of fun only radical physics can provide.

1166
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,360
But dumb Al never dreamed it could be like this.

1167
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
Hey, don't push that.

1168
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,520
That's color control.

1169
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,020
Oh, my God, you're so funny.

1170
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,020
How do you like the view?

1171
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:07,360
I like the view.

1172
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:07,480
I like the view.

1173
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:07,480


1174
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:07,480


1175
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:07,480


1176
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:07,480


1177
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:07,480


1178
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:07,480


1179
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:07,480


1180
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:07,480


1181
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:07,480


1182
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:07,480


1183
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,080
Hey.

1184
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:10,700
Hey.

1185
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,420
Turn the gravity down.

1186
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,800
Yes, atomic manipulations have come a long way since Al reverted to atoms.

1187
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:32,860
In 1981, Fridotronics Laboratories succeeded in creating a micro scale artificial black hole and the electro molecular shield material capable of containing it.

1188
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:37,460
Quite by accident without in any way expecting it, they happened to stumble upon a black hole tube.

1189
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:37,460


1190
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:37,460


1191
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,780
They were able to pull it across some of the most important secrets of the universe.

1192
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:46,860
These astonishing subatomic breakthroughs allowed us to harness the tremendous transformational

1193
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:53,760
energy of these tiny artificial black holes to create the most advanced form of user defined

1194
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,820
fantasy realization the macro world of entertainment has ever seen.

1195
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:16,740
And what will you see in a black hole tube of trans-reality?

1196
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,460
That's up to you.

1197
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:22,300
That's the hot, cool thing about this quantum leaping interactive amusement.

1198
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,980
X-rated!

1199
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:27,900
Yeah!

1200
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:37,380
But, but, but, but black hole tubes are also observer-activated.

1201
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,580
Full of all the potentialities you can dream up.

1202
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,120
So, hey.

1203
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,600
Hey, Slick, shut up, huh?

1204
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,520
I'll let my music come for me.

1205
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,640
Let's go, boys.

1206
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,760
A solo trip lets you create the ultimate personalized adventure

1207
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,940
packed with your very own perfectly tailored fantasies.

1208
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,860
Or go with a group for an unpredictable mix of everyone's brain waves.

1209
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,100
So, hey.

1210
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,680
Whether you like your fun, safe, and sane,

1211
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,460
or be honest,

1212
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,180
on the pale,

1213
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,700
the experiential perimeters are all in your head

1214
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,820
at the black hole tube of trans-reality.

1215
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,140
Big brains have more fun.

1216
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,700
Your tube is raised.

1217
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:29,120
Big brains have more fun.

1218
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:34,280
It's the kind of unpredictable fun only radical physics can provide.

1219
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,560
Make it work for you.

1220
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,980
This is incredible.

1221
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,560
The black hole tube of trans-reality is a Tritotronics quantum amusement system.

1222
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,900
I've heard stories from everybody about what it's like, and I want to go too now.

1223
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:55,380
Well, thanks to Negative Land, Happy Heroes, the name of that CD,

1224
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,380
this is Polycarp, and good night.

1225
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:06,540
Breathe in spirit, breathe in mind, breathe in mind, breathe out tropics.

1226
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:06,540


1227
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:06,540


1228
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:06,540


1229
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,400
Now, no further than

1230
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,740
alone, double put Fei.

1231
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:20,160
Welcome to a carried on camera.

1232
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,260
Boo!

1233
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:20,680
God.

1234
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,380
Gettin' the gas, eye on it.

1235
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,700
Banana, get outta the effectively dead shit,

1236
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,200
oh, good work you.

1237
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,960
Getting котором Went.

1238
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,920
The UH Pitwoman.

1239
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,740
She's the smaller version of Will tyser.

1240
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:33,700
What about the مشary?

1241
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,460
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we're close.

1242
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,520
Please leave your comment.
