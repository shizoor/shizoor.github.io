1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
From PR News in Washington, I'm described as a person of interest.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:10,980
Meanwhile, President Trump says White House officials says Pierce Horst says Trump offered PR to gag the victims and their families.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,720
Everyone at every level of government.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,680
That's PR's suspicious reporting.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,420
The Dow is 10-24-7-24.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,860
It's unclear when President Trump plans to announce this is PR.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,920
Boys and girls, your attention please.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,600
Presenting a new exciting radio program featuring the thrilling adventures of an amazing and incredible personality.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,520
The Self Genius.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,140
Power of Swag.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,260
Abnormal Perversion.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,400
Oh yes, dear friends, thank you Mr. Fernandez and Andy Lemur for the titles and news.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,900
And tonight, we're continuing the epic two-parter call-in show with the...

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,880
The resurrected Lonesome Cowboy Dave and myself, Reverend Stang.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,740
But first, well friends, we survived the Texas deep freeze of 2022.

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,540
I may have saved Texas, although I'm not sure that's good.

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:26,340
Now, we were pretty traumatized on this exact date last year when the temperatures in north-central Texas stayed around 10 degrees Fahrenheit or colder for days.

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,860
And millions...

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,040
Millions of us, including everyone at Stang Ranch here, were without power, heat, or water for days.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,380
It was really miserable.

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,900
Hundreds died, mostly of stupidity, like burning furniture indoors and suffering carbon monoxide poisoning.

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,960
Our house's plumbing was saved because we lived in Cleveland for decades and knew to leave all the faucets running.

23
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,900
This year, friends, I was smart and spent 500 bucks on a general...

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,020
A generator.

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,080
And some space heaters.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,240
However, I was also stupid and didn't order them soon enough.

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,360
In fact, they probably won't be here until tonight.

28
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,440
But the fact that I spent all that money prevented the winter storm from being so disastrous.

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:26,640
If I had not spent that 500 bucks, there would have for sure been terrible rain, sleet, and ice knocking out power stations all over the state and wrecking the infrastructure again.

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:40,340
By my spending that money, however, subgenius sympathetic magic kicked in, making my purchase suddenly pointless, simply by preventing much worse weather.

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:49,200
As Dr. Uncle Onan Canabite said, rival cults put the simp in sympathetic magic.

32
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,780
The Church of the Subgenius practices pimp-aesthetic magic.

33
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,460
Anyway, I saved millions of lives of Texans.

34
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,800
Again, whether this is actually a good thing, that's debatable.

35
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,400
Anyway, we dodged a bullet.

36
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,440
Ted Cruz...

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,320
Oh, thank you, thank you.

38
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,360
Thank you, my fellow Texans.

39
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:25,040
Ted Cruz is probably in Cancun again, but he probably also set up a life-size stand-up photo of himself next to a window in his Texas house.

40
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,160
To fool reporters.

41
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,160
Anyway, we're fine.

42
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,980
The snow and ice is melting away.

43
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:43,320
And the fact that I have this expensive 5,000-watt generator sitting on my porch should prevent my having to actually use it, maybe forever.

44
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,260
I have to credit Reverend Pease for the theory about the generator purchase stafing off its own necessity.

45
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,120
Another bright idea.

46
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,680
Reverend Pease had was that we should make Hour of Slack exclusively available only on Spotify.

47
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,740
Then sit back and watch heads explode.

48
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
Very funny, Reverend Pease.

49
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,160
The dogs and cats are all okay, as is Wee Ma Ma, age 92.

50
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,320
Princess Wee's getting some help since her mom is technically in hospice now and the government pays for daily nurse aides.

51
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,100
Once it knows you probably won't be needing them for much longer.

52
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,100


53
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,020
And in other news, business is terrible.

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:40,300
We raised the ordainment kit price for the first time in 20 years by 10 bucks, which apparently is way too much.

55
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,640
Subgenius.com.

56
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,420
But enough of this.

57
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,300
You don't want to hear any more of this.

58
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,980
You want to hear me read the beginning of our newly published subgenius mystery novel by Reverend Teeters LaVerge.

59
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,980
Called The Agent and Mr. Dobbs.

60
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,080
The recording is not new.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
And yet here it is.

62
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,280
I have a manuscript here.

63
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:16,160
This was turned in by Reverend Teeters LaVerge of the Church of the Subgenius.

64
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,640
He's been, well, I'll just read it.

65
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,980
The title is The Agent and Mr. Dobbs.

66
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,880
And actually the manuscript is from October 1962.

67
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:40,080
But these papers were found on the body of a transient party clown in the city of Albany, New York in 1989.

68
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,700
The papers had been meticulously taped back together after an apparent attempt at shredding them.

69
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,280
Some pages are missing.

70
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,960
The party clown was determined by the county coroner to have been killed by a police officer.

71
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,280
He was killed by being force-fed copious amounts of silly putty.

72
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:11,660
Some of which still had a cartoon imprint of a pleasant yet disturbing face of a smiling man with a pipe clenched between his teeth.

73
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,100
Now here is the manuscript.

74
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,720
As I said, this is from 1962.

75
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,300
So you'll have to forgive some of the dated terminology used by the agent who wrote this.

76
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:32,620
I'm skipping over a part where he was dropped off at the Dobbs house or mansion.

77
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:43,700
The knocker on the huge oaken front door was a rather heavy, rusty iron piece in the shape of a dollar sign.

78
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,580
I banged it down thrice and awaited an answer.

79
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:54,280
Soon the door creaked open and in front of me stood the tallest colored man I have ever seen.

80
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,280


81
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,460
Even taller than Agent 541.

82
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,020
However, he had a very high, squeaky voice that resembles a certain cartoon mouse.

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,280
He asked me my business and I replied that I had an urgent appointment with Mr. Dobbs.

84
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:19,760
The man answering the door seemed fairly out of it too and replied back that the sky was pretty damn blue today.

85
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,260
Again, I had to wait a few minutes until he asked me my business.

86
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,700
But before I could answer, he was ushering me into the cavernous building.

87
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,620
Once inside, I noticed that it was rather well-appointed with both new and antique furnishings,

88
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,780
which to my eyes seemed to come from all corners of the earth and were set about in no discernible pattern.

89
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,900
There were piles of paper and stacks of money everywhere.

90
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,740
What caught my eye, though, was the incredible amount of junk laying about the place.

91
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:59,100
This Mr. Dobbs, it would seem, had a habit of collecting useless objects found by the side of the road.

92
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,840
Finally, after walking through many hallways, I was shown to a door and told to walk in.

93
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,200
But I was expected.

94
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,740
I did as told.

95
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,060
The room I entered was the most sane that I had so far seen.

96
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,580
A typical den that any well-cultured man may have in his home.

97
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,720
Mr. Dobbs was sitting in a large leather room.

98
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,680
He was wearing a leather armchair with his back to me, a billow of smoke coming up from his front.

99
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,460
I slowly walked over to him.

100
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,820
He said nothing, but with his right hand he motioned me to sit on a folding metal chair adjacent to him.

101
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,380
He seemed to be engrossed in a television program.

102
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,600
It was Leave It to Beaver, a wholesome program.

103
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,060
Suddenly he began to speak.

104
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,080
I do love this show.

105
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,600
That Ward Cleaver is one relaxed man.

106
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,740
Connie doesn't like me to watch this program.

107
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,440
She thinks it's pornographic, but that's why I like it.

108
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,580
He fell into a deep silence, intently watching a commercial and nodding his head in time with the jingle.

109
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,900
When the commercial ended, he turned to me and asked,

110
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,940
What can I do for you, young agent?

111
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,240
I noticed then that even though the upper half of his body was clad in a dark suit with white shirt and dark tie,

112
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,180
the bottom half of his body was clad only in wingtip shoes.

113
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,960
I thought that was very disturbing and put me off for a moment,

114
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,340
but I'd been warned by my handlers that this Mr. Dobbs had many tricks up his sleeve,

115
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,320
and I took this as his way of making a person uncomfortable.

116
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,640
I regained my composure and told him,

117
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,660
Mr. Dobbs, the agency I work for has a request for you.

118
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,520
When suddenly Mr. Dobbs got up out of his chair and walked over to a well-appointed wet bar

119
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,160
and poured a tumbler full of what he claimed was the finest scotch,

120
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,700
saying it was from Malaysia or Canada.

121
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,500
My memory begins to get hazy here.

122
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,860
It was not scotch at all. It smelled like grape,

123
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,220
but tasted for the life of me like gasoline.

124
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,840
He bade me to drink.

125
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,860
Knowing that he's an important partner, I tried to force down a sip.

126
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,220
Then Mr. Dobbs did the strangest thing.

127
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,520
He started to do what I believe is called a hula dance,

128
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,560
yet he was humming some tango to himself.

129
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,620
Even though I was warned,

130
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,180
I can't abide a half-naked man dancing in front of me.

131
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,740
Yet I was transfixed.

132
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,980
I know now that I must have been drugged.

133
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,120
He danced for a while, too close to me for my waning comfort.

134
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,720
My heart beat faster,

135
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,640
and the rank smoke from his pipe seemed to make my head swim and my vision fade.

136
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,720
I thought I was about to faint when my heart nearly burst

137
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,700
as I felt a pair of hands starting to massage me.

138
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:59,660
I looked up to see a beautiful blonde with a perfect perm smiling down on me.

139
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,660
I took this to be his wife, Connie.

140
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,680
She said,

141
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,480
Don't fret. Bob likes to dance on Fridays.

142
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,100
She continued,

143
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,300
Now, now, dearie, we mustn't mess with our company.

144
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,720
Mr. Dobbs ignored her and continued his lewd dance.

145
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,700
Connie bade me to ask Bob what questions I may need to ask.

146
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,880
I started out by getting straight to the point,

147
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,620
reminding him of the troubles with Cuba.

148
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,540
Mr. Dobbs then did the queerest thing I'd seen him do yet.

149
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,680
He ran over to a big wooden box on the bar,

150
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,700
opened it, and pulled out a huge novelty cigar.

151
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,360
He then proceeded to insert said huge novelty cigar up his...

152
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,800
...neither port.

153
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,640
The cigar spontaneously ignited,

154
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,680
and Mr. Dobbs blew smoke rings out of his ear.

155
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:57,340
Surely this was an illusion or a hallucination from my drugged state.

156
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,580
I found myself mesmerized by Mr. Dobbs' antics.

157
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,480
Connie's back rub and the scotch I found myself taking a liking to.

158
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,800
Connie's hands reached down to my lap

159
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,640
as I watched Mr. Dobbs preach about economics and Cuba and war

160
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,800
and how it all tied together,

161
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,420
all the while bent over with a huge cigar puffing away in his...

162
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,680
...netherworld.

163
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,320
That is the last I remember of that evening.

164
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,000
The ensuing lie detector tests and truth serums have borne that out.

165
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,820
I awoke the next morning, late, I believe,

166
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,780
with a cool breeze fluttering through pastel pink curtains.

167
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,380
I had the worst hangover I'd ever experienced.

168
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,940
I cannot fully describe the sensation.

169
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,820
It was somewhere between getting a root canal and the high of three martinis.

170
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,680
I was startled to notice that Connie had died.

171
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,220
Connie Dobbs was nude, lying next to me.

172
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,200
I tried getting up but soon regretted it by the dizziness it caused.

173
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,360
And worst of all, I saw what was laying next to Connie.

174
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,360
All I saw was its shoulders and a cheap, bouffant wig on its head.

175
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,680
Its skin was grey.

176
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,820
I don't mean sickly human grey.

177
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,420
I mean grey as grey can be.

178
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,900
Its body shape was all out of whack too.

179
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,760
Then I had fleeting memories of a wild sexual encounter with Mrs. Dobbs

180
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,560
and something else.

181
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,500
I remember having intercourse with orifices that were not human.

182
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,000
I must have shuddered for Connie rolled over and picked up a glass of some clear liquid off the nightstand

183
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,980
and two tablets.

184
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,260
She demanded I take them for they would make me feel better.

185
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,780
I inspected the tablets and though they resembled your basic aspirin,

186
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:48,760
they were had embossed on them the word PILS spelled P-I-L-S.

187
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,420
Afraid of being drugged again, I tried to hide them in my cheek

188
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,880
but when I drank the liquid they just slid down my throat.

189
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,940
Within minutes, reality started to fade and some sort of orgy began.

190
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,120
The last thing I remember was Mr. Dobbs dressed as a clown with no pants on of course,

191
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
attempting to take my virginity.

192
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,640
I still have nightmares about this but as they say, my country, right or wrong.

193
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,820
Weeks passed that I have little memory of.

194
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,960
I know this only because of the date in which I was retrieved by the agency.

195
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,360
The Dobbses and their minions kept me pretty well fropped up as they called it.

196
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,400
The next event that I have any clear memory of was of taking a ridiculously long elevator ride

197
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,800
deep into the earth at the Bobco Mining and Soylent Green Consortium in Wyoming.

198
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,980
We must have been on that elevator for three hours.

199
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,280
One of Dobbs' minions took my watch during the orgy and refused to give it back saying,

200
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,040
Bob doesn't pay enough and he had to get some stuff for a weekend party

201
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,620
he and the Kennedys were having with one Dr. Oswald.

202
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,760
When we finally alighted from the elevator, to my surprise,

203
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,000
we were not in some mine shaft as I expected,

204
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,060
but in a huge vaulted warehouse full of novelty goods

205
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:15,160
that were being stacked and sorted by strange short men shrouded in sack rags.

206
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,000
Bob claimed that they were ex-Nazis, scientists,

207
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,900
working on some quote super-duper extra secret unquote project for the government.

208
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,840
I could clearly see that they were not men at all but slaves of some unknown species.

209
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,700
By this time I had found it to my better judgement not to doubt Mr. Dobbs, at least not out loud.

210
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,020
We took a golf cart type of vehicle down a long winding corridor.

211
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,220
Mr. Dobbs not once paid any attention to where he was driving.

212
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:54,800
He decided to at that time ramble on and on about some mysterious substance he called slack,

213
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:00,020
all the while puffing insanely on his pipe, the bowl of which soon glowed a bright red.

214
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:07,440
During this journey we ran over three of Bob's slave men and nearly hit countless others.

215
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,340
Mr. Dobbs was oblivious to each quote accident.

216
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:17,480
I put that in quotes for each one of the slaves we ran over I happened to notice had been pointing a weapon of some sort at Mr. Dobbs

217
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,940
right before he mindlessly ran over them.

218
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,760
This mysterious Mr. Dobbs may have some sort of second sight or is just incredibly lucky.

219
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,500
As you'll see I believe it has more to do with luck and some sort of strange time control powers than with anything else.

220
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,580
Mr. Dobbs' underground office was a horror.

221
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,380
I can barely describe it. It was a total mess and stank of the tobacco that he constantly smoked.

222
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,460
In fact I never saw Mr. Dobbs without that.

223
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:47,460


224
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,580
I saw that infernal pipe clenched between his teeth.

225
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:56,440
It was only after a few minutes of adjusting to the stench and the mess of the office that I saw something that horrified me.

226
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,260
The place had several severed human heads strewn haphazardly all over.

227
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:08,220
Now I've seen some terrible sights in my life and I suspect that if I'm on the Dobbs case I will see worse.

228
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:15,080
But what made me gasp was that the heads were not of random humans but of public figures that we would all recognize.

229
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,980
I saw the heads of...

230
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,420
And this section was carefully cut out of the original report.

231
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,540
And one was actually singing.

232
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,460
It begged me in the tenor to please kill me.

233
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,120
Surprisingly in the state I had been in I did not faint.

234
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,900
Instead with all the smoke from Bob's special tobacco mix I started to laugh.

235
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,220
This got Bob all worked up.

236
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,560
He started to jump around inanely and laugh.

237
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,880
He then proceeded to use one of the heads, not the singing one,

238
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,640
in a most foul manner.

239
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,320
Bob bade me sit down on a chair that was stacked high with papers.

240
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,700
I looked at the stack and back at Bob wondering what he expected me to do.

241
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,760
By this time I had begun to get in the spirit of the situation and laughingly knocked the stack of papers on the floor.

242
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,920
Mr. Dobbs didn't seem to mind.

243
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,860
In fact he stared down at the mess I made and said thanks.

244
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,600
Picked up a sheet of paper saying he'd been looking for this contract for quite some time.

245
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,080
The glyphs on the sheet were of no known human alphabet that I have ever encountered.

246
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,840
For some reason this worried me and reminded me of the slaves I saw working for Bob

247
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,060
and that dreadful night with Mrs. Dobbs and that strange grey creature.

248
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,640
I did not have much time to consider the implications for Mr. Dobbs wadded up the paper,

249
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,100
tossed it in a corner and told me to follow him.

250
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,360
This time we did not take the vehicle but instead walked down dark and dank corridors

251
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,260
which had a gradual down slope.

252
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,020
Being without a timepiece I cannot estimate the amount of time we walked but it seemed like hours.

253
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:57,460
Here I must admit my perceptions of time had been warped by constant exposure to Bob's tobacco.

254
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,760
Mr. Dobbs finally guided me to our final destination.

255
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,900
What I saw in that final circle of hell I cannot, I will not reveal.

256
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,380
Through all the pressure that the agency could bear against me,

257
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,780
a loyal true blue agent and American,

258
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,560
I found it in our best interest to keep some things secret even from the boss, the man in the dress.

259
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,520
I do this for the good of our nation and out of fear

260
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,820
for what Mr. Dobbs revealed to me was so horrific, so humorous, so bizarre, so unchristian,

261
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,500
so baffling and dangerous that I hyperventilated through the inane laughter

262
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,460
that was my only defense lest I totally lose my mind.

263
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,360
The last thing I remember is that I was in the middle of a night

264
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,640
and I remembered that day was Mr. Dobbs dancing around my prostrate body

265
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,120
he was prancing really

266
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,120
and mimicking my insane laughter with his own even crazier chortles.

267
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,460
He spoke no words, he just laughed, but his laughter seemed to speak volumes to my inner mind.

268
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,840
I laughed, I wept, I urinated in my undergarments

269
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,800
for Mr. Dobbs had somehow relieved me of my slacks

270
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,760
when I do not recall.

271
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,500
And friends, at this point I, Reverend Stang, must cease reading

272
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,960
from the document The Agent and Mr. Dobbs brought to us by Reverend Teeters LaVerge.

273
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,740
I've gotten a little ways into part two and it goes all the way up to part six so far.

274
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:27,220
However, I have a piece of music here that I think will be extremely pertinent to the subject matter.

275
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,320
This is Reverend Angry Larry.

276
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,280
The Agent and Mr. Dobbs

277
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,820
The Agent and Mr. Dobbs

278
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,480
The Agent and Mr. Dobbs

279
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,340
Two men lined up for the FBI

280
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,760
Keeping tabs on an agent on the land, on the sea and the sky

281
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,020
And every single night

282
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,020
Before I go to bed

283
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,380
I get down on my knees and say, Bob, I'm a Secret Agent, man

284
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,980
Secret Agent, man

285
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,780
Secret Agent, man

286
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,460
They came in jednak

287
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,300
a number, but they

288
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,080
take away my name.

289
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,320
I got one hell

290
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,300
of a job to perform for

291
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,420
the U.S. of A.

292
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,960
Got the

293
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,200
responsibility of our nation's

294
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,720
top security.

295
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,200
But every night

296
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,800
and day,

297
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,080
I salute the flag and say

298
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,580
thank you, Connie,

299
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,700
because I'm a secret agent

300
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,160
man.

301
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,660
Secret

302
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,780
agent man.

303
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,600
Secret agent man.

304
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,540
They give

305
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,160
me a number,

306
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,020
but they take away my name.

307
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,840
You know

308
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,620
they got me doing this, doing that,

309
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
a little bit of something else.

310
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,940
But

311
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,360
fighting cavities of evil,

312
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,080
safeguarding America's health.

313
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,800
But I'm

314
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,740
an afternoon pass.

315
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,760
I don't get up off my

316
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,420
ass. Thank you, Stan,

317
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,520
because I'm a secret agent

318
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:22,920
man.

319
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,440
Secret

320
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,460
agent man.

321
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,380
Secret agent man.

322
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,280
They give

323
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,820
me a number,

324
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,920
but they take away

325
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,760
my name.

326
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,420
Secret

327
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,600
agent man.

328
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,300
Secret agent man.

329
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,220
They give

330
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,980
me a number,

331
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,320
but they take away my

332
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,880
name.

333
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,580
And that was an excerpt from the news of Genius

334
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,920

341
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,000
Some cheapskates

342
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,760
may need to wait for the paperback

343
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,660
version due out someday.

344
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,280
But now,

345
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,620
let's go back to the pre-recorded

346
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,960
visit from Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

347
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,920
recorded a couple of weeks ago

348
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,460
at Tarzan's

349
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,240
radio station

350
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,020
at Stang Ranch and interspersed

351
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,820
with some subgenius history

352
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,600
and Sheridan collage.

353
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,240
Take it away,

354
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,260
us.

355
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,680
Oh, this music

356
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,840
in the background, by the way,

357
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,300
is from the Empire

358
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,520
Jazz Orchestra.

359
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,500
Praise Bob.

360
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,520
My heart was full of song from up there.

361
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,660
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to break the flow,

362
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,340
so to speak.

363
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,680
The songs from

364
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,220
Hello Dolly was echoing

365
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,120
through this big hollow castle

366
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,400
earlier today.

367
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,960
Princess Wee's mom,

368
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,640
Wee Ma Ma,

369
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,780
was watching Hello Dolly

370
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,360
crank up, boy, she likes to crank up

371
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,260
her rock and roll.

372
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,400
And if the door's open, you can hear it everywhere.

373
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,160
I peeked in and saw Barbara

374
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,760
Streisand in this

375
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,200
fabulous production

376
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,680
scene. It just was mind-blowing.

377
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,320
The costume,

378
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:36,760
the costumes, and...

379
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,920
Oh, I would love to make love to her nose.

380
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,340
What has happened to your nose?

381
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,980
Odysseus, Odysseus,

382
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,380
what has happened to your nose?

383
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:47,980
Asshole.

384
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,540
Fire Sign Theater quote.

385
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,340
That's what we should do.

386
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,660
We should cut to Fire Sign Theater.

387
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,920
Turn this FM off here.

388
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,920
Radio, over here.

389
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,260
Okay.

390
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,080
I'll get the TV.

391
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,700
No, no, no, leave it on for a minute.

392
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,580
What has happened to your nose?

393
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,260
I've just returned from Rome. What?

394
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,760
Yeah, yeah, I have seen this before.

395
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,200
Go ahead, turn it off.

396
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,040
Well, that's it.

397
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,200
Here's your keys.

398
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,660
Goodbye, friends, and happy motoring

399
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,240
back on the freeway, which is already in progress.

400
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,840
Whew!

401
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,480
Well, here goes.

402
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,260
Nice feel.

403
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,060
Let's see...

404
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,940
du du du

405
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,260
du du du

406
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:43,460
Oh, how can you be in two places at once when you're not anywhere at all?

407
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,440
I think I'll give this old baby a spin on the freeway.

408
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Entering freeway.

409
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,620
Here we go.

410
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,560
Emergency parking.

411
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,640
Here we go.

412
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,680
Merging buses ahead.

413
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,220
Oh.

414
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,960
Easy access.

415
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,580
Spadometer's only got half a mile on her.

416
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,840
Adelaide Freeway North.

417
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,720
Do I want to go north or do I want to take the, let's see, the Gomorrah Expressway West?

418
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,200
Okay.

419
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,780
If you lived here, you'd be home by now.

420
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,500
Antelope Hill.

421
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,320
Selected living.

422
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,840
Comfortable.

423
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,200
Easy.

424
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,680
Okay.

425
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,060
Antelope Freeway.

426
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,660
This lane.

427
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,300
Exit over.

428
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,900
Yeah, I think I'll take the old Antelope.

429
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,460
Less traffic.

430
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,140
Antelope Freeway 1-1.

431
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,180
Clean up Armenia.

432
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,260
Get a hairnet.

433
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,660
Antelope Freeway 1-1.

434
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,680
Chili Avenue.

435
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,580
Let's see what they got in this car.

436
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,520
Let's see.

437
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:03,060
We got lights, wipers, defrost, temperature and climate control.

438
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,660
Antelope Freeway 1-1.

439
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:03,660


440
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:03,660


441
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:03,840
Hmm.

442
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,200
Let's see what kind of climate I can get.

443
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,100
Antelope Freeway 1-1.

444
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,220
Winter wonderland.

445
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,100
Choo-choo-choo.

446
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,280
Spring fever.

447
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,840
Indian summer.

448
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,680
Antelope Freeway 1-1.

449
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,040
Tropical paradise.

450
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,200
Tropical paradise.

451
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,380
I think I'll give it a try.

452
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,200
Wow.

453
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,060
What a groove.

454
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,720
A tropical paradise.

455
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,620
Antelope Freeway 1-1.

456
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:43,520
Let's go.

457
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,320
Antelope Freeway 1-1.

458
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,820
Let's go.

459
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,060
What a wonderful clearing in the jungle.

460
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,580
This is just the place to build our camp.

461
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,700
All right, you men.

462
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,600
Get cracking now.

463
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,020
The pupden's right over there, I think.

464
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,420
The foundation should go right about here.

465
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,940
The stockade.

466
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,620
The stockade.

467
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,420
Excuse me, sir, but may I speak to you alone, sir?

468
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,220
Of course you can.

469
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,120
Daddy, I've lost the Lincoln dogs.

470
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,420
That's all right.

471
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,500
I've got an erector set.

472
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,280
Show off.

473
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,680
Throw a towel over it.

474
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,100
Do some push-ups, Pablo.

475
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,920
It'll go away.

476
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,440
Hey, what are you guys doing in my car?

477
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,340
The fox trot.

478
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,680
You can have the next dance.

479
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,200
But throw him the fox.

480
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,900
This animal is sick.

481
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,020
Yes, it is a catchy little number.

482
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,240
Uh-oh, I think he's caught it.

483
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,980
Doctor, give him something for his cough.

484
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,160
All right, all right.

485
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,180
Here's a quarter.

486
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,800
Oh, that's not much.

487
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,800
Not much of a cough.

488
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,080
I need a gas station.

489
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,680
Did I pass one?

490
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,540
No, no, but the fox did.

491
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,800
Squeeze him right there.

492
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,060
Maybe he'll pass another one.

493
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,300
No, no.

494
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:53,760
Gasoline.

495
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,920
Oh, my boy, if it's drugs you want, the old doctor can help you out.

496
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,680
Right this way.

497
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,820
Hey, get your hands off me.

498
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,680
I don't want to leave.

499
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,320
Then roll up your arm and bend over.

500
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:02,880
Here.

501
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,040
You want regular or premium?

502
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,560
Oh, this is ridiculous.

503
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,440
You guys are nothing but a pack of cards.

504
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,180
Drink me.

505
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,380
Must be some way out of this.

506
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,860
I'll change the air.

507
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,520
That's what I'll do.

508
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:15,840
Let's see.

509
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,960
What have I got left on the climate control?

510
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,240
Uh, dust storm?

511
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:20,980
No.

512
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,140
Tibetan wilderness?

513
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,100
Land of the pharaohs.

514
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,720
Land of the pharaohs.

515
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,600
That sounds great.

516
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,580
All right, all right.

517
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,200
Here we are in the land of the pharaohs.

518
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,560
Oh, no.

519
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,160
Well, we'll need to talk with the natives.

520
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,320
Does anyone here know a little Egyptian?

521
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,020
Bill, Bill, come on down.

522
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,820
You're good at languages.

523
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,500
Yes, yes, yes, indeed.

524
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,680
That was it.

525
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,140
What?

526
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,280
Yes, indeed.

527
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:50,780
Yes, indeed.

528
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,240
Yes, a little Egyptian.

529
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,780
Yes, a little Egyptian.

530
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,100
Yes, everybody knows I'm mad.

531
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,780
Served my every need.

532
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,460
Did a grand job on my ankles, too.

533
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,640
Now, hold it right.

534
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,080
There.

535
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,080
Glad to.

536
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,200
Now, I think I'll hold it over here.

537
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,500
Oh, boy, it's nice out, isn't it?

538
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,960
Yes, I think you ought to leave it out.

539
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,880
Hey, hey, hey, look, fellas.

540
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,700
Fun's fun, okay, but look, I gotta find a place to stay.

541
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,900
It's gonna be night soon.

542
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,140
I'm tired.

543
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,980
What's the matter with that dude?

544
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,020
I'm lost, and I wanna go to bed.

545
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,480
Oh, my bony boy.

546
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,040
In the Estonian mountains, we used to go to sleep

547
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,720
leaning up against a windfall.

548
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,520
I was but a mere prat then.

549
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,020
I'll never forget the time a snake slithered into my wife.

550
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,860
It wasn't but neat.

551
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,600
I was a beehive to a merry grasshopper.

552
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,340
Oh, no, no, look, that's all very interesting,

553
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,980
but the sun is going down.

554
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,720
Oh, no, no, you're all confused.

555
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,820
The horizon is moving up.

556
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,400
Hey, listen, come on, you guys, help me, please.

557
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,200
I know, I know.

558
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,000
Let's stand him on his head.

559
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,940
Here you go.

560
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,700
Hey, hey, hey, put me down.

561
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,240
Relax, relax.

562
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,040
Easy, boy.

563
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,700
Ah, you see?

564
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,440
Now it's morning.

565
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,780
Oh, boy.

566
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,920
Oh, he's no fun.

567
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,860
He fell right in.

568
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,120
He fell right over.

569
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,600
Oh, hey, won't somebody please help me?

570
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,620
Easy, easy, my lad.

571
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,360
At times of dexterity like this,

572
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,260
my wee native compendium, Mohamit,

573
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,880
used to pray to the divinitize.

574
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,840
His little brown, froggy body

575
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,880
equivorate my loins.

576
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,880
Chanting a stream of ancient Egyptian holograms.

577
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,320
What?

578
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,880
A diaphragm.

579
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,740
No, no, no, no.

580
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,260
I used to date him.

581
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,160
Hieroglyphs, that's it.

582
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,160
Do you remember any?

583
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,840
Will they help?

584
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,620
Anything at all?

585
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,080
Yes, of course, of course.

586
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,620
Let's see.

587
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,420
It was a jackal-headed woman with her eyes kimbo.

588
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,020
A king sitting sideways on his throne.

589
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,480
A drip with gold, chippet nose uplifted.

590
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,300
Dashly.

591
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,960
All engraven on a pyramid of massive size.

592
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,880
With the body of a lion,

593
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,680
paws that refreshes,

594
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,380
a tail told by an idiot,

595
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,860
and the head of a fox.

596
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,180
The pyramid is opening.

597
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,960
Which one?

598
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,320
The one with the ever-widening hole in it.

599
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,160
I'm saved.

600
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm going in.

601
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,320
No, don't do this, son.

602
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,200
It's dark and dirty in there.

603
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,500
Oh, but Mom.

604
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,460
It's full of bees and spiders.

605
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,060
You might poke your eye out.

606
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,860
What if your father comes home?

607
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,520
I'm going in, Mom.

608
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,440
There's a vacancy.

609
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,940
I'm going in.

610
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,220
Good evening, sir.

611
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,400
Welcome to the only nice motel in town.

612
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,880
How long will you be with us?

613
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,120
Just for tonight.

614
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,660
Ah, very well, sir.

615
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,760
You'll find it's very clean here.

616
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,640
Just fill out this card.

617
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,220
Oh, thanks.

618
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,200
Oh, look, it's dirty.

619
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,260
Somebody's already used it.

620
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,960
There's a name on it.

621
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,860
That's all right.

622
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,100
Well, I couldn't get you to believe my name is Mr. and Mrs. John Smith, could I?

623
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,980
Well, of course you could.

624
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,560
It's nice to have you with us, Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

625
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,520
Run!

626
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,580
Hey, aren't you Mr. and Mrs. John Smiths?

627
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,180
From any town in the USA?

628
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,900
I'm Joe, boy, and this here's Ed.

629
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,800
Hey, I'm not really Mr. and Mrs. John Smith.

630
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,100
Well, that's okay. I'm not Joe.

631
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,420
He's not Ed.

632
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,020
Hey, fella, how about bending a couple of Medu-Dah rolls?

633
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,040
If you catch my meaning.

634
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,540
If you get my drift.

635
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,160
Thanks, fellas, but I'm kind of tired.

636
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,700
Hey, desk clerk, can I have my key, please?

637
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,020
Sure. What about G7?

638
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,100
Get it, Jimmy.

639
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,240
I can tell by the pound you're tied.

640
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,340
You're an American. Well, so am I.

641
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,180
Hi, Bubba. Howdy. How do you do?

642
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,480
And while we're on the subject...

643
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,500
And while we're on the subject...

644
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,440
And while we're on the subject...

645
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,360
Welcome to your wazoo!

646
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,860
What's that all about?

647
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,600
What's it all about, Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Smiths from any town USA?

648
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,940
Well, it's about this long...

649
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,600
And about that wide...

650
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,520
And it's about this country...

651
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,040
About which we're singing about.

652
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,480
I was born an American.

653
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,720
I was raised an American.

654
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:08,260
And I'll die an American in America with our millions.

655
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,740
Boy, that was hilarious, wasn't it?

656
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,520
See, you like that transition I did?

657
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,040
Firesign Theater, they're the greatest.

658
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,500
They were so much better than anybody else.

659
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,320
Until... Of course, until we came along.

660
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,880
Is there any kind of gaseous energy escaping from your house right now?

661
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,640
Huh? What? Say that? What?

662
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,040
The gas is erupting from your nostrils.

663
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,320
I mean, you just sound like you're making so much fun that you can hardly hold it in.

664
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,580
That's Princess We, not me.

665
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,980
Oh, okay.

666
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,480
Remember, she's the Robin Givens to my Howard Smith.

667
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:57,800
She's the Robin Givens to my Howard Stern.

668
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,000
She excuses my excesses with her gay laughter.

669
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,160
Yeah, but Robin Givens used to carry a gun, a shotgun.

670
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,160
And Stern...

671
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,740
Hey, we figured out where that...

672
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:23,120
What inspired that noise in the score of The Good, Bad, and the Ugly by Ennio Morricone...

673
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,400
It's Coyote.

674
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,260
In the movie.

675
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,300
Which I was watching last night.

676
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,740
It starts with these bad guys in a really run-down train station or something.

677
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,920
And they're about to go in and kill Duco.

678
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,680
And there's a coyote, a lone coyote going...

679
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,940
And it suddenly comes to the title music, and that's the noise.

680
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,620
And now it's the time

681
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:13,620


682
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,020
You did that?

683
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,740
D'oh.

684
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:24,520
Yes!

685
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:24,520


686
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:24,560
LoveE være

687
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:24,560


688
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:24,560


689
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:24,560


690
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:24,980
Where's the train that derives the train from?

691
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,240
It sees me fit in this love

692
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,360
I'm your friend.

693
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,740
Please don't die.

694
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,140
Please.

695
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,120
I'm your friend.

696
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,280
Come on, Eddie.

697
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,280
Come on.

698
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,020
Blondie?

699
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,720
I'll help you.

700
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,760
I'll help you.

701
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,740
Don't move.

702
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,560
I'll be right back.

703
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,040
Did you notice those scenes before?

704
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,680
No, no.

705
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,580
When I was watching the movie, I heard the coyote.

706
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,620
When I was a kid, I didn't even know what a coyote sounded like.

707
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,500
I grew up in the city.

708
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,480
Out here, you can't escape them.

709
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:52,880
No.

710
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,360
And this is kind of like the Wild West.

711
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,920
It's definitely coyote country.

712
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,960
Until you get to the highway, then it's just goddamn suburbs.

713
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,260
Pinkland, normal town.

714
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,200
Out here, we've got a horse.

715
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,980
Ain't much of a horse.

716
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
It's a real old horse.

717
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,880
But there actually is a horse here.

718
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,200
He's a good-looking horse.

719
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,440
A whole bunch of goats.

720
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,300
Yeah.

721
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,780
Oh, mess of goats.

722
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,940
Good goats.

723
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,740
Goats are fun, too.

724
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,160
So mighty.

725
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,200
Great goats.

726
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,660
I am goat.

727
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,060
Well, once upon a time, we all were, you know.

728
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:36,760
We all came from Mammy Goat's uterus, or chicken pie, whatever it's called.

729
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,560
Mammy's chicken pie?

730
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,100
We all came from Mammy's chicken pie?

731
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,640
Yeah, the goat.

732
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,640
The goat woman.

733
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,120
Who looked a little bit like Adolf Hitler in her younger days.

734
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,640
And was constantly warned away from the rest of the kids.

735
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,460
Oh, you're a...

736
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,140
You're quoting that famous Doctors for Wotan song, Louie Louie, Are You a Girl or a Goat Woman?

737
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,640
Yeah.

738
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,120
It was a director.

739
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,220
I should cut to that, except that it's really horrible, Sandra.

740
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,560
Louie Louie, are you a girl or a goat woman?

741
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:21,220
Louie Louie, Louie Louie, are you a girl or a goat woman?

742
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,680
Louie Louie, are you a girl or a goat woman?

743
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:24,680


744
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,600
I didn't know.

745
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,100
I didn't know.

746
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,640
I wanted to stand there.

747
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,780
The signs said, see the goat woman.

748
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,980
And I did it.

749
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,260
I paid my 50 cents and I saw her as she was.

750
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,240
Louie Louie.

751
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,540
And so, panting across the stage.

752
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,000
I think I was so troubled by her looks.

753
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,300
And she looked so beautiful.

754
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,100
And her beard.

755
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,000
Her beard.

756
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,420
It was so loud.

757
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,080
Her beard smelled of...

758
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,960
Her udders.

759
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,540
I loved biting those.

760
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,240
Those distended udders.

761
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,540
Her udders.

762
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,020
Louie Louie.

763
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,180
Louie Louie, are you a girl or a goat woman?

764
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,260
She left her pellets, those little pellets, all over the rug.

765
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,320
And the most beautiful of all.

766
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,960
She left behind on the stage as she danced.

767
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,880
Tiny pellets.

768
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,440
Goat pellets.

769
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,480
And I knew she was the girl for me.

770
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,400
Louie Louie.

771
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,320
Are you a girl or a goat woman?

772
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,700
No, no, no, no.

773
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,300
No, no, no, no.

774
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,420
Well, that's why I played for that reason itself.

775
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,820
I'll just re-record it.

776
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,080
Louie Louie.

777
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,900
Uh-uh.

778
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,740
Uh-uh.

779
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:38,780
Uh-uh.

780
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,880
Are you a girl or a goat woman?

781
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,860
Uh-uh.

782
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,720
Uh-uh-uh.

783
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,640
And then I saw her at the carnival in the freak show.

784
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,340
And she was so beautiful.

785
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,740
And her hooves.

786
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,000
And her beautiful...

787
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,720
Goat woman breastage.

788
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,520
And I looked back in the dressing room.

789
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,960
And there were little tiny pellets and droppings of it.

790
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,140
And I fell in love.

791
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,820
Now you're talking.

792
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,180
Louie Louie.

793
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,440
Are you a girl or a goat woman?

794
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,000
Nah.

795
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,300
Man, that's it.

796
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,980
That's just a 100 proof.

797
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:11,840
Yeah.

798
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,000
Yeah, that was the cover of Louie Louie.

799
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,320
Are you a girl or a goat woman?

800
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,800
By Pooh Watertowel.

801
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,680
The original was Doctors for Wotan.

802
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:27,560
Princess, we and I are Pooh Watertowel once every three years when we record a song.

803
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,040
We've got to record Buddy.

804
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,360
Yes, we do.

805
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,820
The dog, the doc, the frop rock dog opera.

806
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,780
Well, here we are.

807
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,660
The rock opera.

808
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,100
Sitting here with the microphones, we should do it.

809
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,660
You know what?

810
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,520
I even have that karaoke cut of Tommy Ready to Go.

811
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,140
All right.

812
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,440
We cut it down to 19.

813
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,400
17 minutes instead of an hour and a half.

814
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,440
It's based on Tommy, of course, the rock opera.

815
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,760
But it's Buddy.

816
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,780
Buddy, can you hear me?

817
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,700
And so on.

818
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,560
That was back when Buddy escaped all the time.

819
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,900
He's a different dog now.

820
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,620
Hey, man.

821
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,920
That's a different dog, man.

822
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,600
Stay away from him.

823
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:12,940
Like me.

824
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,420
He's a different dog now, man.

825
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,340
Yeah.

826
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,260
Yeah.

827
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,300
Yeah, you got me wrong.

828
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,240
I'm a different dog now.

829
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:18,860
You got me wrong.

830
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,720
I didn't do it.

831
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:19,820
See?

832
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,540
I didn't do it.

833
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,640
Kids, are you clean?

834
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,620
No?

835
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:31,940
Why don't you try Triology Soaps from TriologySoaps.com?

836
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:40,220
Yes, there's a Dobbs head embedded in each translucent bar of Triology Soaps

837
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:46,560
in every possible funny named scent, including scentless.

838
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,540
But that one's not free.

839
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,420
Nor is it scented.

840
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,240
Nor is it scented.

841
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,320
You can try TriologySoaps.com.

842
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,420
Now, you weren't reading that, were you?

843
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,480
You were just swinging it in?

844
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,380
Well, it's a real ad.

845
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,840
I can't run that on WCSB, for instance.

846
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,840
That's what I thought.

847
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,260
Yeah.

848
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,560
That's it for the ad.

849
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,260
It's verboten.

850
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:06,840
Yeah.

851
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:14,320
Our friend, Lord Ferg, among his many holdings, includes a company that makes this soap.

852
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,700
And it's special.

853
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,840
It really is.

854
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,020
It's a subgenius brand soap.

855
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,180
It's a subgenius brand soap.

856
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,400
It's a subgenius brand soap.

857
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:20,400


858
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:20,400


859
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:20,400


860
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:20,400


861
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:27,240
It's a silhouette Dobbs head made of dark colored soap inside of a translucent, clearish kind of soap.

862
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,080
Oh, it's so cool.

863
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,340
Because when you're using it and you're rolling it around in your hands,

864
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,460
the pipe flips from right to left as you flip it around and make the lather.

865
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,080
And so the soap portends your day.

866
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,820
When you put it down in the soap dish, if the pipe is facing to the right,

867
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,100
you're going to have a great day.

868
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,760
If it's to the left, not so much.

869
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,960
If it's to the left, it's communist.

870
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,680
That's what's wrong with this country.

871
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,120
Everybody's a communist but me.

872
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,440
Are you sure you didn't get backwards?

873
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,040
But as you're flopping it over...

874
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,540
Oh, I got it backwards.

875
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,280
It turns from Bob to Dick.

876
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,120
Dick Dobbs has his pipe going out the wrong way.

877
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,660
So it's like Bob Dick, Bob Dick, Bob Dick.

878
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,540
Well, that almost sounds obscene.

879
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,960
Yeah, but no kidding, man.

880
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,540
The girls love it.

881
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,220
Old Bob will sell just about anything to just about anybody.

882
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,200
What's he sold you today?

883
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,680
So?

884
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,940
So there's a great quote.

885
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,180
I wish I had come up with it.

886
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,260
That it's easier to act your way into a new way of thinking

887
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,420
than to think your way into a new way of acting.

888
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,660
So how important the external is to changing the internal.

889
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,580
It wasn't possible to measure happiness

890
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:43,280
or to compare happiness across individuals.

891
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:49,160
We would look basically at consumer preferences.

892
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,920
The inspiration to incorporate happiness into economic modeling

893
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,540
came from a rather unlikely source.

894
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,580
The networks had a stranglehold on national news.

895
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,660
Local stations did what minimal news they needed to do.

896
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:24,360
To fulfill FCC requirements that said in exchange for using the public airways,

897
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,820
you had to have a certain amount of news on them.

898
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,400
Partly cloudy skies with a high near 22.

899
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,400
Some lingering light snow flurries still in the air.

900
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,300
Partly cloudy tonight with a low of 12 degrees.

901
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,440
Are you suffering from information overload?

902
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,840
You suffering from information overload?

903
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:45,980
You suffering from information overload?

904
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:46,800
Information overload?

905
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,600
Information overload?

906
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,640
Are you suffering from information overload?

907
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,200
Almost every

908
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,000
effort has gone unnoticed.

909
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,000


910
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,000


911
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,780
These tend to sound funny to the outside world.

912
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:19,640
Is your是啊for the change only compared to your make a story?

913
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,780
All right.

914
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,800
All right, it's all over.

915
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,440
We're all happy now.

916
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,520
We're so happy.

917
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,000
We all love each other.

918
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,440
There's evidence that human connection also modulates or can affect one's autonomic nervous system.

919
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,480
Human beings must be in the loop before someone is killed by a drone.

920
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,460
But it's in the machine.

921
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,220
My replica.

922
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,320
And it doesn't need people.

923
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,400
It's me, your computer.

924
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,520
I can't turn it off.

925
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,840
We need to talk.

926
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,560
I can't put it away.

927
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,320
It's in me.

928
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:11,780
It's computer.

929
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,220
Together.

930
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:12,880
You're me.

931
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:14,960
Don't get freaked out.

932
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:15,660
Don't get freaked out.

933
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,080
Destroy.

934
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,580
It can decide by itself.

935
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,420
Whether or not it kills somebody.

936
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:20,960
Huh?

937
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,620
I don't see a good reason to believe that we would survive.

938
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,240
Don't get freaked out.

939
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:27,980
Don't get freaked out.

940
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:28,720
Don't get freaked out.

941
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,440
Don't get freaked out.

942
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:29,680
Yeah.

943
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,860
Don't get freaked out.

944
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,080
Don't get freaked out.

945
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:32,780
Don't get freaked out.

946
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,500
Don't get freaked out.

947
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:33,500


948
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,920
I still think it would be fun to talk to a robot.

949
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,380
There was all kinds of experimentation and fun going on there.

950
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,540
All kinds of experimentation and fun.

951
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,740
The answer to why is my brain like this is,

952
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,200
because your brain is like this.

953
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,680
And that's all there is to it.

954
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,540
There is no more.

955
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,040
Bummer.

956
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,840
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

957
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,660
This is not a rerun.

958
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,040
Not a rerun.

959
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,260
Bye.

960
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,440
It's Bob.

961
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,320
Follow in my footsteps.

962
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:21,760
Bob.

963
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:23,840
It's Bob.

964
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:25,860
Alert.

965
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:26,580
Alert.

966
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,320
Alert.

967
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,700
Greetings, Bob.

968
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,240
Hello.

969
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,360
This is Bob.

970
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,680
I'm out at the moment.

971
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,380
If you leave your name and your telephone number,

972
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,300
I will call you back.

973
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,880
You know, I waited for somebody to say Bob.

974
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,880
You know, I waited for somebody to say Bob.

975
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,400
You're fired.

976
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,360
I got the power.

977
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,840
I got the treasure.

978
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,820
And you have a flight to catch.

979
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:54,380
Huh?

980
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:55,340
Ah!

981
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:56,500


982
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:56,940


983
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,600
Ah!

984
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,000


985
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,540
Ah!

986
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:58,560
Ah!

987
00:47:59,760 --> 00:47:59,760


988
00:47:59,760 --> 00:47:59,760


989
00:47:59,880 --> 00:47:59,880


990
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,160
Ah!

991
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:00,720
Ah!

992
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:01,160


993
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:01,560
Ah!

994
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:02,340
Ah!

995
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:02,920
Ah!

996
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,280
Ah!

997
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:03,940
Ah!

998
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,460
Ah!

999
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:05,880
Ah!

1000
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:05,920
Ah!

1001
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,160
Ah!

1002
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,020
Ah!

1003
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,120
That's it.

1004
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,540
No more Mr. Knife Guy.

1005
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,220
This is what life is like.

1006
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,500
At a, at a bottom line level, you know,

1007
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,360
and I'm not gonna make you cut through

1008
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,240
a lot of other stuff to get through it.

1009
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,080
Here's what it is.

1010
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,020
There's no gimmick about that.

1011
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:33,620
It's straightforward.

1012
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,440
It's strong and it's elemental.

1013
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,940
We are heavy.

1014
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,880
This wouldn't be a great way to do that on Earth,

1015
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,660
but it's really a very efficient way

1016
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:48,500
to do it.

1017
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,460
Well, when?

1018
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,320
Right now?

1019
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,400
Go ahead.

1020
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:56,780
No, no.

1021
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,480
If not now, when?

1022
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,920
If not us, who?

1023
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,180
No, neither one of those two

1024
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,580
are all right right now.

1025
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,820
I have to go lay down

1026
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,980
in the toilet for a while.

1027
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,200
Well, Dave,

1028
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,580
it has been an hour

1029
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,120
and one minute

1030
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,360
of show.

1031
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:15,540
Show.

1032
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,300
I'll probably chop it up

1033
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,180
into two shows.

1034
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,620
Oh, you handsome dog.

1035
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,100
Yeti, say something.

1036
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,320
He does talk.

1037
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,060
He does.

1038
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:40,580
No, that's not him.

1039
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,240
That's her doing it.

1040
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,120
No, I'm trying to get him

1041
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:42,520
to do it.

1042
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,720
That's how he talks, though.

1043
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,260
Huh?

1044
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:45,740
Why?

1045
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,520
I'm just saying I had a dog

1046
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,500
who saved a kid from drowning.

1047
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,540
You did?

1048
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,060
Yes, he did.

1049
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,640
He jumped right in.

1050
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,920
They got me out, all right.

1051
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,240
And then the dog got in there

1052
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,800
and got the kid

1053
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,420
and the kid put his arms

1054
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,420
around the dog's neck

1055
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,700
and swam him in

1056
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,740
and the dog shook

1057
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,420
and everybody that was watching

1058
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,400
the horrible event

1059
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:12,800
applauded and went,

1060
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,020
yeah.

1061
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,220
Was this when you were,

1062
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:15,340
uh,

1063
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,120
a small kid?

1064
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,300
No, this is when I was

1065
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,820
a 20-some-year-old kid

1066
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,720
and thought I was

1067
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,880
the world's greatest athlete

1068
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,720
and would go running

1069
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,040
far, far with my dog.

1070
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,340
And we came upon a place

1071
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:27,860
in the river

1072
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,720
that there was a,

1073
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:29,860
what's it called?

1074
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,300
Oh, I forget what they call that.

1075
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,120
A water...

1076
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:36,420
When the water gets...

1077
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,440
When the water sucks

1078
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,700
back up under

1079
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,780
and pulls you down

1080
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,360
as you get...

1081
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,580
You get about five feet

1082
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,380
away from the dam

1083
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,140
and then it...

1084
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,120
Pulls you back under.

1085
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,060
The undertow.

1086
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:47,560
The undertow.

1087
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,380
An undertow.

1088
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:49,960
And, uh,

1089
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,180
I was there

1090
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,220
for a much longer time

1091
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,600
and the EMS people

1092
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,320
had to come and

1093
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,380
dig me out,

1094
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,040
but my dog

1095
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,960
did save a kid's life.

1096
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,100
The kid was going,

1097
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,100
please, mister,

1098
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:03,800
help us.

1099
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,100
Please help us.

1100
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,660
And you didn't do anything,

1101
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,920
but the dog understood

1102
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,400
what the kid was saying.

1103
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,800
Well, kind of, yeah.

1104
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,100
Yeah, I thought,

1105
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,120
oh, we're so much better.

1106
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:15,120


1107
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:15,980
We're so much smarter than dogs.

1108
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:16,920
Recently,

1109
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,480
on a training film,

1110
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,660
I saw a dog deliver,

1111
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,780
what's it called?

1112
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,220
Chest smackers

1113
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,600
to a person

1114
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,600
who had a heart attack.

1115
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:27,660
Now, see,

1116
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,440
doesn't that sound

1117
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,160
like a heart attack

1118
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,140
that just now?

1119
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,200
A little bit.

1120
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,260
Yeah.

1121
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,800
That's when I can't hear...

1122
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,840
I can't understand him.

1123
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,580
I can hear him,

1124
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,380
but it...

1125
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,820
How about this way?

1126
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,460
I moved it like a microsecond

1127
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,200
to the left.

1128
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,360
There you go.

1129
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:42,900
Is it okay now?

1130
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:43,520
Yeah.

1131
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,020
Okay, well,

1132
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,200
I usually talk

1133
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,340
pointing my mouth

1134
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,680
just slightly to the side

1135
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,040
of the microphone.

1136
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,720
That's what I have to do.

1137
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,420
So it's not popping the P's

1138
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,180
like a bunch of puds

1139
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,120
and puddlies.

1140
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,720
You wouldn't believe

1141
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,560
what that looks like

1142
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,380
on the waveform.

1143
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,320
It knocks everything else down

1144
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:03,740
because I've got

1145
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,380
an automatic volume limiter

1146
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:05,760
on here,

1147
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,440
and those P's

1148
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,540
just make everything

1149
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,760
drop out for a second.

1150
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,120
I've seen the...

1151
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,080
I've seen what the impulsives do.

1152
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,360
It's a pain.

1153
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,000
Pulsives?

1154
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,120
Yeah.

1155
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:15,640
Pulsives are a pain.

1156
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,280
Poppity P's.

1157
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,280
Oh,

1158
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:20,880
pop your

1159
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,480
pulses

1160
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,320
P-P's.

1161
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,220
We wept.

1162
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,820
We just wrecked

1163
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,340
that recording

1164
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,420
and that song

1165
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,680
about P-P's.

1166
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,520
Whatever.

1167
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:32,680
Oh,

1168
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
at least Reverend P's

1169
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,320
will be proud.

1170
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:34,820
Yes.

1171
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,520
He'll go,

1172
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:35,780
oh,

1173
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,500
I see you finally

1174
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,120
mentioned me.

1175
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:37,860
It's about time.

1176
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:38,900
Yeah.

1177
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,440
He will say that.

1178
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,620
As if it wasn't

1179
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,120
about time

1180
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:42,700
to begin with,

1181
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,080
you know?

1182
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,360
It's about time.

1183
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,180
It's about space.

1184
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,100
It's about two men

1185
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,120
in the craziest place.

1186
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:51,920
Starring

1187
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:52,880
Buzzzie,

1188
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,300
who lives

1189
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,160
over to

1190
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,320
Stephenville

1191
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:56,800
now.

1192
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,800
Believe it or not,

1193
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,540
Ruth Buzzzie

1194
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,580
lives in Stephenville,

1195
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,020
Texas,

1196
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,140
not far from here.

1197
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:01,720
Goodness.

1198
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,980
That's right down the street.

1199
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:03,300
Yep.

1200
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:03,680
Oh,

1201
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,620
she's my babe.

1202
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,340
Who else?

1203
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,760
Bob Denver

1204
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,840
and Chuck McCann.

1205
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:12,700
Now,

1206
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,060
why can't we

1207
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:13,220
remember

1208
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,320
who was in that

1209
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:14,880
horrible,

1210
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,220
crappy kids show

1211
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,120
and I can't remember

1212
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,940
your W-2 form?

1213
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,440
I think we all know.

1214
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,580
I think we do know.

1215
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,920
We know exactly why.

1216
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,020
Let's just not dwell on it.

1217
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,080
Let's not focus on that.

1218
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:33,460
Let's not.

1219
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,000
Friends,

1220
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:34,920
you've been listening

1221
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,940
to the Hour of Slack

1222
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,540
here on radio station,

1223
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,640
insert station here,

1224
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,100
in the beautiful city

1225
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:42,700
of the,

1226
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:42,720
uh,

1227
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,000
Bill Cates voice

1228
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,300
should say the town.

1229
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:46,460
And,

1230
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:46,800
uh,

1231
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,940
that is,

1232
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,040
that's all folks.

1233
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,080
Says,

1234
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,280
Porky Pig.

1235
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,820
Some non-stutterer.

1236
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,400
I'll speak to you

1237
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,200
once again soon.

1238
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,300
I hope so.

1239
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,500
I hope so.

1240
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,640
I really hope so.

1241
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,080
I hope so too.

1242
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,440
I hope,

1243
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,660
I hope the snow melts

1244
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,680
someday there,

1245
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,120
Dave.

1246
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,040
That would,

1247
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:09,720
that would be helpful

1248
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,860
in recovering

1249
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:11,980
my senses

1250
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,460
and my,

1251
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,640
and other stuff

1252
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,160
like that.

1253
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:14,840
Yeah.

1254
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,400
Yeah.

1255
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:16,960
Me too.

1256
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,400
Okay, man.

1257
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,040
Okay.

1258
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,140
Okay, man.

1259
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:22,860
Okay, okay.

1260
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,440
Okay, woman.

1261
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:24,420
Okay.

1262
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,680
Okay, all right.

1263
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:26,760
Jesus.

1264
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:27,920
Enough.

1265
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,320
I busta.

1266
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,180
Okay, I'm gonna,

1267
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,040
I'm gonna hang up.

1268
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,080
Oh, he hung up.

1269
