1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,120
And that's where it happened.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,100
When I woke up, it was still raining, and I was lying on top of the mud

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,160
like a man trying to find the sugar bowl at a restaurant under a grandstand.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,620
The door to my apartment opened, and she sauntered in,

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,280
moving slowly from side to side like a piece of bubble gum in a set of false teeth.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,980
Her voice was all right, too.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,740
It reminded you of a furnace in a basement full of cats.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,680
Good evening.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,220
I stood up like a dirty, wet baby on a floor full of marbles.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,160
Well, well. Talk.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:31,960
No.

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,440
No? No.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,220
Good. See?

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:35,840
Yeah.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,960
He admits it.

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,960
I don't understand.

17
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,200
Lorraine had washed the makeup off her face, and she looked sharp and quick,

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,980
like a piece of candy in a bad tooth.

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:47,860
Yes?

20
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,720
She looked like a stubborn seed in a deep freeze.

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:51,960
Yes?

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,040
She looked like a guy who didn't figure on a leaf in a pool of water.

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,840
Yes?

24
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,200
She looked like a false baby on a furnace in a basement full of tea.

25
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,740
No.

26
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,600
You take your work too seriously.

27
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
I don't understand it.

28
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,820
Be sure to join us next Sunday evening and every Sunday, same time, same station,

29
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,100
for radio's newest show,

30
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,940
The Subconious Offslaught.

31
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,080
There's something about them you'll like.

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,420
From PR News in Washington, I'm tempered by cautionary reminders to keep it respectful,

33
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,360
but the sexual path is the only sex path.

34
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,620
The Russian government says 4.72%,

35
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,200
and 4.5%.

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,400
Earlier this year.

37
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,260
The Russian government says it is listening to PR News.

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,060
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.

39
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,540
Any abnormal sound?

40
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,600
Normal.

41
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,220
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

42
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,740
Hey!

43
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:55,640
Ha!

44
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,060
Happily, delightfully.

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,020
The conspiracy made him want to be normal.

46
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,560
You've killed me, doctor.

47
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,540
Incredible.

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,180
Absolutely incredible.

49
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,060
Mind over matter.

50
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,300
And all of this is mind over matter.

51
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,180
Totally and absolutely mind over matter.

52
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,860
Normal.

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,600
Normal.

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,980
Why do you want to be normal?

55
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
Think about it, normal.

56
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,440
Normal.

57
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,160
Normal.

58
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,400
Think more normal.

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:53,860
Normal.

60
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,420
I hear it.

61
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,880
Come on, let's hear it.

62
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,960
If I get in the blood, break your eyes.

63
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,260
You're just a normal.

64
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,700
Normal.

65
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,140
Normal.

66
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,300
Normal.

67
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,280
Normal.

68
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,240
Normal.

69
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,080
Normal.

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,440
Normal.

71
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,120
Normal.

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:19,720


73
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,160
Normal.

74
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:21,580


75
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,480
Normal.

76
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,000
Normal.

77
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,900
Normal.

78
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:35,960
Normal.

79
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:36,760
Normal.

80
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,560
Normal.

81
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,560


82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,560


83
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,560


84
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,560


85
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,560


86
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,560


87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,640
America.

88
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:39,900
America.

89
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:39,940
America.

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,920
Moreover.

91
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:46,980
More.

92
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,140
Impossible.

93
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,740
Like.

94
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,360
Using it the Babylon.

95
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,160
MSadows.

96
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,160
That.

97
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,160


98
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,160


99
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,500
Sumrt�'im.

100
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,040
Superb.

101
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,460
Have you ever had any psychiatric help?

102
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,920
I think you've developed some kind of obsession here.

103
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,800
I think you need some help.

104
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,600
Incredible.

105
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,300
Absolutely incredible.

106
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,580
Why do you want to be normal?

107
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,740
You know?

108
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,500
It's more fun not to be.

109
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,160
Absolutely incredible.

110
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,400
Absolutely incredible.

111
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,260
Mind over matter.

112
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,500
The conspiracy mania ought to be normal.

113
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,540
Normal.

114
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,400
Normal.

115
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,380
Normal.

116
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,980
Happily, delightfully, constantly normal.

117
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,080
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.

118
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,720
It's not normal.

119
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,460
Make more noise!

120
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,480
Let's hear it!

121
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,940
Come on, let's hear it!

122
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,480
Go on!

123
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:53,540
Lock me in your protection李

124
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,000
And now, a rant.

125
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,040
Not by me.

126
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,120
It's called, Yes, Promiscua, There Is a Bob.

127
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,960
Is there a J.R. Bob Dobbs?

128
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,500
We take pleasure in answering at once, and thus prominently, the communication below,

129
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:33,020
expressing, at the same time, our great gratification that its faithful author is numbered among the friends of the Stark Fist.

130
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,740
Dear Editor, I'm eight years old.

131
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,680
Some of my little friends say there's no J.R. Bob Dobbs.

132
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,240
Papa says, if you see it in the Stark Fist, it's so.

133
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,960
So don't bother me with questions when I'm hungover.

134
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,640
Please tell me the truth.

135
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,380
Is there a Bob Dobbs?

136
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:04,040
Signed, Promiscua O'Hooligan, 13013 West 69th Street.

137
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,820
Promiscua, your little friends are wieners.

138
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,000
They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age.

139
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,020
They do not believe except they see.

140
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:30,500
They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their pathetic, disgusting, wretched, filthy little minds.

141
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,120
They are inferior.

142
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,760
You hate them, don't you?

143
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,080
Kill them.

144
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,560
Do it.

145
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,500
Do it slow.

146
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,140
Make them suffer.

147
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,360
Eh?

148
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:44,800
Eh?

149
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,040
Eh?

150
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,860
Mm-hmm.

151
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,620
All minds, Promiscua, whether they be pinks or pink-shouldered,

152
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,020
are little.

153
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,960
In this great universe of ours, man is a mere insect,

154
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,260
an ant in his intellect as compared with the boundless world about him,

155
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:13,740
as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the difference between one's ass and a hole in the ground.

156
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,020
Yes, Promiscua, there is a J.R. Bob Dobbs.

157
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,620
He exists as certainly as he exists.

158
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,180
He exists as certainly as the conspiracy's mind-control radio waves exist,

159
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,300
and you know that they abound and tell you to sodomize your neighbor's corpse with a spatula.

160
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,480
Alas, how dreary would the world be if there were no Bob Dobbs.

161
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,580
It would be as dreary as if there were no Promiscuas.

162
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,400
There would be no free energy schemes then.

163
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,760
No UFO cults.

164
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,600
No young Earth creationists to make tolerable the truth.

165
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:52,600


166
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,200
No deep South.

167
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,040
We should have no enjoyment except in reason and enlightenment.

168
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:07,480
The eternal stench with which subgeniusdom fills the world would be deodorized.

169
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,380
Not believe in J.R. Bob Dobbs?

170
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,560
You might as well not believe in Yeti.

171
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,900
You might get your poppin' to hire assassins to watch in all the theaters

172
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,240
on the night of Slagd.

173
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:22,900
You might catch Bob.

174
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,520
But even if they didn't see Bob come on stage, what would that prove?

175
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,080
Nobody sees Bob, but that's no sign that there is no Bob.

176
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,040
The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see.

177
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,440
Such as the batter's box or Papa's credit rating.

178
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:49,260
Did you ever see an angry Yeti levitating just above your bed as you try to sleep,

179
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,400
hating you for your pinkness?

180
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:52,840
Of course not.

181
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,620
But that's no proof that they're not there.

182
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,600
Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.

183
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:11,200
Did you ever see an angry Yeti levitating just above your bed as you try to sleep,

184
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,160
hating you for your pinkness?

185
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,540
Of course not.

186
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,400
But that's no proof they're not there.

187
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,960
Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are,

188
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,760
hating you for your pinkness?

189
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,040
Of course not.

190
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,580
You may tear apart the landmine and see what makes the noise inside,

191
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:39,600
but there's a veil covering the more real world which not the strongest Yeti,

192
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:45,080
nor even the united strength of all the strongest Yeti that ever lived could tear apart.

193
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,980
Only alcohol, drugs, television,

194
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,120
frantic sex, debauchery,

195
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:59,340
can push aside that curtain and view and picture the eternal kegger beyond.

196
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,680
Is it all real?

197
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,740
Oh, Promiscua, have your credit card ready.

198
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,720
No J.R. Bob Dobbs?

199
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,340
Oh, thank Wotan! He lives, and he lives forever!

200
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:21,920
A thousand years from now, Promiscua, nay, ten times ten thousand years from now,

201
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,740
he will continue to make glad the heart of kooks,

202
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,940
and if not, by then, you'll have bigger problems, schmuck.

203
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:39,140
And that was by Zigmunt Figment.

204
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,140
Formerly, Wot de Flock Skoingon.

205
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,320
Thank you, Zigmunt Figment.

206
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,980
Ahead.

207
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:08,100
And here's a... well, it's kind of like almost a nursery rhyme.

208
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:16,460
By Reverend Dr. Onan Kanabite, Universal Uncle and Deputy Adventurer.

209
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,780
Written December 1st, 2018.

210
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,480
And it's called, You Don't Know Who the Subgenius Is.

211
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,160
If there's one thing I've learned in the religion biz,

212
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,060
it's that you don't know who the subgenius is.

213
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,840
They're not always rich, nor poor as dirt.

214
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,480
And they sure don't all wear a Bob T. shirt.

215
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,860
They're the friend who dropped you in a rage.

216
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,100
Or the crazy preacher on the...

217
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,680
the stage.

218
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,340
Your neighbor's kid.

219
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,780
The garbage man.

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,920
The mutant seated at your right hand.

221
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,360
The mustached cop who's on the beat.

222
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,600
The mugger that mugged you downtown on the street.

223
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,620
The sad one.

224
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,800
The funny one.

225
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,420
The one that got away.

226
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,160
The pretty one.

227
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,480
The stinky one.

228
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,480
The one that doesn't run.

229
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,580
Yes, if there's one thing I've learned in the religion biz,

230
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,100
it's that you don't...

231
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,640
don't know who the subgenius is.

232
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,060
But in all this confusion, there's one thing that's true.

233
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,520
The only subgenius you must know...

234
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,020
is you.

235
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,940
Thank you, Reverend Dr. Onam Kanabike.

236
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,320
Oh, and I'm gonna throw in this little factoid here,

237
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,860
that came from...

238
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,140
The Economist.

239
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,540
The global suicide rate has dropped 29% since 2000,

240
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,500
apparently because of improvements in the quality of life.

241
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,700
That's the global suicide rate.

242
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:15,120
The U.S. suicide rate has risen 18% since 2000,

243
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,960
mostly because of the decline in quality of life

244
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,540
for white...

245
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,600
middle-aged men without college degrees.

246
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:27,700
Hmm.

247
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,880
Actually, that's technically me.

248
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,820
But I have not suffered...

249
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,140
a decline in quality of life.

250
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,240
Because I'm a self-educated man.

251
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,540
I don't have a college degree.

252
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,060
I have something much...

253
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,840
much better.

254
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:59,420
A lifetime of reading history, science, and literature.

255
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,880
Of all kinds.

256
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,900
I could probably teach...

257
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,020
several different college courses.

258
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,640
But don't worry, I won't.

259
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,380
I'm busy being the sacred scribe of the Church of the Subgenius.

260
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,040
Busy, sometimes.

261
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,820
Just slacking off.

262
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,880
This music in the background, by the way,

263
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,660
is from CyberChump,

264
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,200
from their album called...

265
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,300
Sankhara.

266
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,900
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

267
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,200
Praise Bob.

268
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,100
We're gonna be playing this song called...

269
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,100


270
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,460
...

271
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,140
...

272
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,320
...

273
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,380
...

274
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,380


275
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,940
Listen!

276
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,100
I'm a man!

277
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,840
I like to get paid when I'm done!

278
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,740
But this dude paid me at once!

279
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,220
But this deal felt all screwed up!

280
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,480
I had a sickening hunch!

281
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,520
He handed me an oily envelope...

282
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,900
I should've left it!

283
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,140
Still, he owed me $150, but inside was a single bill

284
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,180
$150 bill

285
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,920
$150 bill

286
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,960
Completely spent, ready to kill

287
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,560
$150 bill

288
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,080
I can't believe I'm saying this

289
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,360
Does this thing really look legit?

290
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,500
It's got that pyramid

291
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,200
And a hot dog at the tip

292
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,160
He said this bill will get you things when other bills won't do

293
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,600
Don't try to break it, he said

294
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,140
It'll end up breaking you

295
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,200
$150 bill

296
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,740
$150 bill

297
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,800
Completely spent, ready to kill

298
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,880
$150 bill

299
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:20,880


300
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,560
$150 bill

301
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,320
My mind said not to accept it

302
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,060
But my gut said take the loss

303
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,880
I'm determined to break this deal

304
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,420
Raise the nomination no matter what the cost

305
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,020
It's burning a hole in my pocket

306
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,620
All the way up to my goaler

307
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,040
I've gotta buy a little bit of time with

308
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,560
$150

309
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,140
$150 bill

310
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,380
$150 bill

311
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,760
Completely spent, ready to kill

312
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,880
$150 bill

313
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:46,540
You don't hear many rock bands that have a trombone as one of the main instruments.

314
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,660
I'll tell you the name of the band, which is Massive Hot Dog Recall.

315
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:01,600
And at the end of the show, I'll reveal more pertinent information about this unique band from Kent, Ohio.

316
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:13,200
I first saw them at the Devotional of 2016, and my old bud, Reverend Toth Wilder, recently sent me their album, Pissing in San Pedro.

317
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,520
Although for the broadcast stations, I have to...

318
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,700
I have to say that as urinating in San Pedro.

319
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,620
Here's a hint.

320
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Although the singer sounds like the late Zug's Rift, it's not the late Zug's Rift.

321
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,780
Draw your own conclusions.

322
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:41,200
Oh, and before the Onan poem and the Promiscua rant, we heard the song Normal by the great kings of feedback.

323
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,520
And, as almost always, our titles and news came first.

324
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,060
From Le Mer.

325
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,240
But now, let's call Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

326
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,360
Hello?

327
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,480
Dave!

328
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,800
Dave! Dave! Dave!

329
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:01,860
Yeah!

330
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,320
Is everything okay over there, Dave?

331
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,860
Well, I had my cervix removed, which was doing me no damage whatsoever.

332
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,520
But I just didn't like the idea of people, you know, calling me.

333
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,340
I just didn't want something that's service.

334
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,600
And not doing any service to anything.

335
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,560
Right. You didn't need it, particularly.

336
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,560
It's like an appendix, right?

337
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,380
Yeah.

338
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,600
Or tonsils, right?

339
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,640
More, you know, more like mayapples or a tourniquet or something, too.

340
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,680
Because you gotta make sure if you get the wrong kind of action going on, you could damage your wings.

341
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,640
Oh, yeah.

342
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,800
Your chicken wings.

343
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,400
Oh.

344
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,520
I think a lot of our listeners probably feel that way.

345
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:46,520


346
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:46,520


347
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,920
They feel like their wings have been clipped.

348
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,500
But then there's probably other ones that just feel like they can fly, fly, fly.

349
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,280
Are you making a comparison between the two types of subgenia?

350
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,580
Yeah, the depressed ones and the ones that are in their manic phase.

351
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,400
The morose and the be damned.

352
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,360
Yeah.

353
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:08,960
Yeah.

354
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,600
Yeah, I guess I'm in between tonight.

355
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,240
Well, your shoulder blade, you know, like a...

356
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,500
Shoulder blade.

357
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:16,500


358
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:16,600
Yeah.

359
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,300
A pound or so of pork with onion gravy on top of it.

360
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,920
You're king among men.

361
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,980
Actually, it's funny, Dave, because I removed my shoulder blade to let Buddy, the hound

362
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,960
dog, chew on it.

363
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,780
Well, that was a good idea because you didn't want him chewing on your chicken neck.

364
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,700
Exactly.

365
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,280
Yeah.

366
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,720
So it was just to quiet him down, you know, so he'd leave my neck alone.

367
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,100
Yeah, you gotta...

368
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,380
I have to compromise with these dogs sometimes.

369
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,120
You know?

370
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,720
They're...

371
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,520
I'm not sure who the boss is.

372
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,340
Sometimes it's me, but especially when I'm doing something they want me to do, then I'm

373
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:56,760
the boss.

374
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,720
So...

375
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,520
So where are you on that stepladder between manic and depressive?

376
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,160
Between bi and polar?

377
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,720
Yeah.

378
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,100
Synaptic-reversed.

379
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,700
Oh, okay.

380
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:22,760
Right.

381
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:22,760


382
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,100
Also, when BBC made a program for you guys — there's a plug, there's a little

383
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:31,420
trick, there's a little sellers, you'll never miss a single one.

384
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,420


385
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,420


386
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,460
what they've done to a bunch of hstuders.

387
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,820
They're local h colocos.

388
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,020
Yeah.

389
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,080


390
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:45,840
And, they just like a physician, and they kill cat понcör and mou I was announce

391
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,080
to a lady

392
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,080


393
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,080


394
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,940
awful fossils. There's awful dust

395
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,520
on this mixing

396
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,600
console of mine.

397
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,880
That's because of the experimental

398
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,080
spiders you put back there a couple months ago

399
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,500
that you keep on forgetting about.

400
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,140
I mean, it still

401
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,340
works, although the

402
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,640
VU meters don't work at all.

403
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,020
But I can see other VU meters

404
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,980
on my tiny little digital recorder

405
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,620
and they say everything sounds great!

406
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,160
Well, some of them are good

407
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,980
as surveillance units for keeping

408
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,840
up the blind, or the

409
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,940
Soviet hysterectomies and the

410
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,840
other people that are connected to the units.

411
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,140
It's worked so far.

412
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,900
Yeah. Well, everybody

413
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,060
gets a pay raise every couple

414
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,900
months and it makes them, you know,

415
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,760
motivated and stuff.

416
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,820
You know, they were getting

417
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,980
a pay raise until they shut down

418
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,580
the conspiracy.

419
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,500
And we thought that would be good.

420
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,560
We thought, oh great, they're going to shut down the conspiracy.

421
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,940
That'd be great. Well, all of a sudden

422
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,860
you know, money wouldn't buy you

423
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,940
anything and credit cards would get even less.

424
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,960
In fact, they'd

425
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,780
shoot at you just for remembering

426
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,820
what those were.

427
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,780
So it's been pretty bad since they shut the

428
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,840
conspiracy down.

429
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,800
Well, they must be accommodating the time

430
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,760
sphere then because, or the time

431
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,900
control X, because for that

432
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,240
phenomenal one,

433
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,360
a couple thousands of a moment,

434
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,660
you don't know if it really

435
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,540
happened or not.

436
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,740
And that's what blows a hole

437
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,500
in the whole fish.

438
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,440
It cleans everything wide asunder.

439
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,500
Oh, but

440
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,740
before I go any further, wasn't that a

441
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,800
great bunch of stuff that we just played

442
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
in the first half of the show? Man, that was such

443
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,380
great stuff. Oh, it was before I go. It was

444
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,900
wonderful. Yeah, I don't know what it is yet

445
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,720
but I know that I'll pick it and do little

446
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,600
credits and stuff and make

447
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,620
this whole thing last for one hour.

448
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,240
That's the hard part.

449
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,520
Making it last for

450
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,440
four hours is not that hard.

451
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,620
But

452
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,780
making it last for 30,

453
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,640
40 minutes is not that hard. But making

454
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,260
it hit that one hour sweet

455
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,500
spot, you know, that

456
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,760
G spot, the H spot actually

457
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,100
is like. Yeah, that's

458
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,220
the 59

459
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,600
minutes and

460
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,620
30 seconds mark. Oh, I thought you

461
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,360
were going to say it was a 1959 rubber

462
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,580
overturn. I wish. They were

463
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,460
a beautiful car.

464
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,980
Oh,

465
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,420
my

466
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,600
day that I was born

467
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,180
across the plain

468
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,040
from a red dust storm

469
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,520
first the wind

470
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,180
then the rain

471
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,720
streaks of blood

472
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,520
on the window pane

473
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,060
holding the roof

474
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,760
leg on the bed

475
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,780
baptism on the baby's

476
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,140
head

477
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,660
mama cried

478
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,300
The curse has come

479
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,840
The mark of the red man's on my son

480
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,940
The red man coming, he's coming for me

481
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,860
The red man coming

482
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,580
The red man coming, he's coming for me

483
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,400
The red man coming

484
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,840
I learned to crawl, learned to eat

485
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,700
Walk and talk, they double speak

486
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,540
Hide my heart, show my hand

487
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,360
Listen in the dark for the red man

488
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,100
He comes selling that dirt, stain your soul

489
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,540
Saying this don't hurt anyone at all

490
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,740
Just sink your eyes into little girl laws

491
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,060
But don't waste your time, it don't wash off

492
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,260
The red man coming, he's coming for me

493
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,220
The red man coming

494
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,820
The red man coming

495
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,880
The red man coming, he's coming for me

496
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,820
The red man coming

497
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:57,260
The red man coming

498
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,380
Late in life, I fell in love uptown

499
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,100
With a one-on-one who'd been around

500
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,040
I said, how my love, did you lose your hand?

501
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,860
She said, pound of flesh for the red man

502
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,860
A daughter born, a father sees

503
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,280
There's red in the thread of the webby weave

504
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,500
Clean his clothes in the holy phone

505
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,160
But the rank of the red will come back to haunt

506
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,120
The red man coming, he's coming for me

507
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,060
The red man coming

508
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,820
The red man coming, he's coming for me

509
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,660
You won't find the red man coming

510
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,500
Just call me his name

511
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,920
порядon Again and again

512
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,760
Just once in your life

513
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:55,760


514
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:55,840
He's coming for me

515
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:55,840


516
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,220
The red man coming

517
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,640
Just once again Then once more

518
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,940
Just once again Then once again

519
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,080
guitar solo

520
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,580
Red horse sits on a telephone call

521
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,760
Watch to see which way I go

522
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,140
When I fall and when I stand

523
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,120
And tells it all to the red man

524
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,800
Red man coming, he's coming for me

525
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,640
Red man coming

526
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,340
Red man coming, he's coming for me

527
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,300
Red man coming

528
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,600
Red man coming

529
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,720
Red man coming

530
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,780
Ah, yes, dear friends.

531
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,100
Did I mention that this is hour of Slack number 1719?

532
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,380
And did I mention that that spooky song I just played,

533
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,740
Reddle Man Coming, is by the Rainmakers?

534
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,760
It's one of their spooky Stephen King type songs,

535
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,660
sort of like Lakeview Man.

536
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,380
Incidentally, Stephen King is also a big fan of the Rainmakers,

537
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,940
and there's even a YouTube video of him

538
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,240
driving home in his car,

539
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,080
singing along with the song Hooty Hoo,

540
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,500
terribly.

541
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,820
Now, this.

542
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,280
From PR News in Washington,

543
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,280
I'm sexually assaulted by a secret atomic humpback whale

544
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,220
of a secret warehouse just outside the capital of the USA.

545
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,060
That won't happen.

546
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,000
On Wall Street, 54% and 39 Twitter happy states

547
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,620
at the height of 39% and 54 states,

548
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,380
fresh Chesapeake blue crab says effective October 1st.

549
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,840
This is PR News in Washington.

550
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,360
Well, now, um, so,

551
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,020
so now that we've gotten the,

552
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,980
the credits out of the way,

553
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,140
I have two little news items that I've saved

554
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,180
to, to, uh, read to you, Dave.

555
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,100
And one of them is, uh, bi,

556
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,340
and one is polar.

557
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,100
Or rather, one is manic,

558
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,580
and the other one is depressive.

559
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,340
Let me do the manic, the depressive one first,

560
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,420
and then when I read the manic one,

561
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,800
it'll cheer everybody up.

562
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,760
It doesn't require any,

563
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,160
you jumping around or playing with your navel or anything?

564
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,720
No, no, they're real short.

565
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,000
Okay.

566
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:32,800
They're, uh,

567
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,140
I get this, uh, weekly news magazine called The Week,

568
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,960
and it kind of summarizes the,

569
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,860
the right wing and the left wing views of things

570
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,400
and the middle of the road view,

571
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,620
and then you can make up your own view from that.

572
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,840
Uh, they actually do a pretty good job

573
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,780
of, of showing both completely opposite sides.

574
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,440
Anyway, um, here's this guy.

575
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,640
Somebody has a pretty bad name.

576
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,780
Farhad Mandi.

577
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,080
In Jew.

578
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,300
In the New York Times was pondering,

579
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,360
and he, he, he pondered this.

580
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,960
I've been a technology journalist for nearly 20 years

581
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,040
and a tech devotee even longer.

582
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,380
Over that time, I've been obsessed

583
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,060
with how the digital experience scrambles

584
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,300
how we make sense of the real world.

585
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,500
Technology may have liberated us from the old gatekeepers,

586
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,760
but it has also created a culture

587
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,360
of choose-your-own-fact niches.

588
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,660
Elevated conspiracy thinking

589
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,880
to the center of public consciousness

590
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,200
and brought the incessant nightmare

591
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,480
of high school clique drama

592
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,680
to every human endeavor.

593
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,860
It also skewed our experience of daily reality.

594
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,860
Objectively, the world is better than ever,

595
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,100
but the digital world inevitably makes everyone feel worse.

596
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,260
Are you waiting for my, uh, reaction?

597
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,720
No, not really, because you're kind of immune.

598
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,780
You're immune to that whole digital world, aren't you?

599
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,040
You don't need that false progress.

600
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,540
As Bernard used to call it.

601
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,140
Well, I personally love it, but sometimes it, uh, you know,

602
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,160
in and out of institutions so many times recently.

603
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,360
Oh, did you hear that, that dog squeal?

604
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,940
Yeah, it sounds like a dog honking a horn or a steel.

605
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,700
You know what that means?

606
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,260
That, that one means get back up here and get to work

607
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,460
so that you can have time to baby us sooner.

608
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,540
Because I don't think I'm working now,

609
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,340
so I'm downstairs at this table.

610
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,200
The Tarzan's radio station table.

611
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,420
I only sit at it once a week or every two or three weeks.

612
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,660
I think it bothers him.

613
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,960
But anyway, here's some good news.

614
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,340
Okay, this is really strange.

615
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,560
I didn't know quite what to think about this.

616
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,560
Um, somebody named Nicholas Kristof.

617
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,700
Oh, once again, it's the New York Times.

618
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,400
Everybody knows that the world is going to hell,

619
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,360
but...

620
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,260
Let me try to make the case that 2018 was actually

621
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,340
the best year in human history.

622
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,560
It's the nature of the news business to focus on disasters,

623
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,460
war, starvation, and environmental threats.

624
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,620
But such coverage leaves most people spectacularly misinformed.

625
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,840
In polls, 90% of Americans say global poverty is getting worse

626
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,620
or not improving.

627
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,820
In fact, poverty is rapidly retreating.

628
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,700
In the early 1980s,

629
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,820
44% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty,

630
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,980
defined as less than $2 per person per day.

631
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,380
Sound familiar, Dave?

632
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,700
Now, fewer than 10% live in extreme poverty.

633
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,200
Every day, on average, last year,

634
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,700
295,000 people gained electricity for the first time,

635
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,940
305,000 got clean drinking water for the first time,

636
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,680
and another 620,000 were hooked up to the internet.

637
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,660
I guess the internet comes before clean drinking water.

638
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,800
Lifespans and literacy are rapidly increasing.

639
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,460
Well, everywhere but the USA.

640
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,040
Everywhere but the United States.

641
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,440
Yeah.

642
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,200
It may seem Pollyanna-ish to celebrate these victories,

643
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:24,120
but a failure to acknowledge global progress can leave people feeling helpless,

644
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,100
hopeless and ready to give up.

645
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,340
What has already been accomplished should show us what is possible,

646
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,660
and help fuel our future.

647
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:32,660


648
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,640
We need to make more efforts to make the world a better place.

649
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:43,400
So turn in your shoes and lock step march into tomorrow.

650
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,040
Right through in that last part.

651
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,480
I'm coming, mother.

652
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,220
Yeah, I stole it from the fire signs.

653
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,120
Your clam cakes, by the way, I've been trying to tell you for the last six or seven weeks

654
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,000
that your clam cakes are indeed damper than they should be this time of year.

655
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,260
Well, that's okay.

656
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,980
I've got enough little grope clusters here to chew on.

657
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,460
We just quoted Fire Sign Theater.

658
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,000
It always makes me want to punch people in the face.

659
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,820
When they do that to you?

660
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,440
Yeah, they quote Fire Sign Theater or Frank Zappa.

661
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,960
Either one, I just want to punch them in the nose.

662
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,000
It's like, yeah, I know where that came from.

663
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,440
I heard that album 100,000 times when I was in college too.

664
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,000
Now we're 60 years old and nobody knows what that means.

665
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,500
So just blow it off, man.

666
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,540
Forget it.

667
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,900
It's over with.

668
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,940
Actually, we-

669
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:46,840
Did you ever see the lights in the distance like of a buoy, like an aqualine buoy that

670
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,240
I can see out in the harbor that bops around?

671
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,320
Those are really, you know, that's what the conspiracy tries to convince you.

672
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,160
They're just buoys.

673
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,320
But I think they're UFOs.

674
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,660
They're, well, UBOs.

675
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,240
Unidentified Bios.

676
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,240


677
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,040
Bouncing objects.

678
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,380
Oh, I thought it was-

679
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,380
Or UFOs.

680
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,900
Unidentified floating objects.

681
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,920
That makes more sense.

682
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,380
Yeah.

683
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,120
Yeah, especially, why not give credit where credit is due?

684
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,780
You're the guy with the testicles.

685
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,440
You should know the angular area, the whole thing.

686
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,460
You modeled it out thousands of times with the lieutenant.

687
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,360
But you're the one with the buoys.

688
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,500
That's why you were so famous under the name David Bowie.

689
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,960
Yeah, but that was a different incarnation.

690
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,220
And I pretended I was a buoy.

691
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,220


692
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,340
I did.

693
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,840
I guess I've been pretending that for a long time now.

694
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,800
A couple years, I guess.

695
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,140
What?

696
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,180
You've been pretending?

697
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,140
But praise Bob!

698
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,600
That's great.

699
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,240
But then what is that smell?

700
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,340
That's Bob's smell.

701
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:46,700
Oh.

702
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,320
That's the smell of not only the pipe, but the person smoking it.

703
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,480
But you've only been near Bob once that I know of.

704
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,160
I guess it really clings to you, huh?

705
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,200
So that's some kind of trans-Arabian bin-bomb?

706
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,200


707
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,900
Been here, Bob, not once.

708
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,360
Dogs always want to roll on Bob because he has that kind of stink like a dead thing.

709
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,580
Yeah, but they also want to eat all the cookies and puke on each other, you know?

710
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,160
Just like humans and other primates do.

711
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,080
Well, it depends on what's in the cookies.

712
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,580
You know, if they're those medical kind of cookies and, you know, when somebody pukes,

713
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,040
everybody else wants to rush in there and, you know, get some.

714
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,000
They're like, hey, it's still good.

715
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,200
Yeah.

716
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,560
It's still got the stuff in it.

717
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:42,900
It needs to be regularized by the standards and mediocrity union or the participants of

718
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,780
the, you know, the participants there.

719
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:49,920
They need to have some standards set because I'd say like, you know, you eat a pound of

720
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,680
butter and a whole pound of herbal philosophy.

721
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,560
And you do that and you're liable to walk around the streets asking what time zone you're

722
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:58,760
in.

723
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,980
Well, there is already—

724
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,000
Except for happening in Iran.

725
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,020
Yeah.

726
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,100
I ran out of gas, too.

727
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,000
It was like an unusual incident, but it never really happened in my—well, it did happen

728
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,840
to my body.

729
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:16,200
But somehow, that's what I think is scary about those cookies is everything just changed

730
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,380
like as rapidly as it went the other way.

731
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,100
You know what I mean, don't you?

732
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,480
Yeah, sure, sure.

733
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:23,960
Oh, sure.

734
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,920
Of course.

735
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,400
Yeah, well, you were always real clear and sensible.

736
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,980
Usually, Dave, I figure out what you mean by that.

737
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:31,980


738
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:31,980


739
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:31,980


740
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:31,980


741
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,860
I mean, about the third time I hear the recording.

742
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,040
Well, thank God we were all born without vaginas because we could be in a lot of trouble right

743
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,340
now with the sodium police.

744
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,260
Speak for yourself.

745
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,420
Well, you know better and so do I.

746
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:52,740
I mean, I happen to be, you know, handicapped that way, but I've got a little dog here.

747
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,040
It's all she's got is a vagina.

748
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,060
She's got ten nipples, man.

749
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,880
And she lets me get to second base.

750
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,960
That's a good nickname for me.

751
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:01,960


752
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:01,960


753
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:01,960


754
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:01,960


755
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:01,960


756
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,120
I think sometimes there's like 12 teeth, you know, and there's ten.

757
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:13,440
And I used to ridicule them damn dogs just like, hey, ten teeth, get in there, you know,

758
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:13,800
and stuff.

759
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,680
And they walk in like, sure, I can feed a whole family of eight or nine or ten.

760
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:27,900
But I didn't want to because I was, what is it, staying?

761
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,520
Yeah.

762
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,380
Are we on the radio?

763
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,020
Yeah.

764
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:37,660
I used to play this cassette on the radio a long, long time ago.

765
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,120
I haven't heard it in years and years.

766
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,320
I have no idea what episode it's on or what it's even called, but it had some kind of

767
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,080
avant-garde music.

768
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:53,500
And then it was mixed over that was this old man talking about, he starts out saying, dogs

769
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,940
has always been my friend.

770
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,660
And he goes on and on talking about this dog.

771
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,000
And it's kind of this.

772
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,320
This specific dog.

773
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,340
He's the most faithful and loyal and he's going on and on like this.

774
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,600
And it's kind of touching.

775
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:18,540
And just the other day, about 35 years later, I realized from something I was reading who

776
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,920
that old guy was.

777
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,580
It was Lyndon Baines Johnson.

778
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,340
Oh, yeah.

779
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,880
He had put out a record album.

780
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,800
Somebody had gotten into the White House.

781
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,980
Or maybe it was after he retired or something.

782
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:30,980


783
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,720
And got a recording of him just rambling on and on about dogs.

784
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,080
Especially this one dog he liked.

785
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:46,800
And it was the name of it was something about like, dogs have always been my friend.

786
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:51,820
Except that he, I swear, he said, dogs has always been my friend.

787
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,580
It's highly likely because to preclude any kind of grammatical error on his part is certainly

788
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:57,880
not.

789
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,900
Just think of Richard Milhous Nixon.

790
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,880
They're all of us.

791
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,680
They're all of us.

792
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,240
But they all have the same category and the same bloodlines and everything like that.

793
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,100
They were first they were with the Soviet encampment.

794
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,480
Then they turned out it was 1992 already.

795
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,000
Oh, no.

796
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,460
They're all related to the Tsar.

797
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,680
Yeah, the Tsar of the Romanov.

798
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,340
What's his name?

799
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,600
Willy, Willy Wanker.

800
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,240
Yeah.

801
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:22,920
Well, he's he they, you know, Bob took him and his family off to Argentina a long time

802
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,320
ago.

803
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,700
He turned up a real good cover story that even they even found the bones of the Tsar

804
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,460
in his family.

805
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,540
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.

806
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,180
Yep.

807
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:41,260
And it's a good thing we get to take a bath in the sodium lime once in a while to cleanse ourselves and purify our sins.

808
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:49,420
Because, you know, we have had quite a few sins over the last few millenniums or, I mean, millennia.

809
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,940
Well, tell me about those sins.

810
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,780
The Tsarina is my great-great-great-grandmother.

811
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,160
But the Tsar Nicholas was not my great-great-great-grandfather.

812
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,320
Can you guess who my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather was?

813
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:07,980
Rasputin.

814
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,020
That's, here you go.

815
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,760
Gregor Rasputin, the mad monk.

816
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,920
And he had a lot to be mad about.

817
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:27,080
He told them, if any of you nobles kill me, the entire Russian state, the monarchy, will be completely destroyed within six months.

818
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:27,900
And it came true.

819
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,860
Some nobles killed him, and six months later?

820
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,640
There was no Russian monarchy at all.

821
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:40,200
The whole revolution happened, and my great-great-great-great-grandmother and grandcousins were in jail.

822
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,760
Yep.

823
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,000
It was a nice jail until they got machine gunned.

824
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,100
Yeah, they treated him well until they stopped treating him well.

825
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:57,420
But you've got to remember that the Tsarists killed Lenin's brother over really specious reasons just to make a, that, you know,

826
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,960
Lenin was part of the early, early, early, early, early.

827
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:08,220
Early, early, early, middle class arising in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union in Russia at the time,

828
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:15,000
which was basically two classes, the aristocrats, the aristocrats, not the joke, the aristocrats.

829
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,520
Right.

830
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:28,260
The aristocrats and the serfs, the people, the poor, the peasants, the whole freaking huge country full of poor people that are practically owned by other people.

831
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,540
Can you imagine?

832
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:30,960
Can you imagine?

833
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,740
A country like that?

834
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,800
That would just be horrible.

835
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:50,080
Where the poor people have so little money compared to the super aristocrats that they're practically owned and have to slave away most of their day doing tedious stuff they really have no emotional connection to for people they'll never meet.

836
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,360
Owned, I tell you.

837
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:59,480
Sting, are you saying that this country could be ripe for revolutionary fervor based upon what you just said?

838
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,520
No, I think every country.

839
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,060
Every country is pretty much.

840
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:02,480
They're all.

841
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,860
But it's too late.

842
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,140
It ain't going to happen.

843
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,100
The only way.

844
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,040
Yeah, the iconoclaps.

845
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,040
I mean, the subgeniuses don't have too much longer to worry about it.

846
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,880
In about four months, we'll be out.

847
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,420
We'll be off this mud ball.

848
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,620
Yeah, but Bob always promises so much.

849
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,480
It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

850
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,540
And then when we meet again in three weeks.

851
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,360
Well, but that's what the.

852
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,760
You know, that's the faith part.

853
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,140
You have to have faith in the face.

854
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:41,520
I guess I guess I'll just believe and have faith the way the Christians used to make me want to do it when I was a little school boy or towards women.

855
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,580
I was a 53 year old woman with a bad hangover.

856
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,880
That was a headbang.

857
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,740
And that's what it said.

858
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,960
I forgot again.

859
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,920
Well, you got me talking about Bob and, you know, my boss.

860
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,140
And I started thinking, you know, he must be watching me from somewhere.

861
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,820
He's a pig.

862
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,880
I'm not in my.

863
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,000
I'm in my office.

864
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,000
It's like you can't escape him.

865
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,540
There's piles and piles of them.

866
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:22,600
But I was thinking I'm safe here because the only faces on my in my immediate view are a monster high character and some choking hazard characters, joking hazard characters.

867
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,460
It's a card game.

868
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,080
But then I turned around.

869
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,100
Yeah, sure enough.

870
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,400
There's a Dobbs head.

871
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,380
In fact, it's a 3D one with a fez on.

872
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,760
It's a mask.

873
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,840
It's a really good mask that Joe Riley made from John Hagenbrenner sculpt.

874
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:50,080
And then I and then I did have the misfortune of putting up a poster that has this piece of art that Paul Mavridis drew from my idea.

875
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,560
And it has that damn face staring at me.

876
00:45:54,220 --> 00:46:00,500
And there's also a Dobbs for a to kind of a vampire looking rubber mask.

877
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,840
This guy called Sick Rick makes.

878
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,160
You can get you can actually get Bob rubber masks now.

879
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,800
They're about 100 bucks.

880
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,040
But but they're good.

881
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,720
They're hand painted and they're creepy.

882
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,140
Really creepy looking.

883
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,320
Scary.

884
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,520
You can actually.

885
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,600
And you are marketing them.

886
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,980
I just I just said it's Sick Rick.

887
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,500
But it's spelled with just a K.

888
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,460
There's no C like S.

889
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:24,640
I.

890
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:24,860
K.

891
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,420
R.

892
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:25,740
I.

893
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:25,960
K.

894
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,300
Dot com.

895
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,180
Sick Rick.

896
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,100
No.

897
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,100
Sick Rick masks.

898
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,040
People.

899
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:31,700
Oh, yeah.

900
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,060
Right.

901
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,120
Sick Rick masks dot com.

902
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,540
And I haven't been spreading the word about that around enough.

903
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,580
But you can actually get a Bob head mask.

904
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,280
I can say that because.

905
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,120
Beautiful idea.

906
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,160
I don't get any money for it.

907
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,720
Although I later on, I will get a mask.

908
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,040
You know, every 10 masks or so he sells.

909
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,520
I get I get one.

910
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,980
I think I've got three.

911
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,280
But they're not here.

912
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,260
The only one I have here is the dead Bob mask.

913
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,460
It's hand painted in black and white.

914
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,900
So it's more like the Bob's real face.

915
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,720
Once you try that at the bank tomorrow, come in there with a different head.

916
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,120
So.

917
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:10,600
Right.

918
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,760
And we're in different dollars.

919
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,220
Massage.

920
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,440
You rip each one off.

921
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,180
Man.

922
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:16,600
No.

923
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,640
Because see, everybody around here is a good guy with a gun.

924
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,160
They're all packing and they have been forever.

925
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:28,540
You know, they everybody in Texas has a gun in their pocket.

926
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,200
But that movie come hell.

927
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:30,920
Or high water.

928
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:31,860
Yeah.

929
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,180
You walk into the wrong bank getting robbed and everybody in the bank has a gun to shoot back at you.

930
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,700
Actually, I've never seen that movie, but I think that it just got onto Netflix.

931
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:52,620
Well, let's just hope that it honors its traditions of thousands of years now, especially since the Fukuwazis family came to California.

932
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,140
Well, it's probably been colorized or something.

933
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,940
It has to have been because the Fukuwazis family was making fine sodium.

934
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:06,480
Prince back in the nineteen forty five before the first hydrogen explosion occurred spontaneously.

935
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,520
Of course, they're not directed by any power mad crazy people or anything like that.

936
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,560
It's just, you know, we have to stop the war quicker to make it go faster.

937
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,080
Well, that's why they keep explaining it.

938
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,240
And it's always mission accomplished.

939
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,140
Yeah.

940
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,900
But we still always on the road of having to blow everybody else.

941
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:30,640
Up in the world.

942
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,120
Oh, I know.

943
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,080
So many of them.

944
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,520
They got their building up excuses to have wars with everybody at once.

945
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:42,940
Now, China, Korea, Venezuela, just Brazil.

946
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,720
No, Brazil is on our side now.

947
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,180
Well, they become they're run by fascists now.

948
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,660
So technically.

949
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,400
Brazil just elected a Brazilian Trump.

950
00:48:59,380 --> 00:48:59,440
Yeah.

951
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,600
There's been a lot of that.

952
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:02,820
Yeah.

953
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:12,680
So I think what we're looking at right here is pretty soon they want to secure the mineral rights to much of this area called Latin America.

954
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,040
Yeah.

955
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:19,780
You wouldn't want to be a Brazilian Indian right now because there's a bulldozer right outside your hut.

956
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,360
They just sold all of the rainforest to lumber companies.

957
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:28,880
Not only are they shooting you if you're an activist of any kind or even.

958
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,220
Part of a tribal structure that wants to make you wants to complain.

959
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,460
It's better off.

960
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:39,680
You just arm them, give them guns and kind of deputize them to let cut down their own forest and take credit for it.

961
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:48,100
Well, but remember all that good news I read just a little while ago.

962
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:52,700
It was the best year ever for people who had no drinking water at all.

963
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,400
Three two hundred ninety five thousand more got no three hundred five thousand got drinking water.

964
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,360
For the first time every day.

965
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,180
Of two thousand.

966
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,220
Somebody got new.

967
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,640
Where's my fridge.

968
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,700
Where's my clean drinking water.

969
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,420
Wait a minute.

970
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,200
I'm drinking this.

971
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,740
This this Agua fraca.

972
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,740
Here in oil country.

973
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,200
You know.

974
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,360
You have to be a dowser.

975
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,320
You have to know where to poke around with sticks and it'll lead you to oil.

976
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,720
I mean to water.

977
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,100
Right.

978
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,440
But it's all tainted water.

979
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,380
See, it's all been.

980
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,380


981
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,380


982
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,380


983
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,380


984
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,380


985
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,380


986
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,380


987
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,380


988
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,380


989
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,380


990
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,380


991
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:43,340
Frack kind of flavored with that fracking juice that makes the water a little bit tougher and thicker so it can hydraulically force the gas and oil up.

992
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,540
That's the whole.

993
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,480
I mean, sealed up the country pretty quickly.

994
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,300
Haven't they stained.

995
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,420
And we can.

996
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,780
What would Bob say about such a thing?

997
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,480
Because he's in such a creditable.

998
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,120
He already said it.

999
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,460
He said it in the 1950s.

1000
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:03,360
I forget which month or year, but he said it's going to be a bummer, man.

1001
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:04,820
Yeah.

1002
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,620
Case closed.

1003
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:06,760
Prophecy fulfilled.

1004
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,760
Just like the hooks of Norway.

1005
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,560
You know, that's the way they get you to.

1006
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,440
If you want to go ice skating in the wrong pond, you might as well pull off your jockstrap right there.

1007
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:20,600
And if Bob prophesies something and it happens, well, that's a prophecy.

1008
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,000
That's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

1009
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,160
Yeah.

1010
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:28,440
Even if he didn't exactly want it, if he says it's going to happen like a.

1011
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:28,440


1012
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:28,440


1013
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:28,440


1014
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:28,440


1015
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:28,440


1016
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:28,440


1017
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:28,440


1018
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:28,440


1019
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:28,440


1020
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,580
Like it's going to be a bummer.

1021
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,140
Well, it was.

1022
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,480
Because he said so.

1023
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:39,420
It stinks up the atmosphere anyway, and you're bound to believe it's the next one from one

1024
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:39,840
to another.

1025
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,460
I.

1026
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,100
I.

1027
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,500
I.

1028
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,320
I.

1029
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:58,760
I.

1030
00:51:59,360 --> 00:51:59,360


1031
00:51:59,360 --> 00:51:59,440
I.

1032
00:51:59,440 --> 00:51:59,640
I.

1033
00:51:59,640 --> 00:51:59,640


1034
00:51:59,640 --> 00:51:59,980
I.

1035
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:26,940
I.

1036
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,460
I.

1037
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:34,720


1038
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,060
I.

1039
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,560
I.

1040
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:41,460
How can I go out.

1041
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:48,820
Why you growing up.

1042
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,420
Just a bird, not a butterfly?

1043
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:52,620
I mean.

1044
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:52,620


1045
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:52,620


1046
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:52,620


1047
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:52,620


1048
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:52,620


1049
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:52,680
Anyway, and then.

1050
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:52,700
You know what, I think, a lot about that, is that drewЭI don't know.

1051
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:52,700


1052
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:52,700


1053
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:52,700


1054
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:52,700


1055
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:52,700


1056
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:52,780
And we're às.

1057
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:52,780


1058
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:52,780


1059
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:52,780


1060
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:52,780


1061
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:53,080
No, he's going to wear a hat.

1062
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,360
He must have broke down

1063
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,860
I'm broken down

1064
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:14,580
Yeah, I'm broken down

1065
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,480
I'll pay the ransom, the rent, the loan

1066
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,360
I'll be spent when the money's gone

1067
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,000
But I'll never leave, don't fear

1068
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,220
I'll just stay right here and disappear

1069
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,920
I'm broken down

1070
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,680
I'm broken down

1071
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,400
I'm broken, I'm broken down

1072
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,320
Well, I'm broken down

1073
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,720
Well, we're rockin' now.

1074
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:57,360
Broken Down, performed by Bob Walkenhorst and Jeff Porter of The Rainmakers,

1075
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:03,500
although that particular recording comes from a DVD of a Bob Walkenhorst live show

1076
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,840
called Live and On Purpose 2006.

1077
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,400
We almost had him at Starwood Festival last year,

1078
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:16,440
but I'm glad we didn't because I didn't get to go to Starwood last year myself.

1079
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,240
But to end the show on an upbeat,

1080
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,600
I'm going to play another song by Massive Hot Dog Recall,

1081
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,180
a very special song, one I can identify with,

1082
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,340
called Goat in My Car.

1083
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,100
I don't actually have a goat in my car most of the time,

1084
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,100
but my brother has about a hundred goats right down the hill from me,

1085
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,520
and he has definitely had a goat in his car.

1086
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,780
In fact, the goat was trying to drive the car.

1087
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,940
And yes, I have JPEGs to prove it.

1088
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,460
Anyway,

1089
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:56,420
this song will reveal the other connection the Church of the Subgenius has with Massive Hot Dog Recall.

1090
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,100
Goat in My Car

1091
00:54:59,100 --> 00:54:59,800
Goat in My Car

1092
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,220
Goat in My Car

1093
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:06,840
Goat in My Car

1094
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:06,880
Goat in My Car

1095
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,800
Goat in My Car

1096
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,980
Goat in My Car

1097
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:10,240
Goat in My Car

1098
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,260
Goat in My Car

1099
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,180
Goat in My Car

1100
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,920
Goat in My Car

1101
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,820
Goat in My Car

1102
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,820
Got a goat that lives in my car

1103
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:44,160
Who explains that the way that the universe is turned around

1104
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,760
Trying to tell me even though I'm a tool I can still have a little fun

1105
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,220
Driving around with a goat in my car

1106
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,320
Holy shit, there's a goat in my car

1107
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,980
Tell Rusty there's a goat in my car

1108
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,160
Tell my boss there's a goat in my car

1109
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:23,980
Eating garbage is an attribute commonly applied to goats

1110
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:29,040
But my goat will have you know it's just a metaphor for being an asshole

1111
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:34,640
Things get stinky when he forces his opinion

1112
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,060
And by opinion I mean he's packing those big old goat balls

1113
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:43,220
Up to the back of my head from the backseat of my car

1114
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:43,620
Yeah!

1115
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,080
I got a goat in my car

1116
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:52,200
Don't tell the cops there's a goat in my car

1117
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,560
Tell El Chapo there's a goat in my car

1118
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,960
Tell your broker there's a goat in my car

1119
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,060
Don't worry, until anyone and everybody is delayed

1120
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,060


1121
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,060


1122
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,060


1123
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,400
I don't know why it société

1124
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,520
I don't know why she decir

1125
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,280
I bought it in a small coin şekilde

1126
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,380
JeLove

1127
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:35,380


1128
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,740
I went to the electrician

1129
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,720
I'm hungry

1130
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,240
You should go to the Tesla

1131
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,300
I've been trying to get rid of this thing for years

1132
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,040
Like when we stop for gas

1133
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,520
Or burritos

1134
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,380
Or simply just to take a leak

1135
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,340
Cause I've had it up to here

1136
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,280
With these views on modern art history

1137
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,900
Coming around with a gun in my car

1138
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,980
Tell your yoga pants there's a boat in my car

1139
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,180
Tell Chris Bannon there's a 30-pack in the bridge

1140
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,800
Tell General Boy there's a goat in my car

1141
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:39,080
Okay, Massive Hot Dog Recall.

1142
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:39,960
One of the most important shows of all time.

1143
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:39,960


1144
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,700
One of my favorite new bands

1145
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:45,160
Because who else does trombone solos

1146
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,160
And has a goat in their car?

1147
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,400
Herb Alpert never had a goat in his car.

1148
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,280
Anyway, the trombone player and singer is Al Mothersbaugh

1149
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,640
A cousin of Mark and Bob Mothersbaugh of Devo

1150
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,080
And of Amy Mothersbaugh

1151
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:06,080
An artist who runs a cool art gallery at Cuyahoga Falls

1152
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,640
Called Studio 2091

1153
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,400
Over the years I think I've met practically the whole Mothersbaugh clan

1154
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,960
Including the late great General Boy

1155
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,780
A patriarch of the Devo's

1156
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:25,880
Al Mothersbaugh also runs Akron Glass Tinting

1157
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:30,500
Which recently renovated the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile

1158
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,280
Small world, friends

1159
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,980
But all the important parts of the small world

1160
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:38,440

1161

00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,320
Let Bob be praised

1167
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,020
Praised and paid

1168
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,060
Pay Bob
