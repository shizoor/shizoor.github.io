1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
Congratulations! You've made a firm decision, a strong commitment to unwind, to relax, and enjoy the slack you need.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:21,800
Now, in a few moments, I'm going to give you a series of suggestions that will help you to reinforce this commitment that you've made to create this positive and permanent change in your life.

3
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,840
Brothers and sisters, the self-genius, our own spark!

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,480
We're back!

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,100
Oh, that's right, everybody's been here for three hours drinking.

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,020
The book club, I hope you enjoyed your literary discussions.

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:55,680
But now, as part of an X-Day tradition, and also it's a weekly show in San Francisco, we're about to do the Ask Dr. Howell show.

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,980
You'll have to wait.

9
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,160
You'll have to pay to have that question answered.

11
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,200
And obviously, at least one subgenius sent us one penny.

12
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:20,100
That statement won't mean a lot to the folks who listen to Hour of Slack only on broadcast radio from their local college or independent station,

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,280
because you people don't even hear certain episodes, the X-rated internet-only ones.

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,980
For the internet listeners, this episode's very interesting.

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,720
It's a great way to help people understand how the internet works.

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,080
And it's a great way to help people understand how the internet works.

17
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,700
And it's a great way to help people understand how the internet works.

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:48,100
For the previous episode, the one only heard on the internet, number 1327.5XXX, marked a critical turning point.

19
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,680
It was almost the last Hour of Slack.

20
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:57,120
But I can't explain why on this broadcast PG-rated episode.

21
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,080
And here's why I can't explain it.

22
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Some of you may not know this, but by law, on non-commercial public college or community stations,

23
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,940
I can't raise money for myself or the Church of the Subgenius.

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,420
I can't raise money for anybody except the station.

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,780
I can't even say, you've got to go see this band.

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,980
The most I can say is, you might be interested in this band that's playing at such-and-such next Saturday.

27
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,580
Or for more information, see subgenius.com.

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,520
That's what they mean by non-commercial.

29
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,800
And the subgenius thing isn't just this show.

30
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:42,360
For one thing, it's my actual real job, because the church also does a whole lot of other media,

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,120
like books and even events.

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:53,080
Now, if you go to subgenius.com and click the radio button at the top, you can hear

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,580
not only last week's X-Rated Internet Only show, but all the previous ones.

34
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,520
In fact, all previous hours of Slack, almost all of them, in uncensored form.

35
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,660
Also, hundreds of previous episodes of the Puzzling Evidence show,

36
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,920
Susie the Flusie's Bob's Slacktime Funhouse from WREK Atlanta,

37
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,180
Phineas Narco's National Cynical podcast, and the Ministry of Slack podcast.

38
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,800
If you do listen to last week's show, it's more than an hour.

39
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,100
It has cuss words like crazy.

40
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:37,480
And at the end is a 14-minute rant by me that calmly explains a very dire situation.

41
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,420
A situation that threatened the show's existence, even the whole church.

42
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,080
But it's the kind of situation I can't talk about on this station.

43
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,520
You know, I edit a few cuss words out of all broadcast hours of Slack.

44
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,800
The internet version, which has been free, but won't be forever.

45
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,940
At least not quite the same way.

46
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,660
Has the cuss words.

47
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:09,040
Now there's some songs or rants or whatnots that would simply be totally wrecked if I

48
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,120
cut the naughty words.

49
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,600
And when enough of those clips build up, I do those X-Rated non-broadcast shows, generally

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,580
about two a year.

51
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:25,840
That last X-Rated show was really funny until the end when it got really serious.

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,780
That's the thing.

53
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,040
The bottom line is, there's been some news in subgenius land that we can't talk about

54
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,320
on the non-commercial radio.

55
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:40,900
And because advertisers and executives are, by definition, such total chicken shits, I

56
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,580
long ago quit even trying to sell it to commercial stations.

57
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,560
It's like trying to get a vampire to go to church.

58
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,380
Ain't gonna happen.

59
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,820
Anyway, if you like this show, be glad you're hearing it at all, and next time your local

60
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,040
station has a pledge drive, pay attention and do something besides listen.

61
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,060
Give the station money.

62
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,160
The more perceptive of my listeners can see what I'm getting at, and the less perceptive

63
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,540
are free to download the X-Rated show from subgenius.com.

64
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:25,580
The true children of Bob, the people who helped us out in our time of need, I cannot thank

65
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:32,140
you enough, except by continuing to make this darn old show.

66
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,380
And, uh, so let's get back to it.

67
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:46,540
Oh, by the way, the titles in this show were by Pope Zarka of Radio Eschaton on WCNI, Connecticut.

68
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,580
It's one of our newest stations.

69
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,120
And the music in the background right now is Reverend DJ Two Beans.

70
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,560
Oh, yeah.

71
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,660
Uh, Two Beans live at the X Day non-rave.

72
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,100
And now back to Ask Dr. Howell at X Day.

73
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,000
Drill number 14.

74
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,060
Price bomb.

75
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,180
Dear friends, I, Dr. Howell and Dowell, am now here to answer your questions.

76
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,480
Your questions must be written in orthographic form.

77
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,540
Use the pencils and pens which have been provided for you.

78
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,060
And then write them down with the kindliness and charity of Ivan Stang.

79
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:36,340
Use them to write on the slips of paper, which have also been charitably donated and distributed.

80
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:44,740
And if you feel the impulse of charity, which distinguishes the noble from the bestial,

81
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,740
you will include a small premium for me, Dr. Howell and Dowell.

82
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:55,420
The equivalent of asking the withered crone who tells your fortune if she would prefer

83
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,080
that you cross her claw-like palm with silver

84
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,400
because nothing has value

85
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,900
like something which is sponsored with value

86
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,780
and nothing has more value

87
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,200
than that which we invest with value.

88
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,220
Monetary units and paper notes

89
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,620
have no intrinsic value in themselves

90
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,680
but we all agree that we do.

91
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,080
Therefore, send them unto me.

92
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,860
Of course, even if you don't

93
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,340
send a solitary cent up here

94
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,760
I will answer the question

95
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,100
but my answer may be terse, succinct, laconic, brief.

96
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,620
If, on the other hand,

97
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,740
you feel motivated to generosity

98
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,720
my answer may be provided

99
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,580
with the flowery elaborations

100
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,520
which are so often a product of this program.

101
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,720
And, indeed, if we like the question inordinately

102
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,500
I will come forth with a bardic recitation

103
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,840
which is the most important.

104
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,700
And I forgot to mention

105
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,800
you're supposed to give him a shot of liquor

106
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,680
if we like the question

107
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,360
but I guess we're going to pass on that tradition too?

108
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,100
Not going to give him a shot?

109
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,220
We just did give him a free beer party.

110
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,660
That's right.

111
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,720
They had a free beer party.

112
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,240
And to go to my show in San Francisco

113
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,180
costs ten bucks

114
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,280
but it's free to you

115
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,200
because it's included

116
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
with your admission

117
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,240
to this wonderful event.

118
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,240
And so, my golfing and prayer partner

119
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,180
Ivan Stang

120
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,560
is going to read

121
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,540
the questions that you write to me.

122
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,020
At that point, I will answer them.

123
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,720
And as long as that lasts

124
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,080
we will do this

125
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,180
our version here at X-Day

126
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,560
of the Ask Dr. Hal show.

127
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,520
Then it will be time to continue

128
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,040
the bulldada auction from yesterday

129
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,820
for many wondrous treasures

130
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,360
have in the interval come to light.

131
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,860
All through the show, by the way

132
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,320
you may continue to write down questions

133
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,640
as they occur to you

134
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,060
and send them up.

135
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,000
Until Ivan Stang declares

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,540
the session officially closed.

137
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,520
The very first question that we were handed

138
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,220
it came with a one dollar bill

139
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,380
by the way Dr. Hal

140
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,200
but you'll see that

141
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,220
this is

142
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,200
the question

143
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,080
hold on

144
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,640
don't answer this yet

145
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,800
because it's followed by a statement.

146
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,300
The question is

147
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,960
whatever happened to James

148
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,040
Doohan's dick?

149
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,380
And then in parentheses it says

150
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,460
give your answer

151
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,940
then read mine

152
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,480
on the other side.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,100
So he's actually giving you both your answers

154
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,760
So we have dueling answers here?

155
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,920
You have to answer it first

156
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,060
and then read his answer.

157
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,780
Whatever happened to James Doohan's dick?

158
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,140
Alright, well James Doohan

159
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,860
as I'm sure

160
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,340
each and every one of you knew

161
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,040
played the beloved Officer Martin

162
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,040


163
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,040


164
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,480
Montgomery Scott on the original Star Trek

165
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
television program that debuted in 1966

166
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,320
and he was in trim fighting form

167
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,980
then when he would defend his ship

168
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,720
from scurvy inter-seller sailors

169
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,720
and their bad mouthing

170
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,980
of his beloved craft

171
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,980
and not one to shy from a brawl

172
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,540
but success

173
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,360
has a debilitating effect

174
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,700
if you get what you want

175
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,320
you tend to lose your fighting trim

176
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,180
you tend in fact to stop trying so hard

177
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,720
and you get comfortable

178
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,580
and with good cape on lined

179
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,080
and this certainly happened to James Doohan

180
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,280
and he grew wider and rounder

181
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,220
more like those planets that he used to orbit

182
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,440
on the show

183
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,680
in his mighty starship

184
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,180
eventually this condition continued

185
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,400
as it will

186
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,000
until James Doohan's dick became invisible

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,660
from his vantage point

188
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,460
like an unknown stellar phenomenon

189
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:15,460
obscured by a pulsating cloud of dark matter

190
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,060
or nebulous material

191
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,300
there was a knowledge

192
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,320
a vague knowledge

193
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,600
though with the passage of time

194
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,980
less and less a certainty

195
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,540
that it was still there

196
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,460
but as I said

197
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,200
you can look at this as a cautionary term

198
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
about success

199
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,660
don't be so sure that you want to gain

200
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,900
everything that you aspire to

201
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,420
of course if James Doohan is being used in this question

202
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,140
as short for Scotty

203
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,000
one can assume that his dick

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,240
and all his junk

205
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,420
received far too many rads

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,560
through involuntary exposure

207
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,080
to the cores of the ship

208
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,120
which you probably remember

209
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,420
were always overheating

210
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,000
malfunctioning

211
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,380
sparking

212
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,300
and fritzing

213
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,240
now at this point I'm going to turn it over

214
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,680
and read the answer provided

215
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,460
and it's in poetic form

216
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,520
the prick of engineer Scott

217
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,540
fell off from Saturnian rot

218
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,460
so he went to the basement

219
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,400
and made a replacement

220
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,380
out of tungsten

221
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,280
and lambskin

222
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,260
and snot

223
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,180
very good very good

224
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,160
very good

225
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,720
and thank you for your dollar

226
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,500
you are here for a special return

227
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:17,500


228
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:17,720
Lord God

229
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:24,080
Fanny and his buddy bundled up a box of baby birds

230
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,660
Brought the baby birds to the blueberry bush

231
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,000
When the bumblebee folded, bit Bobby on the ball sack

232
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,580
Thank you.

233
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,800
Friends, that was the first cut on the new album

234
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,320
from the Rudy Schwartz,

235
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,120
Project.

236
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,900
The title of the album is...

237
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,700
How could I not...

238
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,040
How could I forget this?

239
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,200
Reach across the office and grab

240
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,300
the CD. The Year They Switched to

241
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,600
Cornmeal by the Rudy Schwartz

242
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Project on

243
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,160
Dr... Is it really

244
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,920
Dr. Jam Records? No,

245
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,180
DC Jam Records.

246
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,160
Yes, Bagpipe

247
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,460
Benny by the

248
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,280
Rudy Schwartz Project.

249
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,440
And now, back to Ask Dr. Howell, live

250
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,380
at 14XX. Here's a

251
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,240
$5 question.

252
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,500
How can we prove

253
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,360
to the pinks that

254
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,740
Bob is real

255
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,300
and Jesus is pretend?

256
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,900
Well, you know,

257
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,820
Jesus used to be

258
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,620
portrayed as knocking on your door.

259
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,100
You know, coming to your door

260
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,180
and knock. And yet, how likely

261
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,860
is this? In

262
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,100
an infinite universe of infinite

263
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,240
possibilities, almost anything could happen.

264
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,940
And yet, this has got to rank

265
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,040
near the bottom. Like

266
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,280
Santa Claus paying a personal

267
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,220
visit. But, on the

268
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,700
other hand, Bob

269
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,260
was known for going

270
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,040
from door to door and knocking

271
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,080
on the door and selling

272
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,220
the vacuum cleaner after dumping dirt

273
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,660
on the floor and all that stuff.

274
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,120
All those traveling salesman jokes,

275
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,120
but perhaps no one today remembers them

276
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,100
or has heard of them or tells them,

277
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,840
but they used to exist and they were

278
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,740
all about

279
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,860
Bob. Bob was the

280
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,940
traveling salesman. Sometimes they even gave

281
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,640
his name as Bob in those

282
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,120
stories. So,

283
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,100
although there aren't too many

284
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,820
vacuum cleaner salesmen prowling

285
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,380
the suburbs today because

286
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,260
people are so fearful.

287
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,300
Oh, well, there's one right here.

288
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,240
I'm delighted to be...

289
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,760
What is the vacuum of choice

290
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,440
that you sell?

291
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,700
Hoover and Dirt Devil.

292
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,820
Is that a Mighty Might?

293
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,560
Does it take style C vacuum

294
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:49,960
bags?

295
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,100
We have SDXY.

296
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,000
SDXY.

297
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,440
Yeah, very exciting.

298
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,640
Those are good machines.

299
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,720
But do you go from door to door

300
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,380
selling these vacuum cleaners?

301
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,440
That's too classic. I'm

302
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,800
overwhelmed. I'm touched. Moved.

303
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,480
I'm moved!

304
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,840
Large big glass for the large big glass.

305
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,780
Ah, that's it. You see, now there is

306
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,820
a mediator between the traveling salesman's

307
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,640
and the customer. And it's the giant

308
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,740
big box store where you have

309
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,820
to buy 90 rolls of toilet

310
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,760
paper at a time. But in

311
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,200
older times,

312
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,900
J.R. Bob Dobbs wore out

313
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,300
his shoe leather

314
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,720
plodding from door

315
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,860
to door. And it wasn't collecting for UNICEF

316
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,200
either.

317
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,740
So, Jesus lived

318
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,400
2,000 odd

319
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,460
years ago. Bob

320
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,600
is likely always to be

321
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,540
still living. Who is

322
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,300
more likely to knock

323
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,280
on your door?

324
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,360
We've got photographs of J.R. Bob

325
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,440
Dobbs. I'd love to see a photo

326
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,120
of Jesus.

327
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,400
Simple as that.

328
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,260
I think you'll like this question,

329
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,120
Dr. Howell. It came with $2.

330
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,960
Good. The question is,

331
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,260
how did you become a member

332
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,500
of the Church of the Subgenius?

333
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,640
Well, I

334
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,320
was going home one night.

335
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,540
I actually had an accident.

336
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,280
I fell

337
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,560
through a sewer grating, which should have been

338
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,480
fastened.

339
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,420
Whenever I passed those things, I always thought,

340
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,400
what if it was loose? And I fell. But of course,

341
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,460
it never happens. I thought, oh, you're neurotic.

342
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,380
Just step on it. And this time,

343
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
it fell. And I met a

344
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,280
group of old people in the

345
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,620
sewer. The Nostotuti,

346
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,320
they called themselves, who

347
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,440
conferred upon me. No, none of that is

348
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,720
true.

349
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,500
That would be the sort of story that you'd

350
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,660
want to tell.

351
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,380
But in fact, how did many

352
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,540
people get honed

353
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,620
onto the magnetic lines of force

354
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,740
emanating from the Church of the Subgenius

355
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,900
through one

356
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,780
special chosen

357
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,380
medium? Three words

358
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,160
here. Pamphlet number

359
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,000
one.

360
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,300
In this case, pamphlet number one had

361
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,420
traveled to the underground comic book

362
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,320
factory where I was working

363
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,200
at that time in San Francisco.

364
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,520
Where it arrived on the desk of the

365
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,000
publisher, Fred

366
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,420
Todd, who took one

367
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,140
look at it and

368
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,920
pitched it into the trash

369
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,440
where Paul Mavridis

370
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,480
and I found it. And we thought

371
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,580
it was hilarious. And much to

372
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,560
Fred's irritation, we kept

373
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,140
going on and on about Bob

374
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,360
and Paul

375
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,460
got in touch with Ivan. And yes,

376
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,560
indeed, there was more to be

377
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,460
said on the subject of

378
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,300
this interesting fellow, Bob.

379
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,220
And so began

380
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,840
an association

381
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,520
which over the years has proved

382
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,660
more than mutually beneficial.

383
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,740
Praise Bob.

384
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,180
Praise Ripoff Press.

385
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,260
Praise Mavridis

386
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,560
and Fred Todd.

387
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,720
Ripoff Press no longer exists.

388
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,340
Really?

389
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,120
I was told

390
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
by Doug

391
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,560
Wellman of puzzling evidence that

392
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,620
when Paul looked

393
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,840
at the pamphlet, he said,

394
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,300
Oh my God, these guys hate Jesus

395
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,720
as much as I do.

396
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,320
Which is actually not true.

397
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,340
We don't hate Jesus.

398
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,820
We've never met the fellow.

399
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,360
Some of us aren't sure that he ever

400
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,200
even existed.

401
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,640
Some of us aren't certain we're livres.

402
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,700
Some of us aren't sure that it really

403
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,660
is the intentionally

404
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:08,660


405
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:08,660


406
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:08,660


407
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:08,660


408
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:08,660


409
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:08,660


410
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,080
thank you,

411
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,160
Mr.

412
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,220
That odd piece of music was by Fabrizio Fulvio Fiale.

413
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,580
I don't know much about it.

414
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,480
Reverend Titor sent me a link to it,

415
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,000
and I downloaded it and played it.

416
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,280
That's all we know.

417
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,080
The last name is spelled F-I-A-L-E.

418
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,660
Fiale.

419
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,600
Fabrizio Fulvio Fiale.

420
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,440
And now, back to Ask Dr. Howell, live at 14X Day Drill.

421
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,860
Now, here's one that came without an envelope or any money,

422
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,080
and it's almost completely unreadable.

423
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,260
Can you...

424
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,800
To me, it says,

425
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,980
Can to bus butthurt?

426
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,360
Can...

427
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,080
I'm able to...

428
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,220
How do you interpret that better?

429
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,000
It says, can to bus butthurt?

430
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,860
Can...

431
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,140
Well, what is this?

432
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,160
I don't know.

433
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,780
Is there any...

434
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,400
Fast?

435
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:25,800
The last?

436
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,160
Did the questioner...

437
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,980
Can the questioner clarify the question, the handwriting?

438
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,740
Can to bus or hobus...

439
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,400
Hobus.

440
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,940
Or perhaps it says,

441
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,860
Ian hobus butthurt?

442
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,500
Question mark?

443
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,640
No, that's not an E.

444
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,580
There's a...

445
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,360
It's a...

446
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,540
It's funny, though.

447
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,260
There's a curly Q at the top.

448
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,600
I don't recognize the problem.

449
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,080
Can to bus butthurt?

450
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,740
Over a consonant?

451
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,360
Can to bus butthurt?

452
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,820
Apparently, the questioner has already left.

453
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,140
Can has.

454
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,760
Maybe...

455
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,360
If this were an H, H-A-S...

456
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,240
Can has butthurt?

457
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,520
That would be that funny cat talk they use on the internet.

458
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,720
Can has butthurt?

459
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,260
Has met?

460
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Like, can has cheeseburger?

461
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,840
Can has butthurt?

462
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,360
Can has butthurt?

463
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:16,760
Can has butthurt?

464
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:16,820


465
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,100
Well, it does have a question mark at the end,

466
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,460
which makes it a question interrogative.

467
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,920
Thus, it deserves a response.

468
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,680
The presence of questions suggests the existence of answers.

469
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,960
Both are constructs which we fling at the implacable silence of the universe.

470
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,960
So, let's just ask...

471
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,500
Let's just act as if this is a question.

472
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,560
And since it is, my answer is...

473
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,060
E-B-S...

474
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,400
Or...

475
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,700
Thalass...

476
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:45,940
Or...

477
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,920
Has...

478
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,160
Or...

479
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,800
House...

480
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,780
Can experience butthurt.

481
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,880
Why not?

482
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,800
Who can't?

483
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:02,200
Fortunately, there are a series of nerves there, though not the greatest concentration

484
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,300
of nerves.

485
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,040
But sure, no one is immune.

486
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,820
I'm sorry if I disappoint anyone with that particular answer.

487
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,840
Dr. Legume brought up something regarding butthurt.

488
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:29,760
When both cheeks are so very, very butthurt, a third butt cheek will sometimes evolve.

489
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,200
And where?

490
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,600
Where does it appear?

491
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,460
I don't...

492
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,460
He didn't say.

493
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:43,980
But I would assume that somewhere maybe between the original two hurt butt cheeks, a third

494
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,060
butt cheek will evolve.

495
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,060


496
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,520
Although that might close off and negate the purpose of the butt.

497
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,600
The main purpose.

498
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,140
In my opinion.

499
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,580
Some people may find other reasons for butts to exist.

500
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:02,840
Perhaps under an increased gravitational load on a heavy gravity planet, more butthucks

501
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,680
would be necessary.

502
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,980
This is a good one.

503
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,620
It came with one dollar and one cent.

504
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,720
Very good.

505
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,060
And a monster skeleton.

506
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,060


507
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,060


508
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,600
A screaming skull sticker.

509
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,680
Oh, boy.

510
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,860
It's a dick, Alex.

511
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:24,960
And a well done graphic of Bob changing into the Hulk that's an ad for the great We Slack

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,140
the new ones.

514
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,780
And the question is, if...

515
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,180
I think this is.

516
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,040
If you...

517
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,040


518
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,040


519
00:25:51,360 --> 00:26:00,320
If you stopped being so stubborn, would you rather be free, sad and happy new Rick?

520
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,320


521
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,320

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,940
not a hardly human without 인'Syth.

523
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:03,540


524
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:03,540

00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:03,540

feel, always makes one see an image of little sperms

530
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,020
wriggling through space. Did these

531
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,960
primordial seeds carry with them the taint

532
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,800
of primordial evil, of primordial disease?

533
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,140
It is not necessary for that

534
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,680
to happen, but it's certainly an interesting poetic

535
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,040
idea that wrapped up in the seed bundle, which

536
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,040
contains everything, is also the element of its downfall.

537
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,000
After all, death was an invention which came

538
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,840
long after the invention of life in order to

539
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,920
manage the number of living things acting

540
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,160
on the resource base, and it was necessary

541
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,660
to counter the invention of sex,

542
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,980
of sexual reproduction, as opposed to budding and

543
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,500
unicellular reproduction.

544
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,500
So maybe it did. Maybe some of Satan's

545
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,280
jisms sizzled down through the various atmospheric

546
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,040
layers onto the earth, and just maybe

547
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,080
evil is older than the beard of the ancient

548
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,500
of days. But those of us who have a greater faith, a faith in evolution,

549
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,580
know that a simple, advantageous

550
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,000
struggling between types is sufficient

551
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,160
to

552
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,300
to

553
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,020
to

554
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020

556
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


557
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


558
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


559
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


560
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


561
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


562
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


563
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


564
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


565
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


566
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


567
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


568
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


569
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


570
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


571
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


572
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


573
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,020


574
00:27:42,040 --> 00:28:12,040


575
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:42,040


576
00:28:42,040 --> 00:29:12,040


577
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:42,040


578
00:29:42,040 --> 00:30:12,040


579
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:42,040


580
00:30:42,040 --> 00:31:12,040


581
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:42,040


582
00:31:42,040 --> 00:32:12,040


583
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:42,040


584
00:32:42,040 --> 00:33:12,040


585
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:42,040


586
00:33:42,040 --> 00:34:12,040


587
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:42,040


588
00:34:42,040 --> 00:35:12,040


589
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:42,040


590
00:35:42,040 --> 00:36:12,040


591
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:42,040


592
00:36:42,040 --> 00:37:12,040


593
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:42,040


594
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,320
be a

595
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,780
信念

596
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,000
Jungle

597
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,860
jungle

598
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,660
Apple

599
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,000
cares

600
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,260
g

601
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:11,440
To

602
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,720
as animated by Bob Clampett.

603
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,200
Could be.

604
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,520
Once upon a swinging time

605
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,520
Frank Sinatra looked around

606
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,340
And he said, I'm lonely for some

607
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,780
Cats and kitties

608
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,240
So he built himself a man

609
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,320
Out of clay the story goes

610
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,480
Then he made him a groovy chick

611
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,200
So they could mingle

612
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,660
The cat surveyed the lady fair

613
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,000
He purred, I'd know you anywhere

614
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,520
He entroved, madam

615
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,320
He entroved, madam

616
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,660
My name is Adam

617
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,640
And she said, buddy

618
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,700
You're all covered in mud

619
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,280
Head to toe

620
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,580
And Frank said, now you'll be

621
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,540
Man and wife

622
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,840
But they said, what are we after

623
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,640
And they lived happily

624
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,760
Ever after

625
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,820
I'll be back in a week

626
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,580
To dig the falls

627
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,700
Then they made the polka nose

628
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,120
Every room a heart-shaped haven

629
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,520
Ooh, them bubbles

630
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,060
Next the recess ding-a-ling

631
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,560
Turned that Chevy to the left

632
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,540
Victor moaned at the frontier room

633
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,140
And there's no cover

634
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,300
This chair is a mess

635
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:51,300


636
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:51,300


637
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:51,300


638
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:51,300


639
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,760
The chick adored her shining night

640
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,160
They cuckooed till the morning light

641
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,640
She said, good lovey

642
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,660
My turtle dovey

643
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,760
And he said, sister

644
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,200
Let's us savor this bliss evermore

645
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,960
And Frank looked around

646
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,760
And he saw it was good

647
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,760
A dug of the kicks and the laughter

648
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,760
And they lived happily

649
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,740
Ever after

650
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,560
рей

651
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:56,560


652
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:56,560


653
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,780
My giant heart

654
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:04,040
It seemed secure

655
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,020
The canceled encouraged

656
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,080
At the pool one afternoon

657
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,460
Chicky met that record man

658
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,680
He said, check my apple pie

659
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,520
I think you'll dig it

660
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,060
Those kids took a little bite

661
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,260
Reaching for their darkest shades

662
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,640
And before you could say Jack Robin

663
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,940
They were swinging

664
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,460
That chick turned into Peggy Lee

665
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,820
Thus Bobby Darin came to be

666
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,560
They sang out blue eyes

667
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,620
Here comes us new guys

668
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,600
And they said Frankie

669
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,180
We'd just like to thank everyone here

670
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,520
And Frank said I always knew you'd be stars

671
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,760
Here and in the hereafter

672
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,460
Let's all live happily

673
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,020
Make that swing and leave

674
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,820
Let's all live happily

675
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,920
Ever after

676
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,520
Ever after

677
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,560
Ever after

678
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,200
Ever after

679
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,240
Ever after

680
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,500
Ever after

681
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:23,140
Ever after

682
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:28,100
Ever after

683
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:28,240
Ever after

684
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,000
Ever after

685
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,300
EHS

686
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,580
I learned that love

687
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,380
In the whoa

688
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,200
Cannibalism

689
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:42,320
The sense of something

690
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,320


691
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,320


692
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,320


693
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,320


694
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,320


695
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,320


696
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,320


697
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,460
S穴

698
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:45,500
I was never

699
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:52,680
wears a light cloth or artificial fabric outfits that are very small and short,

700
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,880
but then that's the way I see it.

701
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,840
And second part of the question.

702
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,120
Second question, how is justice best served?

703
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,020
How is justice best served?

704
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,620
I would assume differently than revenge.

705
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,660
Revenge is served best cold, but justice is served hot

706
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,360
and must be consumed while hot.

707
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:23,180
Otherwise, it fades away and disappears into the vanished heraldry of history,

708
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:28,760
into a confusing blur of shields and banners.

709
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,260
You've got to enjoy justice while it lasts because it is a transient phenomenon.

710
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:42,560
If you're too far away from it, you won't get the best blame.

711
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,220
You'll get the bays of its benefit, its warmth.

712
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:51,060
But revenge is best served cold, as the apothegm says.

713
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:59,060
I believe it was Jonathan Swift who said that princes never managed to eat their meat served hot.

714
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:06,060
This was a dig, of course, at Louis XIV, who made such a ceremony out of being served his meal

715
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:11,680
that it had to be passed down an enormous line of lords before it would come to his table.

716
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,640
So he said,

717
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:22,800
He, the emperor of everything and the Sun King, didn't get to enjoy the meat that the cook in the kitchen could eat when it was hot and savory and piping.

718
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,180
My name's not Bob.

719
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,960
Not a prop, Bob.

720
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,340
Good drugs?

721
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:32,660
Hey, Bob.

722
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,080
Where are you?

723
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,640
I'm not in a cell.

724
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:36,580
Maybe.

725
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,120
What do you mean, maybe? What's that supposed to mean?

726
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,260
Maybe.

727
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:41,560
Maybe.

728
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,420
Means maybe.

729
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,280
Maybe I'm in the next cell.

730
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,760
Another volunteer like you.

731
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:55,820
Or maybe I'm in the central office, spying on you for all those science bozos.

732
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,960
Maybe I'm not even here.

733
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,900
Maybe I'm just in your...

734
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,100
Self-genius.

735
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,520
Powerful.

736
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:06,720
Swag.

737
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,000
Ah!

738
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:08,460
Bob!

739
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,180
Bob doesn't believe I have one.

740
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,280
Hey, Bob, can you move your...

741
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:11,780
Oil de Bob.

742
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:12,540
Oh!

743
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,860
Look out, Tim!

744
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,780
Here's an important message from your Uncle Bill.

745
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,380
Don't buy drugs.

746
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,200
Oh!

747
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,620
Get it, got it.

748
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:25,600
Bob.

749
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,100
Bob here.

750
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,420
Yeah, Bob spelled backwards. It's still Bob.

751
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,180
Hey, for every stank, I got a new joke for you.

752
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,420
It's just Bob is what it is.

753
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:34,860
It's just...

754
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,380
It's literally Bob.

755
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,100
Big Bob.

756
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,080
Big Bob.

757
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,060
Dude, what?

758
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,040
Big Bob, what?

759
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:42,880
What?

760
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:44,500
What?

761
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,000
What is he doing?

762
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,100
What gets you up?

763
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,380
Is he fucking with Big Bob right now?

764
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,480
Why are you fucking with Big Bob right now?

765
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,840
You're fucking with Big Bob, dude!

766
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,840
He would do something!

767
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,100
Why you talk on Big Bob?

768
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,740
Big Bob will eat you up!

769
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,300
Big Bob?

770
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,860
It's like a weird dream.

771
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,680
Oh, year.

772
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,260
We'll never talk shit about Bob.

773
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:04,260
Big Bob will smack you up so hard.

774
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,300
Big Bob's the truth.

775
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:05,720
Okay.

776
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,660
That's Big Bob.

777
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,180
That would be my bad, Big Bob.

778
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,020
That's Big Bob.

779
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,580
That would be my bad, Big Bob.

780
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,280
That's Big Bob.

781
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,620
That would be my bad, Big Bob.

782
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:12,620


783
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:12,620


784
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:12,620


785
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:12,960
That's a big bar.

786
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:13,600
That's a big bar.

787
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,060
That would be my bad big bar.

788
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,060
What do you call that?

789
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:16,980
Uh, bottle.

790
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,440
Bottle.

791
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,120
What about this?

792
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,040
Uh, straw.

793
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,020
Straw.

794
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,120
What about this?

795
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,580
Uh, the salty sour of suck it.

796
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,220
Did you say you are ready to have my thang in your mouth?

797
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,240
Yes, sir.

798
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,380
What do you mean by that?

799
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,140
Big bar.

800
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,120
Big bar.

801
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,040
You smell like rubber and you're really sketchy right now.

802
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,120
Look at me!

803
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,040
What is that?

804
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,000
I'm in some hot soup here, Bob.

805
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,860
Some teenagers are hanging out in front of the store.

806
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,680
I think they could start slacking at any moment.

807
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,620
But I need time to cool down.

808
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,180
Bob, Bob, Bob!

809
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,640
Anything you want, you gotta fill.

810
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,340
Anything you need, you gotta fill.

811
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,160
Anything at all, you gotta fill.

812
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,920
Anything you need.

813
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,420
Cooling, cooling, cooling by day and then at night, working up a sweat.

814
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,460
I don't need no pay.

815
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:41,980
I don't need no pay.

816
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:41,980


817
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:41,980


818
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,160
Step, step, step.

819
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,460
One, two, three.

820
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,000
Boom.

821
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,760
Cooling, cooling, cooling by day and night.

822
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,420
Working up a sweat.

823
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,040
Pushing up a tear and wearing a fit.

824
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,680
One, two, two, pushing it.

825
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,760
Cooling by day and night.

826
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,560
Working up a sweat.

827
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,580
Come on, girl, let's go show the God that we know.

828
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,220
How to control number one in a high-supply show.

829
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,300
Now push it.

830
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,360
The Large did that collage.

831
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,540
My name.

832
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:46,340
My name is not Bob, which also had in it, let me see.

833
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:50,540
Oh, Girl Talk doing In Step.

834
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,480
Thanks to The Large and Girl Talk.

835
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,780
And now, back to Dr. Howell.

836
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,320
This decorated one, this could go on forever.

837
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,820
It's got curly Q's and thingamabobs.

838
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,600
Yeah, it looks like a paramecium.

839
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,560
What does Dr. Howell recommend?

840
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,860
Read for more insight.

841
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:21,160
The other day, the film crew that's here was asking me my opinion of who prototypical subgeniuses are.

842
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:29,740
And it was difficult for me to give the proper answer as to where subgenius thought formulates.

843
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,460
But there are names that come to mind.

844
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,160
Mark Twain, for example.

845
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,280
Or go back earlier.

846
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,500
Thomas Paine.

847
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,280
Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his more...

848
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,480
Bearable interludes.

849
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:48,440
Or how about Restif de la Bretonne, the revolutionary French writer and pornographer

850
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:53,260
who wrote that loathsome 18th century work, The Perverted Peasant.

851
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:59,280
He was a free thinker who, in some ways, anticipated subgenius thought.

852
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,980
And he even used the French equivalent of the word slack.

853
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:06,140
H.G. Wells, I promoted the other day.

854
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,540
Jonathan Swift wrote the first great comprehensive science fiction novel.

855
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,680
Gulliver's Travels.

856
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:17,020
Clark Ashton Smith, besides being named Smith, with his friend H.P. Lovecraft,

857
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:22,920
largely helped to construct the foundations of our mythology.

858
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,120
But, as the old saying goes, if you wish to see a monument, look about you.

859
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,320
I am in the presence of people who are creating subgenius doctrine and thought.

860
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,380
I can speak of those progenitors who have died, who have gone before.

861
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,440
But we...

862
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:46,080
Are all moving forward into a glorious new realization of these things.

863
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:52,980
And it will take someone far beyond even this place to have the final, arbitrative word.

864
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,820
Thank you, Dr. Howell.

865
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,820
Three hours after the rapture happened...

866
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,400
Dr. Three hours after the rapture...

867
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,760
Dr. Three hours after the rapture...

868
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,120
Dr. Three hours after the rapture...

869
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,440
Dr. ...happened, buddy.

870
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,720
congratulations everybody

871
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,700
To the Although I었습니다

872
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,700
direction

873
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,280
Everybody

874
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,660
You will appreciate

875
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,440
the partnership

876
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,280
we gave to the film

877
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,900
Bob

878
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,460
Bob

879
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,700
Bob

880
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,100
Congratulations

881
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,060
Bob

882
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:35,340
Bob

883
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:35,680
Bob

884
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,420
Bob

885
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,200
Bob

886
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,860
Bye.

887
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,060
Bye.

888
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,560
Bye.

889
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,020
Bye.

890
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,780
Bye.

891
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,700
Bye.

892
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:15,940
Bye.

893
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:38,300
That was the Ministry of Slack and the Evolution Control Committee

894
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,300
late at night at the

895
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,940
14X Day Drill.

896
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,720
I don't really know the title of that song

897
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,400
but

898
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,420
you can

899
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,540
look them up

900
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,540
both Ministry of Slack and Evolution Control

901
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,000
Committee at

902
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,460
subgenius.com if you click the radio

903
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,460
button and then click the

904
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,700
title of this show.

905
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,420
Now back to Dr. Howell.

906
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,340
We still have questions coming up.

907
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:07,920
Define

908
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,360
why? Question

909
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,620
mark, question mark, question mark.

910
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,500
Define why.

911
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,000
That's not the same as just asking

912
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,480
why.

913
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,960
But why

914
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,880
is the operative part of the

915
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,460
interrogative

916
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,040
proposition. You must

917
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,240
ask a why in order

918
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,340
to get a because.

919
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,660
So why is

920
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,720
that which needs to be submitted

921
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,800
before achieving a because.

922
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,040
And the presence of a why suggests

923
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,380
the answer of a because.

924
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,320
So they are two

925
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,500
mighty twins who go forth

926
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,400
hand in hand.

927
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,300
You have been

928
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,860

H-A-L because
