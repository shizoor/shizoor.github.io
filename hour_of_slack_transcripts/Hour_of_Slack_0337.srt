1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,140
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of slut.

2
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,800
Slut.

3
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,300
Ah yes dear friends, back in Dallas again.

4
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:16,820
It's so nice to be home, although I spent last week at the Cleveland branch office of the church.

5
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:27,820
See the church is so big now I have to make this monthly circuit to all the branch offices in Cleveland and London and so forth.

6
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:39,260
I'll tell you it's a rough damn job friends preaching to sinners and nightclubs and even worse dens of iniquity.

7
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:54,940
But somebody's got to do it for Bob and somebody has to get the ultimate in total blinding eye-watering slack for the rest of you.

8
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,480
Somebody has to pave that way.

9
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,340
Break that trail.

10
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,840
Here's what happened there.

11
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,280
Baby, you're just normal.

12
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,340
Come to Bob and Connie's Red Alight.

13
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,700
We'll fix you up with a personality completely different than the one you're running away from.

14
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,740
Bob and Connie's Red Alight.

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,700
If we can't get you laid, no one can.

16
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,220
Yeah.

17
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


18
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,620
Connie's Custom Condom Service.

19
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,400
If you've got the prize, we've got the size.

20
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,160
The bigger, the better.

21
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,540
The harder, the wetter.

22
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,260
How may I help you?

23
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,320
Located at a tacky strip shopping mall near you.

24
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:33,300
We're Bob Concord and you probably don't know what we do.

25
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
Bob Concord.

26
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,100
We like it that way.

27
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,060
Bob Concord.

28
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,060
We just want the money.

29
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,600
Now friends, imagine if you will.

30
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,500
A Church of the Subgenius sitcom about the family of Bob and Connie.

31
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,040
Just imagine it for a second.

32
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,840
Hi, Connie.

33
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,060
Where's Bob?

34
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,980
He's in the bedroom polishing his putter.

35
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,880
It got a little dirty last night.

36
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,760
What?

37
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,100
With you around, that's par for the course.

38
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh.

39
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,900
Hiya, Woody.

40
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,200
Trying to pay?

41
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,600
You're not going to play through?

42
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,660
Connie was just making juice.

43
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,240
I know that.

44
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,140
What's in the blender?

45
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,100
I always thought golf goes better with Ma-Tis, don't you?

46
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,600
Bottoms up, boys.

47
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,440
Mmm.

48
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,580
Connie, you sure know how to work a blender.

49
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,080
Yes, you sure know how to mix things up.

50
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,080
And you boys sure know how to handle your clubs.

51
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,540
So do you, Connie.

52
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,240
So do you, honey.

53
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,180
So do you, Connie.

54
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,180


55
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,180


56
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,180


57
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,180


58
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,180


59
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,180


60
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,180


61
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,180


62
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,060
Don't get caught in any sand traps.

63
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,160
You'll scratch your balls.

64
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,320
Hurry back, boys, or I'll resort to dick.

65
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,600
And what about Dick?

66
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,160
And what about Tom?

67
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,480
And what about Harry?

68
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,320
Well, don't worry, folks.

69
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,400
Connie's got plenty for everybody.

70
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,180
Oh, what a lovely, what a lovely day.

71
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,180


72
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,180


73
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,580
Oh, what a lovely couple of couples.

74
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,040
Just how perverted are we getting tonight?

75
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,580
Who's marrying a non-human?

76
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,880
Who's marrying a non-human?

77
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,380
This lady has married a rubber chicken.

78
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,320
Praise Bob.

79
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,080
Praise Bob.

80
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,760
Praise Bob.

81
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,100
Praise Bob.

82
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Praise Bob.

83
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,180


84
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,180


85
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,220


86
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,220


87
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,060
Praise Bob.

88
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,420
Praise Bob.

89
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,960
Praise Bob.

90
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,500
Praise Bob.

91
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,160
Praise Bob.

92
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,360
This man is marrying his wallet.

93
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,120
There he is, the wallet.

94
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,460
The family is the wallet of a man.

95
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:01,880
All right.

96
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,720
Let's proceed.

97
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,380
Do, now this is a generic public short-duration marriage, so we'll have to do fill in the blanks,

98
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,660
sort of.

99
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,020
Do you, in short name here, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but

100
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,580
the truth, say, I do.

101
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
I do.

102
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,600
I do.

103
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,460
Yes.

104
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,800
But the certified coupling will last for 24 hours, starting at 1015.

105
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,840
Let's hurry up.

106
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,720
Five minutes from now.

107
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,380
Yeah.

108
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,300
We'd better get moving.

109
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,240
I want to lighten the saffron of precious sin and time.

110
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:39,380
Ah yes, dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in the presence of J.R. Bob Dobbs and

111
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:45,420
Elvis the King Presley and insert other beauty names here.

112
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,760
Red and Stimpy.

113
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,400
To join these beautiful couples.

114
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,820
men, insert names here, and these women, insert names there, and these wallets and

115
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,980
mothers and jewelry and coffee cups, camcorders, cigarettes.

116
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,400
Oh, God.

117
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,500
Oh, so forever.

118
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,240
So, yes, buried to cigarettes forever.

119
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:15,980
And, okay, in the bondage, the bondage, the bondage of holy matrimony, for better or for

120
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,380
worse, but, Ace Bob, not for long.

121
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,100
Do you feel the spirit?

122
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes!

123
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:40,280
A dragonfly has balanced, a black widow has been mashed.

124
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,860
Bob and Connie got their hands on each other's purse.

125
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,720
And an anaconda has got constriction.

126
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,820
And the black widow has her prince.

127
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:00,060
But Bob and Connie are the one true origin of sin.

128
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,480
It's the miracle of the 90s.

129
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,240
It's the talk of all the others.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,820
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie.

131
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,360
It's the church of genius.

132
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,360
It's the...

133
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:27,060
It won't turn back, till he gets like, go along with me, and Bob will set you free.

134
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,880
The ostrich do it in a circle.

135
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,720
He's with their head.

136
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,520
Duckies.

137
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,080
The ground.

138
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:52,700
Why does it mean like to get it on with lots of people around?

139
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,880
So many combinations.

140
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,880
The results are always the same.

141
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,420
Unless you're prepared to get it on, give up and count his name.

142
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,240
Oh.

143
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,940
It's the miracle of the night.

144
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,420
It's the talk of all the others.

145
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,620
It's the marriage of all the kind.

146
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,660
It's the church of all the free.

147
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,140
She's the one.

148
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,540
It's the only good side.

149
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,580
Oh.

150
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,480
Remember how bad I've been.

151
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,880
We won't turn back.

152
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,120
We'll see.

153
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,600
It's all so much more of me.

154
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,320
I'm nothing without you.

155
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,520
It's all just a dream.

156
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,420
It's a little dream.

157
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,760
Oh, man.

158
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,960
Back to the subgenius wedding.

159
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,300
The mass.

160
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,180
Some people know what that ring is for.

161
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,640
The mass.

162
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,040
Some people really know what that.

163
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,680
That girl really knows how to.

164
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:09,940
Okay.

165
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,740
We got this ring as a holy symbol of the estate.

166
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,000
marriage as well as of the pole going deep into the hole repeatedly.

167
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,300
Why the authority invested in me by J.R. Bob Dobbs and in defiance of the laws of nature

168
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:32,240
and of this state, I now pronounce you all men and wives and wallets and albis for the

169
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,580
next 24 hours.

170
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,660
In the church of genius.

171
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,180
In the church of genius.

172
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,740
In the church of genius.

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,900
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! TMZ

174
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,760
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

175
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,120
Listen to that, the Hail Ponies are drowning out the Praise Bob.

176
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,000
Interesting.

177
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,700
Oh, man.

178
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,280
Yes, indeedy.

179
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:29,680
What a lovely, lovely short duration marriage ceremony that was, too.

180
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:37,300
And that was just last week in Buffalo, New York, where William McKinley was shot by Oliver Stone.

181
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,740
And where the new play, The Marriage of Bob and Connie, was performed.

182
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:49,360
And where we had a rug-biting, spirit-filled, casting-out-of-peen-worms devival.

183
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,060
And what you just heard was actually the end of that event.

184
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:03,220
The song, by the way, of which you heard just a portion, is one of three all-new original Bob hymns that you'll be hearing tonight.

185
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,980
Written by Reverend Vicki Ganger.

186
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,960
And performed.

187
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,640
By her good friend and mine, Sister Melodious Charles.

188
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,140
And, well, it's important that she get credit, dear friends.

189
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,160
Vitaely important.

190
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,300
As it is that all of these gals that you'll be hearing tonight be properly accredited and in a gentlemanly manner.

191
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,080
Because otherwise them gals will have me singing in a high voice in no time.

192
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,900
And be re-beaking my prairie squid without telling me, if you know what I mean.

193
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,780
And I think that you do, don't you?

194
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,280
Uh-huh.

195
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,180
Uh, so, uh, hold on to your scrota there, boys.

196
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:51,200
Because Connie Dobbs, um, ever-swelling army of Amazon uber-femmes has been putting out again!

197
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,520
And that ain't, that ain't like when these normal, warm-up girls put out.

198
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,900
Heh, no siree, Bob.

199
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,500
These sub-genius women are a new breed.

200
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,080
You never know when one of them might turn around and...

201
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,360
put in.

202
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,940
But it's worth the suspense.

203
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,640
Oh, well worth it.

204
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,080
Because gone are the days when I'd go to preach a sermon and I'd be looking out over a small sea.

205
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,920
Or, well, a pond, really.

206
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,440
Or a cow tank, you might say.

207
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:28,100
Of pasty, white, pudgy, bespectacled, bad-skinned, young males.

208
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,640
Well, those faces are still there in the audience.

209
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,060
But at least they aren't also up on the altar anymore.

210
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,940
Ah, yes, dear friends.

211
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,500
The new altered boys up on the stage.

212
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,700
They're mostly she-women to the nth, or the godzillionth degree, in fact.

213
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,060
And I am so happy.

214
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,080
Ha ha ha.

215
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,960
So, so happy.

216
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,200
But of course, of course there is a price to pay.

217
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,140
You might say that old Bob's had to go through a second, uh, emaculation.

218
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,800
Probably cost him a whole body part.

219
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,540
And...

220
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:12,900
Well, friends, I, I mean, we just can't keep pretending that he's the one that wears the panties in the Dobbs household anymore.

221
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,600
And we palin' hearty lads, I'm afraid, must pay the price tonight, yes?

222
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,800
We're going to be forced to listen to this entire play, The Marriage of Bob and Connie,

223
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:34,440
and suffer the knowledge that all the lady listeners tonight will be picking up dozens and dozens of cool new Connie lines.

224
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,220
A verbal ammo to inflict on their menfolk.

225
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,380
And there's nothing we can do about it.

226
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,940
Better get used to it.

227
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:51,440
There's not only this play, but a great frothing mess of up-comin' Connie-based trance spoutings

228
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,420
that have been just spewin' from these wonderful new feminoid members

229
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,980
who've had this sort of burst, this burst, this veritable gushing of creativity,

230
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:08,800
this spewing of busty boldness from the very crevice of the female conspiracy.

231
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,080
The witchy minions of Bob's mother-in-law, who secretly control at least half of the church, maybe all of it.

232
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,760
And how would we know? That's the terrible thing.

233
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,960
Boys, that's the terrible thing. How would we know?

234
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,020
Anyway, prepare to listen closely.

235
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,960
Um, this play is partly rants, partly songs, partly...

236
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,280
Partly actual scenes of the early years of Bob and Connie Dobbs.

237
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,940
Reenacted by actors, of course.

238
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,760
Um, and the recording I have is kind of rough.

239
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,720
It's from various cassette and video sources.

240
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,800
And although I will narrate some of the action when necessary,

241
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,500
it's good that this is radio.

242
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,780
Because radio forces you to use your imagination.

243
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,560
And that makes the special effects so cheap.

244
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,960
So, you know, let's get to it.

245
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,600
Let your imagination run wild.

246
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,460
It's free.

247
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:11,420
Uh, if it helps any, the gals that play Connie, it took three of them,

248
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,460
all look like Connie.

249
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,040
And I beg you to forgive me.

250
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,500
You know that Bob, that way we were guy,

251
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,420
why can't Woodman be more like Bob?

252
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,280
Why do you want him to be like Bob?

253
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,960
Because I don't know Bob.

254
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,620
On the other hand, we should try not to pass judgment.

255
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,700
You're kidding me.

256
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,840
Hey! What's going on here?

257
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:00,500
Uh, at any rate, here goes another hour of slack unlike any other hour of slack.

258
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,120
First time we ever ran the soundtrack of a play.

259
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,660
This play, The Marriage of Cobb and Bonnie.

260
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,740
I mean, uh, Con and Bobby.

261
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:19,840
Um, anyway, by, uh, Saint Elizabeth Croydon and Dr. Joe Pro Schmo.

262
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,640
And starring, among many others, Reverend Mary Squared.

263
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,280
Au contraire.

264
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,600
Uh, yes.

265
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,400
Do you want to be part of a world of sleeping people?

266
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,920
Do you want to imbibe the drug of the commonplace?

267
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,960
Will you be forever addicted to self-restriction?

268
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,720
Established orthodoxies and dogmas,

269
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,060
conditioned interpretations of living,

270
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,060


271
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,440
Regard the material world as reality.

272
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,240
Whilst pretending to deal with the spirit or existence.

273
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,840
Help Bob give hope to hurting hearts.

274
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,520
Hi. How are ya?

275
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,100
We're all set for the really big show in Buffalo.

276
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,760
Oh! I'm all excited!

277
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,940
I know there's somebody here who will testify for Bob.

278
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,260
I see him! The spirit!

279
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,320
Oh, Sister Melodious Chops!

280
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,540
Sister Melodious Chops, dear friends!

281
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,220
My mind is open, but my heart is full.

282
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,440
My mouth is full.

283
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,180
My stomach, yea, even my bladder is full.

284
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,780
But there is one thing, dear friends, that is not full here tonight,

285
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,980
and that is my wallet.

286
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,000
And when I speak to you as to how this came about,

287
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,040
I must speak to you of my personal salvation,

288
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,360
through my personal salivator, J.R. Bob Dye.

289
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,100
Laughter

290
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,760
Music

291
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,260
Well, I used to be a sinner, cause I truly did believe.

292
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,960
And the Virgin married Jesus, and I'm still a sinner.

293
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,740
And me, we're thick as thieves.

294
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,060
And I used to give my dough to televangelistic snobs.

295
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,820
But then the light, it showed upon me, and I found J.R. Bob Dye.

296
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,880
And now my wallet belongs to Bob.

297
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,320
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

298
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,100
Well, my heart is for my honey, and my brain is for my job.

299
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,940
But my wallet belongs to Bob.

300
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,600
It belongs to Bob.

301
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,880
Music

302
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,700
Well, Bobby goes a-frappin' every chance that he can get.

303
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,660
He cannot perform the biggest without even breaking sweat.

304
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,820
So I gave him all my money, Reverend Stanks said it was right.

305
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,860
And for only twenty dollars, he did save my soul tonight.

306
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,120
And so my wallet belongs to Bob.

307
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,220
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

308
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,620
No more candle-up conspiracy.

309
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,860
My loathing wages robbed, cause my wallet belongs to Bob.

310
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,720
Music

311
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,260
Hey, sister.

312
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,540
Music

313
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,200
Well, Bobby's got a sweetie, and Connie is her name.

314
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:03,380
And her ways could put the sacred or a scamp-a-lon to shame.

315
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,560
She reaches in Bob's pocket, feels around for something hard.

316
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,740
Pulls her hand out, holdin' on to his mighty credit card.

317
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,360
So my wallet belongs to Bob.

318
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,520
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

319
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,820
Music

320
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:29,280
And I never have to fear, cause I know Connie's on the job.

321
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,700
And my wallet belongs to Bob.

322
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,280
Music

323
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,240
Well, you may have your lady and your horny green man, too.

324
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:47,820
Music

325
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,500
Their elemental energy may be what's right for you.

326
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:58,220
But someday you'll grow weary of those paganistic cults.

327
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,880
And give away your money to the one who gets results.

328
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,020
And then your wallet will be for Bob.

329
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,560
Yes, your wallet will be for Bob.

330
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,300
And you will be the genius.

331
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
Not another stupid slob.

332
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,040
And your wallet belongs to Bob.

333
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,880
Well, I believe I am much calmer.

334
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,380
Got the peace of head, Arnold Palmer.

335
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,800
Sittin' on the dashboard of my car.

336
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,180
Music

337
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

338
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,440
Bob, where's Bob?

339
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,580
Bob, where's Bob?

340
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
Bob, where's Bob?

341
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,960
Thank you, Mr.

342
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,840
I'm moved today to come and present my own testimony to you.

343
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,000
If you will allow me, please, to introduce myself.

344
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,360
Who are you, Sister?

345
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,840
My name is Sister Magalina Hagalina Hoopataka Wakataka Hogan Logan Pogan.

346
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,100
Music

347
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,160
Now, I'm very pleased to be here today.

348
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,620
I would just like to give up an offering of thanks not only to J.R. Bob Dobbs,

349
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:38,300
but also to the power of Connie and the Yang principle inherent in this subgenius church.

350
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,700
Thank you, Sister.

351
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,480
You know, I myself was born and brought up thinking I was a normal.

352
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:52,820
But inside, something told me I was different.

353
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,840
And then I met Connie.

354
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:02,160
And she introduced me to my true subgenius heritage.

355
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,920
Thanks, her parents.

356
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:04,660
Yes.

357
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,300
And white Russians, by the way, too.

358
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,180
Those white Russians, they went down pretty well.

359
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,400
Well, Connie, you know, she opened my eyes and showed me the light.

360
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,080
She led me to the truth.

361
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:28,920
And it was a difficult truth, ladies and gentlemen, that I was really born a child of the Yeti.

362
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,660
Thank you, Sister, I say.

363
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,000
And as I grew to accept that difficult truth,

364
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,400
I discovered that I truly did love this subgenius way.

365
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,000
And you know why?

366
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,280
Because in Connie's church, the women get to be on top.

367
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,840
The conspiracy, they think they've got it all under control.

368
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,500
They tell you what to eat, what to wear, what to think.

369
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,160
Well, not me.

370
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,640
Not me.

371
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,320
I'm a subgenius.

372
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,420
I am a sister of the Yeti.

373
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,160
And I am anything but normal.

374
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:15,580
I say we all decide we can let the normals decide to wear the same color shirt on the same day of the week

375
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,400
and have all of their clocks run on the same time.

376
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,200
Well, not me.

377
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:25,280
I refuse to agree with anything the conspiracy represents.

378
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,560
And that is my testimony today.

379
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,900
Kill the horrible.

380
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,660
Kill the horrible.

381
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,120


382
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,380
Kill the horrible.

383
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,400
Kill the horrible.

384
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,980
Kill the horrible.

385
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,420
We are no Connie.

386
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,220
We won't stay alive.

387
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,120
Connie, sweet Connie.

388
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,620
We're breaking free, we're alive.

389
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,620
There are certain things that we can all agree on.

390
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,920
There is a right and a left.

391
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,720
Yeah, yeah.

392
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:17,960
Thank you. There is a wrong and a right. There is a good and a bad, dark and alive. Now to the pagans, there's a lord versus lady.

393
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:38,260
That was the yin versus yang, but the subgenius, well, while Bob may have had a lot of yin, take it from me, folks, Connie had a lot of yang.

394
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:46,560
It may take a subgenius to make all that money, but honey, it took a Connie to spend it.

395
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:57,700
Connie is the true goddess of the subgenius church. You can't con a Connie. God rebels for great ideas.

396
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:09,000
When I'm good, I'm very good, but baby, when I'm slack, I'm better. Getting up, getting up, and getting on for the greater glory of mankind.

397
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:17,940
Bob says, follow them if they can't take a joke. Well, Connie says, joke them if they can't.

398
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,280
God take a joke.

399
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,620
Yes!

400
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:47,940
Connie is the true goddess of the subgenius church, and like many other sub-gods and sub-goddesses, it took many incarnations upon this earth to reach her high and wide cosmic status.

401
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
Cleopatra, her slut face.

402
00:27:53,080 --> 00:28:03,980
Bob Ross, courting has who tested the lovers of Catherine the Great and sent only the best to serve the queen.

403
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:12,180
Joan of Arc is being decanonized, for evidence' sakes, she fluttered her soldiers.

404
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,940
The Catholic Church is saying that she never even heard those voices before here on earth.

405
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,420
But we can guess who those voices were, Wotan and all.

406
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,340
And Joan said she heard them, huh?

407
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:35,820
And how else are you going to get a bunch of normals to fight for you, huh?

408
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,180
She was a Connie.

409
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,640
And the Mona Lisa, huh?

410
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,400
Who the hell is she?

411
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,580
And why is she smiling?

412
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:52,540
Could she have slept and still not be telling, hmm?

413
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:01,920
Or maybe she just had a suck on the sacred pipe of Bob.

414
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:02,980
Yeah?

415
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,700
You think?

416
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,920
Simpson and Delilah.

417
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,020
She wasn't cutting his manhood

418
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,560
or taking his manhood.

419
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:15,560


420
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,780
She wasn't taking away his strength when she gave his hair a trim.

421
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,520
She was relieving him of his will to work

422
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,400
and giving him slack.

423
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,040
And in the time of Jesus,

424
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,600
well, maybe not the real fighting one,

425
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,180
but Christ at any rate,

426
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,900
Primal,

427
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,580
sexual,

428
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,060
Connie Salome did a dance like no other dance before it.

429
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,820
Or after it.

430
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:01,060
It was in this incarnation that the war against the conspiracy began.

431
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:08,720
And it's at this point in the play when the most amazing spectacle...

432
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,280
It was great, Bob!

433
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,820
But it was hell, Connie!

434
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,700
Hell, Connie.

435
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,080
Hell, Connie.

436
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,180
It was a hail of a Connie that came dancing out,

437
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,480
ululating like an Iranian housewife,

438
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,700
heard here in the background.

439
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,180
Whoa.

440
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,400
And at that point, I must cut in.

441
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,920
And actually, we come to the end of side one

442
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,080
of your subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

443
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,120
Prepare to switch to side two.

444
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,980
But, oh man.

445
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,280
Yeah, Connie Salome.

446
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,400
Mmm. Mmm.

447
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,280
Oh, that was the first of the Connies that came out on stage.

448
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,740
And like I say, you ought to just use your imagination.

449
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,160
Yes, yes, yes.

450
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,120
It's a beautiful thing, dear friends.

451
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,820
As I say, we've been listening to The Marriage of Bob and Connie,

452
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,980
a sort of devival and play put on at the Art of Magic.

453
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,060
Oh, yeah.

454
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,160
A festival sponsored by Content Knowles,

455
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,380
who I believe has just moved to Austin, Texas this week.

456
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,180
Content Knowles, who also played Connie Salome,

457
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,720
who in our next installment will,

458
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,500
well, it leads into the head launch.

459
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,640
And you got this half-naked.

460
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,540
And this is how it happened.

461
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,060
Oh, yeah.

462
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,940
Anyestshit самые

463
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,780
Great single head, the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer!

464
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,400
Bleeding head good!

465
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,560
Heel head bad!

466
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,580
Bleeding head good!

467
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,640
Heel head bad!

468
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,400
Bleeding head good!

469
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,160
Heel head bad!

470
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,020
Bleeding head good!

471
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,040
But who would launch the head?

472
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:10,640
No.

473
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,520
A little child.

474
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,700
We've never had a child launch a head.

475
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,720
A tiny, little, cute, three-year-old girl

476
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,220
knocked that head soaring into the audience.

477
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,760
Oh, it was a lovely head-launching,

478
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,320
an innocent head-launching.

479
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,120
They're building up to the head-launching.

480
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,060
The next one to catch the head will be the next one, Mary.

481
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,540
There it went. There it went.

482
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,760
A little child's golf club wielded by a child,

483
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,580
sending the head bouncing into the audience,

484
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,940
from which it bounced back, of course,

485
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,960
slugged it back, the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer,

486
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,900
still bleeding.

487
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,620
Thank you.

488
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,600
I exhorted them to get on their knees.

489
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,060
This was certainly the...

490
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,980
The least traditional head-launching,

491
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,660
and yet, was it not touching?

492
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,620
Did you not go home and say,

493
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,740
I saw the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

494
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,540
launch in a true and sacred way

495
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,680
by somebody who really meant it?

496
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,860
Connie, oh, Connie

497
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,180
You're always there to guide

498
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,280
Connie, sweet Connie

499
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,660
You make me feel alive

500
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,300
Connie is a little girl

501
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,480
We're in children's play

502
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,280
Connie's in the lost days

503
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,080
With nothing much to say

504
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:05,240
But we lose track of the elusive Connie.

505
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,700
Where did she go?

506
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,640
For centuries, she seemed to...

507
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,740
To have died.

508
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,800
Been forgotten.

509
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,880
Maybe she was lost, for all we know.

510
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,740
Or, maybe we were lost.

511
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,200
Or, maybe she was taking some time off.

512
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,400
Going back to goddess finishing school,

513
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,200
or whatever the hell it is we do between these incarnations.

514
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,400
Cutting herself some much-needed slack

515
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,560
only to arrive in her most powerful incarnation,

516
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,340
oh, she died, all right.

517
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,260
She died and was reborn into the minds of mortals

518
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,040
all over the United States.

519
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,360
Clara Bow, the It Girl of the silver screen.

520
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,020
Betty Boop, Mae West, Rosie the Riveter.

521
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,560
Although some may say she wasn't very slack,

522
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,140
she did show women how to have their own money.

523
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,640
Oh, she did.

524
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,140
Smoke a cigarette and have a beer at the local bar after work.

525
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,480
Yes! Rosie taught slack!

526
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,820
There was a price to pay.

527
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,640
Oh, there was a price.

528
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,520
We had to go to work!

529
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:38,420
But don't we always pay to know what we really think?

530
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,040
See you then.

531
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,620
Help Bob give hope to hurting women.

532
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,740
We'll be back in a minute.

533
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,400
Oh, what's your point?

534
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:45,980
What's your point?

535
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,620
What's your point?

536
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,520
Ma?

537
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,320
Why don't you go have your research department give you some more education, bud?

538
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,720
My name's Bob.

539
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,360
Do you want to be part of a world of sleeping people?

540
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,240
Sorry?

541
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,980
D'you know anything about girls' birth, Ellen?

542
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,600
Well, I'm starting in full strength right now.

543
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:27,720


544
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:27,760


545
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:35,120
Oh, so it's bibs, you mean?

546
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:35,940
No.

547
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,040
There's no bibs.

548
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:48,980
real-life Nazis, the hurting kind, not anything cutesy like Colonel Clank and all that stuff.

549
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:56,780
I'm talking millions of Aryan-type-looking men, brain-mashing demons,

550
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:04,060
taking away our security and our sanity and giving us fear.

551
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:15,400
Real hard, dark, bombing-heavy, like me, a face so far uncomfortable yet,

552
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:23,400
hands shaking, mind raping, caught in the back of a throat terror.

553
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,520
Talk about a crime.

554
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,140
For Bob.

555
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:27,860
For his sister.

556
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
For me.

557
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,660
And the men.

558
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,520
Talk about a crime.

559
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,220
For Bob.

560
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,400
Won't hand respond to him.

561
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,580
Our story begins in the Great Depression.

562
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:50,260
Someday, sometime, somewhere in the midwest of America, you know what I mean.

563
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,960
Red, white, and blue-collar America.

564
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,820
Corn country, cow country, somewhere.

565
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,760
Somewhere.

566
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:56,760


567
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,320
There's no big goddamn rainbow.

568
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,820
As the Great Depression dragged on, Bob and Connie were born.

569
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,460
Now, on that day, aliens were saved.

570
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,280
Some say they came to take them away.

571
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,060
Some say they were dropping them off.

572
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,720
But there they were.

573
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,760
Bob was born.

574
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:26,760


575
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:26,760


576
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:26,760


577
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,640
Bob was born into the poorest of families.

578
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,840
Walked five miles a day with no pants on.

579
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,040
His mom had lost two jobs.

580
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,920
His father was out of three.

581
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:55,820
But when Bob saw Connie sitting there in the first grade with no pants on, he swore he'd be a millionaire.

582
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,740
Bob was born into the poorest of families.

583
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,960
And we see here the little Connie sitting on the schoolyard bench.

584
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,520
Bob's little friend, Woody, walks up.

585
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,340
Gee, Connie, I'm sorry I stained your dress.

586
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,480
When my mom sees that, she's gonna bruise my bum and take away my baby prairie squid.

587
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:22,180
I was playing with some of my dad's industrial solvents, and I invented this spot remover.

588
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,200
I call it C'mon.

589
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,660
C'mon!

590
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,060
C'mon!

591
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,760
C'mon, Connie, I'm sorry.

592
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,020
That's okay.

593
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,620
It's behind the garage at four.

594
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,560
Try to control yourself this time.

595
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,620
You bet.

596
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,720
See you later, Connie.

597
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,200
Now the little Bob enters.

598
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,500
The little Bob enters and gets his first eyeful of little Connie.

599
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,860
And she looks great, dear friends.

600
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,100
And he thinks to himself,

601
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,120
I'll build your door.

602
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,260
I'll build your door.

603
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:02,660
So Bob then shyly sits down next to little Connie and kind of sidles up to her.

604
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,880
They blush.

605
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,000
It's cute.

606
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,840
And finally, Connie can't stand it any longer.

607
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,220
I'll show you yours if you'll show me mine.

608
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,460
Okay.

609
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,680
What's your name?

610
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,100
I'm Connie.

611
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,860
Bob.

612
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,740
Now that's a name I can remember.

613
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:36,020
Bob was five when he heard this radio announcement.

614
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,400
Up in the air, Junior Birdman.

615
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,740
Up in the air, Birdman pies.

616
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,620
The Junior Birdman show was had in a contest,

617
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,100
and the lucky winner would take home

618
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,080
one million dollars.

619
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,460
Bob had his work cut out for him,

620
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,560
but he couldn't work.

621
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,400
He didn't want to work.

622
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,100
So he got himself a lemonade stand,

623
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:12,280
and he sold that lemonade for five cents a glass.

624
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,120
But it was only two cents if you sent his name into the Junior Birdman show.

625
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,720
Little Connie enters again.

626
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,740
This was fine in my first grade.

627
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,520
He won the Junior Birdman contest.

628
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,980
And then he had a big party,

629
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,520
and there was all this food,

630
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,620
and there was lemonade,

631
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,720
and there was cake.

632
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,380
And we didn't just eat that cake.

633
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,720
We ate the lemonade.

634
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,960
And then we went for rides in a real limousine.

635
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,740
And to top it off,

636
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,780
all the girls at the party,

637
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,620
he chose me

638
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,720
to give a real show.

639
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,740
And I got a silver dime.

640
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,560
Oh, what a palooka.

641
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,380
I read you the Rockefeller.

642
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,460
For nearly twenty years,

643
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,660
the rest of the world went crazy.

644
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:13,900
Hideous poverty became the largest war ever known.

645
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,520
Slacklessness grew to amazing heights.

646
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,180
Newer,

647
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,840
eviler heights.

648
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,720
When the conspiracy dropped the A-Bob

649
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,380
and took control of the chaos,

650
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,240
we entered the dark days.

651
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
Yeah, and at that point,

652
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,200
Bob and Connie, grown up,

653
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,880
meet again by chance at the Milwaukee Airport bar

654
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,200
and dance like crazy.

655
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,820
You know, I'm not a big fan of the New York Times,

656
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:51,820


657
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:51,820


658
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,240
but I've heard some good things about the New York Times.

659
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:53,940
It's been a while since I saw the New York Times.

660
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:53,940


661
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:53,940


662
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,380
and you know I will be.

663
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,740
Tell you what,

664
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,000
drinks are on the house.

665
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:57,980
Thanks!

666
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,100
Suff.

667
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,380
What have you been doing with yourself lately,

668
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,700
you big palooka?

669
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,300
As little as I can get away with.

670
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:09,600
Oh?

671
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:17,100
I sit, I smoke my pipe, they take a picture, I get a check. It's a living!

672
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,260
I've done a bit of movie work myself.

673
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:26,900
Really?

674
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,300
Beautiful dead Connie.

675
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,880
Connie, leader of the high school Hellcats.

676
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:38,240
How did it happen? Was she murdered? What went on in that big house?

677
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,000
See High School Hellcats.

678
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:50,380
Well, you turned out to be quite the lucky catch. Tell me, who's the lucky guy?

679
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,620
They were all lucky.

680
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,760
So, I booked a room over at the airport Holiday Inn.

681
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,160
Really?

682
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,480
I own the airport Holiday Inn.

683
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,760
My place?

684
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,340
Or yours?

685
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,720
Yours!

686
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,140
Congratulations, Bob and Connie. You have passed the alien test.

687
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,860
You subgenius have found each other. Go forth. Slack off.

688
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,220
And lather up.

689
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,020
Let others learn from your effortless example.

690
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,420
Serve floodplains. Ride the wave of love.

691
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:54,420
Fear not. Only subgenii can hear me. Not the normals.

692
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:04,400
Go forth. Spread the word. There are others like you and they would pay to know what they really think.

693
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,280
Let them fool the world over their own eyes.

694
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:14,000
I am Wotan, Elder God of the Imperial Wisdom of Slack.

695
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,320
The Earth has fallen prey to a shroud of slacklessness and hatred.

696
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,020
The conspiracy is doomed.

697
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:32,180
The norm is actually 44 years from today. Only the subgenii will be saved from the exes and their impending doom.

698
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:37,140
Bob and Connie, I charge you with slack.

699
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:42,440
You have 44 years to reap the benefits of what you sow.

700
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:49,200
Go forth and fornicate as though your very lives depended on it.

701
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:55,800
They bought it.

702
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,220
Connie only sleeps with them.

703
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,800
Under the quiet moon.

704
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,820
Just Connie is a lovely...

705
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,500
Say, who picked up the tab in that last strip joint?

706
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,880
You did, Woody. Don't you remember?

707
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,220
Come to think of it, I am a little light.

708
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,800
Well, here we are. Las Vegas.

709
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,300
Have you ever seen so many beautiful, available women in all your life?

710
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,780
Oh, I shouldn't tempt you on your last night as a free man.

711
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,500
Ha! You think a little thing like a wedding is gonna cramp my style?

712
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,660
Well, it probably won't cramp Connie's.

713
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,300
What do you mean by that, Woodhead?

714
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,060
I don't think you really want to know, Bob.

715
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,200
Woody, how naive do you think I am?

716
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,980
I know the woman's insatiable.

717
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:05,100
As much time as she spends on her back, she should be the spokesperson for Sealy Posture Pedic.

718
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,980
I have my doubts when it comes to this wedding.

719
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,920
But when I look at Connie, all my better judgment just goes out the window.

720
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,980
There's just something about her.

721
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,600
There's something about her, all right.

722
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,700
Like what the hell's she doing on planet Earth anyway?

723
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,380
Don't worry, I know.

724
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,280
Excellent to hear all university jerks out there.

725
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,280
Did you get that?

726
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:48,660
Not quite, but you may be

727
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,260
Got mashed but very mashed too.

728
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:51,620
Nothing to say.

729
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:51,620


730
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,380
Yesss dear friends.

731
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,180
That's where I have to fast forward

732
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,020
on my master,

733
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:06,620
tape so that I can get to at least one more song from that play and make you bow down

734
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,820
before the glory that is Connie Dobbs.

735
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,400
Ah, yes.

736
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,000
I woke up Sunday morning.

737
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:15,620
Yeah.

738
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,620
Couldn't find my soul.

739
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,640
Well, I woke up Sunday morning.

740
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,120
Couldn't find my soul.

741
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:39,280
Well, my toilet seat was freezing and my bagel didn't have no home.

742
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,400
I went down to the river.

743
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,280
I saw Bob.

744
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,480
Staggered by.

745
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:56,440
I went down to the river.

746
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,600
I saw Bob staggered by.

747
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,820
A pipe clashed between his molars.

748
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,500
And a twinkle in his eye.

749
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,920
I said, Bob and Connie.

750
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,440
Bob and Connie.

751
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,000
Bob and Connie.

752
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:26,060
Bob and Connie.

753
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,580
Bob and Connie.

754
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,840
Bob and Connie.

755
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,600
Bob and Connie.

756
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:34,520
JOHNNY不對

757
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:34,880
볍

758
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,980
I.

759
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:39,980


760
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,660
I.

761
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,320
Oh.

762
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:48,420
I.

763
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,400
He said, I can give salvation

764
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,100
And I can show you a real good time

765
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,460
He said, I can give salvation

766
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,980
And I can show you a real good time

767
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,280
I said, Wotan says you're kind

768
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,700
So you're just a friend of mine

769
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:42,120
Wotan says, Wotan says you're kind

770
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,700
So you're just a friend of mine

771
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,200
Yeah, boss!

772
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,920
Well, she plays them and she finds them

773
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,500
She don't stack the deck no more

774
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:06,080
Well, she plays them and she finds them

775
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,840
She don't stack the deck no more

776
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,520
You better save your contributions

777
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:15,520


778
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,040
Or she'll kick your bleeding head right out the door

779
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:26,200
I said, Bob and Connie

780
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,000
Bob and Connie

781
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,440
Bob and Connie

782
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,240
Bob and Connie

783
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,780
Bob and Connie

784
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,080
Bob and Connie

785
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,220
Bob and Connie

786
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,540
Bob and Connie

787
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,320
Bob and Connie

788
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:00,320


789
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:00,320


790
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:00,320

Bob and Connie

795
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,720
Bob and Connie

796
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,240
Bob and Connie

797
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:08,240

you can't just fool around

802
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:11,920
Thesearemiamorichtos

803
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,300
There's one more

804
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,780
And that good

805
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,260
Hurry home to Connie.

806
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,180
And leave you on your belly.

807
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,140
Cause it ain't no use in denying.

808
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,660
She's the one that gives you slack.

809
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,740
One more time.

810
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,460
Bobby Connie.

811
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,060
Ooh, Bobby Connie.

Yeah, Bobby Connie.

Bobby Connie.

814
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,680
Ooh, Bobby Connie.

815
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,480
Bobby Connie.

816
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,960
Bobby Connie.

817
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,360
You do right.

818
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,220
Oh, so right.

819
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:11,120
Oh, so right.

820
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,760
If you want.

821
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,560
You got to tie the knot.

822
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,500
You got to tie the knot.

823
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,880
Well, if you want to know the night.

824
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,700
Boy, you still got to tie the knot.

825
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,360
You got to tie the knot.

826
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,260
Well, are you in or out of the program?

827
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,620
Are you on or off?

828
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,780
Oh, no.

829
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,720
Oh, no.

Oh, yes!

Praise merchant.

837
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,200
I'm mad!

838
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,280
Friends before concubines passed away.

839
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,280


840
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,280


841
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,280


842
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,280


843
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,280


844
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,280


845
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,220
stuff coming full body.

846
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:08,500
What are they getting yourself into?

847
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:08,640
deliberate setting today

848
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:08,640


849
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:08,640


850
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:08,640


851
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,700
Don't be the examiner!

852
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,360
Don, don't be the examiner!

853
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,000
Girl, what a great idea.

854
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,560
The dude stole my money.

855
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:19,780
Slime.

856
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,180
Well, you folks looking to get hitched, huh?

857
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:37,040
I can tell. Something about that dress, I guess.

858
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,060
Well, it'll cost you.

859
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,540
How's 20 bucks?

860
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,980
Ah, that'll do just fine. That's the going rate these days.

861
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,560
Yeah, fine institution, marriage.

862
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:52,040
A fine institution. Lots of folks doing it these days, you know.

863
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,400
Mm-hmm.

864
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:53,420
Yep.

865
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,740
Get hooked, get hitched,

866
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,420
spend the rest of your lives together,

867
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,340
and get bitched.

868
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,400
The rest of our lives?

869
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,280
That's what I said, little lady.

870
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,100
I couldn't do that.

871
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:11,520
I couldn't do that.

872
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:12,220
Honey!

873
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:12,460
Honey?

874
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,720
Well, what I mean is,

875
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,840
I have more than one.

876
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,340
Yes, and a nice pair they are, too.

877
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,340
No, I mean husbands.

878
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:32,660
When I find a fella I like, I marry him.

879
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:34,900
Keeps me from sinning.

880
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:36,920
Smart little lady.

881
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:40,060
I couldn't marry just Bob.

882
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,520
Woody, help me.

883
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,460
Oh, I'll marry you, Cody.

884
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,100
Woody!

885
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,520
Oh, goody, Woody.

886
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,320
Let's see.

887
00:55:52,700 --> 00:56:00,180
That makes you my 22nd and Bob my 23rd.

888
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:00,800
Yeah!

889
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:01,480
Yeah!

890
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,520
Good nurse!

891
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,460
Good marriage?

892
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,140
Okay.

893
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,900
Well, all right, I'll throw in the extra groom for free.

894
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,040
I'll get you married.

895
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,160
Oh, goody.

896
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,260
Well, if that's the way it's gonna be,

897
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:26,520
do you sub-genii take each other, so to speak, in holy matrimony?

898
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,000
Oh, yes!

899
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:36,080
Well, by the power vested in me by the city of Las Vegas,

900
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,720
Ha! Ha! Ha!

901
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,960
I, uh, hereby pronounce you, uh,

902
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,940
husbands and wife.

903
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,720
Yeah!

904
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:55,980
Well, feel free to go off and do whatever the hell it is you people wanna do.

905
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,940
You know, I think, uh, marriage is a fine institution.

906
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,240
Could always do with a little expansion.

907
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,500
Uh, anything for the greater good.

908
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,220
You know, people sin all the time.

909
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,940
And if more people got married to more people,

910
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,900
there'd be a lot less sin and a lot more fun in this world, I think.

911
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,880
In this world of mating habits

912
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,160
I have seen it all on Mars

913
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,420
Like a 98-year-old couple

914
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,480
Locked their walkers in the house

915
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,620
Right on this floor

916
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,940
As the communal carnal relations

917
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,420
Nearly turned into a mob

918
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,360
But for a truly unique sensation

919
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,000
We got to turn to Connie and Bob

920
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,860
Oh!

921
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,620
It's the miracle of the nineties

922
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,500
It's the talk of all the artists

923
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,920
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie

924
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,500
In the churches of TVS

925
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,500
It's the miracle of the nineties

926
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,340
It's the talk of all the artists

927
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,840
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie

928
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,840
In the churches of TVS

929
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,700
Don't forget, buddy!

930
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,200
Ha ha ha!

931
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,420
Hey!

932
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,080
Come on!

933
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:23,860
Hey!

934
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:24,480
Come on!

935
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,040
Hey!

936
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:25,220
Come on!

937
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:25,220


938
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:25,500
Come on!

939
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,320
Hey!

940
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,880
I've seen the mating of the iguana

941
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,880
And the rocks is what they prefer

942
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,680
While the flock just likes to hang around

943
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,320
Hoping something will occur

944
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,340
And though the rabbit is most unsteady

945
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,260
He is always ready when it's warm

946
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,580
But when it comes to Bob and Connie

947
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,480
There's no way of keeping score

948
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,480
Oh!

949
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,340
It's the miracle of the nineties

950
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:05,280
It's the talk of all the artists

951
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,700
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie

952
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:12,040
In the churches of TVS

953
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:15,400
It's the miracle of the nineties

954
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,440
It's the talk of all the artists

955
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,900
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie

956
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:25,360
In the churches of TVS

957
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,460
Oh!

958
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,320
Arriba! Arriba!

959
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,200
Arriba!

960
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,280
Arriba!

961
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:31,280


962
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,180
Well, it was the marriage

963
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:36,440
The marriage of Bob and Connie

964
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,480
And that was Bob on harmonica, by the way

965
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,980
And members of the Association of Consciousness Exploration

966
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,080
They're in Cleveland thanks to

967
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,060
Saint Sister Mary Squared Au Contrere

968
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,000
Princess We Are Doe

969
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,060
Queen of all the UFOs

970
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,520
Who played the little Connie

971
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,200
Content Knowles of the First Church of the First Amendment

972
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,420
Who sponsored the Art of Magic show

973
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,320
Where that was held at

974
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,360
Played Connie Salome

975
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,500
Preacher Reverend Joe Pro Schmo

976
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,180
Who co-authored the thing

977
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,340
There's Bob played by Jim Klar

978
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:22,380
Songs by Vicki Ganger and Sister Melodious Chops

979
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,240
Thanks to Mike Cole who plays the show in Cleveland

980
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,640
And we gotta get out of here, friends

981
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,500
Act II, the first show of the show

982
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,540
Next week

983
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:35,280
It's shame and reproach
