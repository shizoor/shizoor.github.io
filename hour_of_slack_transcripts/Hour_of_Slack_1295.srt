1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Well, that's a secret party that's a secret party.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,900
You want to blow your eardrums out.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,000
Old subgenius guys.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,200
Yeah, the people that started the thing.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,960
Who wants to talk to them?

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,740
Who are the people that started the subgenius church?

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,340
Anyways, I need a doctor.

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,720
I think we have one in the audience.

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,660
Bob Dobbs himself has just entered the auditorium.

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,120
Praise Bob, stand up everyone.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,200
Oh my God, something has happened at the theater.

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,280
In the theater.

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,320
In the motorcade.

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,200
Something has happened in the motorcade.

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,260
Someone has just shot J.R. Bob Dobbs.

17
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,800
He's down on the ground.

18
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,740
And there he is.

19
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,580
The preachers are surrounding him.

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,400
People are screaming.

21
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,000
There's that horrible killer.

22
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,720
Dr. Howell has found his pipe.

23
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,960
Dr. Howell's not here tonight.

24
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,580
The pipe is broken.

25
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,100
But we do have in our studio here.

26
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,480
Could this be the end of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself?

27
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,020
Is it live or is it minorex?

28
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,740
What evil could possibly happen?

29
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,360
I think that's Reverend Stang.

30
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,200
How could that be?

31
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:02,680
Where?

32
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,240
That's Reverend Stang.

33
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,980
Here on the Puzzling Evidence Show.

34
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,600
Live.

35
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,820
Or something like it.

36
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,720
Where is Dr. Howell?

37
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,380
Actually, that's a very sophisticated tape manipulation

38
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,100
by our host, Puzzling Evidence.

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,280
He'll make it sound as if Reverend Stang is actually live in the studio tonight.

40
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,760
It was a skillful manipulation of tape.

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,620
Editing.

42
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,100
With real tape.

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,340
Real-to-real tape.

44
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,900
The splices are an inch thick in some places.

45
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,060
It's amazing how we can...

46
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,140
My first splices were...

47
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,580
Yeah, Scotch tape and my mom's sewing scissors.

48
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,140
Yeah.

49
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,220
On quarter inch tape.

50
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,560
And every time it would hit the tape head, you'd hear a big...

51
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,920
Yeah, you'd see the...

52
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,300
Back when I was a kid, we had to use masking tape for recording.

53
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,720
I remember...

54
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,180
I remember when we had to use a match head.

55
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,180


56
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,180


57
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,060
We had to get more than one track on that mono box.

58
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:02,860
Yeah.

59
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
We just...

60
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,600
We just stick a match stick...

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,760
Stick a wire to that dang duct tape in this giant recorder machine

62
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
and it would pull that tape through.

63
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,060
It was hard because it was sticky.

64
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,800
It was sticky.

65
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,220
But the sticky was where the recording took.

66
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,440
Yeah, well, it was...

67
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,280
It was very fuzzy and hissy sound.

68
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,440
I had some tape at...

69
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,000
Like this recording of yours truly, Reverend.

70
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,180
I've been Stang.

71
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,960
I knew when I was using it...

72
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,400
I knew when I was using the tape that it was already missing its media.

73
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,600
The hour of slack.

74
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,060
Oh, wait.

75
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,640
Oh, no.

76
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,100
There's copyrighted music in the background.

77
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,800
This is not...

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,280
We can't use that.

79
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,100
We can't use that.

80
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,540
No.

81
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,220
That's...

82
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,160
Okay, now you can do it.

83
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,120
Just...

84
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,540
Oh, wait.

85
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,280
From problem...

86
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,840
Why do I give it to my cough and cold and stuffed up nose?

87
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,660
Oh, wait a minute.

88
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,580
Do you somehow thought this was the call-in health show?

89
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:49,820
Send $30 to...

90
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,740
Oh, that's right.

91
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,780
It's a public station.

92
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,720
You thought this was the call-in health show?

93
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,480
That we were going to give you advice on your sniffles and...

94
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,800
We used to.

95
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,600
Your need for rhinoplasty.

96
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,640
We used to before we became hateful and mean.

97
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,420
We used to tell people how to...

98
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,440
We give people advice and tell them how to live.

99
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,420
We tell them their past lives.

100
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,680
Give me some advice, then.

101
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,260
Okay, well, good advice.

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,660
Boy, we're short and low and so high.

103
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,020
We've got a lot of...

104
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,760
Do you have any use for bad advice?

105
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,740
Like, go mountain climbing all by yourself.

106
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:23,800
Okay, get ready.

107
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,140
Here's the fanfare music leading up to the fantastic advice.

108
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,640
Do I take medicine?

109
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,300
It's not quite here yet.

110
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,320
When you encounter a mediocre advice...

111
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,220
It's just mediocre advice.

112
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,140
...on the trail.

113
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:34,580
Yeah.

114
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,200
Crouch down like his prey and shiver.

115
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,200
This is just mediocre advice at this point.

116
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,740
We're getting closer to the excellent advice.

117
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,540
No, this is actually really bad advice.

118
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,360
Oh, this is bad advice.

119
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,560
I'm working on bad advice, yes.

120
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,220
When you...

121
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,840
So when you encounter the lion on the trail, you should, like, make faces at him and go...

122
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,440
That's what you should do, actually.

123
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,540
Shoot the finger at him.

124
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:54,660


125
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,220
The bad advice is to cower and shiver.

126
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,940
Or to flee.

127
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:58,940


128
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:58,940


129
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:58,940


130
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:58,940


131
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,120
Or to flee.

132
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,660
Because that's what his prey does.

133
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,760
What should you do is roll over and expose your...

134
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,500
What his prey doesn't do is go...

135
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,300
You should roll over and expose your belly.

136
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,200
Oh, that's so cute.

137
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,340
Okay, now put that away.

138
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,620
I wish I could do that.

139
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,420
Better find out if he's friendly first.

140
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,380
The show wants to help this individual, but the show's help is so...

141
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,740
It's such short supply right now.

142
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,980
We can't really help...

143
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,680
We looked in the help bucket and it was completely empty.

144
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,180
And we're not really here.

145
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,580
No, this is a tape.

146
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,140
A special sneaky tape made by Cousin Evans.

147
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:42,900
So thanks to the studios at WCSB Cleveland, we're able to seem to be together.

148
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,580
We're channeling Dr. Gene Scott on Line 3.

149
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,500
How realistic.

150
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,360
Anyone ever really anywhere, anyhow?

151
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,460
Princess Wee is here.

152
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,900
Princess Wee should be joining us.

153
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,320
Well, she's been photographing.

154
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,340
But she is doing a job.

155
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,440
She's been photographing.

156
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,020
She's been photographing.

157
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,120
She's photographing.

158
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,340
Manufacturing the tools.

159
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,540
My very favorite picture of you and me, Dr. Drummond, was taken in here, but our places

160
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,060
were switched.

161
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,700
That was over there?

162
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,500
And you were listening to the microphone.

163
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,400
You had your ear to the microphone and you were talking in your headphone.

164
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,140
It looks perfectly natural.

165
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,860
I do that sometimes.

166
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,480
It's in the last subgenius.

167
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,940
It's in the third subgenius.

168
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,640
I do that sometimes.

169
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,360
I shouldn't say the last one.

170
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,780
The most recent.

171
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,140
There will never be a last subgenius.

172
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,560
The most recent.

173
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,580
The most recent subgenius.

174
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,980
Are you talking about the third subgenius empire, 1878 to 1892?

175
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,020
No, no, no.

176
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,320
I'm talking about the recent.

177
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,660
Oh, okay.

178
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,160
I could take my colorful, my colorfully quaint hat off, I guess.

179
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,440
No, those were the early subgenius tablets.

180
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,580
I've got a different hat for you.

181
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:48,660
Those days.

182
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,880
You could, if you, you didn't have to take the whole subgenius tablet.

183
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,680
It had all of our laws on it, but you didn't have to take the whole tablet.

184
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,640
You could just take a half.

185
00:05:59,640 --> 00:05:59,820
Really?

186
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,780
Just even a nibble?

187
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,240
And then if you start to come on later.

188
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,760
Just a nibble off the end.

189
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,540
If you're not coming on in about an hour, you take the other half.

190
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,400
Isn't that right?

191
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,920
Something like that?

192
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,800
Right.

193
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:19,320
You don't have to eat the whole subgenius book of knowledge in one humongous hit, as

194
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,540
the kids call it these days.

195
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,560
They so humorously refer to it as a hit.

196
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,620
Give me a hit of that subgenius.

197
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,940
How can we compete with Jenkham?

198
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,960
You know, how can the church of the subgenius?

199
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,640
We don't even try.

200
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,940
I wonder if you'd put on this hat for me.

201
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,060
We'd like to go into.

202
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,840
Good Lord.

203
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,480
Someone has skinned.

204
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,680
Not only has an overman appeared on the planet Earth, but someone has skinned it.

205
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,900
Where did you find it?

206
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,160
Or maybe not.

207
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,900
How did you have it?

208
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,920
There's a dead overman skin.

209
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,060
Did I leave this somewhere?

210
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,300
I don't know.

211
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,880
What is it?

212
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,740
You picked it up the other day.

213
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,200
It's an overman.

214
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,180
It's a man's shrunken head.

215
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,040
But I thought here's a time when the primitive overman drops.

216
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,680
Half his brain will have to leave the show.

217
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,440
Good Lord.

218
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,620
Dr. Drummond, like Ed Gein, has spliced the skin of another overman.

219
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,120
And there aren't even supposed to be any other overman.

220
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,980
So it's like an overman wearing an overman mask.

221
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,040
It's hard.

222
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,000
It's a tough bit.

223
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,440
I can see where it's really.

224
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,860
They do have rubbery skin.

225
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,500
It looks amazing.

226
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,660
Really great.

227
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,020
The rubbery skin of the overman is impenetrable by normal.

228
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,780
Oh, I see.

229
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,360
Can you hear overman?

230
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,640
Sure, I can hear.

231
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,800
Can you hear me?

232
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:37,740
What?

233
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:37,960
No.

234
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,020
I can't hear me.

235
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,180
And it repels kisses.

236
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,260
I can't hear you.

237
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,520
Yes, that was the sad thing.

238
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,080
I can hear me.

239
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,660
What was sad?

240
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,200
This show is so better than a kiss in overman.

241
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,060
Oh, yeah.

242
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,940
His rubbery lip skin repels a kiss.

243
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,220
And his huge, bulging, chrome bone.

244
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,000
Ew, look what he's doing.

245
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,520
There you go.

246
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,920
He was heading for trouble.

247
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,880
The overman was.

248
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,120
You're in trouble.

249
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,860
Jumping off the head.

250
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,840
Overman, no!

251
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,520
Yep.

252
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,840
You're in trouble.

253
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,640
He was nogging, nog, nog, nogging at heaven's door with that giant head.

254
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,260
Yeah, that's what he does.

255
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,200
Actually, I like giant heads.

256
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:26,620
Although, I must say, Dr. Evidence, I was offended as I gazed around.

257
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,940
The lounge of the studio and discovered that there was not a Dobbs head pinned anywhere,

258
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,760
but one of those Andre the Giant heads.

259
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,960
And there's some other head over there pinned up on the wall.

260
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,360
Oh, no.

261
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:39,800
You're right.

262
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,240
But I wouldn't.

263
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,140
That Elvis head.

264
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,460
There was a single Dobbs head.

265
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:50,780
This is not the KPFA I knew where there was a Dobbs head branded on the skin of every

266
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,000
DJ back in the day.

267
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,920
That was the day, by the way.

268
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,680
Oh, the day.

269
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:55,840
Yeah.

270
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,760
Not every other day that the kids are talking about these damn kids.

271
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,720
Yes, friends, welcome to another episode of the Hour of Slack.

272
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,220
Hopefully, one that won't need to be edited greatly, except to reverse the phone numbers.

273
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,600
Except when they say, X day.

274
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,600
What do you think of my knee?

275
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,720
We do.

276
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,220
Don't obey any of the phone number suggestions by Mr. Reverso Mouth.

277
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,820
Yeah, my knee, too.

278
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,200
I know.

279
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,360
My knee, three.

280
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,500
So now, you know, it's just like the old days.

281
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,720
When I first came to see you guys, it's just cameras everywhere, only we were in Dealey

282
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:34,920
Plaza.

283
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,960
Yeah, the big difference is I don't have one of the cameras.

284
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,940
Back then, the cameras were bigger and they were separated.

285
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,800
They were actually in different devices than the recorder and the phone and everything.

286
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,020
UFOs can notice also that his head just changed again.

287
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,020
They actually had a different device for every little function.

288
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,500
Can you believe that?

289
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,800
I was the guy that had to sync the sound to the camera.

290
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,740
I was the guy that had to sync the sound and the picture up.

291
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,420
Of what?

292
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:04,260
And before, well, all that duct tape that we recorded everything on.

293
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,220
He had one roll of duct tape for a picture and a roll of masking tape.

294
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,700
And then we just used the same roll over and over again.

295
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,860
We just kept recording other things on top of it.

296
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,840
Yeah, you couldn't make a copy of any of it.

297
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,820
You could make a movie and then show it once.

298
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,840
And then it would lose its stick.

299
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,520
The Return of Negi.

300
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,580
16.

301
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,980
I think that tape was on like, we'd use this duct tape probably 40, 45 times by then.

302
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,800
Man, that sucks, but you guys have probably a tape of that.

303
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,400
A tape?

304
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,160
We can't hear you unless you yell.

305
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:39,780
Oh, can you hear me?

306
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,780
No, you have to get into a microphone.

307
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,060
We're on the radio.

308
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,720
Oh, well, I can hear her.

309
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,520
Fairly close to your ear.

310
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,880
848-445-DETAILS.

311
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,580
Speak to the other man, Ivan Stang, Cousin Emmett, and the Queen of UFOs.

312
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:54,820
Right here.

313
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,700
For serious.

314
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Forever.

315
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,900
That's why we play that pink music.

316
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,120
There we go.

317
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,740
It's all better now.

318
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,420
This sounds like old show music background.

319
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,920
Oh, ew.

320
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:17,200
I've been so busy on the secret project that I have had to run reruns for our Slack for

321
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,360
the last couple of months.

322
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,360


323
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,120
Thank you, everybody.

324
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,980
Thank you.

325
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,560
Thank you.

326
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,000
Thank you.

327
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,220
Thank you.

328
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,340
Thank you.

329
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:21,380


330
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,480
We've got more great reruns.

331
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:22,720
Yes.

332
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,840
I was going to say, you know how lucky we are.

333
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,040
Shows were good back then.

334
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,820
No, really.

335
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,880
Settle down.

336
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,000
All of us are going to have reruns to go back to.

337
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,020
Settle down out there.

338
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,540
I mean, we have big audio banks.

339
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,140
Somebody, young people now, comment on that to me.

340
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,200
Okay.

341
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,520
If they don't settle down, we're going to get the water cannons out.

342
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,380
They assume I've been everywhere in the shop ever.

343
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,220
We'll hold them down.

344
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,280
And people see me at events that I'm not at because oh yeah, I saw him.

345
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,900
He was shooting that.

346
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,120
He was shooting that.

347
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,120


348
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,820
You're controlling yourself.

349
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,060
He was there shooting that.

350
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,500
So that's, I just thought I'd want to share that with you.

351
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:55,660
And also the other thing is, I have a three-quarter inch bait, a pneumatic machine next to my chair at home.

352
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,460
I've got one.

353
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,920
He's got one that's like he can...

354
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,620
If you've got any of those, I have those tapes.

355
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,800
Yes, I have those tapes.

356
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,760
And they're probably falling apart.

357
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,120
So they might be, they're in the giant archive basement.

358
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,580
You should think about...

359
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,400
Your third level down at the slacker mansion.

360
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:13,740
It's all there.

361
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,180
You should think about maybe using that pneumatic machine to...

362
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,460
Will that audience shut up?

363
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,120
Good Lord, how much butt kissing can they do?

364
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,380
Bobby, he says.

365
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,740
Just wave your arm like a cutoff signal.

366
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,700
Just wave your arm like a cutoff.

367
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,660
Like a cutoff signal in a band.

368
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,080
Okay.

369
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:29,940
Okay.

370
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,860
Do it, do it.

371
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,240
Jesus.

372
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,600
There you go.

373
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,020
They're very responsive.

374
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,580
This is like land that chopper in front of me.

375
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,280
Oh, yeah.

376
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
You can't just...

377
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,040
You have to give the right signal.

378
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,200
We got here by helicopter.

379
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,460
Helicopter.

380
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:43,800
Yeah.

381
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,920
By heliopter.

382
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:45,960
No, no.

383
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,900
Actually, we rode helicopters this time.

384
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,720
All the way.

385
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Hip-hopping.

386
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,100
Because it's a big project we're working on.

387
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,560
A big mysterious project.

388
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,460
Yeah, tell us about the mysterious secret project.

389
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,120
Well, yeah, right.

390
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,680
What?

391
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,920
And unveil those mysteries?

392
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,980
The inter-inter-mysteries?

393
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,120
No, no.

394
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,520
You're supposed to lie about it.

395
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,360
You know, like it's interesting.

396
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,760
Oh, what?

397
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,060
Unveil the mysteries.

398
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,640
We...

399
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,400
Oh, don't do that.

400
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,240
Don't.

401
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,180
Unveil the mysteries.

402
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,180


403
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,180


404
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,600
The mysteries.

405
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,080
The mysteries will become embarrassed and shy.

406
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,800
Well, we used to joke about...

407
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Get big goose pimples on it.

408
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,120
Yeah.

409
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,160
We joked about encoding the book of the subgenius into the DNA of cockroaches.

410
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,780
And then we would joke how they'd evolve so fast that after a while it would say,

411
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,600
Praise Bill.

412
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,060
Oh, yeah.

413
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,240
Praise something.

414
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,060
Do you tell the cockroaches they don't dream in Christ?

415
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,540
Praise Bill.

416
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:41,980
Well, as it turns out, the cockroaches don't have a complex enough DNA to use.

417
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,160
We have to use a higher...

418
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,380
Yeah, that's when we decided, well, let's just do it in like six-point type instead.

419
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,440
Really?

420
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,220
No.

421
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,860
Then the cockroaches are right over here.

422
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,100
Let's do it in three-point type.

423
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,740
I can't read our old stuff.

424
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,180
Yeah.

425
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,660
Wasn't that a great idea?

426
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,480
I have to have a magnifying glass to read our old stuff.

427
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:04,480
It should be dense enough that it evades scrutiny by its sheer density.

428
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,880
Well, the idea was that you had the word of Bob in your pocket, but the conspiracy made

429
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,280
us print these books large size.

430
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,180
We wanted them more like...

431
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,840
Like a little Bible.

432
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,900
A little miniature Bible.

433
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,080
Yeah, like the Chairman Mao's little salad book.

434
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,440
Yeah.

435
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,800
Yeah.

436
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,560
They cost a lot to do that.

437
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,600
Osama Bin Laden's little yellow book.

438
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,020
Yeah.

439
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,700
What?

440
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,240
Well, that's a collection.

441
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,740
Code yellow book by...

442
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,780
Yeah, they're cool, man.

443
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,980
Well, those days were the internet.

444
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,540
You can piece together your own book from your greatest...

445
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,720
Have you ever read Muammar Gaddafi's Green Book?

446
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,440
No.

447
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,240
No, I haven't.

448
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,400
I really want to.

449
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:38,860
It's amazing.

450
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,480
I've been wanting to for a while.

451
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,540
He's still on the bestseller list.

452
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:42,600
He's still on the bestseller list.

453
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,160
He's still on the bestseller list.

454
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,160


455
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,620
He's a genius.

456
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,760
About half of it is the best, most honest, blunt description of the conspiracy I've ever

457
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,080
seen.

458
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,060
And the other half is totally out there kooking.

459
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,480
So it's perfect.

460
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:54,860
Yeah.

461
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,180
It's like the...

462
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,880
Is it really green?

463
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,260
Is it really green?

464
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Muammar Gaddafi's little green book.

465
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,920
That's not what it's called.

466
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,920
But it's green because...

467
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,600
Called My Life or something.

468
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:04,900
Yeah.

469
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,280
My Life by Mo.

470
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,140
By Mo.

471
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,240
Mo's Life.

472
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,540
Yeah.

473
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,280
Muammer.

474
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,140
Muammar.

475
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,140


476
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,140


477
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,440
Muammar.

478
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,440
I've still got that Gaddafi head that Palmer Freedy's donated.

479
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,340
Oh, yeah?

480
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,200
Yeah.

481
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,380
The Muammar Gaddafi football head.

482
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:21,880
Right, right.

483
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,140
The football head.

484
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,360
Remember, it's shaped more like that.

485
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,420
I was so insistent in Gage.

486
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,360
We could kick it around.

487
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,960
What's that game you guys play here in America?

488
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,000
Hand Egg?

489
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,060
Here, Hand Egg.

490
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,980
They used a hand to throw an egg-shaped thing.

491
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,360
And Doc Frump was explaining that game.

492
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,320
And the men all wear gladiator uniforms.

493
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,100
They kick it, too.

494
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,700
Yeah, but it's Doc Frump.

495
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,460
That's wrestling.

496
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:40,980
Oh, they do?

497
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,200
They kick it.

498
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,900
They kick it.

499
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,760
And hand it.

500
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,680
I've got...

501
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,760
They hand it to one another.

502
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,040
They kick it and they throw it.

503
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,720
It's a strange thing.

504
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,220
They're always trying to get rid of it.

505
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,640
There's a lot like Sock Car in England and the other...

506
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,000
But they try to get rid of it.

507
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,560
They're always trying to get it, like put it in this thing at the end.

508
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,840
And then when they get rid of it, that makes it better for the other guy.

509
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:12,220
I have to admit that since I've thrown myself so deeply into deciphering the Dobbsian manuscripts,

510
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,400
I haven't been keeping up on plain ordinary...

511
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,780
Modern day conventions, right?

512
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:17,980
Yeah.

513
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,460
These expressions of modernity.

514
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,560
I see kids staring at these screens and they're squeezing things with their hands.

515
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,220
Fiddling with their hands.

516
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,320
Their little hands are going...

517
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:28,900
Yeah.

518
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,380
And there's a lot of that that I find...

519
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:32,720
Yeah, they're...

520
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,500
Look, those are electronic...

521
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,460
They're made out of electronics, I understand.

522
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:38,860
What?

523
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,560
Someone's invented a fancy new electronic gadget?

524
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,200
What?

525
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,200
It's an electric...

526
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,660
No way!

527
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,840
It runs on batteries.

528
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,740
Copyright 1999, Fernando Nandini-Murr.

529
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,280
Somebody invented something new?

530
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,820
He doesn't get quoted much because he never said very much.

531
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,940
Okay, we're going down into the subgenius archives here.

532
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,720
Oh, my God.

533
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,500
You can see Fernando Nandini-Murr is...

534
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:08,180
The archive, just alone for him, fills his entire ancient Swiss bunker.

535
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,680
Posting, I notice your breath has become...

536
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,080
Your breath has become...

537
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,300
Slightly labored.

538
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,720
Is this a tough climb for you?

539
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,140
Yeah, you know, it's more the atmosphere down...

540
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,880
Oh, man, we're on...

541
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,020
He can talk while he breathes.

542
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,700
The atmosphere down here is so fed.

543
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,680
Well, he's very advanced.

544
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,200
I wish I could talk while I breathe.

545
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,780
He's very advanced.

546
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,520
Hey, pass the feta cheese.

547
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,160
Oh, here we go.

548
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,520
Okay.

549
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,020
Here we go.

550
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,360
It's not real cheese, man.

551
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,140
You should have been here, like, last week.

552
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,900
We had this lady caller that was just stuffing us full...

553
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,820
It was puzzling evidence.

554
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,380
Ex-wife was calling us.

555
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,840
And she was filling us full of all this...

556
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,860
She's just bringing the memory home.

557
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,760
...up, the one-week-old memory.

558
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,520
Home food.

559
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,740
I feel like I'm just going to punch her out.

560
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,600
Does it make you feel like you...

561
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,940
I love you, and would you...

562
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,340
The transmission's slipping on the fourth gear.

563
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,480
If you can fix that, make me dinner, and bring me a beer...

564
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,340
Man, I would just knock the crap out of her if I were you.

565
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,760
She ought to be horse-whipped.

566
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,260
She's fine with all that, you know.

567
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,920
That's her breathing in the background.

568
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,440
You know how big she would be if that was her breathing?

569
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,660
She's wearing a diving suit.

570
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,100
I don't even know who you're really talking about.

571
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,880
But I'm not really here.

572
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,740
You're just a tape.

573
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,500
We're going to clean your mind.

574
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,300
You're just a fancy tape.

575
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,700
You did not hear this.

576
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,460
I'm not.

577
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,500
Fancy mixtape.

578
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,420
The best part...

579
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,260
Intricately spliced together from ancient tapes.

580
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,840
So I go see Avatar, right?

581
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,340
Yeah.

582
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,340
And, you know, I get there a little bit late and get in the front row, kind of over to the left.

583
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,660
Because I went there a couple of times to see big 3D technology, right?

584
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,080
And I sit down.

585
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,060
And a whole bunch of young men sit down next to me.

586
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,800
They're still talking and doing the whole cell phone thing.

587
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,440
And then the movie starts.

588
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,200
Everybody gets quiet.

589
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,920
The movie's going along.

590
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,560
The movie's going along.

591
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,700
And remember when Cigarette Lady from, you know, the...

592
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,040
Trinidad?

593
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,960
There was a Cigarette Lady.

594
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,740
Cigarette Lady?

595
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,260
Yeah, she's Cigarette Lady in real life, but not in...

596
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,840
Ripley.

597
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,760
You know, the Ripley lady.

598
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,120
Oh.

599
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,520
Dies.

600
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,100
Oh, Cigarette Lady.

601
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,000
The kid next to me.

602
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,020
Yeah, he's probably like 17.

603
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,880
Screams out her name at full volume.

604
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,820
In the silent theater.

605
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,120
It was just amazing.

606
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,240
You know, it was like...

607
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,540
He was so in there.

608
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,180
He just went...

609
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,020
Whatever.

610
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,960
Did he scream out her character name?

611
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,400
Yeah.

612
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,500
Yeah, staring at the screen.

613
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,900
He was so into the movie.

614
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,560
And I'm thinking...

615
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,220
You're never going to live that character.

616
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,560
Your friends are never going to let you...

617
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,780
Actually, he was so into it.

618
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,380
He had to scream her name because it was so sad.

619
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,040
Yeah.

620
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,640
I thought it was amazing.

621
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,740
But he called her Ripley.

622
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,960
No, he called her whatever her name was in the movie.

623
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,120
You know, Georgette or whatever.

624
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,100
He said...

625
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,920
It's the sad part.

626
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,500
She's dying.

627
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:41,800
She's dying.

628
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,200
She's dying.

629
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,200


630
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:42,680
A tree of knowledge.

631
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,380
She was so good in Alien.

632
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:52,120
You know, that whole Avatar thing was really sort of a metaphor for Church of the Subgenius.

633
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,080
Isn't everything?

634
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,320
I saw that.

635
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,020
The Na'vi.

636
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,540
Turn that word around.

637
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,000
Spell it.

638
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,060
What does that spell backwards?

639
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,440
Ivan.

640
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,240
There you go.

641
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,060
Ivan, there it is.

642
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,700
Case closed.

643
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,440
And that other one that you turn it around backwards, it spells Drummond.

644
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,020
Yeah.

645
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,100
Yeah, the play.

646
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,760
That was the Unobtainium.

647
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,360
You turn it around.

648
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,540
It's inside and out.

649
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,760
Inside and...

650
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,200
And sideways backwards.

651
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:13,820
Yeah.

652
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,960
And it spells Drummond.

653
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,340
Perfect.

654
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,660
And crap story backwards.

655
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,900
So let's go...

656
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,240
Let's slack worry.

657
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:19,980
Right, right.

658
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,020
Let's go through the movie now.

659
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,640
Yeah, we could go through the movie.

660
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:22,780
Starting with the...

661
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,020
Piece by piece.

662
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,360
All right.

663
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,200
Where do you start?

664
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,760
I don't even remember when you started that thing.

665
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,920
All I remember are the sequences, like the going and getting your dragon.

666
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,460
Yeah, that's good.

667
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,560
That's nice.

668
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,240
I'd do that.

669
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,020
And then...

670
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,580
Oh, they do that in every movie now.

671
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,380
Climbing up the little dirt balls of the planet was amazing.

672
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,760
Or climbing up the flying dirt balls was a lot of fun.

673
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,020
Yeah.

674
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,000
In 3D.

675
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,920
The 3D...

676
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,500
The difference...

677
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,740
They have a bunch of different 3D systems.

678
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,160
And I went to see the...

679
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,000
There they go.

680
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,040
Like the best one.

681
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,860
They just fell into the water.

682
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,140
It's like a big volume space.

683
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,620
And they keep bringing focus in and out on the things they want your eye to go to.

684
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,720
Well...

685
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,480
I'm calling my mind.

686
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,580
That's one reason that ultimately gives you a headache.

687
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,080
It's because the camera is trying to focus where your eye goes to.

688
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,040
I have trouble watching the 3D movies really focus on a real thing.

689
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,320
My eyes just don't...

690
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,660
Can't...

691
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,340
I can't get used to the glasses on my...

692
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,700
On top of my glasses.

693
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,440
I'm washing my mind with radio water.

694
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,080
Right.

695
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,400
Oh, that radio water.

696
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,840
It's so deadly and yet so irresistible.

697
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,860
I'd rather watch it in 2D because then I'm not constantly reminded I'm trying to see 3D.

698
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,740
The radio dryer?

699
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,740
Or that I'm seeing 3D.

700
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,360
I'm sitting there going, wow, that's cool.

701
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,120
And it's 4U.

702
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,440
What were they talking about?

703
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,780
I wasn't listening to the plot anymore.

704
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,620
I like how it's so funny when he talks about show.

705
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,200
He believes there really is a show.

706
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,640
No, I'm just a tape too.

707
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,780
I think it's so funny when everybody goes...

708
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,940
That's why sometimes we go...

709
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,080
The ultimate insincere laugh.

710
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,520
Stupid.

711
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,140
And then there's the...

712
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,560
Now that qualifies as a sincere laugh.

713
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,960
That is a sincere laugh though.

714
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,560
Hey, Stan, you feel this?

715
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,020
That's not insincere.

716
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,240
It is.

717
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,600
It is.

718
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,600


719
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,600


720
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,600


721
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,600


722
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,600


723
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,600


724
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,440
You feel this thrill in your head.

725
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,800
You can call right now if you're a listener.

726
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:26,060
Actually, if you're a listener and you're a dedicated active listener, you'll call the show at 510-848-4425.

727
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,600
East of the Rockies, call 510-848-4425.

728
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,420
Can't breathe.

729
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,600
Our psychedelic hotline at 840...

730
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:38,760
4-4-8.

731
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,640
4-4-2-5.

732
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,100
What if they're west of the Rockies?

733
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,560
I'm going to have to reverse every time you guys say that so the people in Madison...

734
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,000
Yeah, Wisconsin, don't try to call that local number.

735
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,360
You need to call 5...

736
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,100
That's why we always put the area code at the beginning of it.

737
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,560
Huh?

738
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,840
That's why we always put the area code at the beginning and that way they'll call the show.

739
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,580
But it's...

740
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,280
Because the show's on all the time whether we're here or not.

741
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:05,760
Right.

742
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,260
There's somebody going to be here to answer that number.

743
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:08,840
Right.

744
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,440
Yeah, that's why...

745
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,320
And take your request.

746
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,360
And take your request.

747
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,700
Whenever Safeway or anybody wants my number, that's what they get.

748
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,680
848-4425.

749
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,040
That's my home number.

750
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,720
That's a good number.

751
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,000
So who knows what...

752
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,440
Don't say it's a bad number.

753
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,240
You see weird calls.

754
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,620
That's a good number.

755
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,760
You know, I just don't...

756
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,220
If you put that number together numerically and turn it around backwards...

757
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,960
I should say, one of the qualifications for being a friend...

758
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,400
It's a special secret.

759
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,660
...is you have to have a radio show.

760
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,200
Yes.

761
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,240
In your mind.

762
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,240
In your field of mind.

763
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,280
Somebody said they were going to call tonight.

764
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,400
If you're in North Carolina, would you call and give me a free car?

765
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
94.1 KPFA Berkeley, Indiana Free Free KPFA.

766
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,040
Because if you live in North Carolina, I need a car there.

767
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,480
I need to have a car in North Carolina.

768
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:04,440
You know, I got an email this very morning from a poor listener in Greensboro, North Carolina,

769
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,720
who was asking...

770
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,600
Well, he was basically informing me that he was...

771
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,500
He was probably the only subgenius in Greensboro, North Carolina.

772
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,120
The sad thing is, he's not by any means.

773
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,380
There's quite a few of them in Greensboro.

774
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,780
He just hasn't hooked into the community there yet.

775
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,040
The subgenius community.

776
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,980
Maybe he doesn't want to.

777
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,680
That's because subgeniuses, by nature, are not joiners.

778
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,660
And they don't seek each other out all the time very well.

779
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,560
And when they do, they eventually get in terrible fights.

780
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,500
Although sometimes they have sex first.

781
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,080
Yeah.

782
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,540
And get married.

783
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,320
And get married and have children.

784
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,080
And sometimes they just have...

785
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,100
But eventually they have the terrible, terrible fights.

786
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,520
God!

787
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,120
Spon of Bob!

788
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,980
Princess, we are laughing because it is so sad.

789
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,080
It is so sad.

790
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,960
I am laughing.

791
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,740
It is so sad.

792
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,080
We will cry forever.

793
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,800
It is so sad.

794
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,380
So many families have been formed at X Days.

795
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,860
And the weird thing is, I'm not even kidding.

796
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,760
I know.

797
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,400
That's scary.

798
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,860
We're moving X Day to a new site.

799
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,020
It's hard to get moved.

800
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,160
You want to mention that to the general public?

801
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,580
Oh, yeah.

802
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,200
Yeah, absolutely.

803
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,520
I'm not really here anyway.

804
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,540
Because it's against the rules of California.

805
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,260
No, it doesn't have anything to do with California.

806
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,440
Princess Maria is really breathing heavily over there.

807
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,560
You wouldn't be able to understand any evidence.

808
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,480
Her breathing is so heavy.

809
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,300
She can't breathe in there.

810
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,500
Possibly evidence.

811
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,040
Subgenius.com!

812
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,060
She can't breathe in there.

813
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,100
You should be there.

814
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,720
Subgenius.com.

815
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,140
There's lots.

816
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,860
I'm sure you can.

817
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,920
There's nothing there.

818
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,640
There's more information.

819
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,380
There's so much free stuff there.

820
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:37,800
It's not a call to action.

821
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,360
I was just reading many stories and looking at many videos.

822
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,420
It's a place to go to find out good things about life and things in general.

823
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,400
There's also dirty pictures there.

824
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,280
The CSS Hunley attacks the Usatonic and sinks her.

825
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,040
And then disappears for 134 years.

826
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,060
I saw for three days recently.

827
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,020
Wow.

828
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,180
Well, about a month ago.

829
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,280
Nobody will ever know what happened in New York.

830
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,340
Yeah, amazing.

831
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:02,380
And for three days I thought subgenius.com was down and my business had been destroyed.

832
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,320
Because it was blocked by the service for Super 8 motels.

833
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:07,880
Yes.

834
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,440
So if you're at a Super 8.

835
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:10,700
And Marriott.

836
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,180
We were in the fancy hotel, Marriott Hotel in New York City.

837
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,760
We were doing that big New York check.

838
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,940
I couldn't even see subgenius.com.

839
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,260
So that's all that blue gravity thing though, right?

840
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,140
Yeah.

841
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,640
Did you rub your nose to tell me that I had a booger in my nose?

842
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,000
No, no.

843
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,460
I rubbed my nose to get the booger out of my nose.

844
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,860
Okay.

845
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,500
Because earlier tonight, Princess, we rubbed her nose.

846
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,320
I'll do it like this.

847
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,640
I'll go.

848
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,740
And she meant, hey, there's a booger in your nose.

849
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,260
Ew.

850
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,000
And I thought she meant, don't do that.

851
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Don't talk about Walmart.

852
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,180
Yeah, yeah.

853
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,720
Don't talk about Walmart.

854
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,100
Why?

855
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,780
Do you have a problem with Walmart?

856
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,420
No, no.

857
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:52,260
We were with someone who has a big severe problem with Walmart.

858
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:52,740
Yeah.

859
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,760
A lot of people have to do it in this state.

860
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,100
I didn't want to get into it.

861
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,340
A lot of people do it in this state.

862
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,100
But personally, I think that people that don't like Walmart hate the poor.

863
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,340
Exactly.

864
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,320
I think they hate poor people.

865
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,980
I don't know whether to be ashamed because I shopped.

866
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,080
I don't know whether to shop at Walmart or because I'm so poor I have to shop at Walmart.

867
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:16,040
And not only do they hate the poor, but Walmart was invented so ugly people would have a place

868
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,480
to shop without fear of being derided by the beautiful people.

869
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,520
Why do you think I go there?

870
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,820
It was a great...

871
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,100
Well, all the good in Walmart.

872
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,840
Ugly people can finally go someplace and think, God, at least the beautiful people aren't

873
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,200
here looking at me and scrutinizing my every move and saying how ugly I am.

874
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,980
Putting me on a website.

875
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,960
I can park my fat carcass here with the rest of the ugly people.

876
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:37,960


877
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,360
Shopper'sEventsDay.com.

878
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,060
And nobody cares.

879
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,480
It's finally a beautiful place for ugly people and poor people who can't afford the high-priced

880
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,140
goods at those mom and pop locations.

881
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:50,700
Whatever, Milo.

882
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,860
I can't even hear you anymore with these old ears.

883
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,320
And friends, every time you download a movie, you're putting a mom and pop Hollywood studio

884
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,960
out of it.

885
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,420
That's right.

886
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,200
Damn, Mom and Pop.

887
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,880
There are moms and pops there, too.

888
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,480
Your mom and pop Hollywood studio.

889
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,640
Every time you go to the media ditch, really.

890
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,060
Yeah.

891
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,940
And you go fishing in the middle of the night.

892
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:07,940


893
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,040
You go to the media ditch and you bring back the big load.

894
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,140
That's all mom and pop.

895
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,100
You're taking that right out of the mouth of mom and pop.

896
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,520
You may as well be urinating on top of mom and pop.

897
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,260
Somebody pissed on this thing.

898
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,700
That's what I was thinking.

899
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,620
You were thinking?

900
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,800
I do not flop on mom and pop.

901
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,520
No, I was smelling.

902
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,120
I do not like.

903
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,120
It smells like spam and ham.

904
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:37,480
It smells like spam and ham.

905
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:37,900
I can't believe it.

906
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:44,200
I found myself reading that Dr. Seuss book, Green Eggs and Spam, at hyper-fast speed about

907
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,300
four days ago to my grandson.

908
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:52,380
And my daughter said, that is the fastest I've ever heard anybody do green eggs and

909
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:52,520
ham.

910
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:58,040
I just wanted to see how fast I could get through it without flubbing it.

911
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,800
Without flubbing it.

912
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,280
It's a tongue twister.

913
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:00,780
Yeah.

914
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,960
A lot of his work was very difficult to do at a high rate of speed.

915
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,820
It was fabulous.

916
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,520
I witnessed it.

917
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,100
I would not eat it with a coot.

918
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,780
I would not eat it on a boot.

919
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
I would not eat it in my hand.

920
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,100
I would not eat it with my trash.

921
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,440
I would not stroke it with my gland.

922
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,860
I do not like green eggs and spam.

923
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,880
I do not like them no more.

924
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,100
I would not flop it on my pop.

925
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,460
I would not pop it on some flop.

926
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,440
I love having princess Wei in the studio.

927
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:32,960
She's great.

928
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,880
She makes this sound so good.

929
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,260
She makes our jokes sound great.

930
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:36,620
Automatic audience.

931
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,940
Yeah, you'd think it was an audio put-up.

932
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:37,940


933
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:37,940


934
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:37,940


935
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:37,940


936
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,240
It was funny.

937
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:38,940
Is it real?

938
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,860
But it is funny.

939
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,920
It is funny.

940
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,240
To some people.

941
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,120
Well, to this people.

942
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,120
Some people.

943
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,100
I got a little...

944
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,000
Some people out there.

945
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,160
You know, there's an official...

946
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,940
People, yeah.

947
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,320
...subgenius Facebook page, and I posted links to an hour of slack on it.

948
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,620
The last one, which, by the way, was all reruns of this show.

949
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:04,940
Reruns?

950
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,320
And old Cher's show and old Susie's show.

951
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,820
It was the three great shows mashed together.

952
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,540
Excellent.

953
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,900
And this one person said...

954
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,680
Okay, I heard the word great.

955
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,580
This is slack.

956
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,080
This is just stupid.

957
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:16,940
Yeah, yay.

958
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:17,680
Oh, really?

959
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,240
He spelled stupid with an E.

960
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,200
Thank you.

961
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,100
S-T-E-P-I-D?

962
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,800
Stepped?

963
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,880
No, no.

964
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,020
That would be stupid.

965
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:26,720
What?

966
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,300
He stepped.

967
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,160
Which E?

968
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,020
I love that internet, boy.

969
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,300
Which E are you talking about?

970
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,460
Which internet?

971
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,060
Stooped.

972
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,480
You know.

973
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,200
A stooped.

974
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,420
Stooped.

975
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,240
That's the best.

976
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,660
That's the band.

977
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,440
See, that's the band.

978
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:38,980
The Stoopeds.

979
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:46,760
By the way, the lead keyboard player for the Stoopeds is also the third guy on the right

980
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,460
in the residence.

981
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:54,100
And the sax player in the Stoopeds with an E is the other resident.

982
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,480
When they play live.

983
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,820
Which they just did.

984
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,220
I don't know of these bands you start...

985
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,560
I'm going to turn that other one down.

986
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,420
Yeah, well, yeah.

987
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,360
Is this the Stooped Day Parade band?

988
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,900
No, Stooped is the guys who I'm talking about are also...

989
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,300
Are they?

990
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,300


991
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,220
Yeah.

992
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:08,880
Amazing...

993
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,140
It's a band called the Stoopeds.

994
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,520
Studio musicians.

995
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,240
Stoopeds.

996
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,800
And they play bad 70s cover tunes and sometimes play the beautiful Stoopeds Day Parade.

997
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,560
Yeah, they're really wonderful.

998
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,700
And in their spare life, the keyboard player does stuff like...

999
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,700
You know, the other half, the residents.

1000
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,620
The three and four guy are fake.

1001
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,520
I remember them.

1002
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,240
Yeah.

1003
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,860
One and two are real.

1004
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,640
Philo had many tapes of that ancient band.

1005
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,100
That's when I first met Lies.

1006
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,360
Yes.

1007
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,140
And, you know, people said, you should go...

1008
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,120
The only other guy that talks about Kennedy as much is this guy.

1009
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,760
Go see him, you know.

1010
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,960
Don't talk to me about it.

1011
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,000
So, yeah, I went over and he was playing.

1012
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,240
He was just getting all those albums and I'd never heard them.

1013
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,660
They were great.

1014
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,000
They were...

1015
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,600
And they were doing tapes.

1016
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,960
They were doing Super 8, you know.

1017
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,440
Who was that?

1018
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,060
Just like everybody else.

1019
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,800
The Rezzy dance.

1020
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,400
Oh, yeah.

1021
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,580
Philo was the one who knew about that band back in the days of Dallas.

1022
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,420
All homebrewing the boys.

1023
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,440
He would school me in this new art form called punk music.

1024
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,820
And I got to say, I was...

1025
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,240
What was it?

1026
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,340
New wage music.

1027
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,580
New wage.

1028
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,040
New wage.

1029
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,540
Yeah.

1030
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,080
Our new...

1031
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,120
I've got a good copy of Jack, Please Don't Go by the band that dare not speak its name.

1032
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,540
And I'm trying to match it to all that Super 8 we shot in Dealey Plaza.

1033
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,520
I've got one you should have.

1034
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,320
The shot of you going...

1035
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:31,140
Ivan staying in a clown suit, shooting at people with a BB gun in front of the front steps of the school book depository.

1036
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,760
I was scared.

1037
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,720
Really?

1038
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,840
I was so scared we were going to get busted.

1039
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,340
Me too.

1040
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:35,720
Yeah.

1041
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:35,860
Yeah.

1042
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,620
I was too.

1043
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,760
But, you know, it was like...

1044
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,560
We were like...

1045
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,400
It was so cool.

1046
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:39,980
It was amazing.

1047
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,320
And then people are just staring at him.

1048
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,700
This is 80s.

1049
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,520
Well, it was...

1050
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,200
You know what it was?

1051
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,840
He presses for the cross the street button.

1052
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,820
A lot weirder stuff happened around there all the time.

1053
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,020
He's a polite killer clown.

1054
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,780
He runs out.

1055
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,180
Yeah.

1056
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,840
It's not a light yet.

1057
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,120
So he runs out.

1058
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,640
But not just...

1059
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,340
I think it was...

1060
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,580
It was kind of exciting to be doing it.

1061
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:53,900
The traffic sounds.

1062
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,640
Getting away with it.

1063
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,980
Well, for our part, it was fun.

1064
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,320
Oh, man.

1065
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,080
But it was actually not all that novel.

1066
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,760
I mean, hadn't Ant Farm already done this huge art performance?

1067
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,120
75.

1068
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,500
75, yeah.

1069
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,440
But that was back when it was still bad taste enough.

1070
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,240
Awkward.

1071
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,600
I mean, there was really bad taste in Ant Farm, but they break the ice because they did that

1072
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:08,980
whole movie.

1073
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,420
Yeah, by the time we did it, it really was funny.

1074
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,380
It was only five years later.

1075
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,500
And at that point, the city fathers in your town are thinking, let's just wreck this building.

1076
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,320
So how long until 9-11 is real funny?

1077
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,140
It's going to be a while.

1078
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,080
It's going to be a while.

1079
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,280
Yeah.

1080
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,420
Probably another 10 years.

1081
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,140
Yeah.

1082
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,020
10, 20 years.

1083
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,620
Right.

1084
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,320
Well, because, yeah, Kennedy wasn't funny until what?

1085
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,500
The late 70s?

1086
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,040
Middle 80s.

1087
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,200
Yeah.

1088
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,000
Late 70s.

1089
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,100
Yeah, late 70s.

1090
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,660
We were all...

1091
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,220
We were all being...

1092
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,960
You couldn't accuse us of bad taste.

1093
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,300
Right.

1094
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,500
We're the very arbiters of good taste.

1095
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,480
Oh, yeah.

1096
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,360
And we're still...

1097
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,440
And Cary Thorne is still alive.

1098
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,680
We...

1099
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,480
Back then.

1100
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,060
Back then.

1101
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,320
That's right.

1102
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:50,480
I read in a magazine the other day by a crazy person that Cary Thornley lived in fear of

1103
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Ivan Stang.

1104
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,260
Really?

1105
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,280


1106
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,200
And he said, don't ever talk about Bob because Ivan Stang will sue you.

1107
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,960
And that seems strange for me to read because...

1108
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,640
All I...

1109
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,240
All I remember was friendly essays sent by Cary Thornley.

1110
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:04,620
Yeah.

1111
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,300
They were...

1112
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,600
You have to remember it's always about who's saying it.

1113
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,620
It's kind of hard to read.

1114
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,620
He was a little bit on the paranoid side, though.

1115
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,280
Well, he had to be.

1116
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:12,880
A little bit.

1117
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,360
He's like, imagine a moth close to the flame, you know?

1118
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:15,600
Yeah.

1119
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,360
That guy was involved in some stuff and then the thing they were involved in happened.

1120
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,820
Probably somebody else did it.

1121
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,280
But all of a sudden it's like, who...

1122
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,060
It doesn't matter if somebody else did it.

1123
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,820
You've been talking about it with a lot of people.

1124
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,040
Now, let's see.

1125
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,260
And he's called into every committee and he's...

1126
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,380
Got people like...

1127
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,600
Yeah, I remember driving to the city, picking him up, bringing him back over here, having him on the show, taking him back.

1128
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,720
I taped all that stuff and it's amazing.

1129
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,940
I thought, I would not want to trade places with his pants for anything.

1130
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,820
Yeah, no kidding.

1131
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,500
Yeah.

1132
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,240
Do you still have those tapes?

1133
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:44,660
Yeah.

1134
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,360
And that's what gets stained is the laundering.

1135
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,580
When you get that scary.

1136
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,600
Yeah, that's what gets stinky, too, is the laundering.

1137
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,080
I think he had a pretty complicated life.

1138
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,960
I've still got the tapes of the first guy that informed us he was Jesus.

1139
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,040
Picking him up at the airport.

1140
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,780
And him saying, yeah, I got all this pot with me.

1141
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:11,000
Let's all get busted so we can be on David Letterman tonight and explain how the Bible says marijuana should be legal.

1142
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,640
Yeah, he was going to smoke pot on David Letterman.

1143
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,220
Remember that?

1144
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,040
He was going to pull it out and fire it on David Letterman.

1145
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,500
This is after the church and the subgenius super lawyers got him out of jail.

1146
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,460
This is all going to happen that night.

1147
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,080
Right.

1148
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,840
The night after we picked him up at the...

1149
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,720
Nobody knows how good our lawyers are.

1150
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,020
He was our first coup.

1151
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,060
We actually went and picked him up.

1152
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,820
That was Will Small.

1153
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,500
Yeah, the great Will Small.

1154
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,840
Lord is real.

1155
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,340
Lord is real.

1156
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:47,440
But to think how far, how different it is, how my coup d'etat has improved so much.

1157
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,220
I do remember, I do remember.

1158
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:58,560
There hasn't been a Jesus able to tell me he was a Jesus since long before the real Jesus, Bevilacqua came.

1159
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,780
But do you remember?

1160
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:07,940
Will Small, after we had tested his wares a little bit, we realized why he was like he was.

1161
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,680
It was something he'd done in Hawaii, and this was some very special...

1162
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,900
Will Small, the true Jesus of that time, which was about 1983, I think.

1163
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,460
Something like that.

1164
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,920
He flew to Dallas from Hawaii to meet with J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1165
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,300
Bob was not around.

1166
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,120
Bob was in Tibet.

1167
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,940
But we were around.

1168
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,760
I got...

1169
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,500
It was a long time ago.

1170
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,100
And my family wasn't around.

1171
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,200
That was the only reason he ended up in my house.

1172
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:40,580
Yeah.

1173
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:46,180
But he ended up in the slapper mansion at the original Second Fist Temple Lodge in Dallas.

1174
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:46,920
Right.

1175
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:55,780
And then led on that he wasn't just one of the 12 Davids of Philadelphia, but was in fact the Jesus Christ.

1176
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,320
Yeah.

1177
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:56,960
Born again.

1178
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,240
I remember that.

1179
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,280
And he learned this by smoking marijuana.

1180
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,740
He was smoking marijuana at a marijuana plantation in Hawaii where he lived.

1181
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,000
That's the marijuana?

1182
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,160
Oh, come on over here and sit down.

1183
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,360
I want to watch TV with counseling evidence.

1184
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,900
The Bible had informed him that he was Jesus.

1185
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,880
It would be interesting to find out how many...

1186
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,000
We would be his only spokesman.

1187
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,620
Yeah.

1188
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:18,640
We were the only ones that could see in such a way that could reveal this truth.

1189
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,980
He wasn't enlightened enough to instantly recognize this.

1190
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,200
Right.

1191
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,320
To reveal the truth.

1192
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,420
However, we didn't.

1193
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:24,960
The truth of Will Small.

1194
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,940
We didn't, but we did remember...

1195
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,980
Lord is real.

1196
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,280
Quite supremacist.

1197
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:39,080
...Sussex in Alabama, who like him had deciphered from the Bible that the true Jews were the Englishmen who came to America.

1198
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,300
That's true.

1199
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,440
So we sent him to meet them.

1200
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,140
He later went on to see if...

1201
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,640
He said they didn't want to be his spokesman.

1202
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,900
And he informed me that he'd gone to see Bhagwan Rajneesh, now known as Osho.

1203
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,540
And once again, he was...

1204
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,140
It was as if...

1205
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,040
It was as if it was a world of Judas's.

1206
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,920
For that particular Jesus.

1207
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,000
Bhagwan Rajneesh was a no-show.

1208
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,820
How many of my listeners tonight think you're Jesus?

1209
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,400
Stand up.

1210
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,540
I want to see you standing.

1211
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,180
Now, come on.

1212
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,120
Now, that's all way back in the...

1213
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,220
Philodramas stood up.

1214
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,460
We're watching TV.

1215
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,160
Yeah, and Queen of UFOs.

1216
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,240
There's nothing wrong...

1217
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,920
Everybody but Ivan Stank.

1218
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,100
I'm sorry.

1219
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,140
There's nothing wrong...

1220
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,800
We're all Jesus.

1221
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,680
...with thinking you're Jesus.

1222
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,520
The only thing bad is when you think you're the only Jesus.

1223
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,160
I'm not.

1224
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,820
Amen, brother.

1225
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,520
I'm not going to...

1226
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:28,940
Amen.

1227
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:35,240
I stand in a party of Jesus stretching back over six millennia.

1228
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,120
I can see...

1229
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,300
I just don't think that you're the only one.

1230
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,520
...from sea to shining Jesus.

1231
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,760
You're no more Jesus than I am.

1232
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,380
Jesus is a trick on subgeniuses.

1233
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,480
Or something like it.

1234
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,920
And we love tricks.

1235
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,860
We love Jesus.

1236
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,820
We love the tricks.

1237
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,780
We love it.

1238
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,280
We love all the great prophets.

1239
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,500
We love all the great prophets.

1240
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
And Edgar Cayce.

1241
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,100
Why?

1242
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:58,480
Why?

1243
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,660
I really liked Edgar Cayce because he was...

1244
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,940
It was hard to figure out.

1245
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,060
He could cook a fine cherry pie.

1246
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,000
Edgar Cayce could.

1247
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,600
It's good to have a guru or an enlightened being that can cook.

1248
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,200
That can really win your heart through your stomach.

1249
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,840
So I wonder who the new head of a tank car is.

1250
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,700
It's not Darwin Gross anymore.

1251
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,320
No, no.

1252
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,060
It's Darwin Gross.

1253
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,120
Darwin Gross.

1254
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,340
Darwin Gross has passed on to the higher level.

1255
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,740
Actually, I have a book at home that has that.

1256
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,940
Who the current one is.

1257
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:42,420
I bet that's something we can find out of our special way back Dr. Hal question machine.

1258
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,780
He just pulled that out of his pocket.

1259
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,320
Dr. Hal's not here.

1260
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,340
We have a machine he's left with us that has the contents of his brain.

1261
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,960
And we can search the contents of...

1262
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,160
Not a very big machine considering.

1263
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,660
Well, he's had his brain digitized.

1264
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:57,960
And so...

1265
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,020
We need a card for that.

1266
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,060
Let's see.

1267
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,060
A little more cut out of Dr. Hal, though.

1268
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,720
Let's see now.

1269
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,220
But the problem is...

1270
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,480
We do need a cardboard cover.

1271
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:05,820
Don't we?

1272
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,480
You do.

1273
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:06,820
You do.

1274
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,680
We really do.

1275
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,120
So he's at every show ever.

1276
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,400
Now, what were we going to ask Dr. Hal's brain?

1277
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,680
Unroll a big picture and have it dance around the stage?

1278
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,040
Yeah.

1279
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,740
And then play a tape of it.

1280
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,200
Oh, they do that all the time.

1281
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,000
What are Dr. Hal?

1282
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,440
What question was I going to ask you?

1283
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,620
What question was I going to ask?

1284
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,960
Which he would gladly do.

1285
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,360
I should do that.

1286
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,320
You know, just this...

1287
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,680
Hal does a rant for each show.

1288
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:30,940
Yeah.

1289
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,660
Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.

1290
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,040
Yeah.

1291
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,420
Well, have a picture of Hal and the tape recorder right behind the picture's mouth.

1292
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,940
And just hold it there for the, you know, 20-minute rant of Dr. Hal.

1293
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,940
And then have him do a rant for each show.

1294
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,760
All right.

1295
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,320
Okay, that's 20 bucks.

1296
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,180
So what was I going to search for?

1297
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,360
What was I going to search for?

1298
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,120
Come on, pay up.

1299
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,620
Did you forget already?

1300
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,780
Yeah, what is Wikipedia?

1301
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,440
I can't believe he forgot already.

1302
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:56,920
What?

1303
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,340
Now I've got to rewind the show.

1304
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,600
And figure out what it was we were going to search for.

1305
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,300
Unless you call us right now at 510-848-4425.

1306
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,660
It's 510.

1307
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,880
That's a long-distance call if you're outside the 510 area.

1308
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,080
But if you just dial 1, nobody will care.

1309
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,940
Your call will be charged to your phone, however it is, normally.

1310
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,340
We don't care.

1311
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,620
We don't take Skype calls.

1312
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,660
We just want your real call.

1313
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:27,140
You can prove to us of your participation as an active listener.

1314
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:32,960
By actually actuating the dial of the telephone or the buttons or whatever.

1315
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,840
You know, I don't encourage that on my show.

1316
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,660
On my show, I don't let anyone call in except once in cowboy day.

1317
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,860
Well, I know, but you're sort of, you have a style.

1318
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm sort of a fascist.

1319
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,900
We like our callers.

1320
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,800
We have callers call in and we immediately throw them in the caller pool.

1321
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,940
Which is like the deep end of the pool.

1322
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,120
And they have to survive there with the other callers.

1323
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,700
They splash in.

1324
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,820
They splash around.

1325
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,180
Some of them sink to the bottom.

1326
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,060
Some of them bob right to the top and they're like, they become regulars.

1327
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:12,000
But others just sort of fall to the bottom of the caller pool and they get their, they get stuck in the drain in the bottom.

1328
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,640
And it pulls them through and it's really nasty.

1329
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,740
I remember when Phineas Narco was just a caller.

1330
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,360
Yeah, look at him.

1331
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,060
Now he's a demigod.

1332
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,940
Yeah, we've called him and praised him.

1333
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,200
Repeatedly.

1334
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,860
I've done that.

1335
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,600
I don't know how many dozens of times.

1336
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,520
Countless dozens of times.

1337
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,040
Countless dozens.

1338
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,600
Of times.

1339
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,640
Dozens of times beyond.

1340
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,140
So many dozens of times.

1341
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,400
It's beyond counting.

1342
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,240
That's 12 times as many as an uncountable amount.

1343
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,520
Amount.

1344
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,520
Yeah.

1345
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:56,640
Yeah.

1346
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:03,560
We, uh, Princess, we and I found ourselves in the Twilight Zone recently as we kept passing the same hitchhiker.

1347
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,600
Oh, really?

1348
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,320
We were in a mournful old sad man who was just standing there with this.

1349
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,320
I remember that Twilight Zone episode.

1350
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:11,840
Oh, I.

1351
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,880
Starring, uh, England.

1352
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,220
We met like, Inger Stevens was passing him, uh, she kept passing him.

1353
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:20,980
Hey, would somebody.

1354
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,340
She stopped.

1355
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,340
Why don't you keep the sign?

1356
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,220
There's those callers.

1357
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,300
Okay, there are the callers.

1358
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:24,900
Hello.

1359
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,160
Go ahead, caller.

1360
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:26,800
You're on.

1361
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:27,260
Oh, yeah.

1362
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,880
Well, how'd I get driving by and New York winking at me?

1363
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,900
Wasn't quite gay.

1364
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,520
Dr. Howell's in New York winking at you?

1365
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,100
Aw, obscene.

1366
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,140
Sometimes.

1367
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:38,800
I'm on the same roadkill.

1368
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,320
I kept driving by the same roadkill.

1369
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,300
Yeah, I know.

1370
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,780
Keep driving by the same roadkill.

1371
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,980
Oh, yeah.

1372
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,420
Are, are you the large caller called the large?

1373
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,660
Yeah, I brought it over.

1374
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,740
I'm not a large.

1375
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,560
That's the large right there.

1376
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,740
Is that the large?

1377
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,280
Large, right there.

1378
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,500
So it's, the show's called the large?

1379
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:56,500


1380
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:56,500


1381
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:56,500


1382
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,760
The color's no longer large free?

1383
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:58,640
No.

1384
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,040
It looked like it was kill free.

1385
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:00,440
Hold on for the moment.

1386
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,640
It'll, these are the callers that have bobbed up to the top of the, of the collar well.

1387
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,560
It's the deep end of the pool, but we like to call it the collar well, because it's not

1388
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:11,920
very-

1389
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,480
It's an honor, really.

1390
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,260
It really is.

1391
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,480
They push on their little heads and they go down for a second.

1392
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:16,760
Watch.

1393
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,360
Some of them just float.

1394
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,820
They're like filled with air.

1395
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,920
They're filled with air completely.

1396
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,700
Like little, are you?

1397
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,200
Yeah, you can tell by the music.

1398
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:26,480
Are you?

1399
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:26,480


1400
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:26,480


1401
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,580
They're like, they're like the bladders of jellyfish.

1402
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:35,660
Some of them are bobbing on the surface, but their tendrils and other appendages hang way,

1403
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,040
way down into the-

1404
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,900
You'd like to interview the roadkill?

1405
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,240
Into the rest of the pool.

1406
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,360
Some of those are not, those, oh those aren't.

1407
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:49,700
They're so far down deep below that they sound, it sounds like a-

1408
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,300
Distended hemorrhoids or something there.

1409
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,340
They have glowing-

1410
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:56,980
Oh.

1411
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,840
Little organs that light up.

1412
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,360
Right.

1413
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,600
They're sort of so far down in the darkness that they attract the other collars that are

1414
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,560
already stuck on the bottom of the collar.

1415
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,520
Oh, that's what they are.

1416
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,380
Wait, there's more than one of them?

1417
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,820
They're stuck in the drains down there.

1418
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,160
Yeah.

1419
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,120
The drains are constantly pumping-

1420
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,280
Just drain out, clean it a little bit here.

1421
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,340
Pumping fresh fluids into the well.

1422
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,260
Now they're all gone.

1423
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
I need my fluid.

1424
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,960
Yeah, like a school of fish.

1425
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,360
And zebra mussels clogging up the-

1426
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,320
You need the fluid.

1427
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,320


1428
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,320


1429
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,320


1430
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,320


1431
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,320


1432
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,020
You need the fluids in there because that's what keeps everything moving and liquid.

1433
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:30,360
Yeah, yeah.

1434
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,400
Keeps everything free and clean.

1435
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,700
That reminds me of a troublesome moment I had earlier this evening, but let's not go

1436
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,220
into that.

1437
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,200
No, no, we have to.

1438
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:40,760
It's on the air now.

1439
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,760
And the music is playing.

1440
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,360
I know, whatever you say comes true in the air.

1441
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,840
There's another roadkill.

1442
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,920
Let me go get it for you.

1443
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,080
It's the same one, man.

1444
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:48,480
Don't touch it.

1445
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,100
You know, I was at the roadkill.

1446
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,600
Did you go through Seligman and go to the roadkill cafe?

1447
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,860
Why, yes, we did.

1448
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,300
We didn't go to the roadkill.

1449
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:56,300


1450
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:56,300


1451
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:56,300


1452
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,440
We didn't go to the roadkill cafe, but we photographed the living hell out of it.

1453
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,960
We stopped there and actually got ... We've stopped there twice now on our way back and

1454
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,240
forth to Texas.

1455
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,860
Look at Princess Wee's shirt.

1456
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,700
She's wearing the Seligman shirt.

1457
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:09,600
All right.

1458
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,720
Too many words.

1459
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,920
It's like all the words of Arizona.

1460
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:12,980
Route 66 shirt.

1461
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,600
Did you go through Oatman?

1462
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,680
No.

1463
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,520
Oatman's on Route 66.

1464
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,520
It's an interesting little town.

1465
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,920
We didn't not know ... Nothing told us to go to Seligman.

1466
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,280
We didn't know what the hell was going on.

1467
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,280


1468
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,280


1469
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,280


1470
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,280


1471
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,940
We were led there by the signpost up ahead.

1472
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:36,900
We just felt ... We pulled over to gas and the sign said, historic Route 66 Seligman.

1473
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,340
We thought, okay.

1474
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,680
Yeah, you should ... Let's check that out.

1475
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,600
Maybe on the way back.

1476
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,360
It's the kitchiest ... Unbelievable.

1477
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:47,120
I mean, we were in search of kitsch, of course.

1478
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,440
I stopped there once and had like a thousand motorcycles in that one little town.

1479
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,540
It was every square inch that was covered with motorcycles.

1480
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,840
And there were a lot of motorcycles.

1481
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,940
And Benny Dukes.

1482
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,800
And James Dean.

1483
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,860
They were having some kind of cross-country tour with motorcycles.

1484
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,480
Marilyn Monroe.

1485
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,660
Marilyn Monroe, yeah.

1486
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,360
It was like Motorcycle Day or something.

1487
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,440
I was on that planet.

1488
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,540
The Marilyn Monroe's and the Einsteins and there were some ... Like Frankensteins.

1489
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,840
Ride your tricycle.

1490
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,600
Or Frankensteins.

1491
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:14,940
Frankensteins.

1492
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,360
That was from ... Remember ...

1493
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,580
The Frankensteins.

1494
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,000
What's that British science fiction weekly series about the ...

1495
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,720
Dr. Howe.

1496
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,540
No.

1497
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,900
And the Phylosoraptors.

1498
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,520
That's the Friday Night Show.

1499
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:25,520


1500
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:25,520


1501
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:25,880
Friday Night Show.

1502
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:25,920


1503
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:25,920


1504
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,700
It's the Friday Night Series of Chick and John.

1505
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,520
They had the Phylosoraptors.

1506
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,280
And the Frankensteins.

1507
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,100
That was the scariest movie ever.

1508
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,280
Frankensteins, bad.

1509
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,160
Phylosoraptors.

1510
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,880
Razor sharp claws.

1511
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,060
Eviscerating.

1512
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,160
Gunmeat streets.

1513
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,200
Gunmeat streets.

1514
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:47,920
Bad apple place.

1515
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,060
I read on the news today ...

1516
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:50,760
It's the bad weather man.

1517
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,400
One-fingered dinosaur skeleton was discovered in China.

1518
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:55,520
The practice of ...

1519
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:55,520


1520
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:55,520


1521
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:55,520


1522
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:55,520


1523
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:55,520


1524
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:55,520


1525
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,340
I mean, not just that skeleton, but the dinosaur.

1526
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,160
It was a precursor to the Tyrannosaurus.

1527
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,500
I think that was the one.

1528
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,520
It had only one finger, the middle finger.

1529
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,280
Yeah, and it was a nose picker.

1530
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,920
It was the most insulting dinosaur.

1531
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,140
The nose picker X.

1532
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,760
He was a really hostile dinosaur.

1533
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,940
He only had one finger, and it was in a middle finger salute.

1534
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,300
Everything you want in a dinosaur is available in China anytime.

1535
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,760
He used to use it to pick the noses of dead dinosaurs.

1536
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,500
This is the weather for Booger Raptor.

1537
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,840
Booger Raptor, yeah.

1538
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,540
Booger Picker Raptor.

1539
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,780
Yeah, you're right, Weatherman.

1540
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,640
It had to go to Sewerage Street.

1541
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,640
All show down the trail.

1542
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,000
Down Sewage Street.

1543
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,140
Those poor old shows.

1544
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,980
They go to the old show home.

1545
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,100
You drop that butter.

1546
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:52,600
Poorly paid, irritated nurses change their pants and rewind their tapes.

1547
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,680
You think?

1548
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:03,560
I think about those bedpan people that, you know, when they were kids, they grew up, they told their mom what they wanted to be when they grew up and said, I want to clean bedpans when I grow up.

1549
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:03,840
Really?

1550
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,240
Yeah.

1551
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,460
I want to serve the people.

1552
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:17,680
And I think that's probably the most, the highest, the most sincere way of serving my fellow man is by changing their bedpans when they're in their state of infirmity.

1553
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:22,580
You know, frankly, when every now and then as a minister, I get somebody.

1554
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,080
I do that.

1555
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:23,080


1556
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:23,640
Going.

1557
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:24,360
Myself.

1558
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:31,400
Saying to me, begging me for advice because their life has gone to hell and they're so unhappy.

1559
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,920
And they go on and on and on and on and on about themselves and how awful everything is.

1560
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,780
And how awful it is for them.

1561
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,840
And what should they do?

1562
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,260
Yeah.

1563
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:45,460
And I always say, find somebody who's in a lot worse shape than you and serve them.

1564
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,640
You know, wipe and clean up after people who can't do that themselves.

1565
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,660
Go down to the local.

1566
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,060
Join me.

1567
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:59,320
And say, I want to volunteer for whatever your nastiest, most foul jobs are.

1568
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,200
And you know what those, those, those, uh, Bobby's don't do.

1569
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,880
They don't take me up on it.

1570
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,760
I don't know why, because it would make them feel better.

1571
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,500
Become a greeter at your local hospital.

1572
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,180
Or your local Walmart.

1573
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,280
A greeter.

1574
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:22,440
Or a, or a good by sayer at your, there's actually almost as many farewellers as there are greeters at hospitals.

1575
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:22,920
No.

1576
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:23,260
Go to the hospital.

1577
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:23,900
What was the name of that?

1578
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,940
What was the name of that Walmart-like thing and idiocracy?

1579
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,100
I love.

1580
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,220
Welcome to Costco.

1581
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:30,840
I love you.

1582
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,340
Welcome to Costco.

1583
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,220
I love you.

1584
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,740
Welcome to Costco.

1585
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,620
I love you.

1586
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,100
Welcome to Costco.

1587
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,000
I love you.

1588
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,360
You should have somebody next to you like that.

1589
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,760
Standing in the road, way out there on the gate.

1590
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,860
Welcome to Costco.

1591
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,500
I love you.

1592
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,780
Welcome to Costco.

1593
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,640
And you'd find 12 people that want to do it.

1594
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,300
And you could get a lot.

1595
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,180
Or welcome to Burning Man.

1596
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:52,380
Burning Man.

1597
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:52,920
You'll have like a.

1598
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,820
They have, that's what I mean.

1599
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,580
Like an army of them standing there burning.

1600
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,040
It's already happening, yeah.

1601
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,440
Welcome to Burning Man.

1602
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:56,640
Welcome to Burning Man.

1603
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,120
I love you.

1604
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,900
They're called the pagan festivals.

1605
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,060
They really did that.

1606
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,660
Burning Man is the institution.

1607
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:02,760
What's that?

1608
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:03,900
Rainbow Bridge.

1609
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,780
So each group has its own group.

1610
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,600
Yeah, right.

1611
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:05,860
Whatever.

1612
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,140
It's like, welcome home.

1613
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,020
Yeah.

1614
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:08,940
Welcome home, brother.

1615
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,060
Sister, I love you.

1616
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:10,800
I'm glad you're back.

1617
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,320
Do you have a quarter?

1618
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,580
We've been waiting for you.

1619
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,760
I love you.

1620
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,440
Give me a quarter.

1621
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,920
I'm glad you're back.

1622
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,300
Can I have a quarter?

1623
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,040
Only now it's $25.

1624
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,320
I've been waiting for you.

1625
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,540
If you don't get the quarter.

1626
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,400
I'll use this giant shock machine.

1627
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:25,900
Oh.

1628
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:26,660
Oh.

1629
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,160
Oh.

1630
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:27,540
Chief.

1631
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,840
Give me a quarter.

1632
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,280
Man, that's an old E-meter.

1633
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:30,760
Ouch.

1634
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,380
Ow.

1635
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,340
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1636
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,720
He's got an E-meter.

1637
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,840
You know, Reverend Stang, we learned a lot from old.

1638
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,540
I have to power it up.

1639
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,320
How did you do that?

1640
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,500
Prince of the Indians, Chief.

1641
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,480
Give me a quarter.

1642
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:42,460
Remember?

1643
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,720
Yeah, we learned how to talk about him.

1644
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,000
He was Prince of a tribe.

1645
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,900
Of a special tribe.

1646
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,780
Well, we don't know that he.

1647
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,520
We really don't know that he was an Indian.

1648
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,100
And you're right.

1649
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,280
That part is probably.

1650
00:51:54,780 --> 00:52:01,640
That's probably over the top in terms of horrible, horrible things for us to say on the show.

1651
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,320
But it was a gimme quarter.

1652
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,560
Well, there's a whole gimmick.

1653
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,140
He did say gimme quarter.

1654
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,440
Every, every store we drive by.

1655
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,600
We're going to cleanse the airways here.

1656
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,120
That's a nice politically correct TV show.

1657
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:12,680
Let's watch TV.

1658
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:13,760
Yeah.

1659
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,640
Wiggly, wiggly.

1660
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:15,240
So cool.

1661
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,260
Chief Family Dollar.

1662
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:16,920
Yeah.

1663
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,840
I mean, did you notice all the variations on dollar coming across the country?

1664
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,200
Only when we were doing it.

1665
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,320
There was no such thing as a dollar store.

1666
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,240
It was called a five and dime.

1667
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:26,800
Yeah.

1668
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,960
And they had Woolworths was still around.

1669
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,320
You could buy things for a dime.

1670
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,900
Remember you had Woolworths and TG and Y.

1671
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,660
Remember TG and Y?

1672
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,380
Yeah.

1673
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,120
And they had like a good walk in these rows of trays of army men.

1674
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,760
You could buy for like a hundred for a dollar.

1675
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:50,020
You can still buy 50 army men for a dollar, but they're about quarter the size.

1676
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,660
They used to.

1677
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:50,920
Oh.

1678
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,180
But they still smell good.

1679
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:52,440
They're not as good.

1680
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:52,440


1681
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:52,460
They're all the same.

1682
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,240
They're not as firm.

1683
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,260
And they don't look as good.

1684
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,140
They're like all blotchy and blurry and blobby like now.

1685
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,400
It's nearly as articulate and perfectly refined.

1686
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,860
The thing I like about that movie Toy Story, which I've seen about seven times in the last

1687
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:12,240
month, is the little army men and the way they walk attached to their base.

1688
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:12,640
Yeah.

1689
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,780
That's the way army men really walk.

1690
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,140
Attached to a plastic base at their feet.

1691
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,160
It's a little awkward, but you know, you didn't, it's a little awkward.

1692
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:22,160


1693
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:22,160


1694
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,580
It was when I was a kid with my army men, it was more about setting them up into the

1695
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:31,840
vignette, the diorama and getting everything all perfect than it was actually walking them

1696
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,240
around.

1697
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:32,660
You know?

1698
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:32,820
Yeah.

1699
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,160
My brother and I, we'd get this, we'd make a neat thing.

1700
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,420
And that was like all our army men, all our dinosaurs.

1701
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,360
All set up.

1702
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,360
All our little robots.

1703
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,720
And then when we got it all set up, it was like we retired and didn't want to play with

1704
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:44,820
it.

1705
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,240
Yeah.

1706
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,980
You get it all set up and then it's, that's it.

1707
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,000
You know, you're through.

1708
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,140
But you feel stupid going, okay, my army man's fighting my robot.

1709
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:52,140


1710
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:52,140


1711
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:52,140


1712
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:52,140


1713
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,940
They're going to kill him.

1714
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,720
They're making cities.

1715
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,780
And then we have big arguments about where stuff would go.

1716
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,420
My best friend and I would fight over like where the outdoor theater went and where the

1717
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:03,160
garage went.

1718
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:03,560
Oh yeah.

1719
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:03,960
No.

1720
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:04,840
Oh, you play Sims?

1721
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,420
No.

1722
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,260
No Sims, but in the dirt with little.

1723
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,700
No, the theater goes here.

1724
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,320
A bag of plastic airplanes.

1725
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,400
That's not even a theater.

1726
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,980
That's just a cracker box.

1727
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,920
A bag of plastic cars for a buck.

1728
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,140
So we brought our thing together, man.

1729
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,620
That's not a Quonset hut.

1730
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,140
That's a sawed in half bottle.

1731
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,120
Like where the Quonset huts would go was like a cracker box.

1732
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,120


1733
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,120


1734
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,120


1735
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,120


1736
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,120


1737
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,500
That's really important.

1738
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:25,660
I played Tonka truck Sims.

1739
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,480
They were Sims.

1740
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:28,940
It was an advanced game.

1741
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:29,900
But they were like physical Sims.

1742
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,480
Simulation of a truck, but it was digitized down to about a foot long.

1743
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,160
But they were physical.

1744
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,400
And they were made of metal, actual metal.

1745
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,640
And you can, they were sturdy, man.

1746
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,220
You can crash those things in.

1747
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,140
Those were physitized.

1748
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:45,200
If you watch Ivan Stanforsley, you can see the pleasure saucers behind you.

1749
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,520
There's that, before digitizing, they were physitized.

1750
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,740
They've been burning and sanitizing the road behind you guys.

1751
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,060
They actually existed in physical Sims.

1752
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:52,100
I mean, you could, you could, you could.

1753
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:52,100


1754
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:52,100


1755
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:52,100


1756
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:52,100


1757
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:52,100


1758
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:52,580
That was a physical thing.

1759
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:52,580


1760
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,760
It's a strange thing.

1761
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,040
Don't let a trace of them exist.

1762
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,940
To actually be able to touch something that's real.

1763
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,200
That was so criminal.

1764
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,880
The UFO guys in over there just burning the road.

1765
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,140
It was a strange experience.

1766
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:06,600
It's very strange experience to actually interact with your character without using a mouse.

1767
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,720
The cartoon cross country trip.

1768
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,900
Or some type of a digital interface.

1769
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,580
When you get home, you got to do it.

1770
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,920
The 3D was cut out for people.

1771
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,680
You actually had to touch your character with your hands.

1772
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,340
With your physical hands.

1773
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,460
And put that on YouTube.

1774
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,900
To make them move.

1775
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,080
It was not only 3D, but you could.

1776
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:22,840
On YouTube?

1777
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,740
Feel it.

1778
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:27,040
I don't know if many of the listeners understand what that word.

1779
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:27,860
Feel.

1780
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,420
Meals.

1781
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,100
You actually.

1782
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,100
Is it on YouTube?

1783
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,320
You could touch it with the tactile senses.

1784
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,580
But it wasn't a keyboard.

1785
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,160
No.

1786
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,020
And it wasn't a game controller.

1787
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:37,500
No.

1788
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,040
But it was.

1789
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,580
You could actually feel it with your hands.

1790
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Very strange.

1791
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,000
Very strange sensation.

1792
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,680
Compared to today's electronic feedback mechanisms.

1793
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,220
And you know, you're with your.

1794
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:51,980
Speech.

1795
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,060
You know, you're with your.

1796
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:52,060


1797
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:52,060


1798
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:52,060


1799
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:52,060


1800
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:52,060


1801
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,000
Kids these days.

1802
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,940
They got it so damn good.

1803
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,320
My kids sit in a.

1804
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,680
They sit on my lawn.

1805
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,940
Playing their damn video games.

1806
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,680
Now they're not even video games.

1807
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,440
What they're doing is they're invading your.

1808
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:05,500
Cloud, man.

1809
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:05,520
Your space.

1810
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,240
With their special tools.

1811
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,760
The Rolling Stones saw it coming.

1812
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,600
They saw how we'll be storing every media in the future.

1813
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,760
And they sang it.

1814
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,880
They said, get off my cloud, man.

1815
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:16,480
Oh, yeah.

1816
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:16,960
The cloud.

1817
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,980
Yeah, I'm going to entrust all of my.

1818
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,100
See, that's old guy.

1819
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,900
That's the dividing line between us.

1820
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,020
That's the dividing line between us.

1821
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:22,060
And they're saying it.

1822
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:22,060


1823
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:22,060


1824
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:22,060


1825
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:22,060


1826
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,900
Between us and them now.

1827
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,080
Because them.

1828
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,320
They trust the cloud.

1829
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:27,700
They have gone with the cloud.

1830
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,740
The cloud means that old guys like.

1831
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,120
No, no.

1832
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,640
I have to have seven physical copies in seven different cities or it doesn't exist.

1833
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:45,940
I remember that when we when we couldn't start talking before we had at least two tape

1834
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,500
decks running.

1835
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,240
No matter what happens in every single life.

1836
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,100
Hey, shut up.

1837
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,020
Shut up.

1838
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:51,900
You might say something.

1839
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:52,060
I'm not.

1840
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1841
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1842
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1843
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1844
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1845
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1846
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1847
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1848
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1849
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1850
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1851
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1852
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1853
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1854
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1855
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,940
We don't have the tape.

1856
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,460
We are the guy at the end of the table.

1857
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,880
And there's a young guy with a tape recorder.

1858
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,920
And you say, I knew Bob Dobbs for what he was.

1859
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,660
I knew him.

1860
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,920
He didn't say it exactly like that.

1861
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,220
No, it's an adaptation for a screenplay for an abstract.

1862
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:08,420
Huh?

1863
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,940
For a TV show.

1864
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:10,720
I knew Bob Dobbs.

1865
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,440
For a parrot that said it.

1866
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:12,520
I knew Bob Dobbs.

1867
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,660
For what he was.

1868
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,040
Three hundred years later, there was a parrot that kept repeating.

1869
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,420
He's a hell of a man.

1870
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,820
I don't know what it is.

1871
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,340
He's got that.

1872
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,060
I just know it happened.

1873
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,060


1874
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,060


1875
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,060


1876
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,060


1877
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,060


1878
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,280
Here we are a million years later.

1879
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,260
We think we made this up, but it came out of history.

1880
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,280
Sophistication.

1881
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,460
Yeah.

1882
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,340
You don't hear any words, do you?

1883
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:33,860
No.

1884
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,640
That's the, uh, yeah.

1885
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,080
I didn't.

1886
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,440
Good.

1887
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:35,740
Okay.

1888
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:36,860
Yeah.

1889
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,540
That's totally, totally subliminal.

1890
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:41,260
Subliminal.

1891
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:41,800
Yeah.

1892
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,320
There's no.

1893
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,600
Now this is the part where the show is very subtle.

1894
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,360
Okay.

1895
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,560
This is where we ask for the callers to stimulate us.

1896
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,740
Check out this show.

1897
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,260
We call the callers.

1898
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,040
They call the callers.

1899
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:52,420
We call the callers ourselves.

1900
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:58,680
Now we actually dial 5 1 0 8 4 8 4 4 2 5 and we call ourselves.

1901
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:05,980
Oh, incidentally, I want to do a shout out to my mother-in-law and her friend, Ruth,

1902
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:12,680
who really both wanted to stay up and listen to the show, but it was a little bit late.

1903
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,700
Are they going to try?

1904
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:18,400
I told him, I said, Hey, look, you can tune in during lunch tomorrow.

1905
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:18,980
You can.

1906
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,860
It'll be on.

1907
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:20,960
Right.

1908
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:22,400
I'll put it on the archives.

1909
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:22,880
Better be.

1910
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:23,800
Sure.

1911
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:24,840
This is.

1912
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:31,600
I'm about out of reruns on our Slack and I need something to put on.

1913
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,160
We've got a lot of reruns for our Slack.

1914
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:39,300
You can start running those early.

1915
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:46,240
One rerun I ran was the first hour of the five hour subgenius executive retreat.

1916
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:46,740
Oh yeah.

1917
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,180
Yeah.

1918
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,060
It was an over the edge show.

1919
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:49,580
Yes.

1920
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,300
Over the edge show.

1921
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:51,620
Yes.

1922
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:58,640
And we were had all gathered for the subgenius executive retreat at sulfur springs or sulfur

1923
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,160
palms.

1924
00:58:59,500 --> 00:58:59,900
Yeah.

1925
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,720
Sulfur palms.

1926
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,300
That was it.

1927
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:06,780
And I kept saying Don Joyce's name instead of his character name.

1928
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:07,340
Yeah.

1929
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:07,760
Morpheus.

1930
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,740
He likes to be called Morpheus when he's off the show.

1931
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,580
I think then it was, I was, you know, for years I always talk about how I hate the guy

1932
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,520
that came on before me, you know, just to work this thing.

1933
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,220
And then a few years ago I asked Don, do you ever listen to the show?

1934
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,480
And, and hear what I say?

1935
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,060
I go, no, I don't have FM in the car.

1936
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,400
So he missed many years lambasting.

1937
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,040
Yeah.

1938
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,520
Horrible, stupid show.

1939
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,700
Almost wasted, almost wasted words.

1940
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,360
The one guy you wanted to get the joke.

1941
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,280
Well, that's what I hear.

1942
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:41,380
When it, when princess, we, and I drive home from WCSB, we hear Dr. Sinister talking about

1943
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,480
how crappy our show was.

1944
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:42,860
Yeah.

1945
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,340
He does that a lot.

1946
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,020
I hear that a lot.

1947
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:45,820
And what show is it?

1948
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,480
Ivan's Dang.

1949
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,840
It's the hour of Slack.

1950
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,200
The voice of the show.

1951
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:51,200


1952
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:51,200


1953
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:51,200


1954
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:51,200


1955
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:51,200


1956
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:51,200


1957
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:51,200


1958
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,200
The church of the subgenius.
