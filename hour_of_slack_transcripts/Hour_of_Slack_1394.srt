00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,000
The Subgenius Power of Slack!

2
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,620
Slack!

3
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:40,560
The program you are about to hear, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, is parody, satire, and comedy.

4
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:51,340
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius, religion, politics, or any other touchy subjects is intended only as humor,

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,920
and should cast no reflection on the high standards of the staff or that of Georgia Tech.

6
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,960
The Subgenius Power of Slack!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,260
Reverend Susan the Flusen.

8
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,180
Yeah.

9
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,840
Princess We Are Doe.

10
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,700
Oh, yeah.

11
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,540
Nate, the selfless engineer.

12
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,480
The head of J.R. Bob Dobbs is here with us.

13
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,100
I don't expect listeners to believe that, but we'll post the pictures later.

14
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,880
And rarity of rarities, we are live here in the studios of WREK Atlanta.

15
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,720
It's so exciting.

16
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,360
For this special edition of The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour!

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,540
The Hour of Slack!

18
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,820
With special guest star, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

19
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,400
And Bob's Discord.

20
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,880
Plus, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse with special guest star, The Hour of Slack.

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,900
Now, if only we had Lonesome Cowboy Dave's head here instead of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

22
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,240
Yeah.

23
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,060
It would be chattering away nonsensically.

24
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,880
Or what would appear to be nonsense.

25
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,600
Don't you have any canned Dave you can just spill out?

26
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,560
We ate all the canned Dave, huh?

27
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,200
Oh, man.

28
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,380
You know how Popeye always has that can of spinach that he pries open with his pipe?

29
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:35,840
Yeah.

30
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,300
We have a can of Dave.

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,200
That's why we bring the Dobbs head, the head of J.R. Bob Dobbs along.

32
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,760
We use his pipe as a kind of a canned Dave can opener.

33
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,900
Is that why you were slurping up there in the backseat of the car?

34
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,620
It used to be you could just give him cheap hemp and that would open him up.

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,960
But that doesn't work anymore.

36
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,320
And they get after you for that.

37
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,580
Oh.

38
00:02:59,620 --> 00:02:59,800
So.

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:02:59,980
Oh.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,080
So.

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,640
Yes.

42
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,740
We have to remember that we're on the air.

43
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,240
That's sometimes difficult for people of our years.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,240
Air?

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,420
Yeah.

46
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:12,860
Yeah.

47
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,540
That means don't use your usual language.

48
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,340
Don't talk like that.

49
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,020
I could use some air right now.

50
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,900
I'm surprised I'm not on oxygen.

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,300
I'm so damned old.

52
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,840
Must reach oxygen.

53
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,080
Take.

54
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,380
This is the arthritis hotline.

55
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,980
Must reach oxygen.

56
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:29,980


57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,100
Switch.

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,520
The terrible rotten smell of burning flesh.

59
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
No, that's just.

60
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,220
Recording everything going fine.

61
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,660
No problem.

62
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,280
Okay.

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,900
We got all the old stuff out of the way.

64
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,720
Those are the old stuff.

65
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,280
Oh, wait.

66
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,020
Repent.

67
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,740
Quit your job.

68
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,420
Slack off.

69
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:45,880
Okay.

70
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,280
Oh, whoa.

71
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,380
Are we still?

72
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,940
Oh, these shows get longer each time.

73
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,240
Yeah.

74
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,640
Or my attention span is changing or something.

75
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,600
In fact, that's not the only thing that needs changing.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,260
I forgot my deep pens.

77
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,480
Tell us, Reverend Stang, about your unique mission.

78
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,600
Or is it an emission?

79
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,400
Yeah, that's an old one.

80
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,480
That was Brother Cleve Duncan.

81
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,980
He was Bob's chosen emissionary.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,280
Well, you're certainly emissionating through the southeast right now.

83
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,260
Yeah, we're not in any position to criticize that.

84
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,840
No.

85
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,340
Not missionary.

86
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:24,820
No.

87
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,840
But Princess, we are indeed on a soul-saving tour.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,240
We're saving our own souls from having to shovel snow in the driveway in Cleveland,

89
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,020
Ohio for the rest of the winter.

90
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,280
So we've flown south.

91
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,780
South.

92
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,320
We have no winter here.

93
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,040
To South Hell.

94
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,220
We have abolished it.

95
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,820
That's where we're going ultimately.

96
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,380
Stang Ranch in Texas.

97
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,740
South Hell.

98
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,520
Where all the Stangs get together to excesslessness-mas.

99
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,160
And don't give each other presents.

100
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,600
We have this new tradition.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,600
And you still go?

102
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,800
Yeah, we don't give each other presents.

103
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,140
We just sit around and stare at each other.

104
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,460
And take care of the infants, you know.

105
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,480
There's all these little...

106
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,580
There are many litters of little Stangs out in the goat pen.

107
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,380
Well, all the trees are festooned with natural mistletoe.

108
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,460
So what do you expect?

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,180
What, a Stang Ranch?

110
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:19,700
Yes.

111
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,900
They're festooned with rattlesnakes, thorns.

112
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,720
I mean, it's all prickly pears.

113
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,620
It's true.

114
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,860
It's an obstacle course.

115
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,740
And someday we'll move this subgenius.

116
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,480
And there's X-Day celebrations there.

117
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,280
When we've toughened them up in southern Ohio.

118
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,020
We'll take them to where there's real hurricanes.

119
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:38,960
You thought we...

120
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,820
I mean, tornadoes.

121
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,500
You think those tornadoes we had the last X-Day were fun.

122
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,580
I liked it.

123
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,260
Well, yeah, we had...

124
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,140
I had fun fighting the elements.

125
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,260
Yes.

126
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:49,720
We'll meet you.

127
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,660
We set up Tarzan's radio station on picnic tables at this campground.

128
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,340
Really?

129
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:56,880
Yes.

130
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:57,660
It's...

131
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,300
They have...

132
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,660
It's sort of indoors.

133
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,100
It's in kind of a cafe.

134
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,880
Sort of indoors.

135
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,360
Yeah.

136
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,120
And...

137
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,980
It's open air on one side.

138
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,160
It's a form of indoors.

139
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes.

140
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,040
And we have many fans.

141
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,640
And we need those fans because it's so hot.

142
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,020
And there's also people there, but they're kind of torpid and half asleep.

143
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,780
Well, we happened to be camping in a federal disaster area during a heat wave.

144
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,180
And it was just sort of situationally challenging.

145
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,260
Well, I'm...

146
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:29,880
Challenging.

147
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,860
Strangely enough...

148
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,360
Brutal.

149
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,540
Brutal.

150
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:31,660
Yes.

151
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,640
The subgeniuses were the only people for about 200 miles around who had electricity.

152
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,440
We really had it made.

153
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

154
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,400
It was like a real X-Day.

155
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,560
The people who didn't buy subgenius memberships...

156
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,980
That's not a call to action, by the way.

157
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,860
It's just a what if.

158
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:55,100
They were doomed to sit around in Columbus and Cincinnati sweltering with no internet.

159
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,280
We had ice and electricity and we had...

160
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,900
Well...

161
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,240
Hell, we had...

162
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,240


163
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,240


164
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,600
We had so much electricity, lightning struck the place.

165
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,580
Holy...

166
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,000
It still didn't shut down.

167
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,600
It really did.

168
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:15,580
We got a nice recording of a bolt of lightning hitting about 100 feet away from all the mics and everything.

169
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,520
And it didn't destroy anyone.

170
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,260
Anybody important.

171
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,620
Sure.

172
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:27,680
A few camp employees that had never really gotten fully ordained.

173
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,960
But...

174
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,820
But I don't want to talk about the old glories and miseries.

175
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,760
I want to talk about something that blesses my heart.

176
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,820
And that's the love of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

177
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,680
He has none for you, my friend.

178
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,360
You don't have to worry about old Bob worrying about you.

179
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,220
You don't...

180
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:56,360
You know, with some of these other gods and personal saviors, you know, you have to feel guilty when you lean on them.

181
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,560
You pray to them and everything.

182
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,640
And then later go, why?

183
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,040
Why am I pestering?

184
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,560
Didn't Jesus have it hard enough?

185
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,260
Didn't poor Muhammad have it hard enough?

186
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,900
Why am I leaning on him?

187
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,960
Well, you don't have to worry about that with Bob because he's not going to listen to your prayers.

188
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,080
And you really don't want him to.

189
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,980
You don't want...

190
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:19,180
Because you don't know who else might overhear your prayers and know what your deepest fears are.

191
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,540
Especially you don't want Bob to know that because he'll exploit them.

192
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,620
He'll put a unique interpretation.

193
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,660
Yeah.

194
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,620
It'll be for...

195
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,940
It'll be all for the best.

196
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,600
It'll be all for the best for Bob.

197
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,580
The Dob Spin.

198
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,240
Yeah.

199
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,640
But most of us have given up on ourselves.

200
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,720
We're just entirely devoted to his pleasure and happiness.

201
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,340
It's not that he needs our help.

202
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,140
It's kind of like one of those amusement park rides.

203
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,760
It's a whirling disc and you're on it in your butt and you just get tossed in any direction.

204
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,160
Yeah.

205
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,740
That's dope.

206
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,840
Yeah, but then you get right back in line and do it again.

207
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,580
Get into that pink smelling seat.

208
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,200
Because it feels so good when it stops.

209
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,220
That's right.

210
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,520
I can't do those anymore myself.

211
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,780
That background music is so Bernard Herrmann-like.

212
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,560
I think it's some guy named Herman Bernard.

213
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,460
He did the music for all my favorite movies when I was a kid.

214
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,760
We wanted to have that in the background.

215
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,020
It's religious music.

216
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,400
I didn't think Porn Loops had a soundtrack.

217
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,500
No, there's a monster movie.

218
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,720
That's better than porn.

219
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:27,920
That's better than porn.

220
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,160
That was my porn.

221
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:36,040
You know, I used to tell people, after going through many different beliefs and faiths,

222
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,340
I was searching for the truth for so long.

223
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,340
I finally returned to my childhood religion, which is monsters.

224
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,920
That's what it really boils down to.

225
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,840
I think that's what draws many subgeniuses to Bob.

226
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,180
Because even though he looks like a grinning, vapid, leading man,

227
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,620
we know that he's real.

228
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,800
He's really the monster in this movie.

229
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,800
But this time, it's a monster that's going to win.

230
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,420
It's one of those cool monster movies where just when you think the humans won,

231
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,840
the very last thing before the titles indicates,

232
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,100
oh no, that monster's not dead yet.

233
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,360
No, sir.

234
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,880
And there will be a sequel.

235
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,820
The monster always wins in my book.

236
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,720
I don't know, man.

237
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,880
On the way home from a bad movie,

238
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,120
I'll figure out how to bring the monster back.

239
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,460
Well, in a way, you're right.

240
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,800
Every one of those early Frankenstein movies,

241
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,100
Frankenstein's monster was killed dead.

242
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,980
The thing that could not die was killed dead at the end.

243
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,540
And yet, somehow, they'd always manage to scrape him back up.

244
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,360
Same with Godzilla.

245
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,620
Think how many times Godzilla...

246
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,660
I saw Godzilla lose every bit of flesh off his bones.

247
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,220
How many times did they pull the stake out of the dust and there's Dracula again?

248
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,840
Yeah.

249
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,960
Somebody drools or cuts themselves.

250
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,720
A little drop of blood falls in that dust and there's Dracula.

251
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,340
Well, same with Bob.

252
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,580
You know, just when you think the pipe's gone out...

253
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,440
Somebody's going to drop money.

254
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,540
Lightning strikes right in the center of that pipe and lights it up again.

255
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,900
I told you about how Bob was an abortion survivor

256
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,100
and it took a tornado to even abort him in the first place.

257
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,540
And then once Mrs. Dobbs, the sainted Jane Dobbs,

258
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,720
saw that six-week-old fetus...

259
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,720
That mewling chunk of protoplasm.

260
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,680
Yeah, she loved him.

261
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,260
Yeah.

262
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,160
All things, all beings that gaze upon Bob,

263
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,120
even when he's pretty gross-looking.

264
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,000
He was basically looking like a hawker.

265
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,180
Yeah, yeah.

266
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Like a mewling lunger with little eyes that haven't quite opened.

267
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,300
But, you know...

268
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:43,960
Three of them.

269
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,240
Well, the third one never fully opened.

270
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,360
I guess that was the pipe.

271
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,540
Well, you know, that's the funny thing.

272
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,940
He had a little vestigial, like an umbilical cord pipe.

273
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,800
That was a twisted little thing.

274
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,420
And it survived, too.

275
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,100
Mm-hmm.

276
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,080
Gradually straightened out and lengthened.

277
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,260
Became what we know as the pipe now.

278
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,740
Yeah, yeah.

279
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,020
I'm sure all the listeners know all about what we're discussing

280
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,340
because they've been listening.

281
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,440
Like so many say,

282
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,880
Wow, our Slack?

283
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,740
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse?

284
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,040
I used to listen to that back in elementary school.

285
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,860
These are 40-year-olds saying that.

286
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,540
That's my cutest.

287
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:26,980
They say,

288
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,380
It's still on.

289
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,200
And you can always tell who doesn't really listen.

290
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:34,880
It's funny now.

291
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,480
You can tell which ones don't really listen when they say,

292
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,400
Yeah, that's right.

293
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,420
Yeah, we changed.

294
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,240
Now it's funny.

295
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,480
Actually, it's just the opposite.

296
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,600
This show has dozens of listeners.

297
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,520
Right.

298
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,120
Oh, I know.

299
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,020
I've seen up to...

300
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,360
The low two dozens.

301
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,040
We can see at WCSB Cleveland.

302
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,480
Technically, that's plural.

303
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,020
We can see...

304
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,360
How many people are listening on the internet feed?

305
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,400
I've seen as many as 25.

306
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,340
Now, luckily, that's as many as it'll hold.

307
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,540
So there could be more people trying to listen.

308
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,640
And I like to think there's maybe a quarter of a million going,

309
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,960
Gee, the stream is blocked.

310
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,820
I can't hear it.

311
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,400
They try every week for years and years.

312
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,860
But you can download these things, of course, friends.

313
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,820
You go to Subgenius.

314
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,200
com.

315
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,160
You can find out where to download every single episode of Reverend Susie the Fleezy's show.

316
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,740
All her co-host shows.

317
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,260
Well, the good ones, anyway.

318
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,780
And the Limpnode Institute.

319
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,420
And all the...

320
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,260
Literally, hours of slack going back to about 1987.

321
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,160
That's fabulous.

322
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,460
No.

323
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,080
What a fabulous thing.

324
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,460
In 1989.

325
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,380
You can have those and listen to them anytime you want.

326
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,440
The real old ones...

327
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,280
Believe it or not, the old ones are pretty good.

328
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:54,560
Yeah.

329
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,600
Nothing like what you're listening to now.

330
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,660
Really lively.

331
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,440
You began radio, didn't you?

332
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,840
No, but I'll tell you what.

333
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,580
If you go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,

334
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,880
which is not something I would recommend most subgeniuses do,

335
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,160
there is one interesting part.

336
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,040
And that's the Hall of Technology.

337
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,920
And it's not a very long hall.

338
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,980
It's about as long as this...

339
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,560
Wait, did I just say that?

340
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,520
It's a long hall to the short hall called the Hall of Technology.

341
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,400
And the sad thing is, it's about...

342
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,020
Say the hall is 30 feet long.

343
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,520
Within the first five feet, right after the Edison wire recorders,

344
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,200
you start seeing recording equipment that you and me owned as we were young.

345
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,140
You know, the little four-inch reel-to-reel things.

346
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,420
Yeah.

347
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,420
And it ends with the iPod.

348
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,400
Of course, it starts with these recording decks as big as a Volkswagen.

349
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,500
And it ends...

350
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,200
It ends with the little teeny iPod.

351
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,640
I take technology backwards wherever I can.

352
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,660
If I have something to record off of the Internet, I record it on tape.

353
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,320
And I take it into the studio.

354
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,960
And put it on another computer.

355
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,120
You're old.

356
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,240
You don't have any tattoos or piercings either.

357
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,420
You are old, man.

358
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,120
I don't have any identifying markings when we live in a police state.

359
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,580
Oh, how stupid of me.

360
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,400
You're not going to be able to Xerox my ass and send it around.

361
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,080
On the wire.

362
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,480
See, there's another old reference.

363
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,760
On the wire.

364
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,500
On the wire.

365
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:28,980
Uh-huh.

366
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,680
Yeah.

367
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,080
Yeah, that was a TV show or something, wasn't it?

368
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,540
The Wire.

369
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,260
Yeah.

370
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,360
I watched television.

371
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,560
That's all it means to most people.

372
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:47,220
Did you hear the paper recordings or cardboard before the wire recorder?

373
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,980
Before the soft wax recorder.

374
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,580
The candle recorder.

375
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:51,840
The cable recorder.

376
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,600
In 1860.

377
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,380
1860 or 1870 something.

378
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:04,280
Made a recording device that, I guess, put indentations in paper.

379
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,040
So it wasn't a very powerful recording device.

380
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,920
And no, the paper survived.

381
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,680
I think that was a doily.

382
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,560
It wasn't a record.

383
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,300
No playback machine.

384
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,080
No, this was for real.

385
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,900
It's a disposable doily.

386
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,340
It's ruined my needle.

387
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,300
Some smart computer people got the paper.

388
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,920
There was no real playback.

389
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,220
And they were able to scan the indentations on the paper and translate that into a sound signal.

390
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,060
And it was a crappy recording of somebody singing some piece of classical music.

391
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,960
Oh, and a recording of laughing.

392
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,680
Laughing was an early popular subject of recording.

393
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,920
Nate is nodding as if to give weight to your raving.

394
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,680
Did you hear any of this?

395
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,480
I haven't heard that story, but that's pretty interesting.

396
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,280
Yeah.

397
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,640
It was just a couple of months ago.

398
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,000
It was going around the web.

399
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,400
Oh, so it's true.

400
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,080
And it sounds so plausible.

401
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,740
Oh, yeah, it has to be true.

402
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,540
If it was on the internet, golly, they wouldn't put something.

403
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,640
They wouldn't put a misfactual thing on there.

404
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,660
They can't put it.

405
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,340
They've got laws.

406
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,740
That's right, yeah.

407
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,820
Just like newspapers.

408
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,820
Mm-hmm.

409
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,620
Uh-huh, yeah.

410
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,780
Seventh Voyage of Sinbad in the background there, isn't it?

411
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:23,700
Yeah.

412
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,080
Yeah.

413
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,920
Did you see the first six movies?

414
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:26,980
What?

415
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,300
Oh, no!

416
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:35,820
The first Voyage of Sinbad, where he only fights mice and a really bad dog.

417
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:42,280
The second Voyage of Sinbad, he fights a rabid wild boar.

418
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,220
I think Identity Theft is the third one.

419
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,240
By the fourth or fifth one, he's...

420
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,760
Yeah.

421
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,360
Fourth one is VD.

422
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,300
Fourth one is VD.

423
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,580
No, it's VD.

424
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,300
He's fighting venereal disease.

425
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:52,620
Oh, yeah.

426
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:52,620


427
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,500
And the fifth one, he fights...

428
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:53,500


429
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:53,500


430
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:53,500


431
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:53,500


432
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,220
He fights an elephant and a yeti.

433
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:04,740
And by the seventh Voyage of Sinbad, of course, it's cyclopses and dragons and tiny miniature princesses flying off of trapped birds.

434
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,600
And then the eighth Voyage is bill collectors.

435
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,980
Yeah, they censored...

436
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:14,020
The conspiracy censored the eighth because he fights the conspiracy and wins.

437
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,880
But in that one, Torrin Thatcher played Sinbad and Kerwin Matthews had moved on to...

438
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,400
Whoa.

439
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,260
...to Jack the Giant Killer.

440
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,700
And we all know about Voyage number nine.

441
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,940
Which they're remaking, by the way.

442
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,920
Number nine.

443
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,420
It was in the Crimson Pirate, which is one of my favorite Burt Lancaster movies.

444
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,580
Torrin Thatcher.

445
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,260
They're...

446
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,980
You know, they're doing a remake of Jack the Giant Killer.

447
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,020
Did you know that?

448
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,620
Blink.

449
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,680
Yeah, she blinked a bunch of times.

450
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:52,280
Most of you don't remember the Jack the Giant Killer movie from the 60s.

451
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,180
But it was...

452
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,720
It was okay until they decided to remake it into a musical.

453
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:06,300
And they redubbed the normally spoken dialogue to make it sound like everyone was singing the dialogue.

454
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:06,840
And they stored music...

455
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,220
I must have missed this.

456
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm drawing a blank.

457
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,640
It's unbelievably clumsy.

458
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,260
I was probably smart as a little kid and managed to miss that crap.

459
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:22,500
You know, I mean, you take a movie that is just people talking and then overdubbing it with the same dialogue.

460
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,160
But there's...

461
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,660
They're singing that dialogue.

462
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,020
And there's music that's forced into it.

463
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:37,360
There's a song that goes with the climactic fight where Jack is on this dragon's back.

464
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,160
It's really the magician's turned into an evil dragon.

465
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,740
And he's plunging a sword into the monster's neck.

466
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,420
And there's this jolly, jolly, jolly fighting the monster music.

467
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,720
Oh, the leprechaun is singing.

468
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,940
You may...

469
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,380
How did we get on this?

470
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,580
Shouldn't we be playing something interesting?

471
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,960
Or worse?

472
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,040
I've got that horrible album.

473
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
Horrible?

474
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,300
That horrible album.

475
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:02,980
Which one?

476
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,600
The psychedelic youth album?

477
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,240
The Ken Nordean only not funny?

478
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,780
Captain Entropy?

479
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,000
Teaching kids the laws of thermodynamics through creative play?

480
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,780
Oh, that was the Timothy Sagan.

481
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:28,760
I was calling him Timothy Sagan because he's trying to be Carl Sagan for acid heads, obviously.

482
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,820
They call it a children's record.

483
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,840
But it sounds more like Tim Leary's horrible Tibetan Book of the Dead record.

484
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,840
Susie just ran off.

485
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,140
She does that.

486
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,820
It's a thing.

487
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,140
That was fast.

488
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,520
I think she was trying to do some assistance of record album sourcing.

489
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,460
I do believe she's on her cell phone.

490
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,740
Oh.

491
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,200
What's a cell phone?

492
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,520
Oh, that's those new things that the kids use.

493
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah.

494
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,260
Huh.

495
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,400
Here, let me go look at that stack of records real quick.

496
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,020
All right.

497
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,000
There's some really, really bizarre stuff.

498
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,240
Oh, yeah, here it is.

499
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,760
Worlds of Youth.

500
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,360
Worlds of Youth. That's the one.

501
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,780
This is what we're going to be...

502
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,680
Right. Yeah. The Captain Entropy.

503
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,460
The Captain Entropy was okay.

504
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,020
He has a great song.

505
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:28,780
Yeah.

506
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,500
No, that's not a song.

507
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,200
That's the trippy Timothy Sagan.

508
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,140
Worlds of Youth.

509
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,940
This recording recreates nine of the 25 word worlds presented in the book Worlds of Youth.

510
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,340
Perspective paper, rank number three.

511
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,760
With the added dimension of modern rhythm and dramatic dialogue, each of the nine speaks of vital Christian message.

512
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,520
To the new young generation that wants to be seen and heard.

513
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,700
On this record you'll hear new sounds.

514
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,740
Drums!

515
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,300
The rhythms of pop, rock, and jazz.

516
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:10,920
In crisp counterpoint, two voices engage in rapid fire dialogue around common everyday phrases like...

517
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,940
The kite and the news.

518
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,640
The boy looking natural.

519
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,140
The nasty picture.

520
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,760
Come to war and...

521
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,740
March on.

522
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


523
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,120
The martyrs.

524
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,160
Martyrs is one we probably ought to play.

525
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,080
Martyrs. He didn't even have time to scream.

526
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,260
This album is not entertainment.

527
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,000
And yet it is, friends.

528
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,620
You'll see.

529
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,120
It explodes nine worlds of young adults into sights and sounds of fact and faith.

530
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,020
It moves.

531
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,940
It fuses faith to the beat and the rhythm.

532
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,620
The issues and the drama of century 20...

533
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,500
And a half.

534
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,800
So this is after 1950.

535
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,880
It is more than high-fi wizardry.

536
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,980
It can be heard once or a hundred times.

537
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,000
It is hard to forget.

538
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,040
It reminds the hearer of where every man has been and will go.

539
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,520
Too bad about the women.

540
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,340
In each band you hear everything about life and new life.

541
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,880
So those are two different things.

542
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,960
Life and new life.

543
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,900
It makes man, man.

544
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,960
Past and future meet the present.

545
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,760
It has new sounds.

546
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,760
It opens doors.

547
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,060
It does not judge.

548
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,440
It's just like Bob.

549
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,080
It has new sounds and horrible smells that go with them.

550
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,460
It opens bathroom doors.

551
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,260
Dave.

552
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,480
It does not judge because it does not care.

553
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,260
It is sound that creates sight.

554
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,280
It's like that radio synesthesia.

555
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,620
New imaginations.

556
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,520
Each of these indirect conversations.

557
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,600
Is an individual contemporary parable.

558
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,780
They are happenings.

559
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,420
Designed to have God happen to you.

560
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,760
And you know what else happens, friends.

561
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,580
Besides God.

562
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,940
Today in your fears, your failures, your fun, your friends.

563
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,740
Those all go together.

564
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,000
Failures, fear, fun, friends.

565
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,780
Their telling is meant to produce a completely free unfettered response.

566
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,540
A fresh experience of what it means to be a free human being.

567
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:22,720
Who is free.

568
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,160
Who is more than the sum of his parts.

569
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,420
Now this is obviously.

570
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,200
Oh, why are there ravering trucks?

571
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,440
This is obviously written before women were allowed to read.

572
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,180
They call all of your life.

573
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,760
From reading the paper, going to school and driving your car.

574
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,320
To copping out on a friend.

575
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,240
Into brilliant perspective for self discovery.

576
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,400
We ought to play the martyrs.

577
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,580
Wouldn't that be the best one?

578
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,360
Yes.

579
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,580
That's the fourth cut on side two.

580
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:52,720
That's the fourth cut on side two.

581
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:59,800
And this is made by Herbert Broeckring and John Rydgren.

582
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:09,140
The selection of this record must be played individually due to special locked groove construction between bands.

583
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,860
Final DRM?

584
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,700
Yeah, this is actually.

585
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,880
It's like Ken Nordean if he wasn't funny.

586
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,720
And there's like a little pause to the end.

587
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:22,720


588
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,360
And a tag where there was probably something where you would put in the church P.O. box say.

589
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,000
Okay, well we'll be ready for that.

590
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,420
And this album Worlds of Youth is available from.

591
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,360
Insert website URL here.

592
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,080
Subgenius.com

593
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,280
He wasn't perfect.

594
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,180
But he was a martyr.

595
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,260
An honest to goodness martyr.

596
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,460
An honest to goodness martyr.

597
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,460
At last we know it.

598
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,580
At last we know it.

599
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,660
Now we're sure.

600
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,480
The mill sure got him quick.

601
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,520
The big wheels got him.

602
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,880
Not a minute's notice.

603
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,580
Not a minute's notice.

604
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,060
It sure can turn against a guy.

605
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,480
It sure can turn against a guy.

606
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,700
A guy who cared for every inch of it with his sweat.

607
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:22,700


608
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,140
And blood.

609
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,580
And blood.

610
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,360
He greased it three times a day.

611
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,580
Checked every moving part.

612
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,620
He even built it.

613
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,780
He even built it.

614
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,380
Checked every moving part like a gone specialist.

615
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:38,980
Checked every moving part like a gone specialist.

616
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,420
A pediatrician.

617
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,840
A parent.

618
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,400
He treated it like a baby.

619
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,240
And when he wasn't looking for one second.

620
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,260


621
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,320
It clobbered him.

622
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,700
He didn't even have to.

623
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,640
It was time to scream or say ouch.

624
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,320
It was time to scream or say ouch.

625
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,220
All the cogs and wheels he greased and fit.

626
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,360


627
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,240
They kept right on going.

628
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:03,620
They kept right on going.

629
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,460
It wouldn't stop.

630
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,480
Until he stopped them.

631
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,680
With his own body.

632
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,960
And then everything in the mill stopped.

633
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:13,540
And then everything in the mill stopped.

634
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,600
And lots of things outside the mill stopped.

635
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,960
Like the bowling he was planning for.

636
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,040


637
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,620
And the trip next summer.

638
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,680
And the election next year.

639
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,020
And the election next year.

640
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,560
He was good in politics.

641
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,960
He was good for people.

642
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,800
And the promotion.

643
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,580
It stopped.

644
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,640
And the meal tonight.

645
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,580
And the book tonight.

646
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,760
And the bed tonight.

647
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,900
Everything stopped.

648
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,620
Outside the mill.

649
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,820
Everything stopped inside the mill.

650
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,200
And they had to untangle it all.

651
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,160
And they had to untangle it all.

652
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,560
And check over the mill.

653
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,260
And the wheels.

654
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,180
And every moving part.

655
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,980
And start the mill all over.

656
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,840
And start everything all over.

657
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,400
Inside the mill.

658
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,100
And outside the mill.

659
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,080
The mill wasn't damaged much.

660
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,160
The mill wasn't damaged much.

661
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,300
I took his shoes home.

662
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,400
I took his shoes home.

663
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,560
And all the other things.

664
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,180
His shoes weren't damaged at all.

665
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,760
His shoes weren't damaged at all.

666
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,740
The holes in the bottom.

667
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,420
He put those in himself.

668
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:25,820
Building.

669
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,360
And greasing the mill.

670
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,640
And getting it ready to run.

671
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,080
And running it to make paper.

672
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,340
Paper for envelopes.

673
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,040
And letterheads.

674
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,200
Paper for 73 letters to a girl.

675
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,640
And 319 more after the wedding.

676
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,840
To four children.

677
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,940
And 13 grandchildren.

678
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,640
He used plenty of barrels of grease.

679
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,460
In 32 years at the plant.

680
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,500
He made a lot of paper at the mill.

681
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,140
He made a lot of paper at the mill.

682
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,840
Expensive paper.

683
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,640
He made this paper.

684
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,920
It's expensive paper.

685
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,260
It's expensive paper.

686
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,260


687
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,800
Martyr Paper.

688
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,240
Man can lay down his life for a brother.

689
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,580
Man can lay down his life for a brother.

690
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,780
Or a sister.

691
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,260
Anywhere.

692
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,800
Wherever there is absolute risk.

693
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,000
Wherever there is absolute risk.

694
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,880
There is the call to be a martyr.

695
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,140
Not all martyrs stand in pulpits.

696
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,000
Not all martyrs stand in pulpits.

697
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,100
Or rest in mission fields.

698
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,400
Some lie under heavy machinery.

699
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,460
Some lie under heavy machinery.

700
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,920
Some stand in paper mills.

701
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:43,980
Some stand in paper mills.

702
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,900
And grease pits.

703
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,320
And behind counters.

704
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,640
And behind counters.

705
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,640
History is not sure of the exact spot of the crucifixion.

706
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,060
History is not sure of the exact spot of the crucifixion.

707
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,080
Good.

708
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,360
For even the paper mill could be the place for a sacrifice.

709
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:57,900
For even the paper mill could be the place for a sacrifice.

710
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,020
Or the bowling alley.

711
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,620
Or the supper table.

712
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,620
Treat reverently and sincerely

713
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:04,880
Treat reverently and sincerely

714
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,380
all things and places.

715
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,780
Someone may have laid down his life for it.

716
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:11,920
Someone may have laid down his life for it.

717
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,480
You may be next.

718
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,480
Life is to be spent.

719
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,060
Life is to be spent.

720
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,680
Life is to be spent.

721
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,960
AHH.

722
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,620
Now this is where the magic happens again.

723
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,900
Now this is where the magic happens again.

724
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,460
Ah, the magic.

725
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,580
Oh, Stange.

726
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,220
Huff, Stange has an unfortunate addiction problem going on.

727
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,660
Don't distract me.

728
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,460
I've almost got that small hermit or show.

729
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,900
I wouldn't call it sad.

730
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,720
I'd call it more like tragic.

731
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,160
Yeah.

732
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,020
Everybody plays video games.

733
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,380
Unless you're really old.

734
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,160
I'm the oldest video game player.

735
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,980
I just started, though.

736
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,680
I never did it before this year.

737
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,320
What Mike Nesmith says about video games.

738
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,620
Video games are this generation's rock and roll.

739
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,780
All the kids get it and all the adults don't.

740
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,680
That's right, man.

741
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,500
Yeah.

742
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,320
You're taking away my slack, man.

743
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,420
Let me do my thing.

744
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,040
Man.

745
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,700
Man.

746
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,580
Yeah.

747
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,080
I've busted ass on this video game.

748
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,100
I've worked like a dog.

749
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:38,920
I've logged like 76 hours just on this game since we started on our trip.

750
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,760
Prince is right.

751
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,280
On previous long cross-country trips, I made us talk.

752
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,160
I wouldn't let Princess We play her Jonathan Colton albums over and over and over and over and over again.

753
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,740
I would read to her from the AAA books about what towns we were.

754
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,680
It was trying to be, you know, have interaction.

755
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,240
But we've discovered a better new way.

756
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,860
Our environment.

757
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,660
Where for four hours as we drive, she'll listen.

758
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:17,300
We'll listen to the same Jonathan Colton album, singing along with it over and over again.

759
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,380
And I will slay the same monster in Monster Hunter Freedom 2.

760
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,220
Is it where tradition meets tomorrow?

761
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,880
That one?

762
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,220
Over and over again.

763
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,620
It was Artificial Heart.

764
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,640
Ah, the new one.

765
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:28,960
Yes.

766
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,180
Yeah.

767
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,460
We saw Jonathan Colton three nights ago in Charlotte, North Carolina.

768
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,640
He was here Wednesday.

769
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,420
Oh.

770
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:35,820
Yeah.

771
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,780
How many monsters did he kill?

772
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,640
Oh, he's a wuss.

773
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,240
He didn't know anything.

774
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,480
Actually, he did.

775
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,180
He did sing several, at least three songs about video games.

776
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,080
Yes.

777
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,760
He's got theme songs to video games.

778
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,260
Yeah, right.

779
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,300
He's also worked.

780
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,060
There's some games that open and close with his song.

781
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,940
Code Monkey is the most famous one.

782
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,660
It is.

783
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,160
And he was real friendly.

784
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:09,500
After the show, he came out and I dashed up before anybody else and handed him a subgenius membership pack and said,

785
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,260
that was a great show.

786
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,580
And here's a present from Church.

787
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,400
It's a subgenius to which he said, I'm I don't know what to say.

788
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,160
I'm speechless.

789
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,320
And I thought he probably says that to everybody hands in the present.

790
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,920
And it's a great response.

791
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,220
I thought he said, I don't know where to start.

792
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,480
Yeah, I don't know where to start.

793
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,260
And it was.

794
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,240
It's like he doesn't know what it is.

795
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,540
You know, so he's literally telling the truth.

796
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,680
And he's in it.

797
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,140
And it kind of butters up the idiotic fan and gets rid of him at the same time.

798
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,300
I'd later.

799
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,360
I'd later came up to him to make sure he didn't take it too lightly.

800
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,640
I said, sir, that little black folder there is worth almost thirty five dollars.

801
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,560
Yes.

802
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:10,200
So in the course of driving cross country, Princess, we you could probably win any argument about who's been doing the most driving by just looking at the logs on Stang's little PlayStation portable there.

803
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,300
I don't drive at all.

804
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:11,740
Oh, you don't.

805
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,020
Yeah.

806
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,200
Yeah.

807
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:12,260
Yeah.

808
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,260


809
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,260


810
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,460
Yeah.

811
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,280
The brains of the outfit drives well.

812
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,000
I can drive perfectly well.

813
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:22,060
It's just that I'm better at navigating and she's better at not hitting things with the car.

814
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,280
He nagivates.

815
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:23,720
Yeah.

816
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,420
That's exactly right.

817
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,700
I'm the backseat driver.

818
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,120
Said.

819
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,360
I very much am a backseat driver.

820
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,300
I know everything that she should do differently.

821
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,440
And I explain.

822
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,720
Well, thank goodness you're there.

823
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,200
Yeah.

824
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:37,740
Yeah.

825
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,040
Does he have a brake pedal on his side?

826
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,160
Yes.

827
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,160
Well, except that.

828
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,760
but I'm not really paying any attention now.

829
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,900
I'm in my own little world.

830
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,780
I'm in a better world where I'm rich,

831
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,780
where I'm a strong, tall, handsome...

832
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,820
Well, actually, Stangor, too, is rather scarred up.

833
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,360
Ceaselessly energetic.

834
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,660
Well, yeah.

835
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,540
This guy can run up mountainsides without...

836
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,120
Well, he has to stop and have...

837
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,160
He doesn't have paws?

838
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,040
He does eat,

839
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,720
but he doesn't have to go to the bathroom ever.

840
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:09,940
Ever.

841
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,220
Ever.

842
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,940
I've been...

843
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:18,500
I've actually been playing Stang in a total of about 450 hours.

844
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,560
This is the reason why there's so much violence in video games.

845
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,960
That's why Stangor's so mean.

846
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,100
There is no extra meditation in them.

847
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,560
Right, they can't...

848
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,540
They're building up a bear pack in a mean load.

849
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,420
He's like a crock again.

850
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:28,980
My good heavens.

851
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,840
That's what makes him so ferocious.

852
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,700
Is that the two-headed tiger?

853
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,260
Yeah.

854
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,140
Schnappy.

855
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,860
So, right.

856
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:52,160
I have tried not to inflict my latest short-duration personal savior on the audience too much.

857
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,120
But I guess that has ended tonight.

858
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,640
Well, how will we know what to believe if you don't tell us?

859
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,140
That's what you're here for.

860
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,860
Tell us what to think, do, and say.

861
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,900
That's right.

862
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,920
No, no, that's the job of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

863
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,560
I'm just his clerk.

864
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:07,820
Well, you'll do.

865
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,920
I can tell you where to send...

866
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,620
I can send the money to know what to say, see, and do.

867
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:18,740
Speaking of Bob, what liquid is oozing from the corner of his severed head's mouth?

868
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,720
What sort of stain is going on?

869
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,620
That's ichor, right?

870
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,940
Foul ichor, I believe.

871
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,420
Yes.

872
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,340
Ichor is magical blood.

873
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,120
I see.

874
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,120
The blood of dragons and things like that.

875
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,980
I thought it was just like spuzz or something.

876
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,360
Yeah, I think he probably just...

877
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,820
He sneezed and didn't think about Kleenex.

878
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,940
I thought maybe it was like a black Dahlia scar or something.

879
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,120
Yeah.

880
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,200
Well, he needs...

881
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,660
He's missing his body.

882
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,360
Yes.

883
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,880
He kind of looks like the chopped off android head in the first Alien movie.

884
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:52,980
Oh, yes.

885
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,380
Yeah.

886
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,880
He's kind of got milky stuff leaking out and he's all twisted and lopsided.

887
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,080
It's situated properly to be a black Dahlia scar.

888
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,740
But he won't relinquish the pipe.

889
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,960
You can see the photographs of this on subgenius.com.

890
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,920
By the time everyone outside of it finds out, it's gone.

891
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:09,920


892
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,140
Atlanta hears this weeks from now.

893
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,960
So I'm going to have to chop this up and put it on CDs.

894
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,920
I'll do all that in the car.

895
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,620
In between bouts of fighting monsters in the game.

896
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,360
Do what you have to do, man.

897
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,320
Last year we did...

898
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,280
I tried to produce hours of slack in the car.

899
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,300
It doesn't really work.

900
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:39,400
The most you can do is chop up shows of Susan the Flusen or puzzling evidence shows and such.

901
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,060
And duplicate reruns.

902
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,360
Look at the leisurely life of a serial killer.

903
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,360
Yeah.

904
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,880
How do you know where to chop Susie's shows?

905
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,280
They're pretty dense.

906
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,180
So Susie.

907
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,180
At the hour.

908
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,580
But when they're after they've been on for an hour, then that's the end.

909
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,720
It doesn't matter.

910
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,040
About 59 minutes and 45 seconds.

911
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
I'd leave...

912
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,720
You notice I generously leave the stations 15 seconds for their PSAs and stuff.

913
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,900
That's real cursory.

914
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,420
That's so kind and thoughtful.

915
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,920
Oh, he's all kinds.

916
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,200
That's real sub of you.

917
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,660
That's what you were going to say, wasn't it?

918
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,620
That's real subgenius of you.

919
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,920
How are they going to develop the blipverts if we don't press them for time?

920
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:22,700
Right.

921
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,300
Yeah.

922
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,360
An hour is long.

923
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,980
I got a lot to pack into an hour.

924
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,300
It's not big enough.

925
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:36,020
I wind up jacking stuff up to where it's over before I know what went on.

926
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,360
I like it that way.

927
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,560
You know, it's all good.

928
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,660
Thank God it's over.

929
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,120
We've only got 20 more minutes for this section.

930
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,600
I can't wait for it all to be over.

931
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,960
Hey, look.

932
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,800
How many...

933
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:57,540
For me, this would be weekly show number 1,896.

934
00:38:59,420 --> 00:38:59,980
800.

935
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,360
1,300.

936
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,400
That's right.

937
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,420
Did I say 800?

938
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,540
1,396.

939
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,560
That was an instant 500 shows.

940
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,600
Well, three is...

941
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,520
10 years?

942
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,180
He added another 10 years to it.

943
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,160
Padding.

944
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,880
What's 10 years at this point?

945
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,760
Well, actually, 10 years for me, big difference between 59 and 69.

946
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,220
I think the primary warehouse is around here somewhere.

947
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,060
Don't give me a line like that.

948
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,200
Yeah.

949
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,140
That is a kind of...

950
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,080
59, 69.

951
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,780
There's a joke in there somewhere.

952
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,840
A crude, juvenile, silly joke.

953
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,780
Involves beef and broccoli, I'm sure.

954
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,640
That's it.

955
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,920
That's the key.

956
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,280
Well, isn't there something we should be putting on that's professionally produced?

957
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,760
I have a penois.

958
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,320
Interesting.

959
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,000
A benois.

960
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,540
Can we all watch while you put it on?

961
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,960
Yeah, a penois with a benois by Renoir.

962
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,740
Wasn't penois the sidekick gerbil on Danger Mouse?

963
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:09,900
I'll put it on in the pieceois.

964
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:09,900


965
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:09,900


966
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:09,900


967
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:09,900


968
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:09,900


969
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:09,900


970
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:09,900


971
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,520
of what?

972
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,540
We could hear another chunk from us.

973
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,620
Oh, well.

974
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,560
Do you remember the cartoon Danger Mouse?

975
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,700
The British made cartoon called Danger Mouse.

976
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,360
No.

977
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,140
I remember references to it.

978
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,880
He had a sidekick named Penfold.

979
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,880
I was...

980
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:27,720
Yes.

981
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,880
He was a mole.

982
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,540
That was after my time.

983
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,440
Oh, well.

984
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,540
Did he get it?

985
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,180
It's all after my time now.

986
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,540
So old.

987
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,240
So old.

988
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,540
I think we should play

989
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,500
Captain Entropy.

990
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,500
Yeah, play Captain Entropy

991
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,480
and I'll pull the coffin lid

992
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
shut on myself.

993
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,360
Go ahead

994
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,680
and explode the tomb.

995
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,600
Spin the entropy.

996
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,100
Cave in the entrance to the tomb.

997
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,060
Keep the servants in here with me.

998
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,120
Sit here at my Frankenstein way piano.

999
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,160
Roll away the stone.

1000
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:06,920
Yes.

1001
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,480
As Dr. Paul Bearer used to say

1002
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,160
as he said at his Frankenstein way piano.

1003
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,300
Wow, you should be a horror host.

1004
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,480
Well, he was a horror host from Tampa

1005
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,400
and he used to close every creature feature

1006
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,920
with Poisoning Pigeons in the Park by Tom Lehrer.

1007
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,520
He would lip sync it as he was behind his Frankenstein way.

1008
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,480
Yes.

1009
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:31,940
Wow.

1010
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,160
That sounds really lame.

1011
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:34,800
It was.

1012
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,460
Yeah.

1013
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,180
Yeah.

1014
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:37,520
Yeah.

1015
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,180
Fort Worth, our horror host was,

1016
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,260
he called himself Gorgon,

1017
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,800
but you could kind of tell he was also Icky Twerp,

1018
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,220
the children's show host.

1019
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,560
He was featured in that horror show,

1020
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,760
horror show host documentary, American Scary.

1021
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,180
I remember seeing that.

1022
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,380
I'm afraid to watch that.

1023
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,320
Yeah.

1024
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,960
There are many subgeniuses now,

1025
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,540
still,

1026
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,600
still being active horror,

1027
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,740
TV horror hosts.

1028
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,040
One of the few areas of gainful employment for us weirdos.

1029
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,400
Yeah, that's about all there is left for us.

1030
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:23,920
I've got my application in at the local Fox outlet.

1031
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,780
Aging Goulardies.

1032
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,120
Oh, God, man.

1033
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,920
There's so many Goulardie ripoffs.

1034
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,800
It's sickening.

1035
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,180
I say, I'm not even a native Clevelander

1036
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,160
and I'm disgusted of all the so-called sons of Goulardies.

1037
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,040
I'm disgusted of all the Goulardios.

1038
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,660
Oh, wait, Reverend Angry Larry is doing a direct Goulardie takeoff.

1039
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,180
Is he really?

1040
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:43,720
Is he?

1041
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,340
Yeah.

1042
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,060
I didn't know that.

1043
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,560
The Dead Dave show is grounded

1044
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,380
and he's switched to doing a horror host thing,

1045
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,180
only he doesn't actually introduce any,

1046
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,660
he never gets around to the movie.

1047
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,520
It's just the horror host all the way through.

1048
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,220
That's pretty.

1049
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,420
Looks like you skipped the crappy movie.

1050
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:04,840
Yeah.

1051
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,000
Kind of a horror neighbor.

1052
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,780
Okay, were we going to play Captain Entropy

1053
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,060
since everything is so bad and falling apart?

1054
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,640
The center does not hold.

1055
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,800
Things fall apart.

1056
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,980
So won't we listen to this?

1057
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,120
Teaching kids thermodynamics through creative play.

1058
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,140
All right.

1059
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,760
I'm going to tell you some things about the spaceship you live on.

1060
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,980
Call Earth.

1061
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,080
And about some of its passengers.

1062
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,140
First, I'd like you to meet the captain.

1063
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,380
Gather round, sailors, and listen to me.

1064
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,720
And I'll tell you about Captain Entropy.

1065
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,100
Entropy.

1066
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,160
Entropy.

1067
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,780
Entropy is something that happens.

1068
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,320
It's so important.

1069
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,020
It functions something like a captain.

1070
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,140
Captain Entropy commands the earth and sky and sea.

1071
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,340
Moving, flowing, strong and free.

1072
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,060
Partly you and I.

1073
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:38,620
Partly me.

1074
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,320
Children all know Entropy.

1075
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,420
Because kids are full of energy.

1076
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,500
They give their energy where there is little or none.

1077
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,240
And work begins.

1078
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,920
And work gets done.

1079
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,940
But here's what I mean.

1080
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,020
Do this right now.

1081
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,800
Take any object from a table or a shelf

1082
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,680
and slowly place it.

1083
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,840
On to the floor.

1084
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,140
Go ahead now.

1085
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,580
Good.

1086
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,880
Feel the pull of gravity on your body and on the object.

1087
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,760
Pretend to fight gravity.

1088
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,940
Pretend the object is very heavy.

1089
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,260
But you are strong and you can handle it.

1090
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,120
Now lie down on the floor beside the object.

1091
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,160


1092
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,160


1093
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,160


1094
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,160


1095
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,140
And try to shape your body to resemble its contours

1096
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:49,820
to released by the physical nature.

1097
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:49,820


1098
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:49,820


1099
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:49,820


1100
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:49,820


1101
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,860
Can you do that again.

1102
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,920
Don't move on to a consciousness cup.

1103
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:57,920


1104
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,280
I wanna have one.

1105
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:58,280


1106
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,040
All right.

1107
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,040


1108
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,040


1109
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:06,840
What is that?

1110
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:06,880
Time away.

1111
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:06,880


1112
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,040
Pick up the object and lift it slowly.

1113
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,920
That's right.

1114
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,660
Fight gravity with all your might.

1115
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,380
And return the object to the exact place you took it from.

1116
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,200
Like a movie running in reverse.

1117
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:33,780
You have just flowed through your hands and you have caused an object to rise.

1118
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:40,400
Even though gravity wanted it to return to the floor.

1119
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,020
By now you can feel that entropy involves a flow of energy.

1120
00:46:50,680 --> 00:47:00,960
When entropy is around, energy flows from a point where it is more concentrated to a place where it is less concentrated.

1121
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,760
People call it a flow of energy.

1122
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,140
The existence of entropy.

1123
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,860
The laws of thermodynamics.

1124
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,340
Now I want you all to get up off the floor.

1125
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,360
And half of you stand over here.

1126
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,560
And I want the other half of you to stand over here.

1127
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,980
Form two groups.

1128
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,000
One in front of each speaker.

1129
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,360
Now we're going to demonstrate.

1130
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,100
What people mean.

1131
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,940
By entropy.

1132
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,400
Hey you over here.

1133
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,440
You're a coffee pot.

1134
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,320
You're a bubbling.

1135
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,640
You're boiling hot.

1136
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,980
Move your body as the coffee boils.

1137
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,360
And twist and steam as it flies and coils.

1138
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,740
Now you over here.

1139
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,560
You're a lump of ice.

1140
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,340
You're stiff and cold but kind of nice.

1141
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:11,860
Move your body in a firm position because of the condition of your frozen condition.

1142
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,320
That's right now ice lump.

1143
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,240
You slide over to the coffee pot.

1144
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:23,200
In coffee pot you boil your way over to the ice lump.

1145
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,560
Nice and slow.

1146
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,900
And both of you connect and do just what comes naturally.

1147
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,740
The coffee in the pot stops boiling and stands in the ice.

1148
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:33,740


1149
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:33,740


1150
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:33,740


1151
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:33,740


1152
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:33,740


1153
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:33,920
And still.

1154
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,460
And the ice lump changes shape and melts on the floor.

1155
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,660
Cold energy flowed from the cold ice lump into the coffee pot.

1156
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,880
Which could jump.

1157
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:59,860
Energy flowed from the coffee pot and changed the ice to warm or hot.

1158
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,260
This natural flow of energy.

1159
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,540
Which balances things for you and me.

1160
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,740
Commands the earth and sky and sea.

1161
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,720
And it is led by Captain Entropy.

1162
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,720
Yeah, yeah.

1163
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,120
The path of entropy leads everywhere.

1164
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:27,960
Because energy seems to keep on evening itself out.

1165
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,720
You work or play all day.

1166
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,540
And your energy runs down.

1167
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,840
And you eat food.

1168
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,720
And energy from that food flows into you.

1169
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:46,460
Well, what if someday entropy's command becomes so great that everything stops?

1170
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:54,420
What if energy distributes itself so well that everything is equal everywhere?

1171
00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:00,480
Would this mean that spaceship earth would stop?

1172
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,920
Or maybe land somewhere?

1173
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,600
Well, here's the answer.

1174
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,080
If you love to love.

1175
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,340
And if you love to move and be.

1176
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,200
You may decide to go on to something else.

1177
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:25,000
You might just rest your body and use the power of your mind to think and dream and imagine and fly.

1178
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,160
Maybe if all physical things came to a standstill.

1179
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,320
Maybe your thoughts and dreams would still go on forever.

1180
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,080
To other ships and other universes.

1181
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,480
Until the very entropy of your mind came home again.

1182
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,500
And again.

1183
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,440
And again.

1184
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:29,160


1185
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,060
And again.

1186
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:40,480
Ginogar laughs as she takes a smell from you and me and gives it to a galaxy that waits for Captain Androgyne.

Honestly

1213
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,520
This is a scam

1214
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,980
That reminds me of that

1215
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,000
Man bait and switch

1216
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,720
Like Ian played us a recording

1217
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,220
Of a woman calling a talk show

1218
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,460
Complaining about the deer crossing

1219
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,440
Signs that they shouldn't

1220
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,200
Put them at busy intersections

1221
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,780
Or busy highways

1222
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,100
They should move them to school crossing

1223
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,540
Because then the deer wouldn't be crossing

1224
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,240
In such high traffic areas

1225
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:01,800
Areas

1226
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,320
It didn't sink in

1227
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,120
Are you familiar with the comedian Greg Proops?

1228
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:08,800
No

1229
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,880
He tells the story of him and another

1230
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,940
One of his co-workers on the show

1231
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,160
Whose Line Is It Anyway

1232
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,820
Doing a corporate gig in Hawaii

1233
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,400
And he's

1234
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,080
From his hotel room

1235
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,520
They've had some sort of trendy chemical amusement aid

1236
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,440
And they're looking outside at a nature preserve

1237
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,880
And there's a sign that says

1238
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,360
Don't molest the tortoises

1239
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,440
It's like a turtle preserve

1240
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,060
And sure enough there are turtles around the base of the sign

1241
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,180
And Greg turns

1242
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:31,900
To Colin and says

1243
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,700
How do they know to stand under the sign?

1244
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,900
Well they can see the pig

1245
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,860
I think you know

1246
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,360
Like with the deer

1247
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,280
Of course they can't read

1248
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,460
Only an ignorant person would think a deer or a turtle could read

1249
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,660
But they can tell the picture

1250
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,860
Sure there's a picture of the deer

1251
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,420
Of course the animal

1252
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,420
It's shorthand so you don't have to speak the deer language

There is no more money

1283
00:58:59,660 --> 00:58:59,980
For a tire

1284

You listened to this show

And we're even more glad

1297
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,260
That some listeners

1298
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,380
Have donated enough

1299
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,680
To help us keep on going

1300
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,180
For another couple of months

1301
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,980
And not just this show

1302
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,680
But subgenius.com

But if you truly love Bob

1306
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,980
And want some of that money

1307
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:30,620
That's slack back

1308
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,300
To rebound to you

1309
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,680
You should go to

1310
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,120
Subgenius.com

1311
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,200
Front page

1312
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,740
Or especially the radio page

1313
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,800
Or the catalog store pages

1314
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,980
And help out financially

1315
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,120
As best you can

1316
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,620
Now we know what it's like

1317
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,480
To be on the brink

1318
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,340
Of total poverty

1319
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,500
And we don't want any subgeniuses

1320
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,180
To make their own situations worse

1321
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,760
But some of you

1322
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,120
Still have jobs

1323
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,080
Even five bucks

1324
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,400
Makes a big difference

1325
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,400
Even if it's only once a month

1326
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,000
From enough of you

1327
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,340
Fifty bucks makes

1328
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,420
An even bigger difference

1329
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,700
All we're saying is that

1330
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,220
Blow jobs could go the way

1331
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,100
Of Steve jobs

1332
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,200
If you don't pay Dobbs

1333
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,580
We also take checks

1334
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:15,380
And money orders
