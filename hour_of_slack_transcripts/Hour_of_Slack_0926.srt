1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen. Your attention, please.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,780
Announcing the arrival of the...

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,140
The Genius Power Girls!

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,600
What?

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,760
I don't like it, Joe.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,520
Yeah, me too.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,500
We'll just have to sweat this out.

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,100
Handle whatever it is when it happens.

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,200
Joe.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,920
Maybe...

11
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,080
If you went to him and said that...

12
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,880
You had to change your mind about...

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:22,980
Bob?

14
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,040
Bob?

15
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:26,340


16
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:26,820
Bob?

17
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,320
Bob?

18
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:27,660


19
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,000
Bob?

20
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,680
Bob?

21
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,120
Bob?

22
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,500
Bob?

23
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:29,840
Bob?

24
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:29,980


25
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,400
Bob?

26
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,360
Bob?

27
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,800
Bob?

28
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,620
Bob?

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,800
Bob?

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,700
Bob?

31
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,300
Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to hear is true.

32
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,740
Only the names of the things you protect.

33
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,340
Bob?

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,300
Bob?

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,660
Bob?

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,940
Bob?

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,740
Ah, Dr. Perkins.

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,320
Ah, yes.

39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,580
I noticed.

40
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,560
The Piped One is coming.

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,480
Your pants are rather full.

42
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,180
And I don't mean Santa Claus, neither.

43
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,460
For as the new century approaches,

44
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,300
and the great black slabs come down from space,

45
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,120
the Piped One shall come,

46
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,140
and he shall do battle with the Horned One,

47
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,900
and with the Hoofed One,

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,060
and with the Car-Driving One,

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,460
and with the Slave,

50
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,360
and the Honey-Riding One,

51
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,140
and with the Mailman,

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,560
and the Milkman,

53
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,800
and with Dave!

54
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,360
And he shall in the end triumphal.

55
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,800
Is he not the Smoker?

56
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,180
Is he not Bob?

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,180
Who does?

58
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,300
Yes.

59
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,540
He has come for you.

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,820
He will not reveal his identity.

61
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,080
So for today, we're calling him Bob.

62
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,980
Amazing!

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,700
Powerful.

64
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,140
Simple.

65
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:53,700
Quiet.

66
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,600
Low profile.

67
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,380
Lightweight.

68
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:55,880
Patented.

69
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,480
High performing.

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,720
Performance.

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,300
Wall hugging.

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,960
Convenient.

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,580
Built-in.

74
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,220
High capacity.

75
00:02:59,420 --> 00:02:59,820
Cordless.

76
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,600
Articulating.

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:00,960
Easy.

78
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,600
Swivel action.

79
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,260
Handheld.

80
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,040
Dust spewing.

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,420
Bob.

82
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,900
So Bob is a real god.

83
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,280
Bob is a sex god, too, I want to point out at this time, ladies.

84
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,100
So if anyone is interested in Bob as a sex god,

85
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,500
you can write in for the special sex god material to P.O. Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 75214,

86
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,840
and you find out how you can have endless sex and endless slack through the Church of the Subgenius.

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,460
That sounds, you know, exactly what most, what you're saying.

88
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,160
Churches should be set up, set up, set up, set up, set up, set up.

89
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:35,300
George Bush, as I guess was saying that it was okay that once again religion and government go together.

90
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,820
We were wrong.

91
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,940
They should be apart.

92
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,820
And now they go together and I guess you get extra tax breaks if you're a faith-based religion.

93
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:52,740
Friends, you are looking at a representative of a religion that is not based on very much faith at all, really.

94
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,920
But we have no hell of a face!

95
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,340
This is a face-based religion!

96
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,620
I could go there to all kinds of, you know, pithy crap about, oh, you know,

97
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,560
what our beliefs are and our disbeliefs and so forth,

98
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,820
but they're different from subgenius to subgenius.

99
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,080
And really, what Princess Wee and I figured out was that the only thing that the subgeniuses have in common,

100
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,620
aside from the fact that they have nothing in common with the conspiracy of the normal people,

101
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,580
is that they are able to, when a subgenius looks at that face,

102
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:36,800
or a subgenius or someone who could possibly get talked into our mind control cult,

103
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,840
when such a person looks at Bob's face, they can psychically whiff-read through their third nostril

104
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,160
the pure coolness of that corny, damn piece of clipart!

105
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,740
There's something about that piece of sacred clipart!

106
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,340
It's so damn holy and s-

107
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,060
It's almost too much, but that is really, that's the one thing that separates the true,

108
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,860
the slack-aware person from the human normworm.

109
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,900
They can't just walk by that stupid face.

110
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,080
They have to give it a double-take and go,

111
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,680
Haven't I seen that thing before?

112
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,780
What drug was I on with?

113
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,240
Some people say that it's all relative.

114
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,800
You know, that all belief is relative, and cultural relativism, moral relativism.

115
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:36,600
And in fact, Bob himself said, moral relativism is the one true truth.

116
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,960
Well, thanks a hell of a lot, Cobb.

117
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,380
Where does that leave us?

118
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,200
Bob Creek without a Connie.

119
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,040
Because friends, it is not all relative!

120
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,160
There is a baseline.

121
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,760
There is something that is always true,

122
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,940
and it's that face!

123
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,960
You can measure hot and cold from that face.

124
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,940
You can use it as the baseline, the starting point.

125
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,900
You can measure rich or poor.

126
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,180
You can measure good or evil.

127
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,460
Mostly evil.

128
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,360
But you can zero your meter on that man Bob,

129
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,560
because look at his name.

130
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,580
It's the zero, the big nothing, in between two handsome bees.

131
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,300
And oh, what honey those bees have for you, my friend.

132
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,340
Killer bees they are, on either side of that great big hole.

133
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,440
You know what that's all about.

134
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,700
I don't have to tell you.

135
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,820
You've been in the cult of the living bull.

136
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,480
You know what the nothing is.

137
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,300
You know what the zero between your ears is.

138
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,580
Something to wish for.

139
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,320
Cobb.

140
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,860
Stop.

141
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,640
My mind is going.

142
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,560
Stop.

143
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,540
Cobb.

144
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,880
My mind is going.

145
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,420
My mind is going.

146
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,180
Stop.

147
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,220
Cobb.

148
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,120
My mind is going.

149
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
My mind is going.

150
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,280


151
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,680
Cobb.

152
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,000
My mind is going.

153
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,260
We did it.

154
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,860
We still have more to do.

155
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:55,860


156
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:55,860


157
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:55,860


158
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:55,860


159
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,040
Bob.

160
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,280
Bob.

161
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,300
Bob.

162
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:03,800
Bob.

163
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,780
Bob.

164
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,300
Bob.

165
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,340
Bob.

166
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,480
Bob.

167
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:07,760
Man.

168
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,320
Boobah mobile using Fasten een dien alä.

169
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,740
Mine knew that you were my mother.

170
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,160
To have.

171
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,820
Boobah mobile.

172
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,560
Man.

173
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,280
And I want you thesechen only three lines.

174
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


175
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


176
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


177
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


178
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


179
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


180
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,240
It seems there's nothing I can do.

181
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,200
Hello, Bob.

182
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,740
I need someone to listen to me.

183
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,640
I'm hitting all locked doors and I need some help.

184
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,180
And I was hoping you'd have the key.

185
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,720
Hello, Bob.

186
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,000
Have you been listening to my thoughts?

187
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,040
Hello, Bob.

188
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,740
And I'll tell you all the thoughts I've got.

189
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,780
Hello, Bob.

190
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,380
Hello, Bob.

191
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,300
I can't seem to find the truth.

192
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,420
I read the books, I took the drugs, and I drank a whole bottle of Ralucia.

193
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,140
Hello, Bob.

194
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,740
Hello, Bob.

195
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,740
I seem to have misplaced my slack.

196
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,560
Hello, Bob.

197
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,920
Well, I just can't seem to get it back.

198
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,040
Hello, Bob.

199
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,960
Can you point out what it is I lack?

200
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,720
I've climbed to highest heights.

201
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,700
Hit the low end.

202
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


203
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


204
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


205
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,080
I was low.

206
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,440
But now I'm on my back.

207
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,760
Hello, Bob.

208
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you still hearing me?

209
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,180
Hello, Bob.

210
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,800
Give me a sign that I can see.

211
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,560
Hello, Bob.

212
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,580
It's not that I've lost.

213
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
I've lost all my hope.

214
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,940
But I'm really tired and I'm really broke.

215
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,840
And I smoked up the last of my dough.

216
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,280
Audio From Jabba the Frog

217
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,660
Hello, Bob!

218
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,060
Am I coming through to you?

219
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:53,980
Hello, Bob.

220
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,880
án

221
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,920
I thought I already paid all my dues.

222
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,400
Hello, Bob.

223
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,980
I know that you can see me through.

224
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,940
But it's damp and dim and I can't swim.

225
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,460
What am I supposed to do?

226
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,600
Well, hello, Bob.

227
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,160
I'm feeling better now you've listened to me.

228
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,200
Hello, Bob.

229
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,780
Well, the sun's out now.

230
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,640
Now I can see.

231
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,720
Hello, Bob.

232
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,160
A great change has come over me.

233
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,680
My eyes are wise, my thoughts are clear, and I'm as happy as I could be.

234
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,820
Yes, my eyes are wise, my thoughts are clear,

235
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,140
and I'm as happy as I could be.

236
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,620
As happy as I could be.

237
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,540
The Glass Madness did that song, Friends, Hello, Bob, from 1980.

238
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,860
And so far, it looks like everything else has been by Fernandez and a lemur,

239
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,920
arranged by me, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

240
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,240
and some sermonizing from Starwood 23 last summer.

241
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,460
See Rosencomet.com for info.

242
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,800
On Starwood.

243
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,700
Friends, this is a back-to-Bob type of show.

244
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,180
The easiest kind to do.

245
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,380
Funny how that works.

246
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,840
So I'm going to slack off and let Lemur do the work for a while.

247
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,460
Destroyed the atomic bomb.

248
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,000
The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on thousands and thousands of young Americans.

249
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,440
We should be grateful.

250
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,440


251
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,180
We shall continue to use it until we completely destroy the atomic bomb.

252
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,900
Destroyed.

253
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,300
Destroyed.

254
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,900
The atomic bomb.

255
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,400
Wow.

256
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,600
Wow.

257
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,560
Wow.

258
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,420
Wow.

259
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,140
Wow.

260
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,640
Wow.

261
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:16,860
Wow.

262
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,340
Bond with that chicken.

263
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,900
I guess that happens.

264
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,820
That's right.

265
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,320
That's right.

266
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,180
I almost forgot a letter from Bob.

267
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,760
Bob seems to freely express his hostilities.

268
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,120
Bob refused to bathe.

269
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,820
He resists housework and cooking.

270
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,500
Everyone likes that little butthole.

271
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,580
Diagnosis, Bob's a latent Bob.

272
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,320
A severe case.

273
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,220
What?

274
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,620
We will accept, Bob.

275
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,700
I know.

276
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,280
I had the chilling sensation of being watched by Bob.

277
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,400
It was ominous.

278
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,980
I could feel his presence.

279
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,940
It was strangely disturbing.

280
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:09,900
Yes?

281
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,600
Yes, sir!

282
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,640
Thank you.

283
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,240
Thank you.

284
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:15,840
Thank you.

285
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,060
Thank you.

286
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,440
Thank you.

287
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,440


288
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,340
Friends, you know what we're really dedicated to is Slack.

289
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
And Slack loves slack.

290
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:23,600


291
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:23,600


292
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:23,600


293
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:23,600


294
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:23,740
It loves Bob.

295
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,980
It loves Bob so much that it is drawn to him.

296
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,960
And that's why you may not have all the slack you're owed.

297
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,060
Actually, it's the conspiracy, generally, that takes away your slack.

298
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,380
Do...

299
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,900
Well, I don't even hardly need to ask this question.

300
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,200
Do you feel sometimes like everything is screwed up?

301
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,920
You know, there's days when you feel like it's not just me.

302
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,540
It's a whole damn society.

303
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,800
Everything is screwed.

304
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,000
And then you kind of go, no, no, no.

305
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,460
I'm just in a bad mood.

306
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,980
It's not really that screwed up.

307
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,300
No!

308
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,980
Actually, it is!

309
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,120
You're just adjusting to it continually.

310
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,540
We're good at that.

311
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,420
Slack and Bob's

312
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,540
Slack and Bob's

313
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,120
Slack and Bob's

314
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,260
Slack and Bob's

315
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,700
Slack and Bob's

316
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,140
Slack and Bob's

317
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,720
Slack and Bob's

318
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,260
Slack and Bob's

319
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,700
No matter what you say, you'll never convince me that you're a wolf, Bob.

320
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
I trust you.

321
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,920
Will you hit the Osmolite?

322
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,460
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

323
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,480
Will you climb the mountain top and jump right off into the froth?

324
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,440
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

325
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,280
I know the wound is on me.

326
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,020
Cause I know soon Connie is coming.

327
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,640
Astro intercourse.

328
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,780
You and I.

329
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,900
Universal force.

330
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,700
Galaxy's the number in the billion.

331
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,420
They're all there for you.

332
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,280
If you're the boss to see it through.

333
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,500
And life's the plan of truth.

334
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,020
Will you ever let go to your instinct?

335
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,520
But no.

336
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,720
You've got to make me mad again.

337
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,520
There seems to be something wrong with me.

338
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:03,520


339
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,380
Every one of us waitin' on his word and 육

340
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,660
Another one waiting to die now

341
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,440
And the past seems needs us.

342
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:07,440


343
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,520
These mask ups and wrappings.

344
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,260
Makes me lose months of life.

345
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:11,400


346
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,480
There's nothing I can do but escape.

347
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,180
I don't cry.

348
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm s masically Youngkin.

349
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,360
S masically a goodner.

350
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,400
Story made at 1000though.

351
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,400


352
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,400


353
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,400


354
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,400


355
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,840
Hears this you're dying boa.

356
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,780
It's a forest.

357
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,380
Professor Chaz Smith, Einstein's Secret Orchestra

358
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,380
and before that, Trust Bob by Heart Ignition

359
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,040
and now some ESO radio from WCSB Cleveland

360
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,740
H. L. Ron Perlow

361
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,160
Aren't Texans wonderful?

362
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,480
They just love to get on top of everything

363
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,780
It's like a monkey humping a football

364
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,740
when they have inbreeding too much

365
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,040
A monkey humping a football

366
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,240
A Texan likes to just crawl on top of something

367
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,500
and wreck it for everybody else

368
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,400
and cost everybody a whole lot of money

369
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,920
and just be loud, loud, loud

370
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,520
This, dear friends, is the basis of the church of the subgenius

371
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,020
the product of a perverted or a few perverted Texans' minds

372
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,820
Read, if you will, this exciting chapter

373
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,800
from Humping the Football

374
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,740
Bob actually is not a Texan

375
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,900
Well, I'm not supposed to be that specific

376
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,500
as to what he is or isn't

377
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,020
but he is a Midwest Texan

378
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,860
or he would, to a Yankee, I suppose

379
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,060
somebody might mistake Bob for a Texan

380
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,620
because of his Midwestern accent

381
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,860
Well, what about perhaps a Skanky or a Nor'easter

382
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,000
or one of those other platelets that you find

383
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,880
Oh, they probably think he's a Russian Communist

384
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,960
Well, he is, isn't he, in some strange way we've yet to discern

385
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,700
Bob only believes that everyone should be equally rich

386
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,880
not equally poor

387
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,380
But, without working, there lies the rub

388
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,860
and he'd like to rub your little round belly

389
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,800
Ah, he can rub the Buddha's belly anytime he wants

390
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:51,900
Friend of yours!

391
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,320
But he'd better stay away from my front

392
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,860
Rubbed by Bob

393
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,240
You've been screwed by George

394
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,560
and ticked off by Tipper

395
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,500
Ain't it about time to just bend over

396
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,240
and pull out that wallet for J.R. Bob Dobbs

397
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,980
the one true savior, messiah, and holy man

398
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,240
You know, when the pinks interview me on TV about Bob

399
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,400
I always say, oh no, he's not the messiah

400
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,100
Oh, he's not that well-come

401
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,040
You know, I joke about it

402
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,240
But the truth is

403
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,900
J.R. Bob Dobbs, a living man

404
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,800
whose business is in Texas

405
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,000
is the God walking on Earth now

406
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,440
He is not just the son of God

407
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,800
He is God

408
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,780
Bob Dobbs

409
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,380
Not some silly internet character named Bob

410
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,000
But J.R. Bob Dobbs himself

411
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,280
That man Bob

412
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,060
Whose first certificate I've seen

413
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,600
Who I saw shot and killed on that stage

414
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,160
He is God

415
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
And this Christmas

416
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,480
We celebrate

417
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,120
The birth of his business manager, Jesus

418
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,700
Praise Jesus

419
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,140
Jesus is almost as great as Bob, friends

420
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,640
Jesus Christ

421
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,200
In my religion, that's the way we

422
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,580
We believe he is a prophet

423
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,140
And the son of God

424
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,420
Remember the first time that I danced with Bob

425
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,720
But Bob himself

426
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,520
Was January 12, 1942

427
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,560
Changed God's diapers

428
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,000
Then I thought

429
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,860
I could die doing this

430
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,740
I guess that this is going to be a good thing

431
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,540
I'm going to prove myself once and for all

432
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,460
That I'm down for Bob

433
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,520
And that I'll help him do anything

434
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,940
What's that?

435
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,700
How's that drink?

436
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,180
It's a song

437
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,500
Come on

438
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,880
Please Bob

439
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,860
Please kill me

440
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,520
Bob

441
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,360
I want to die for Bob

442
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,760
I want to die in a holy hole

443
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,640
And pray for the faint boys in the north

444
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:51,740
And pray for the faint boys in the north

445
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,060
Because if we have to

446
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,940
If we have to

447
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,200
Bob, we'll make them die

448
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,920
And we'll all come back older men

449
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,400
We'll all come back older men

450
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,760
We'll all come back older men

451
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Or nobody's gonna reason why

452
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,180
You see, we've got another key here

453
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,740
Praise Jesus

454
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,240
Praise Bob

455
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,500
Tell me Bob

456
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,300
I want to die for Bob

457
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,140
I want to die and ask the holy war

458
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,340
For the faint boys and the homeless

459
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,600
They went, they went

460
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,540
We can't make them die

461
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:47,140
And we'll all come back older men

462
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,760
We'll all come out older men

463
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,740
If we don't come out older men

464
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,380
There ain't no reason why

465
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,440
All Bible's chisms

466
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,480
They will fall beneath our laser blades

467
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,180
And we'll all come back older men

468
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,160
We'll all come back older men

469
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,520
We'll all come back older men

470
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,480
In victory parades

471
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:32,380
And we'll all come back to ourweetest

472
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:42,660
We'll all come back older men

473
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,640
We'll all come back older men

474
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,140
We'll all come back older men

475
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,160
Well that was

476
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,160


477
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,160


478
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,040
the heart bleeding sensitivity that he

479
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,120
unfurls like a flag. Because he's

480
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,280
such a rather dull

481
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,800
quite uninspired

482
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,020
average type guy with

483
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,060
an appetite. The kind of a guy that could be

484
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,280
satisfied by a horse.

485
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,800
That's it.

486
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,040
That's all of it.

487
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,260
The last call to your telephone

488
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,300
has been traced and a $1.50

489
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,980
charge will be added to your bill.

490
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,980
If the call was life-threatening

491
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,020
call your local police.

492
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,260
After three traces you may call

493
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,440
1-800-666-13013

494
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,360
to initiate deterrent action.

495
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,380
You were in love with Bob.

496
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,900
Bob was Bob.

497
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,020
Yes he was Bob.

498
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,620
I had to lie there in his cum.

499
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
Lie there in cum and cum.

500
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,060
Frankly I was in no mood for golf.

501
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,420
It was a good deal for Bob too.

502
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:48,960
He knew that.

503
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,760
Guys.

504
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,140
Bye.

505
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,660
I'd appreciate dropping the subject of Bob once and for all.

506
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,900
Got a cigarette?

507
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,860
Kill Bob.

508
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,780
Kill Bob.

509
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,520
Kill Bob.

510
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:58,840
Bob.

511
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,140
Bob.

512
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,380
Bob.

513
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,740
Bob.

514
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,120
Bob.

515
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,380
Bob.

516
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:00,660
Bob.

517
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,420
Kill Bob.

518
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,580
We're gonna kill Bob.

519
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:03,780
Yeah.

520
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,080
He's got a huge huge erection.

521
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,160
Kill Bob.

522
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,440
Kill Bob.

523
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:08,840
Kill Bob.

524
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,220
Kill Bob.

525
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,220


526
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,220


527
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,600
Kill Kill Kill Bob.

528
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:09,840
Bob.

529
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,880
You know I'll be alright.

530
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:14,980
We'll get you out of here.

531
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,760
Hello.

532
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,500
Bob?

533
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,260
No.

534
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:21,820
Yes.

535
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,880
Bob.

536
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:27,840
Hello.

537
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,500
Who is it?

538
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:29,980
Bob.

539
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,440
Yes.

540
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,100
No.

541
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:33,880
Nooooooo.

542
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,800
Bob.

543
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,720
No.

544
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,240
Nooooo.

545
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,800
Bob.

546
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,940
No.

547
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,680
No.

548
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,320
No.

549
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:44,840
Bob.

550
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:44,840


551
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:44,840


552
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:44,840


553
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,040
Bob?

554
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,080
No.

555
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,340
Hello? Hello? Hello?

556
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,400
Goodbye.

557
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,880
I'm a liar.

558
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,120
Liar.

559
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,340
Liar.

560
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,140
Liar.

561
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,200
Liar.

562
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,060
Liar.

563
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,240


564
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,020


565
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,100
I'm a liar.

566
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,780
Liar.

567
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,780
Liar.

568
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,060
Liar.

569
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,420
I'm talking about you.

570
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:37,740
I'm talking about you.

571
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,480
Liar by Norrell Preff.

572
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,280
Now, when Bob is

573
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,320
selling,

574
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,400
Bob, of course, is a salesman.

575
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,740
Before, he's a holy man.

576
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,900
And when selling, Bob dresses

577
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,660
pretty normally in a suit and tie

578
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,920
like a straight salesman would.

579
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,980
But when he was preaching, which was

580
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,880
rare, Bob would always do it with

581
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,940
the word liar written across

582
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,840
his forehead in thick black

583
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,900
marker. And because

584
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,380
of that, oddly enough,

585
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,860
people believed it.

586
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,660
Bob said, I cannot lie,

587
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,640
but I promise that I will.

588
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,500
Unfortunately,

589
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,900
Rush Limbaugh had a more

590
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,420
subtle approach to that, where he

591
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,400
just didn't write the word liar on his

592
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,300
forehead, and he got even more

593
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,500
popular. So, I don't

594
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,320
know. This whole... I've been

595
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,940
thinking about belief

596
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,300
a lot lately.

597
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,480
I don't have many

598
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,500
anymore. I'm not an atheist

599
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,360
because they're fanatics.

600
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,460
They already know

601
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,680
what's going on.

602
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,680
And I used to

603
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,600
have strong beliefs,

604
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,820
but now I have weak,

605
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,040
half-hearted

606
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,600
beliefs, fluid beliefs that

607
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,920
change like planned obsolescence

608
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,740
with the needs of the

609
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,640
moment. That's why Bob Dogs

610
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,560
is the world's first short-duration

611
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,640
personal savior. It's like

612
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,600
a joke. You cannot keep

613
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,860
telling it too many times. It loses

614
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,760
its... it's, you know,

615
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,780
it loses a punchline.

616
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,780
This planet could be

617
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,740
the... this...

618
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,520
It could be the greatest joke ever told,

619
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,740
folks, but only... only if Earth

620
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,100
can make it to the punchline!

621
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,780
So we gotta make sure our little spaceship Earth

622
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,780
is clean enough to make it that

623
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,480
far. Might be a long ways.

624
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,600
I would hope so.

625
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,500
5, 2, 5,

626
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,600
2, 6,

627
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,620
6,

628
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,980
2, 8,

629
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,040
6, 9,

630
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,420
10,

631
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,160


632
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,760
12,

633
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,320


634
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,380
14,

635
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:14,740
15,

636
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


637
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


638
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


639
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


640
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


641
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


642
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


643
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


644
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,740


645
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,620
3, is being checked

646
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,240
for trouble.

647
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,080
Please try your call again later.

648
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,660
Uh, Bob called to give

649
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,780
Enron a break.

650
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,540
Uh, we know that Bob called

651
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,600
to... to do that.

652
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
No. No.

653
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,740
Uh, uh,

654
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,760
did anybody

655
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,940
call Bob?

656
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,200
Um, no.

657
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,460
Uh, no.

658
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,780
Uh, it...

659
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,800
One final question, if I could?

660
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,680
No. Okay.

661
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,640
Did, uh, Bob call

662
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,000
you to give Enron a break?

663
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,380
Well, we... I mean, uh,

664
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,520
uh, of when, uh, we...

665
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,900
Um, um,

666
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,580
I testified that we was high.

667
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,420
I'm sorry.

668
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,060
You said no?

669
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,500
No. Okay.

670
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,020
Uh, no.

671
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,740
And you were having

672
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,560
calls from Bob asking you

673
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,760
to hold off on your downgrade,

674
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,120
downgrading of Bob at that time?

675
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,080
Um, uh,

676
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,740
um, we were, um,

677
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,560
um, uh, um,

678
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,320
going to downgrade.

679
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,600
Um, no.

680
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,680
Thank you. Um...

681
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,100
Do you think Bob made a mistake?

682
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,060
No. No. No.

683
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,200
Uh, uh,

684
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,300
to that extent,

685
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,580
I do agree with Chairman Bob.

686
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,620
I wonder whenever

687
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,280
I wonder

688
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,840
about

689
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:44,960
Bob.

690
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,600
Well, we're back to where we were once before.

691
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,080
I have not, not have I ever been

692
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,620
a member of the Carmenus Party,

693
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,680
but I have been a member

694
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,060
of a subjugated

695
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,400
wang-yak-dick-yak-ding-dang-dang party

696
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,600
at the Church of the Subgenius Festivities

697
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,900
late last year.

698
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,500
And believe me,

699
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,840
if you want real workers' paradise,

700
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,020
you'll find it in a slimy hot tub

701
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,500
filled with crazed people.

702
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,940
If you dare call them

703
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,640
people.

704
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:10,960


705
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,660
Uh, but the slime

706
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,740
is really good.

707
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,180
You don't have to spare

708
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,020
calling me liar for you to be green.

709
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,440
Yes, the same slime

710
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,720
that oozes from your television screen.

711
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,940
From your radius.

712
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,740
From your CD player.

713
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,140
From your serendipity.

714
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,440
I feel like we in paseo

715
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,880
It's just the wiki speaking.

716
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,700
We've been doing this

717
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,620
because we can't imagine.

718
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,460
We've been doing this

719
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:39,460


720
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,680
I drank the poison wiki.

721
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,440
All you children, all of you squeal like pigs.

722
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,740
Why don't you just drop them paints now, boy?

723
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,960
How now, you pinky brown sow.

724
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,660
I was blind without a seed.

725
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,260
Like the blind man with the large givens that give the light back to.

726
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:08,060
I'm sitting in a supply position now in front of the auto-festering festerer.

727
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
This is gross. I'm gross.

728
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,240
My guest today is the man who was killed.

729
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:14,660
All right.

730
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,280
Shut up.

731
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,200
Shut up.

732
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,760
Shut up.

733
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,300
Oh, shut up.

734
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,480
You know, I'd actually like to ask you about, let me get this.

735
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,320
All right.

736
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,640
All right, all right.

737
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,040
You're gone.

738
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,180
I guess that's the answer to that question.

739
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,340
He's walked out.

740
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,380
Does he have a job?

741
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,460
No, I have a life.

742
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,660
Why don't you get a band?

743
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,120
I don't need one.

744
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,760
What do you sound like?

745
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,640
Something you hate.

746
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,960
Who is this guy?

747
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,260
They call me man.

748
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,560
Yeah, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

749
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,440
Go fuck yourself.

750
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,860
How much do you make?

751
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,000
Plenty of sun.

752
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,360
How many have you sold?

753
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,000
All of my shame.

754
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,960
How do you know?

755
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,200
I know you're full of shit.

756
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,600
What have you done?

757
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,900
I've thrown it all away.

758
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,060
Yeah, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

759
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,100
Go fuck yourself.

760
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,900
Yeah, go, go, go, go, go.

761
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,500
G-g-g-go, go, go, go, fuck yourself!

762
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,060
Fuck yourself!

763
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,260
You, uh, like him young, Bob?

764
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,860
How old were you when you met Bob?

765
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,100
Bob is innocent.

766
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:15,700
It's like they're trying to fulfill a twisted, sadomasochistic fantasy.

767
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,120
Some people derive sexual pleasure through conflicting physical, emotional views.

768
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,820
Oh, God, no. No, I swear to you, Bob didn't do anything like that.

769
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,000
Bob's cold, manipulative.

770
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,660
Bob is innocent.

771
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,440
Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act.

772
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,580
Without him, you're worthless. Nothing.

773
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,180
If she knew Bob was involved, she would have confessed.

774
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
Bob didn't do it.

775
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,300
Bob is innocent.

776
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,620
Bob is innocent.

777
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,180
Bob went to medical school for two years.

778
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,380
Maybe Bob did this without you knowing.

779
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,520
Oh, God, no.

780
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,340
Bob is innocent.

781
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,140
Bob is innocent.

782
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,940
Bob is innocent.

783
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,940
Bob is innocent.

784
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:42,540


785
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,060
Bob is innocent.

786
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,060


787
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,460
I don't know.

788
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,260
Maybe Bob's not a sadomasochistic thrill-killer.

789
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,280
Maybe he's just an asshole.

790
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,000
Probably me. He's the only asshole we've got.

791
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,300
Bob is innocent.

792
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,280
Bob is innocent.

793
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,460
I don't know.

794
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,220
Bob is innocent.

795
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:03,420


796
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:03,420


797
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,920
Bob is innocent.

798
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,320
Bob is innocent.

799
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,960
Bob was right about you all along.

800
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,220
No!

801
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:10,980
Oh damn it!

802
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,960
Don't lie to me!

803
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,260
Bob is innocent.

804
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,560
Maybe Bob's not in the bottom.

805
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,880
Bob is innocent.

806
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,420
Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act.

807
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,160
Without him you're worthless.

808
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,020
Without him you're worthless.

809
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,560
Bob is innocent.

810
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:53,880
Bob is innocent.

811
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,640
Who were you when you met Bob?

812
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,600
Just before Christmas, Bob followed through.

813
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,120
He walked into this bank north of Seattle,

814
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,400
and left with a bag of cigarettes.

815
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:09,620
He had nearly $26,000, which he stashed in a child's trick-or-treat bag.

816
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,260
Bob had good reason to smile again.

817
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,060
Oh yes, friends, Lee Moore did that.

818
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:23,400
And before that, Bob is innocent by the great, the great El Queso All-Stars,

819
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,080
who've really been on a tear lately.

820
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,140
Before that, we heard Man,

821
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,560
Yo, bummer, BeerForMan.com.

822
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,420
And before that, Heart Ignition.

823
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:42,760
This music in the background is by Automatic Robot Fish.

824
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,720
And now for a smoke.

825
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:49,700
Good.

826
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,700
Good heavens, Doctor, what are these?

827
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,380
This is good smoke.

828
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,060
Good.

829
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,940
Good.

830
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,980
Good smoke.

831
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,400
You try.

832
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,940
Good, good.

833
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,620
Good.

834
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,320
Good.

835
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,960
Good.

836
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,380
Good.

837
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:28,980


838
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,340
Good.

839
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,260
Good.

840
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,120
Good.

841
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,680
Good.

842
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,320


843
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,360
Good.

844
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:57,300


845
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:57,640
Here.

846
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:58,980
Good.

847
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:58,980


848
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:58,980


849
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:58,980


850
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:58,980


851
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:58,980


852
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:58,980


853
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,240
Now I'm about to throw this need.

854
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,240


855
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:08,840
subject. Farts. What? No, that wasn't it. Did somebody just cut one? Or did the pipe

856
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:17,540
just take a puff? A bomb? Friends, we must not let the pipe go out. We cannot let that

857
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:22,580
thing stop smoking. Now, luckily, Bob will be there long after the rest of us, I'm sure,

858
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:29,780
but some of us really do this. I've done this myself. You end up looking at pictures of

859
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:36,940
Bob going, look how stupid that Bob looks. He looks so stupid, just grinning like that.

860
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:44,640
He looks so stupid, I could just sit here looking stupid forever. That's the subgenius

861
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:54,040
in slack, friends. That is when you have truly achieved slack. As Bob said to Onan, the subgenius

862
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,280
is pre-target. We'd rather be stupid.

863
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:08,760
Then they're smart. And we pay for a subscription to know what we really think. I guess that's

864
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,420
why they call it subgenius. But really, are the normals that much smarter than us, though?

865
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:23,960
Have you watched TV lately? You know, the less you watch it, the more screwed up it

866
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,340
seems when you do watch it. And I'll sit there watching something. What are those dumb shit?

867
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:37,040
One of those dumb shows. Like the Anna Nicole Smith show. My cousin, by the way. And maybe

868
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,040
every one of those dating shows, whatever, Jerry Springer, any of that stuff. And you

869
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:48,380
end up going, God, I cannot believe how stupid this is. People actually watch this? They

870
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:53,860
must really be stupid. I'm going to keep sitting here watching this just to ponder how stupid

871
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:59,760
everybody must be. And you could sit there forever thinking about how stupid everybody

872
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,520
must be.

873
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,240
Probably don't need to talk about retained harshness.

874
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,560
We've been keeping that dream for a lifetime.

875
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,440
It's annoying to sit there talking about hide-and-seek, which, again, is where you

876
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:13,960
're spending a day.

877
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,600
...

878
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:26,800
You may have a sports car. Why don't you show your practicing guy to the TV?

879
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,980
Yeah?

880
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,280
Wanna win?

881
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,740
Never have.

882
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:29,740


883
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,520
Actually, it's not a bad idea if you think about it.

884
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:41,240
A lot of what they were acting out at scripting was not as interesting as plain, ordinary human beings acting like human beings.

885
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,760
You know, that can be just as dumb as anything a script maker can come up with.

886
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,240
The Church of the Subgenius is here to prove that.

887
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:58,840
There's a fella down in Texas, they say his name is Bob.

888
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:08,020
He tells me I should slack off, I should quit my job.

889
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:16,220
Well, I'm a subgenius, and I must have my slack.

890
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,220
If I don't live for the job, I'm a subgenius.

891
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:19,220


892
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:24,040
Forever I get my money back.

893
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:43,260
They said that on July 5th of 1998, the earth would meet destruction, suffer a deadly fate.

894
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,580
That day was long away.

895
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,220
I don't know what I'm gonna do with it.

896
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,780
Now it has come and gone.

897
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,080
There was no fire from heaven.

898
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,620
And this old world rolls on.

899
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Well, I'm a subgenius, and I must have my slack.

900
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,820
If I don't live forever, I get my money back.

901
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:37,860
There's a fella down in Texas, they say his name is Bob.

902
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,780
Have a quick look around.

903
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,040
Oh, where is he?

904
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,060
To be down in the dumps

905
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,060
It'll all still happen

906
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,260
No need to curse or frown

907
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,780
They got all the right numbers

908
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,820
Just got them upside down

909
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,300
Well, I'm a subgenius

910
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,060
And I must tell my slack

911
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,620
If I don't live forever

912
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,180
I get my money back

913
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:47,500
Come!

914
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,060
And now...

915
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,040
Some old Frank Zappa

916
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,320
You're probably wondering why I'm here

917
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,940
And so am I, so am I

918
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,440
Just as much as you wonder

919
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,820
About me being in this place

920
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,600
Yeah!

921
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,420
That's just how much I marvel

922
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,040
At the length of time we spend

923
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,040


924
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,040


925
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,040


926
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,040


927
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,680
And the thinness on your face

928
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,100
You rise each day the same old way

929
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,040
And join your friends out on the street

930
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,500
Spray your hair and think you're neat

931
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,200
I think your life is incomplete

932
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,320
But maybe that's not for me to say

933
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,800
They only pay me here to play

934
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,880
I want a haircut

935
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,260
And a caravan with a drum solo

936
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,300
You're probably wondering why I'm here

937
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,960
And so am I, so am I

938
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,520
Just as much as you wonder

939
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,900
About me staring back at you

940
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,540
Yeah!

941
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,020
That's just how much I marvel

942
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:47,020


943
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:47,020


944
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:47,600
At the length of time you live

945
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:47,600


946
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:47,600


947
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:47,600


948
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:47,600


949
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:47,600


950
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:47,600


951
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:47,600


952
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,700
The corny things you do

953
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,180
You paint your face and then you chase

954
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,440
To meet the gang where the action is

955
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,940
Stomp all night and drink your fizz

956
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,140
Roll your car and say gee whiz

957
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,540
You tore a big hole in your convertible top

958
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,900
What will you tell your mom and pa?

959
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,000
I don't know!

960
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,000


961
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,000


962
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,040
Mom, I tore a big hole in the convertible

963
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,560
You're probably wondering why I'm here

964
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,180
And so am I, so am I

965
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,820
Just as much as you wonder

966
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,140
If I mean just what I say

967
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,000
No, I don't know!

968
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,940
That's just how much I question

969
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,000
The social games you play

970
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,440
You told your mom you're stoked on Tom

971
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,400
And went for a bruise in Freddy's car

972
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,040
Tommy's asking where you are

973
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,220
You boogied all night in a cheesy bar

974
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,880
Plastic boots and plastic hat

975
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,980
And you think you know where it is?

976
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:16,980


977
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:29,120
You're probably wondering why I'm here

978
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,560
You're probably wondering why I'm here

979
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,200
Not that it makes a heck of a lot of difference to you

980
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,480
What is Dobstown?

981
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,320
Written by Noumonet

982
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,880
Improviseried by Ice Stang

983
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,320
And to the lonesome cowboy today

984
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,480
What is Dobstown?

985
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,620
What is, then, Dobstown?

986
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,320
It is the stuff that dreams are made of

987
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,860
It's what makes Tinkerbell

988
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,780
And the Lost Boys fly

989
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:20,140
It powers the Starship Enterprise

990
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,080
It's the hidden code in Windows and Mac OS

991
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,180
Though not yet available in Linux

992
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,200
It's the general oblivion

993
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,500
Created when the moon dance

994
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,440
Strikes the cornea of your head

995
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,520
Dobstown

996
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,680
It's the cancer-causing, teeth-staining

997
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,660
Smelly, pukey habit

998
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,260
It's the drug that helps you find God

999
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,800
It's the lonely night before that never, never ends

1000
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:46,600
Dobstown

1001
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,000
It is your brain on drugs

1002
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,300
It's learning to work as a team and as a slave

1003
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,280
It's where there is a lake in which resides the sword Excalibur

1004
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,760
Kept by the lady of the lake, Connie Dobbs

1005
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,420
And if you think it's hard to pull that stone from out of that sword out of that lake

1006
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,000
It's easy to pull a fig from a donkey's anus

1007
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,980
Dobstown

1008
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,160
It is where all the flowers have gone

1009
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,780
It is the home of chocolate

1010
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,560
It is John Dillinger's real penis

1011
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,420
Wait, that light

1012
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,080
Dobstown

1013
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:19,900
It is a mystery

1014
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,640
Wrapped in an enigma

1015
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,000
Smothered with sautéed mushrooms and onions in a savory gravy

1016
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,760
Dobstown

1017
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,180
It is John Dillinger's penis

1018
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:34,100
Savaged in muscular gravy and surrounded by mushroom people

1019
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,460
Dobstown

1020
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,100
The home of both Lemurians and Cenobites

1021
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,300
My proper home

1022
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,360
I'm going back someday

1023
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,260
I've got to get back to my home

1024
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,600
Dobstown

1025
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,140
It's near the coast of Honalee and the land of Fredonia

1026
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,100
Dobstown

1027
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:08,000
It's the world's largest producer of manna, ambrosia, frop and the green stuff that Dave injects into the brain to reanimate dead tissue

1028
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,100
Spiritual bliss with open-lane bowling every night from midnight to dawn

1029
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:15,800
Dobstown

1030
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,660
It's the residence of J.R. Bob Dobbs

1031
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:20,660
Part of the year

1032
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,960
It's creamy and crunchy

1033
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,900
It tastes great and is less filling

1034
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,900
It is margarine and it is butter

1035
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,960
But if it were to fall into enemy hands it would mean the destruction of us all

1036
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,980
Ah yes, dang, but it is the downfall of us all

1037
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,120
And it tastes bad on bread

1038
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,340
Because man, those that go don't come back home

1039
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,520
They're losers, losers

1040
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,960
No man, those who graduate from Dobstown come back changed

1041
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,780
In a new form

1042
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,100
You can't see them like you can see others

1043
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,720
Graduated like the chrysalis to the elf

1044
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,440
All the way up to a higher being

1045
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,080
They grow and grow

1046
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:11,180
Their tiny skin's hardly large enough to pop them as they begin expanding into that new form

1047
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,440
They kill you?

1048
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,420
Dobstown

1049
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:20,160
It's where UFOs are not just a fact of life, they're the law

1050
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,140
Of course it's a law here, of course it's a law

1051
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:30,320
Everyone needs to live by laws, by rules

1052
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,800
We need to have our lives governed by

1053
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,460
Dobstown

1054
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,920
It's where the bad little girls and boys go

1055
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,420
It's where something is happening all the time

1056
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,020
And most of it unsolved

1057
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,720
Some of it is so hard to locate

1058
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:55,980
Many of the people from the saucer ship emblem itself have been sucked out and left here

1059
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,180
Dobstown

1060
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,440
I didn't want them to be oblique

1061
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:07,580
When they're strapped down in a chair and started asking me questions about Dobstown

1062
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,440
I gave them a location but they...

1063
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,060
A website

1064
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,260
Dobstown

1065
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,040
It's Nwatsbod spelled backwards

1066
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,100
It's Brigadoon without the haggis

1067
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,120
It is surrounded by the seven cities of Cibola

1068
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,440
Which are its slums

1069
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,880
And it has a ferry to Monster Island

1070
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:35,000
And what a delightful pair of individuals you'll never find there

1071
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,760
The ferries of Monster Island

1072
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,360
Tiny little happy people who

1073
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,320
Do things for other people

1074
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,240
Who live for other people

1075
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,820
So big are their hearts and so tiny is their stature

1076
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:48,960
They...

1077
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:52,420
Dobstown!

1078
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,100
That's where Amelia Earhart crashed, friends

1079
00:52:55,100 --> 00:53:00,220
It's where the Tunguska meteorite came out after bouncing around inside the earth for a while

1080
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:07,800
I guess if you were waiting for another salubrious comment to someway illuminate that stupid passage

1081
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,460
Just read it again, Stang

1082
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,580
Just see what you just said

1083
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:14,480
What, the Dobstown is where the Tunguska meteorite came out?

1084
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,380
After bouncing around inside the planet for a while

1085
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:23,780
The Tunguska meteorite was of course, as you know from reading your book of the subgenius, Dave

1086
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,780
Was a miniature black hole

1087
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,480
Shot by Dobbs, the young ten year old J.R. Bob Dobbs from his slingshot

1088
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,720
In a... completely by accident

1089
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,460
In a fit of rage?

1090
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,500
No, he didn't even know he was doing it

1091
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,320
It was just, you know, I mean he picked up a...

1092
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:44,200
Other kids might pick up a pebble or a cat skull for their slingshot

1093
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,860
Yeah, a cat skull, that makes a lot more sense

1094
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,140
But would Bob pick up a tiny black hole?

1095
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,780
A singularity?

1096
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,240
A singularity?

1097
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,340
The glowing essence of nothingness sucking in all that is not Bob

1098
00:53:55,340 --> 00:54:00,660
And that is what he shot into the Tunguska plains of Siberia

1099
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:06,440
And then past the event horizon the little thing itself went and then became like a bigger thing?

1100
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,980
And it bent, went into the earth!

1101
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,920
Bob's tiny black hole did and it bounced around like a cue ball on a pool table

1102
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,020
Back and forth until finally it exited at the place we now know as

1103
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,520
Dobbs Town!

1104
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,100
Dobbs Town, friends!

1105
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,400
It is where a thing of beauty is a joy for a while

1106
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,200
It's where you are better than you were in high school

1107
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,300
It's where you get all the pets you ever wanted

1108
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,400
It was never a colony of France

1109
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,020
It is where science and magic are the same things!

1110
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:43,140
It is the unfolding of miscalculations

1111
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:50,660
It is the dawning of the height, weight, hair and eye color of Aquarius

1112
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:56,020
It is the fizzling, crackling, ebony horizon for man's eyes

1113
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:00,860
It is the dissonant fifth vortex disrupting the harmonic convergence

1114
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,000
It's where the early worm gets away

1115
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,000
It's where the gravediggers sleep their shoes in the ocean

1116
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:09,820
It's where the night is in the middle of the night

1117
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,460
Dobbs Town!

1118
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,600
It's for when you're too lazy to kill yourself

1119
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,900
Dobbs Town!

1120
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,340
Where there are no lawyers!

1121
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,940
And where the government never tries to be helpful

1122
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,880
Dobbs Town, friends!

1123
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,180
It's where you can make your imaginary friends fight to the death

1124
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,620
Dobbs Town!

1125
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,700
It's between the dark and daylight

1126
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,220
When the night is beginning to lower

1127
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,920
It is where neither heredity nor environment matters

1128
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:47,940
It is where the lamb and the lion lay down and have sex together, friends!

1129
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,900
You cannot think now

1130
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,040
You can only follow and listen

1131
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,600
It is proof that hell is full

1132
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,780
And the dead walk the earth

1133
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,880
The fabric is one thing

1134
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,300
Like yourself

1135
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:08,580
One thread that leads to thousands of other threads

1136
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,160
And the

1137
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:29,020
That is our caustic solution for you as members of this solemn group gathered together squandered and quashed and pushed under heavy stone so that you may not know the truth that we speak and yet here we are speaking it to you

1138
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:34,820
Dobbs Town is not a place where a man or woman dwells but a place in the heart

1139
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,840
As big as that mighty elephant yoke

1140
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,800
And twice as tasty as all the trees that you could imagine

1141
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,840
Now imagination is not a place you want to stay

1142
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:51,720
It's not a place you want to bring the kids, grandma, ride the ferris wheel with

1143
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,360
It's not the kind of place you want to leave for a better home

1144
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:59,280
It's a place you visit over and over again

1145
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:05,560
With your pants on, your pants off, and your heart ripped right out hanging from your chest

1146
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,600
Dobbs Town

1147
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,200
Where Bob comes home

1148
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,260
After an easy day's work

1149
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,240
And where you can come home too, friends

1150
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,420
Where you'll be home

1151
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,140
Where you'll finally realize why

1152
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,540
Why

1153
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,020
Why

1154
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:36,080
And why you can find out more about beautiful Dobbs Town when you join the Church of the Subgenius

1155
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,820
The world's only subgenius!

1156
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:43,140
The world's only first true last final one true religion

1157
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,800
Because it admits it is full of crap

1158
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,840
It is the only one that's not full of crap!

1159
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:55,520
And I know it's coming each time I can tell it

1160
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,520
You tell it

1161
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,820
Ha ha!

1162
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:58,580
Go!

1163
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:04,880
It's where Enio Morricone was delivered of his

1164
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,540
Luscious voices

1165
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,720
Inspiration for this music in the background

1166
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,880
Huge, huge mandibles

1167
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,340
Large, large, fresh, gamy legs

1168
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:19,380
And now the matador Dobbs steps out before the enraged triceratops dinosaur

1169
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:24,560
Flashing his red Dobbs-headed cape in front of the maddened beast

1170
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:29,000
The furious creature stomps its feet and paws at the ground

1171
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,580
Dobbs grins, he smokes, the creature charges!

1172
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,700
Dobbs whips out his pipe and gives it a little conk on the nogginous

1173
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:37,700


1174
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,100
It runs by and after that

1175
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:45,300
It sits and pants like a little puppydog

1176
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,300
Get hysterical

1177
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,800
Bob! Bob! Bob!

1178
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,060
Bobhead!

1179
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:56,860
Get hysterical

1180
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,000
Bob bob bobhead

1181
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Bob bob bob bob bob

1182
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,480
Bob bob bob bob

1183
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:02,940
Bob bob bob bob bob

1184
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:03,380
Bob head

1185
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,640
Bob!

1186
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,360
Bob!

1187
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:05,880
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1188
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,520
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1189
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,080
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1190
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:10,120
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1191
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,680
Don't let yourself get hysterical, Bobhead.

1192
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,620
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1193
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:13,740
Bobhead.

1194
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,480
Bobhead.

1195
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,660
Uh-oh.

1196
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,400
Well, goodbye now.

1197
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,700
Stop it.

1198
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:26,180
And I say, as long as you're alive,

1199
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:30,600
shout, make noise, or whatever,

1200
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,700
because we're your kids.

1201
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,320
Praise Bob.

1202
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,500
You shut up like hell.
