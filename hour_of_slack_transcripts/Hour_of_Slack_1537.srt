1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
I come from Thebes, and the women of Thebes are warm-blooded, passionate, and we know what we want.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:10,740
What?

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,580
The Soap Genius!

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,220
Powerful!

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,860
Soap Genius!

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,680
Bob!

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,520
Bob!

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,140
Bob!

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,100
Bob!

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,380
The secret is obvious.

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,240
Bob!

12
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:21,680
Bob!

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,020
Bob!

14
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,440
Bob!

15
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:22,580
Bob!

16
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,220
There are Bobbies to my left, there are Bobbies to my right, there are Bobbies versus Bobbies

17
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,800
and they refuse to fight.

18
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,180
Yeah!

19
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:31,960
Hey!

20
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,080
You've heard the phrase, you know, uh, you know, oh man, yeah, he looked like he got

21
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,200
beat with the ugly stick.

22
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,560
Alright, or uh, yeah, no man, I've thoroughly been beaten with the tired stick.

23
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,620
Alright?

24
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,680
Yeah, well, uh, I've got an approach to mental health here.

25
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,740
Unless I've been getting hit, oh, I've got a little better at it.

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:17,020
Okay, so I of all the people in the studio today, uh, we were stopping by the guy that

27
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,020


28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,580
So, uh, we started and it just sort of pretty easy, man, morene here, more goofy fun.

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,500
So, red slip Saturday evening.

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:22,500


31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,960
What's up, Harry?

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,080
What's up, Catalina?

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,080


34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,840
It's so amazing, the three of us Friday night together, eating lunch together in Taer ANDA.

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,200
Wow!

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,000
Everywhere I go it seems exceedingly easy to find

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,300
Some poor old fool who's miserable and imprisoned in his own mind

38
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,220
And it's always kind of pissed me off because there's no excuse

39
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,680
I've had it developed and tested a hell of a treatment for the blues

40
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,640
Every now and then I meet some sad self that I'd like to beat

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,100
With a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,760
It came to me within a dream, one cold and restless night

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,040
Ten thousand souls in a deep dark hole and I possessed the light

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,900
And one by one they climbed on up a parade of misery

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,480
I had this big stick and each one I hit fell laughing to their knees

46
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:24,740
Ha!

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,080
My purpose here was suddenly clear I'd rock the earth spreading cheer

48
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,560
With a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,060
And when I woke it dawned on me the stick was already mine

50
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,100
I got it at a yard sale about a mile down fifty-nine

51
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,300
And it must have been the stick that day when I smacked poor old Vince

52
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,460
He cracked a smile and said,

53
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,260
I'm not the first in a while but happy ever since

54
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,920
Hey Vince!

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,460
Come on up!

56
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,940
He used to be a mopey kid but that'll change when he got hit

57
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,180
With a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick

58
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,280
Now a family man and a CEO Vince owes it all to just one blow

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,720
From the happy stick, from the happy stick, from the happy stick, from the happy stick

60
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,160
Hey!

61
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,340
You!

62
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,340
Come here!

63
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,240
Hey!

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,440


65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,440


66
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,440


67
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,440


68
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,440


69
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,440


70
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,440


71
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,580
Thank you.

72
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,120
Thank you.

73
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,880
With a happy stick, with a happy stick, with a happy stick.

74
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,120
Hey.

75
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,260
You.

76
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,300
Come here.

77
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,140
Thank you all very much.

78
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,140
That was great.

79
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,100
Yeah.

80
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,940
Try that at home.

81
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,740
Yeah, happy stick.

82
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,780
Just find a club and, you know, and try.

83
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,380
You know, if somebody's fucking miserable around you, just hit them.

84
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,460
Just hit them once.

85
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,440
See if it works.

86
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,200
And maybe it won't.

87
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,180
I can't promise, you know, the same results that I've had with the stick that I have.

88
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,860
But give it a try anyway.

89
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,600
Hit them with a happy stick.

90
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,600
That was St. Andrew the Impaled live at the X-Day Drill last July.

91
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,280
In fact, everything on this episode was recorded by Reverend Suds Bashaw or myself.

92
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,200
At the 18 X-Day Drill.

93
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,060
And best of all, each track is self-crediting.

94
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,480
Oh, here we go.

95
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,740
It's on now.

96
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,940
Who's the fool?

97
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,900
This is on.

98
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,960
The fool who follows him.

99
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,700
Because what?

100
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,740
Who's the fool?

101
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,920
Because this is Fid.

102
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,740
Julie.

103
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,120
Fid.

104
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,640
Julie.

105
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,920
Because what are y'all talking about?

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,840
What are y'all talking about?

107
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,540
Slack.

108
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,060
Some conspiracy member stole your Slack.

109
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,880
Some peep boy got on your nerves.

110
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,460
Hit you in that spot.

111
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,960
Well, let's talk about something important.

112
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,720
Okay.

113
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,580
Are they all here?

114
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,360
Yeah.

115
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:03,960
Are they all here?

116
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,220
Okay.

117
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,180
Well, I'm going anyway.

118
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,100
Let's talk about something important.

119
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,720
I know.

120
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,480
Okay?

121
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,240
All right.

122
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,160
Put that prop down.

123
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:15,660
What?

124
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,380
What?

125
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:16,700
No.

126
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,440
What?

127
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,000
You think I'm fucking with you?

128
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,020
Get off the stage.

129
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,240
What's wrong with you?

130
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,280
You think I'm fucking with you?

131
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,880
I am not.

132
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
I'm fucking with you.

133
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,120
What's your name?

134
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,240
Reverend Funny Name?

135
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,460
You call yourself a subgenius, you son of a bitch?

136
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,300
I am not fucking with you.

137
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,020
Because I'm here from Bob and Connie.

138
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,740
And I'm here on a mission of mercy.

139
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,260
Because the good news is, you're on a mission of mercy.

140
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,620
You're all fired.

141
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm going home.

142
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,260
What's going on?

143
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,320
What's the bad news?

144
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,440
I'm going home.

145
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,920
I'm going home.

146
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,300
Oh, wait.

147
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,520
That was the bad news, right?

148
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,340
My first answer.

149
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,460
But the even better news is that you've all got, all of you have got until July 5th,

150
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,900
1998 to get your job back starting tonight, starting with tonight's rant.

151
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,540
Oh.

152
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,820
Have I got your attention now?

153
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,320
Good.

154
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,640
Because we're adding a little something to this X Day sales contest.

155
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,120
First prize is a trip on the saucers.

156
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,880
You all know that.

157
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,060
Second prize, you all want to see second prize?

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,460
Second prize is a prop stick.

159
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,240
Third prize is you're fired.

160
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,280
I want third.

161
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,620
How do you get third prize?

162
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,500
You can't all get third prize.

163
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,440
I'll take second prize.

164
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,420
But what really, what really is your project?

165
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,440
I could use some steak knives.

166
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,280
What really though is your project?

167
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,260
I mean, we talk about it a lot, about hey, what's your conspiracy job?

168
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
You know, what do you do for a living?

169
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,440
What do you do to earn a living, earn a paycheck?

170
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,020
And although it might be different from person to person, you know, I work at the thermometer

171
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,520
factory, take some of the mercury out of the

172
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:22,520


173
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:22,520


174
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:22,520


175
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:22,520


176
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:22,520


177
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:22,520


178
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,900
mercury to make sure it's still poisonous to, you know, infants and whatnot.

179
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,480
You may work at the nine volt battery testing station where you put it on your tongue and

180
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,400
make sure it still gives you that zippity do da that we all expect from our, you know,

181
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,840
top of the line nine volt batteries.

182
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:44,900
But regardless of what your conspiracy job is, what we say it is, when we know what we're

183
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:52,500
talking about in parlance and colloquialism, we all have the same conspiracy job.

184
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:52,500


185
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,300
We're all employed by the conspiracy to be pink.

186
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,960
No!

187
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,620
No, no, no.

188
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,200
What do you mean pink?

189
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,180
I'm employed by Bob to be pink.

190
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,520
They do.

191
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,720
That's your real con job.

192
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:17,000
Whatever, whoever gives you the paycheck, okay, that is not your true conspiracy job.

193
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,380
Your true conspiracy job is to buy into the conspiracy.

194
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,480
Okay?

195
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,820
At large.

196
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,460
You're supposed to look at the context as opposed to the subtext.

197
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,920
You're supposed to look at those posters of the people so happy at their jobs.

198
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,380
Hey, come work here.

199
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,780
Look at the smile on my face.

200
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,020
And buy into it.

201
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,000
Really, we all have the same conspiracy job.

202
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,600
And we're all employed by them.

203
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,860
And we can't get away from it because we are all in enemy territory.

204
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,880
We don't want to think about it right now.

205
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,580
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

206
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,200
It's okay though, because you carry your kingdom with you.

207
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:13,340
The couple of dozen square centimeters underneath your feet that you take with you everywhere you go, that's your kingdom.

208
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:21,260
No matter how far you are behind conspiracy lines, no matter how deep in the depths of pinkness you may be,

209
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,040
you still carry that slack with you.

210
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,700
Everywhere you go.

211
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,520
Underfoot, above brain, subgenius.

212
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,020
Praise Bob.

213
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,260
Praise Bob.

214
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,720
Let me hear it.

215
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,360
Let me hear it.

216
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,080
Praise Bob!

217
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,480
Praise Bob!

218
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,420
Praise that face.

219
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,420
Just do whatever you want to that face.

220
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,180
He's going to kill Bob.

221
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,260
He'll kill Bob too.

222
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,320
You kill, you praise Bob right away, and then you kill Bob.

223
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,100
And you pee on his head.

224
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,080
You pee on his head.

225
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,360
I grabbed that and then look.

226
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:17,140
You know there's something that we can learn from our competitors as any good, strong salesmanly, salesmanly, shipley based organization should do.

227
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,620
Which is learn from their competitors.

228
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,460
And there's a guy named Judas you might be familiar with.

229
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,600
This guy, if it wasn't for him, you know, never sold Jesus out to the Romans,

230
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,120
there would never have been the salvation of all humanity.

231
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,860
But the important part is he made money in the process.

232
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:42,440
I mean, he got 30 shekels of silver propagating the entire salvation of all humanity.

233
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,260
What a bargain.

234
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,100
I think we can all learn from his example.

235
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,040
Take advantage of the guy that's already going to do it first.

236
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,100
I love you guys.

237
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,440
I love you.

238
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,660
I love you.

239
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,240
I love you.

240
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,140
I love you.

241
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:58,200
I love you.

242
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,240
Give up your jam solos in the name of Bob

243
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:41,100
Give up your jam solos in the name of Bob

244
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,020
I commend you!

245
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,840
Give up your jam solos in the name of Bob

246
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,340
All your bass are belongs to Bob

247
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,460
Give up your jam solos in the name of Bob

248
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,540
Give up your rockin' beats, funky beats, your sandals to Bob

249
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,560
Give up your spiffy riffs, give up your cool tricks to Bob

250
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,680
Give up your bass solo, Sarah, make it hard to Bob

251
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,640
Give up your rhythm and all of your livin' to Bob

252
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,400
It's what Bob wants

253
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,760
It's what Bob gets

254
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,380
Give up your rhythm and all of your clothing to Bob

255
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,460
Give up!

256
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,140
guitar solo

257
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,740
guitar solo

258
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,020
guitar solo

259
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,780
guitar solo

260
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,520
guitar solo

261
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,540
guitar solo

262
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,040
guitar solo

263
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,400
guitar solo

264
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,800
guitar solo

265
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,700
guitar solo

266
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,540
guitar solo

267
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:49,320
guitar solo

268
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,960
door slams

269
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,780
Just when you forgot to laugh

270
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,020
laughter

271
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,540
doorbell rings

272
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,680
hear Mitch screaming

273
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,540
Oh, you even got a mic on me?

274
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,760
Where is Princess Wee?

275
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,580
Oh, where, where, where is Princess Wee?

276
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,200
Oh, how many times have I asked that question in my life?

277
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,300
This is the soundcheck part of the gig.

278
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,740
We're still at the soundcheck part.

279
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,060
I'm just telling you, man, I'm telling you, this is still the soundcheck part.

280
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,620
We're not actually in the performance part of the gig yet.

281
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,660
That's not what my script says.

282
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,240
This is the soundcheck?

283
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,180
I thought we were almost finished recording the album.

284
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,080
You see the challenges that a doctor faces.

285
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,540
Does this work?

286
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,420
Check, check, check.

287
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,500
He remembers the lyrics.

288
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,700
Check, yeah, that was the...

289
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,940
The soundcheck, the check, the bounce check.

290
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,320
The bad check.

291
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,400
But I gotta get over there to my instrument.

292
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,340
So, is our first song numbered?

293
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,500
And where is Princess Wee?

294
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,740
Where is Princess Wee?

295
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:42,040
Where is Princess Wee?

296
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,000
Where is Princess Wee?

297
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,000
Where is Princess Wee?

298
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,500
A random dollar.

299
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,960
We got a random dollar.

300
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,600
Hey, there's something we haven't done yet.

301
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,620
It's the important part of Dr. Float Hand in every revival and every act's type.

302
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,880
And he just handed me this dollar and it reminds me of what we haven't done yet.

303
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,060
You're supposed to tuck that in your pants, I think.

304
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,400
No, no, that's that dildo thing.

305
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,620
Oh, Dr. Drummond, remember what you do with the dollar?

306
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:11,620


307
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:11,620


308
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,040
Oh, Dr. Drummond, remember what you do with the dollar?

309
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,100
At the start of a subgenius show?

310
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,980
You set it on fire!

311
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:27,780
Because, dear friends, as long as the smoke from this dollar bill rises up into heaven,

312
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,700
that means the exes can smell that money burning.

313
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,640
They know there's somebody down here on Earth worth saving.

314
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,760
Or else...

315
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,460
That's probably one of the best spent dollars all night.

316
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
I can probably still smoke.

317
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,580
I've never been a part of that.

318
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,440
Don't call the fire marshal, please.

319
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,040
I thought it was making a joke, but now that I think about it, we actually did that.

320
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,640
Dance to the doctors or die!

321
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,760
Dance to the doctors or die!

322
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,280
Dance to the doctors or die!

323
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,820
Dance to the doctors or die!

324
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,900
Dance

325
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,720
to the doctors or die!

326
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,000
They're dropping on fly

327
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,960
Dance to the Dr. Morty

328
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,140
Die, die, die, die

329
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,440
Dance to the Dr. Morty

330
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,900
Die, he's a favorite

331
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,840
What is he?

332
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,840
Dance to the Dr. Morty

333
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,500
Die

334
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,280
Dance to the Dr. Morty

335
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,960
Die, die, die

336
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,740
Dance to the Dr. Morty

337
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:07,500
Die, die, die, die

338
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,980
Die, die, die, die

339
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,680
Die, die, die, die

340
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,440
Dance to the Dr. Morty

341
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,080
Dance to the Dr. Morty

342
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,440
Dance to the Dr. Morty

343
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,720
Dance to the Dr. Morty

344
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,460
Thank you.

345
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,080
Thank you.

346
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,100
Thank you.

347
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,820
Thank you.

348
00:28:59,740 --> 00:28:59,980
Thank you.

349
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,920
Thank you.

350
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,800
Thank you.

351
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,620
Thank you.

352
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:06,200
just heard was first the Doctors for Wotan reunion last summer and then the original

353
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:13,120
version of the same song from 1980. And now, Priestess Pisces has some very important words

354
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:22,400
for newish subgeniuses. I could, you know, what I could do is I could, uh, I could tell some secrets.

355
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:29,980
Secrets. What? Tell what? Did you say secrets? Yeah, I could, uh, explain a little bit of secrets

356
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:37,360
to those who are brave enough to stick around. Secrets about who? Not really secrets about anyone

357
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:44,340
in particular per se, but one of the things that people get kind of confused about is, you know,

358
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:51,580
you'll have people who join the church, then some people get really butt hurt. And

359
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,380
I'm not sure if that's true. I'm not sure if that's true. I'm not sure if that's true. I'm not sure

360
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,520
A lot of people don't understand what gets you to that point. What, why are there some people who

361
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:03,920
get it and some people who don't? So let's talk about the fall of the Bobby and the making of

362
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:14,000
the kook. The Bobby in reality is just a pre-Overman, right? He's not yet fully developed.

363
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,240
Now, all Bobbies have the potential to become a true Overman or Uberfem.

364
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:29,040
What happens on the way? Well, that determines the final outcome. Many Bobbies have what is known

365
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:36,180
to the subgenius doctor community as studeo-tenarcanis, which, or eager puppy syndrome.

366
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,020
Symptoms of studeo-tenarcanis include annoying sycophancy, demands of attention,

367
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,260
and a tendency to think everything is the best idea ever. And it's usually not.

368
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,220
Okay. So, I'm going to go through a few of them. So, I'm going to go through a few of them. So,

369
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:57,200
to put it simply, eager puppies run about trying desperately to get established dogs to notice.

370
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,240
In truth, they are full of energy and they're really just looking for a spot in the group.

371
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,540
There are two ways that the subgenius community handles these eager puppies.

372
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,780
What is gentle training and coaxing? Where we take the eager puppy behavior,

373
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,100
we pull them aside and gently point out that,

374
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:30,120
as a matter of fact, good yes Cuando el chumel esicularly most

375
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,140
vulnerable, we help support it. If, as they say, we need my best voice because I might be a hungry melhor.

376
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,420
Have you heard the dog would have a perfect choices of integer?

377
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,020
Shout out to you權 there.

378
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,380
Wow. Oh, there it is. Nice dog, baby. There it is. Nice dog, there it is, right?

379
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,820
Watch out for it. Ask it. Can you? Take care of him right away.

380
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:50,220
As they move their figure, the dog will not follow them. That's why we feel like this boy with a flare on it.

381
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:58,320
like that puppy, all a Bobby wants is to be loved and accepted. Just like the puppy, the Bobby doesn't

382
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:06,840
mean to piss on the floor or break the vase. They're just not mature enough to understand it.

383
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:15,360
So what ends up happening is when approached with even the gentle coaxing or the full-fledged

384
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,280
aggressive stop being fucking annoying asshole type stuff, the Bobby comes to a crossroads.

385
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,420
A true good Bobby, one who was destined to become an overman at that point,

386
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,820
accepts the criticism in his heart and usually learns to sit down and shut the fuck up for a

387
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,100
little while, pay attention, and then in that process develops into an overman.

388
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:45,140
Let me digress for just a moment because there's another group outside of the

389
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,340
Eagerness Club that I'm going to talk about in a moment.

390
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:52,960
And that is the intelligent lurker. These are the guys who show up at X Day, we've never seen

391
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:59,740
them before, but they know everything about the Church of the Subgenius. They have read all of

392
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:06,460
the books. They listen to Hour of Slack on a weekly basis. They have gone through and watched

393
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:13,360
all the videos. They are often the archivist type of the Church of the Subgenius. Those actually are

394
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,320
the rare exception of the Church of the Subgenius. They are the ones who are the most intelligent

395
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,920
of a Bobby that skips growing stages and goes straight to overman.

396
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,480
Those are the, many of them are the emergentiles of the group. Some are, of course,

397
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,520
rewardians. Some of them end up hanging out in the background and deciding to run sound.

398
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,980
Some of them end up hanging out in the background and doing incredible art out of nowhere,

399
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:39,480
as Stang was speaking of before. However, what ends up happening with the other group,

400
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:45,300
those eager puppies, is the ones who can't take it.

401
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:55,180
The ones who can't take the general guidance or the ribbing, those become, unfortunately, the kook.

402
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:04,240
Because all I ever wanted was for Stang to acknowledge me because I like Bob, and Stang

403
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:13,380
didn't say hello to me, and then Sudds told me to shut up. And then mean old Pisces wouldn't

404
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,300
pay any attention to me. I would have been surprised if the Ch drone had gone by. I would have been

405
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,300


406
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:21,480
to me and and that's it i quit they're a bunch of they're a bunch of buttheads and and i hate

407
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,180
the church and you know what it's all wrong and and and it's just they suck they suck and i don't

408
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:35,860
like them and they're mean and they go on usenet or facebook and post a bunch of stuff about how

409
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:43,880
we all suck now i know there's some bobbies in the audience i can see you and i know this will

410
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:50,040
be on the radio later and i know they're listening the best guidance i can give you

411
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:56,940
bobbies the best guidance i can give any of you is take a moment and shut the fuck up

412
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:04,160
just a moment i'm not asking you to stay silent for the rest of your life i'm not asking you to

413
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,420
never participate in fact i'm saying the exact opposite i want you to participate i want you to

414
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,500
come up on stages like this one i want you to go to

415
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:13,860
devilement

416
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:21,680
i want you to be part of this organization but before you go up in a group of us

417
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,360
and put your foot in your mouth so far that shoelaces are coming out of your asshole

418
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:35,880
pause just for a moment pay attention and make sure utterly and completely sure

419
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,500
that you really get the fucking joke

420
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,620
now anyway

421
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:49,220
this is evolution control committee specifically trademark g if you're not familiar with him

422
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,260

423
00:37:53,260 --> 00:38:02,480
so without further ado prepare to be slightly mind fucked and uh just as a a slight introduction

424
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:10,580
here i uh this is something i have not done i've not performed any of this uh before uh that i'm

425
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,840
doing tonight um about 17 years ago i was a student at the university of california and i was a student

426
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,080
at the university of california and i was a student at the university of california and i was a student

427
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,080


428
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:21,580
the girlfriend i was with at the time told me you know pants are funny and she was right pants are

429
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:27,360
funny in like just about every context and after that i started djing under the name dj pants head

430
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,100
and i also had cheese and pants theater where i'd made a giant costume of a pair of pants

431
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:41,540
with the waistline above my head and that all began before any of that happened i had started

432
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,440
collecting samples

433
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:49,600
with the word pants. So spoken bits, musical bits, whatever. As long as pants

434
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,600
showed up in it somewhere, I was collecting it. And I've never done

435
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:00,680
anything with these samples. These have been used for nothing until tonight.

436
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,760
Tonight it's all about the pants. And that's my introduction.

437
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,680
Something about to lit me up like July. And with the millions in the pants, I couldn't help but cry.

438
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:26,180
We sick of these scams. Sick of these plans. Sick of this dance. Walked into his office, took the nine out my pants.

439
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:38,760
How about a pair of pink sidewinders and a bright orange pair of pants?

440
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,040
Then it's out into the night.

441
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:51,180
With their pride in their pants. With a slut that they tow underneath the street lamps.

442
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:59,500
Tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you.

443
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,220
I can barely fit my dick in my pants.

444
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,360
Went flashing on down to the swimming pool.

445
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:13,840
Give me a kiss.

446
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,840
I gave them critters a citation.

447
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,780
By the time we arrived it was too damn late. Them critters had all had their pants down.

448
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,440
Them dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-dog- dog-dog-dog-dog- dog-dog-dog-dog- dog.

449
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Don't think that you're charming. The fact that your arm is now around my neck.

450
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,000
Who got you in my pants. I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget.

451
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,420
Kewit!

452
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
Duh duh duh.

453
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,980
Heart pain

454
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,320
Heart pain

455
00:40:53,140 --> 00:41:10,960
We blasted Glasgow

456
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,800
Invaded France

457
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,700
I saw the Sweden

458
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,740
Shut down our pants

459
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,300
Are you still mad

460
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,140
I wore the pants

461
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,380
Most of the time

462
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,660
Knew you'd be a vision in white

463
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,520
Had to get your pants untied

464
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,020
Say, who wears the pants in your family anyhow?

465
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,480
Excuse me?

466
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,020
Don't make pants out of my skin!

467
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,160
Hey everybody, I'm taking off my pants!

468
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,840
The rolling hills are soothing

469
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,740
The wind isn't

470
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,620
I think my pants are falling down

471
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
Doesn't really trouble me here though

472
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,780
Eat my pants!

473
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,520
I'm a pants, pants, pants!

474
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,500
Saw the songs of the plaid bartenders

475
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,460
Western unions of the country westerns

476
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,600
Silver Fox is looking for romance

477
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,140
In the chain-smoked Kansas flash dance

478
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,240
Ass pants name

479
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:38,620
Whoops

480
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,500
Ray Ray

481
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,500
Ray Ray

482
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,060
Well, a beer won't get mad

483
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,240
If you come home real late

484
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,460
Or make you put pants on to eat

485
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,300
Wanna try a new kind?

486
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,660
Go ahead, it won't mind

487
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,480
Cause a beer doesn't care if you cheat

488
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,120
Ray Ray

489
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,420
Ray Ray

490
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,820
Raise the curtain

491
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,200
Lower the boom

492
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,360
I can't seem to find a pair of pants that rhymes

493
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,780
Maybe it's a pair of pants that rhymes

494
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,280
Sounds unorthodox

495
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,820
But you might do well by thinking like

496
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,600
A box

497
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,540
Why can't I get just one kiss?

498
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,260
Why can't I get just one kiss?

499
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,660
There'd be some things I wouldn't miss

500
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,560
But look at your pants and I need a kiss

501
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,140
Say

502
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:42,760
And they'll say I'm naive as well!

503
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:42,800
There's no way you can baby over a P twice

504
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,500
A lie is a big deal

505
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,980
I'm too low for that

506
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:50,860
So if I don't have a baseball bat

507
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,880
Well, I gotta go

508
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,880
Oh, hey, Thomas

509
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,200
O'Clay

510
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,720
What do you do when you use your video?

511
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,080
Non-وفhit

512
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,100
Oh, yeah

513
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,100


514
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,900
Oh, you don't want to hurt a person

515
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:07,900


516
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:07,900


517
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:07,900


518
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:07,900


519
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:07,900


520
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:07,900


521
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,480
Hey me

522
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:08,620
Those classics

523
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:08,960
Thoughts

524
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:08,960


525
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:08,960


526
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,940
Are you hungover?

527
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,760
Quite a bit

528
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:12,760


529
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:12,760


530
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:12,760


531
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:12,760


532
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,520
One

533
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,620
Arty farty

534
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,680
You'll never fool your auntie

535
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,660
Who knew you when you picked your nose and wet your pants

536
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,000
How did she know when she did that

537
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,560
One day in the canyon, no pants on her quim

538
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,060
A rattlesnake saw her and flung himself in

539
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:37,520
Charlotte the harlot gave the cowboys the frights

540
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,960
The only vagina that rattles and bites

541
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,340
This is Precious Roy, and I'm in the mood for pants

542
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,000
This is the big one, all right

543
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,600
This is Mr. Scary Pants

544
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,180
You do like to jump, but who would have thought you'd jump into somebody's pants

545
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,540
Not so fast, happy pants

546
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,280
Restaurant's on the other end

547
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,000
You can't shoot your pants there

548
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,400
Skip the goodbyes, where are my pants?

549
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:05,800
Luella

550
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,760
Luella

551
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,280
Luella

552
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:10,940
Luella

553
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,120
Luella

554
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,900
Ripped her zebra pants in the polo lounge

555
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:20,940
And Errol Flynn was not let in cause he was coming down

556
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:26,120
So he sits and lets the curve in take him

557
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,320
A gentle please will leave his pants in disarray

558
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,040
Cheek, cheek, cheek, cheek, cheek, cheek, cheek

559
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,440
In bed for once a day

560
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,940
I had a fun day

561
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,560
and grip on my pants.

562
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:47,460
Then I had me a girl from France

563
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,700
Just wanted to get in her pants.

564
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,960
We go to college, eat Christmas dance

565
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,260
We don't wear bras and we don't wear pants

566
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,420
We like to give the freshmen a chance

567
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,680
We are from Campus Hall

568
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,420
We're from the top of the class

569
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,940
We're from the top of the class

570
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,680
We're from the top of the class

571
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,440
Johnny had a habit

572
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,480
Didn't stand a chance

573
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,820
Walked right up behind him

574
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,580
Shot him in the pants

575
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,940
Johnny!

576
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,080
Little General

577
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,920
Napoleon

578
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,540
Son of France

579
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,640
Tried to conquer

580
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,340
The world but lost his pants

581
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,220
Made defeat

582
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,540
On a park track

583
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,280
That's when the

584
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,460
Someday

585
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,060
You'll be able to walk

586
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:08,920
Someday

587
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,760
You'll be able to talk

588
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,000
No more diapers

589
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,280
You will wear pants

590
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,540
You'll be able to sing

591
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,180
What? What? What? Where's my pants?

592
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,620
I know you wanna be grown up

593
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,680
So I brought you your very own pair of grown-upers pants

594
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,460
Do you like to try them on?

595
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,560
Don't stop now

596
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,600
You need some pants to go with that outfit

597
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,100
Yeah

598
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,940
Why'd you take his pants off, Sharon?

599
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,220
Why'd you take his pants off?

600
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,880
For $750, according to the World Book

601
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,940
What is the main reason your dog pants?

602
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,180
Because he can't talk dirty

603
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,060
Ha ha ha

604
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:00,420
She spins and pulls her pants down

605
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,120
The cold air holds her like a thief

606
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,800
She might even smoke no cigarettes

607
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,320
Ah

608
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,540
Play my guitar like Dickie

609
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:11,160
But

610
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,440
Get in Miss Shania's pants

611
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,020
I don't think I gotta check ass on his

612
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:20,380
Ass

613
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:20,920
Down

614
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,320
Down

615
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:21,820
Down

616
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,440
Down

617
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:22,860
Down

618
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,120
Down

619
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,100
Down

620
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,280
Last night she dressed me up in hip-hop pants

621
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,580
So

622
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,220
The fadgy style that rides below your ass

623
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,020
Crouch

624
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:38,020


625
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:39,140
Out

626
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:40,220
Out

627
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,380
Out

628
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,440
Out

629
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,120
Out

630
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,300
Out

631
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:45,700
Out

632
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,000
Out

633
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,200
Out

634
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:46,660
Out

635
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:46,880
Out

636
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:46,880


637
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:46,880


638
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:46,900
Out

639
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,420
Out

640
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:47,420


641
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:47,820
Out

642
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:47,820


643
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:47,860
Out

644
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:47,860


645
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:47,860


646
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:47,880
Out

647
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:47,880


648
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:47,880


649
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:58,740
Out Out Out Out

650
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,960
Dah

651
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,100
Not

652
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:03,500
It's

653
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,100
It's

654
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:05,620
Uh

655
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:05,860
My

656
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,060
My

657
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,600
Touch

658
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:10,620
Of

659
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,060
girl

660
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:11,580
I

661
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:11,840
Have

662
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,780
No

663
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:12,900
Grain

664
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,500
To

665
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:13,520
Go

666
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,640
Oh

667
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,100
rete

668
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,880
流

669
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,880
Be

670
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:25,880
Though he's a fool, he wets in his pants, and he falls off a stool.

671
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,780
He falls off a stool.

672
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,720
Knew you'd be a vision in white.

673
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,520
How'd you get your pants so tight?

674
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,800
How'd you get your pants so tight?

675
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:40,500
How'd you get your pants so tight?

676
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:45,200
Now my friends say to me, Eddie, Eddie what do you think of the new double knits?

677
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,360
Eddie, what do you think of the new double knits?

678
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,340
And I tell them, I'll tell you something frankly my friends,

679
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,620
when the new double knits first came out, I was not impressed.

680
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,840
But as you can see, these pants I'm wearing are double knit,

681
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,520
they stretch in all the right places.

682
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,360
Oh, that number scared the pants off me.

683
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,680
Are you sure you didn't just forget to put them on again?

684
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,540
And I suppose this is the on button.

685
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,180
No, that's the button that makes Beaker's pants fall off.

686
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:15,560
That's the button that makes Beaker's pants explode.

687
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,400
Beaker, go change your pants.

688
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,440
Come along.

689
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,440
This is what I was wearing.

690
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,520
Well, then they had to put it on your pants.

691
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,960
So I put it on my pants.

692
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:25,920
What's the deal?

693
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,940
They say, look here, smarty pants.

694
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,200
And let us not forget, look here, smarty pants is what democracy is all about.

695
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,620
The pants, the ones in the pants.

696
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,260
Pull up the pants.

697
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,920
This room costs $2,000 a month.

698
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,180
You can believe it, man, it's true.

699
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,760
Somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants.

700
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,880
The hip parade, great train, the saving hawkers dance.

701
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:10,700
Pedal pushers, duck tails hanging, begging your pants.

702
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,700
So here I am in the alleyway.

703
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,060
I want a cash in my pants.

704
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,680
I get paid by a ten.

705
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,200
Now we go steady to the pictures.

706
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,260
I always get chocolate stains on my pants.

707
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,880
Here comes the blind commissioner.

708
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,960
They've got him in a trance.

709
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,360
And he's tied to the tightrope walker.

710
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,860
The other is in his pants.

711
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,080
We were sitting in the backseat just shooting the breeze.

712
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,060
With our hair up in curlers and our pants to our knees.

713
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,200
Dead man with no eyes, won't you look at me tonight.

714
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,680
Tell me why I look good.

715
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,480
With my pants all so tight.

716
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:24,380
She'll, she'll beg, she'll, she'll, she'll, she'll beg you to come to the country dance.

717
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,840
You ride 20 miles for the big romance.

718
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,240
She shows up in her brother's pants.

719
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,340
What did you expect?

720
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,420
The New York Times should grow a beard and take off its pants.

721
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,800
We must act now.

722
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,840
It's so bad.

723
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,380
They're so poor that some families have to share a single pair of pants.

724
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,620
Who gets the wearer?

725
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,680
If you have jump, you wear the pants.

726
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,640
Oh, wow.

727
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,460
Pants that are too tight or a skin tight shirt may look like a million.

728
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,300
But you'll bowl like two cents.

729
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,460
Did you see what I just saw?

730
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:56,940
What?

731
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,740
Oh, pull your pants up, Roddy.

732
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,960
Don't you want to live forever?

733
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,060
Not if drawstring pants come back into style.

734
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,300
My pants feel like they're shrinking too.

735
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,400
Uh-huh.

736
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:08,840
Uh-huh.

737
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,460
Pants around the ankles?

738
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,100
Oh, that's great.

739
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:37,060
I think it's meant to do as much as we need to, though.

740
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:37,060


741
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,180
It's great for the You 어려y withِ

742
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,180


743
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,180


744
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,180


745
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,180


746
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,180


747
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,180


748
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,360
relies too much on the

749
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:44,360


750
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:44,360


751
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:51,720
to be nosy but I went into a bank to get some bail for a-rab and all the boys back in the tank

752
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:56,360
they asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants

753
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:04,420
my my the time to fly when it's in another pair of pants

754
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:25,280
I remember Ruby she always dressed in red

755
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:33,740
wearing skin-tight pants lord and how she could dance with a rag wrapped around her head

756
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:42,580
I've never must a crease in your blue search pants

757
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,920
I never

758
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,380
get the chance this is a fine romance

759
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,660
you're talking about me

760
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,320
and your pants are up

761
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:59,840
we're re-

762
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,700
we're re-

763
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:08,180
hello my name is Nigel and I don't have any pants on

764
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,780
sitting in the garden in the shade

765
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,700
sitting in the garden

766
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,420
with my little puppy

767
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,760
I named him

768
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,660
I named him

769
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,340
King Tester

770
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,240
we're at we're at we're at we're at we're at

771
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:22,920
we're at strangling

772
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,260
you can't angle us

773
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,260
I know you're listening

774
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,100
I caught you pissing your pants

775
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,040
you're scared of pissing us

776
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,280
the crowd is missing us

777
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:30,880
we're on a

778
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,520
when the rabbit of chaos is pursued by the ferret of disorder through the fields of anarchy

779
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,360
it is time to hang your pants on the hook of darkness

780
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,500
did your mother tell you anything else today?

781
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,940
did she give you any instructions today?

782
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,520
yeah

783
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,460
what'd she tell you?

784
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,560
to keep my pants pulled up

785
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,600
it's Elzar again

786
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,020
oh my god I'm so excited I wish I could wet my pants

787
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,240
take it easy big boy

788
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,520
I still want to know how many female pants you've been in before you've got me to take mine off

789
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,500
but that was merely prelude of what was to come

790
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,460
then in 1997 even more complex formations occurred

791
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,000
and I'm not wearing any pants right now

792
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,060
if I knew you were coming I would have put on pants

793
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,540
buy my potato powered pants

794
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,080
what?

795
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,140
suckers

796
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,960
no I'll do a dance I'll knock your pants off

797
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,360
what store are we going to go to?

798
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:20,700
Marvin's

799
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,320
where then?

800
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,600
what are we going to buy at the store?

801
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:24,500
pants

802
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,080
pants?

803
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,420
for mommy?

804
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,040
yeah

805
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,740
and that's it thank you very much

806
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:40,220
that felt much quicker than I actually thought it was going to be I had no idea how long it was I didn't even time it out

807
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,920
anyway that's it that's all I got

808
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:42,500
an amazing gym

809
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,020
thank you very much

810
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,000
xenopathy

811
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:07,200
the error Sudoku

812
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,060
so many homophobic faces

813
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:12,060


814
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:12,060


815
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:15,100
And everything is fixed and you can't change it.

816
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,920
So yeah, it's about pants.

817
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,820
What did I say?

818
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,900
Down with pants.

819
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,720
Up with skirt.

820
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,500
Sideways with pants.

821
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,820
You're wearing too many pants.

822
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,120
Take off your pants.

823
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,780
Without no pants on.

824
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,080
Oh, that's our motto.

825
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,280
Well, some of us, not me exactly.

826
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:49,060
The music tonight was mostly Six-Fisted Tales of Connie,

843
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:22,540
Praise Bob!

844
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,620
I went out to the package liquor store the other day

845
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,540
to get some rolling papers

846
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,200
to make some prop sticks.

847
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,160
And I say to the guy,

848
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,120
Hey, do you have any Topps rolling paper?

849
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,760
And he says, no, we don't have any Topps rolling paper.

850
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,140
And I said, do you have any zigzag rolling papers?

851
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,480
And he says, no, we don't have any zigzag rolling papers.

852
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,780
And I said, do you have any Mackwoods,

853
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:58,280
cigars that I can break into some sort of disgusting clip

854
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,020
and have to force myself to choke down?

855
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,340
And he says, no, we're out of those too.

856
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,920
And I said, what do you have?

857
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,620
What do you have?

858
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,080


859
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,980
So this guy, he looks at me and he says,

860
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:15,660
I've got for you one gigantic piece of aluminum foil.

861
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,140
And what you can do is fashion it into a bowl

862
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,920
and I'll crude fashion around a pencil

863
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:26,160
like some sort of retarded five-year-old in the craft museum.

864
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,620
And you can deject yourself

865
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:32,220
to using human garbage to smoke your drugs.

866
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:37,960
I say to the guy,

867
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,260
I'm not a guy.

868
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,640
So you're just going to give this to me?

869
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,620
And he said, no, we're going to charge you $5.

870
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:58,100
So I gave him $5 and I went home to smoke my prop.

871
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,180
And is it any coincidence at all?

872
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:06,900
Is it any coincidence at all that the name tag of the man

873
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,620
behind the counter at the back is Liquor Star?

874
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,480

01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:34,040


900
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,240
didn't have any Subgenius's to make their

901
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,500
own situations worse.

902
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,440
But some of you still have jobs.

903
