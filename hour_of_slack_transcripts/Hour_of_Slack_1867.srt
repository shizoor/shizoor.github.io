1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello, boys! I'm back!

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:16,000
Knock, knock.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,700
Say hello to my little friend!

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,740
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,420
And I'm all out of bubblegum.

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,260
Oh, shit.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,440
Ah!

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,540
We had a conversation about our teenage daughters earlier.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,620
What kind of creativity will they have?

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,260
Kind of being shaped in this biased experience in their formative years.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,380
And so, mentally, in what ways?

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:55,040
This time period, or because we're all kind of, you know, the creativity is pent up a little bit.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,760
Guided by the belief that the arts of humanity is essential to the well-being of diverse,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,160
and democratic society.

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,120
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,640
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,880
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,300
The subgenius of...

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,720
...Slack.

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,760
Ah, yes, that's better, huh?

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,000
Welcome to...

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,980
...the Elko Coffee.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,580
Is this your family?

24
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,820
Ah, I like to go to the lake, and...

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,840
...and the north and the east will be introduced.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,440
And people will have a number in their hands, in their forehead.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,740
Someone with a lot of energy.

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,800
Okay, your code number once more?

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,520
237.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,700
237, and you're calling from Dallas.

31
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,000
Sorry.

32
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:48,660
Okay, thank you.

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,580
Thank you.

34
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,220
Now you're online.

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,940
And without it, you can starve.

36
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,440
Yes, my code number is 237.

37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,020
This is not a rerun.

38
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,820
It's a...

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,800
...something a bit different.

40
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:09,100
The very careful speaking entity in Cleveland calling itself Sheridan sent 50 minutes of great collage and bulldada,

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,680
some of it from our oldest Media Barrage albums,

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,960
with some kind of happiness theme.

43
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,520
But some of it hurt my ear bones,

44
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,360
which, like my lumbar vertebrae, are already beat up enough.

45
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,160
And I don't want what happened to me, dear listener, to happen to you,

46
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,980
because then your listening powers might be as terribly weakened as mine.

47
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:37,040
So, into the holes from which I surgically amputated the dangerous parts of Sheridan's corpus,

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,120
I injected foreign matter also from Cleveland, but from long ago,

49
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,500
such as excerpts of Chaz Smith's ESO Swamp Radio show on WCSB Cleveland,

50
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,580
on which lonesome cowboy Dave and I had blabber rights.

51
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,140
But now this.

52
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,500
From Reverend Bleepo Abernethy, great radio producer,

53
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,960
and now a moving picture of the world,

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,180
and now the world's greatest actor in Hollywood,

55
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,520
known as Bill Cates.

56
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,780
This is one he did a long time ago in the future.

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,620
Has this ever happened to you?

58
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,020
Why, I should have been there, Ted. It was great.

59
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,220
There was free booze, great music, one of the best parties I ever went to.

60
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,760
Where were you that night?

61
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,900
Oh, I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

62
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,740
I guess I should have gone, huh?

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,300
Didn't you feel stupid?

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,120
Didn't you wish you could go back to that night, that party?

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,740
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that.

66
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,680
Well, I'm going to do the very thing, introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

67
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,600
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time,

68
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,440
slow time,

69
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,020
and make time run backwards.

70
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,020
But most importantly, you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

71
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,260
How, you may ask?

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,560
Well, just ask this man here, an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

73
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,780
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck. Blango.

74
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,860
My dog was dead. Was I sad till I met Bob.

75
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,520
Bob showed me how I could go back, get the registration number for the car,

76
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,940
do a slip job on the brakes,

77
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,340
and wouldn't you know it, that truck went off into a ditch and burst into flames

78
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,400
just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger.

79
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,140
Ain't that right, fella?

80
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,640
Yes, just imagine the horrible things that could be undone tomorrow

81
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,580
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.

82
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,680
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.

83
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,900
Just right, Bob's School of Time Control, the universe.

84
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,280
Bob's School of Time Control, Division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

85
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,100
What bothers me is that they're marketing a video game now called Prince of Persia,

86
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,540
The Sands of Time, where one of the features they're advertising is time control.

87
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,420
Really?

88
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,000
Wow. That sounds like a libel story.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,740
Well, it took a conspiracy long enough to rip it off, didn't it?

90
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,180
Yeah, well, if your character dies, you can wind time back and...

91
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,040
Cool. And you are the character, of course.

92
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,660
So we're learning how to control time in our own existence just by focusing on a video game.

93
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,960
In the old days, it was very realistic.

94
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,520
It is.

95
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,520
They're giving away our real time control, and they're selling us fake time control in a damn video game.

96
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,240
Wait a minute. Okay, so you can somehow wind time back by doing things or something like that? Is that it?

97
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,600
I think there's like a, you know, some button or control key.

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,660
Yeah, gotta find a secret room or something like that.

99
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,100
It's a control key, and then you go, you know, and you're back where you started.

100
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,560
You know, in the old days, that used to be called...

101
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:20,960
Einstein lied.

102
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,380
He lied.

103
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,500
Start over.

104
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,420
Yeah, well, I mean...

105
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:24,780
Play again.

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,720
I think he can...

107
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,720
It was called play again in the old days.

108
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,180
Well, that's what it's going to be now in the new world.

109
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,160
That's what it's going to be.

110
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,460
People are going to be asking to replay their lives and so forth, and they'll be able to do it because of the implants.

111
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,620
Yeah.

112
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,460
When you get to the end, is there a play again button?

113
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,600
Well, you gotta make sure you have a record apparatus implanted in the back of your skull.

114
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,100
And once you do, at the moment of your leaving of this body, you get a number of previews.

115
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,580
And also, when you get previews from the next things coming up and trailers from what you already did called This Life...

116
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,700
Unfortunately, many people...

117
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,060
Many people forget to punch the erase tab.

118
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,880
Well, some of them are...

119
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,020
They have an erase tab on their brain and they go ahead and blank it all out.

120
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,680
And then overdub it.

121
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,540
There's the next life.

122
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,000
Right.

123
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,900
And then it comatose...

124
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,620
It overdubs right over it.

125
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:05,900
Yeah.

126
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,720
You've got two lives going on at the same time.

127
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,380
Well, that's...

128
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,520
That's why institutions are filled up with these people in chairs, you know, wrapped to the chair and duct tape.

129
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,940
Well, I think that's what I want to do as far as being a criminal is concerned, is I want to overdub my past existence.

130
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,500
And I would like the police state to come in and overdub me and for my crimes.

131
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,900
That makes sense, doesn't it?

132
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,240
I just want better background.

133
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,860
That's so whimsical.

134
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,740
According to Bob, the problem with time control is that to travel, like, for instance, into the past, you have to...

135
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,960
It's like a slingshot.

136
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:41,140
You have to go way into the future, stretch it real hard until you're way out in the future, then let go and it'll shoot you.

137
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,980
It'll slingshot you.

138
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,380
Well, see, way, way, you got it.

139
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,120
There's not a quantity that we can quantify.

140
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,080
There's another way to do that.

141
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,100
Way, way.

142
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,920
What's way, way?

143
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,460
Wait, there's another way to do that.

144
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,860
The Silver Surfer proved that.

145
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,020
To go so fast and far forward that you break through the wall of inertia.

146
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,680
Yeah.

147
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,740
And then pop back to the beginning of time or wherever you want to dump off.

148
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,300
Well, after you break through the wall of inertia, you're just in the wall of momentum yourself.

149
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,600
I mean, I hate to sound so realistic, but...

150
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,080
I don't know.

151
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,200
I don't know.

152
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,500
Once inertia flops by...

153
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,300
I'm not a scientist.

154
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,340
...you become part of Mr. Momentum, who's a much harder guy to stop.

155
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,560
He's like one of those weasels.

156
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,660
You can't get a grip on it.

157
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,880
You can't wrap your teeth around it.

158
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,680
You can't smoke it.

159
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
You can't wear it to bed.

160
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,180
What do I know?

161
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,840
You can't buy it a little glass of wine or give it a little sleeping pill.

162
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,700
But it'll sure knock you upside the head.

163
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,340
Oh, yeah.

164
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:24,920
Yeah.

165
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:25,920
You know, it's...

166
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,880
Knock your head.

167
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,820
...more than smoking banana.

168
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,180
One cannot see or touch the wind, and yet the wind has great power.

169
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,780
The wind may caress you while you know it not exists.

170
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,060
I mean, you know what I'm saying.

171
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,860
I think I should just drop my drawers and let it run right up me right now.

172
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,760
We're not interfacing with the elements.

173
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,640
That's another illusion.

174
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,580
The Zervins ain't got nothing to do with it.

175
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:48,700


176
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,160
As long as it's in color, that's all I ask.

177
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,260
Well, it's colored.

178
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,220
It has many different colors, but it's not in color.

179
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,440
We didn't even see in 3D when I was a kid.

180
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,160
It was all flat.

181
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,960
Everything was flat?

182
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,200
Yeah, but as long as it's in color, man, that's virtual enough for me.

183
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,820
Did you ever turn the paper on its side?

184
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,060
Kids don't know that.

185
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,940
They don't remember that.

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,520
They think...

187
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,020
Right.

188
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, you know, before color TV...

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They don't know about the old age.

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,780
...there was black and white TV, but before black and white TV, there was only a two-dimensional

191
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,260
world, a flatland world.

192
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,500
Right.

193
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,900
All your grandparents grew up in flatland world.

194
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,580
And to get from point A, you had to get a three-dimensional being to write A on a piece

195
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:21,740
of paper...

196
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,180
It was only since color TV was invented that the world...

197
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,120
...and put a point there and write B and draw a line.

198
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,680
Yeah, it was only since color TV was invented that the world became three-dimensional.

199
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,700
In fact...

200
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:35,460
Well, only when we started breeding the people with the two eyes that you could even tell

201
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:35,920
the difference.

202
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,820
That was a good idea, two instead of one.

203
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,320
And you know, like, just think of like Goliath and some of these guys that had the one poked

204
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,540
out.

205
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,120
Just think if you're in a battle, you could have...

206
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,420
You can't take that crap for granted.

207
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,380
They think it's always been, oh yeah, we've always had two eyes.

208
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,020
Oh, we've been gifted with two eyes.

209
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,280
It's always been stereo.

210
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,000
That Bob or some other character didn't bestow them on us.

211
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,780
Of course he did.

212
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,380
Or else how would they have come into existence, you know?

213
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,580
I remember when you were billed for color.

214
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,100
I remember when you were billed for having an extra eyeball.

215
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,720
Remember that?

216
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,120
What happened to the Cyclopses?

217
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,440
The Cyclopses went the way of Mother West when they just passed into the flying, into

218
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,320
the air and never returned.

219
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,520
People think that's like a myth.

220
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,740
There really was Cyclopses.

221
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,120
The Betamax, the Macintosh.

222
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,600
Yep.

223
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,520
The American Empire.

224
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,760
Yes, the revolution.

225
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,120
Uncle Sam, all those other extinct creatures.

226
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,740
The flat Cyclops revolution.

227
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,360
Freedom.

228
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,380
Happiness.

229
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,020
3D freedom.

230
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,300
Other dying things.

231
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,560
Liberty in 4D.

232
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:29,960
So to speak.

233
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,140
Oh, screw that.

234
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,600
Let's just come up with some formulaic pop idols and sell them as rebellion.

235
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,880
Why don't we come up with...

236
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,420
I tried, man.

237
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,500
What, the little bobble hedge?

238
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,140
I'm lucky if I can get, you know, five or ten CDs sold at a D-Bible.

239
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,540
I tried, man.

240
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,300
I like the Jesus Christ bobble hedge, the Reverend Ivan Stang bobble hedge.

241
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,760
These are...

242
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,540
Well, then obviously you don't have the right pop icon.

243
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,720
Idol.

244
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,100
Well, no, I guess we should use the pink bob that Dr. Legume designed for Mojo.

245
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,760
Then it would be as rich as Mojo.

246
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,680
No, you still...

247
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,060
You gotta like, waitly that way.

248
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,640
I think Jackson should be martyred and sanctified and consecrated in the blood of the Lamb.

249
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:08,740
Look what works.

250
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,260
Britney and Christina.

251
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,300
That's what sells.

252
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,580
If we could just find the perfect teat.

253
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,140
The perfect one tit and nipple.

254
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,540
It lasts a week, though.

255
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,720
The perfect tit flavor only lasts one week and then it begins to sag and then there's

256
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,220
a new tit flavor.

257
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,720
Well, but then you got your money and you can...

258
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,400
What you are laundering is the munchkin or the little people flavor of the entire universe.

259
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,800
You're not really copulating with what's great, with what's superb and what's essential and

260
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,440
quintessential.

261
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,380
You know what I'm saying?

262
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,880
Yeah, you're putting down bubble gum bands, man.

263
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,400
You gotta get sexy in your gorilla...

264
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,020
No, I'm not.

265
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,480
You're a snob.

266
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,560
Are you putting down stupid dribble pop...

267
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,120
No, I'm not.

268
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,100
I'm not snotting.

269
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,600
There's no mucus in my thought.

270
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,060
This is what I am saying is that they should take at least one tithing's worth and give

271
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,200
not only to Bob, but to Bob's birthday.

272
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,720
And to his minions and his denizens as well.

273
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,960
Why give it to a fat or skinny like Michael Jackson?

274
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,280
That waif, that strange waif.

275
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,400
Look at all the money he's accumulated so he could engage in perversions.

276
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,620
We engage in simple perversions.

277
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,060
We don't need that much money, but we need some.

278
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,480
Dave.

279
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,140
His skin doesn't have any color either.

280
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,020
I know, man.

281
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,960
That's some sick-ass shit right there.

282
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,140
His songs are just a little more hummable than yours.

283
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,040
I don't know about that.

284
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,040
Look at how he hums with that weird triangle and all that.

285
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,800
That's a nostril area.

286
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,480
Except for beat me to a pulpit.

287
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,360
That's very...

288
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,400
I wake up with that going on in my head sometimes.

289
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,340
Yeah, that's a happy little ditty, but...

290
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,680
We got decent recordings of the band the other night, by the way.

291
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,320
That's incredible.

292
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,320
Even your band.

293
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,040
How strange.

294
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,320
Yeah, it was weird.

295
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,440
On the c Bravo.

296
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,680
Uh––.

297
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,380
So-

298
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:07,960

hanes

302
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,900
Well, I keep on thinking about you

303
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,000
Sister golden hair, she flies

304
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,060
I feel people together

305
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,300
Don't you listen to what the man says

306
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,500
One of these nights

307
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,480
I'm telling the night

308
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,960
Baby, baby, falling in love

309
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,240
With that light

310
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,700
Like a rhinestone cowboy

311
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,560
Take things over

312
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,920
Sorry things ain't what they used to be

313
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,200
I like love

314
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,200
What you want, you make me want

315
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,160
I like it

316
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,980
I like it

317
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,440
I like it

318
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,260
Let's do it again

319
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,360
Let's do it again

320
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,140
Let's do it again

321
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,040
Let's do it again

322
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,740
Let's do it again

323
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:23,800
Let's do it again

324
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,140
Hello, and we're back

325
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,220
And you're listening to

326
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
WWYN

327
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,320
And what's with you now

328
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,300
PM Radio

329
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,220
Brought to you this week

330
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:49,520
from Mama Slithroat's dungeon, conveniently located below the outhouse in back of Uncle Warthog's farm.

331
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,960
Come on, come all, you'll be flush with joy.

332
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:09,120
We've just heard Upchuck and the Swallow Charlies with Pancake Vomit from their new album, Told Ya So.

333
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:17,940
Before that, we had Big Wheel and the Hubcats with Don't Tread on Me.

334
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:25,520
We started out that set with a record that skipped, so I don't give up.

335
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,020
Oh, it was.

336
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:41,920
Now this business news from Shauna Zurbuck, filling in for Grinnell the Pumper, who is currently folding chairs in a church basement.

337
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,700
The report from Wall Street is people are doing stuff.

338
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,820
However, Wall Street is closed this morning,

339
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,940
as they didn't feel like doing anything.

340
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
They're going to make Yellum today.

341
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:04,700
An investigation into the business practices of funeral parlors was dropped today,

342
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:12,140
as Slabum Inc. presented their latest irrefutably true ad slogan.

343
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,640
It's why we go to funerals, to make sure they're dead.

344
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,700
Back to you, Bunny.

345
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,040
That's Raphael.

346
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,300
And that's Shauna.

347
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,580
One Easter Egg Party.

348
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,000
Haunt.

349
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,240
And you'll never live it down, folks.

350
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:48,160
Support for this Hour of WWYN is brought to you by Yoder Table Legs Cow Powdered Amish Neon Conglomerates.

351
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,240
It's utterly ridiculous.

352
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,940
And be sure to tune in tonight for another episode of the Yoder Table Legs Cow Powdered Amish Neon Conglomerates.

353
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:55,940


354
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:03,000
We're going to have a new interview and live performance with hairy skin in the shavers.

355
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,980
Lead singer Cleaver Hornschnitz is back on the bottle, folks.

356
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:17,000
So we should expect better than that God-fearing crap that tanked them in the charts.

357
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,000
Sobriety sucks, people.

358
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,380
So don't try it if you're not prepared for failure.

359
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,080
And abject poverty.

360
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,380
Well, that's it for now, folks.

361
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:55,180
I'm Raphael Schlickerhutz, waiting for the checks to bounce and checks to bounce and checks to bounce and checks to bounce and this last weather forecast from that crazy manicure lady at the tattoo shop.

362
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,280
Stay inside, people.

363
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,980
Just stay inside.

364
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:12,580
Friends, get your ears vaccinated every week that you listen in because otherwise, well, there ain't no telling what happens.

365
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,040
Well, the lines are lighting up.

366
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,520
All we have to do is accuse you of not understanding a damn thing.

367
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,380
And then they call it, you know.

368
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,280
I get it.

369
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,160
This is some sort of a joke.

370
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,960
This is some sort of takeoff on religion, isn't it?

371
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,820
Oh, you go ahead and believe that.

372
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:42,320
As you go down, deeper and deeper into your mire of ignorance, ignorance and foolishness.

373
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:05,780
I call the plane got off in Spain, pulled it out and did the same damn thing.

374
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,980
I claim all these garbage dumps.

375
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
And that moment.

376
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,140
That's.

377
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,140


378
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,140


379
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,140


380
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,140


381
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,140


382
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,140


383
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,140


384
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,140


385
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,220
I'm going to be slowing down of time.

386
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,360
That is what savoring is all about.

387
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,780
And that is sort of the antithesis of habituation.

388
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,980
Hey, how you do your work is up to you.

389
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,020
What we give you is clear objectives.

390
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,020
And then you figure out how to get your work done.

391
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,500
If you want to be more productive, you know, go buy a Cal Newport book or something like that.

392
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,020
But it's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.

393
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,400
You have it backwards.

394
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,460
It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.

395
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,760
Enjoy life like Bob.

396
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,900
Just enough faith for you to believe on your own what is real and what isn't.

397
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,660
It feels like playing a game.

398
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,260
Where somebody cheated, but there's nobody else there.

399
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,720
And you're not even playing.

400
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,060
I came to the realization that I had every symptom of burnout.

401
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,200
Every single one.

402
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,140
And I assure you that's not a good place to be.

403
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:51,900
There is a massive industry of happiness studies, self-help manuals, helping people to overcome all sorts of unhappinesses.

404
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,740
Trying to help people find meaning in their lives.

405
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,820
Trying to help people make better decisions about their lives.

406
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,740
You know, I feel like there's always people who feel like no people have to be punished.

407
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,660
Because they've messed up.

408
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,140
Right?

409
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,900
This is the rule.

410
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,200
If you can't follow the rule, you have to be punished.

411
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,140
And money is the way we punish people.

412
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,880
So, in this kind of world, I think that we have to be more productive.

413
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:21,880


414
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,680
In this kind of world, a good life is a balanced and a virtuous life.

415
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,540
Not a single-minded pursuit of income.

416
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,580
This is a joke, but it is a very serious joke.

417
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,220
We are the first non-tax exempt church around.

418
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,800
We're the first industrial church.

419
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:42,800
We want to be proud to pay our taxes and let people know we're not doing a skate-buy on the cops thing.

420
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,320
We don't want to fool anybody.

421
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,960
Isn't it a fact, really, that you've invented this whole thing?

422
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,480
That you've thought up all these little gimmicks.

423
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,060
And you're taking advantage of a lot of ignorant people by getting money out of them.

424
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,280
People who believe in you and your silly preaching.

425
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:03,300
See, we're not saying anything that none of these other modern-day, new-age religious cults aren't saying.

426
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,160
The only thing is, we're not denying it that we're in it for the money.

427
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,620
And we're not disputing any of your belief systems, because we believe in just about every one of them anyway.

428
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,080
Sir, we absolutely believe in everything.

429
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,620
We believe in it wholeheartedly.

430
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,440
Hey, how you do your work is up to you.

431
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,460
What we give you is up to you.

432
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,440
We give you as clear objectives.

433
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,440
It was by far the biggest private employer in the region.

434
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,160
And many would say, the best employer, too.

435
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,360
We're going to see a moment of punctuated equilibrium.

436
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,700
Where one day we're all doing email and Slack all day.

437
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,300
Four years later, that's going to be considered incredibly old-fashioned.

438
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,960
Boy, right on the head!

439
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,160
No! No!

440
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,740
That's not the whole story.

441
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:49,060
And making it all about suffering and oppression, also not the whole story.

442
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,320
Everything is complicated.

443
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,860
Everything has nuances.

444
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,320
So, we should advocate for changes when we can.

445
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,740
But we shouldn't assume we know what those changes should be without listening to people's stories.

446
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:12,760
When I pulled that bubble wrap out, her eyes opened wide.

447
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,660
A bubble-popping junkie.

448
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,600
She reached out.

449
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,800
And popped one.

450
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,220
And stopped.

451
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,300
Knowing I needed it for packing material.

452
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,920
A week later, I shipped her a box of bubble wrap.

453
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,940
With a note.

454
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,580
Enclosed, you will find two sizes of bubble wrap.

455
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,180
One size is for your hands.

456
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,880
While the other is better suited for your feet.

457
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,240
Choose wisely.

458
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,520
As you must top them all.

459
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:19,000
The next day, she had to travel out of state for a business trip.

460
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:28,400
Two days later, while she was gone, burglars broke into her house.

461
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:36,280
Upon entering the front door, they were immediately startled.

462
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:45,700
She had laid the thin bubble wrap underneath the welcome mat.

463
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,980
Hearing pops.

464
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,220
They froze in their tracks.

465
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,500
They thought they were being shot at.

466
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,160
It was quiet.

467
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,140
There was no alarm sounding.

468
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,980
No people rushed to confront them.

469
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:18,360
It could be a home alone movie moment.

470
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,020
They smiled.

471
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,000
Shrugged.

472
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,180
And continued stomping on the welcome mat.

473
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,740
Gotta pop them all.

474
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,580
By the time the police arrived.

475
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,140
Due to the silent alarm.

476
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,940
The cops thought they were being shot at.

477
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,520
They riddled the place with bullets.

478
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,060
Kicked in the door.

479
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,400
Walked on it as they entered.

480
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,020
Popping even more bubbles.

481
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,700
And began firing into the house.

482
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,940
Anything that wobbles after a bullet grazes it is a target.

483
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:30,940
All personal collections, photos, letters, bills, and entire worth of the house are dispatched with deadly force.

484
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,300
After demolition and rebuilding of a new house.

485
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,300
Including a room special for the police.

486
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:45,300


487
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:45,300


488
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:51,440
The house was naturally designated to be filled with assorted types of bubble wrap.

489
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,520
She was heard to say.

490
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,940
You just don't know your limitations.

491
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,900
You just had to pop them all.

492
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,300
Didn't you?

493
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,880
And then.

494
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,520
The poorly built roof caved in on her.

495
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
și

496
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:15,520


497
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,480
și

498
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,980
Și

499

500
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
ì

501
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:50,660
Gratitude, the dark side of gratitude is that it could lead to complacency, to be like,

502
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,060
oh, everything's wonderful.

503
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,200
And they are deeply happy.

504
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,260
They radiate happiness.

505
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,520
They're surprised.

506
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:02,680
Why?

507
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,320
Because they're grateful.

508
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,140
So it is not happiness that makes us grateful.

509
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,980
It's gratefulness that makes us happy.

510
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,780
If you think it's happiness that makes you grateful, think again.

511
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,540
It's gratefulness that makes you happy.

512
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,080
And let's think about each and say, how do we actually want to execute this process in

513
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,000
a way that doesn't require us to keep chucking channels?

514
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:33,500
That is not really what's going on inside, but I love that there is the radiating.

515
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:33,780
Okay.

516
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:34,300


517
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,600
And I said, this is, I knew it was going to work to my competitors.

518
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,140
Still didn't think it was going to work.

519
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,960
They thought, but I could feel, I was close to it.

520
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,960
I could feel the walls were shaking and they were going to fall down.

521
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,040
I can build up enough pressure on it.

522
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,720
Like an earthquake.

523
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,560
It was gonna, it was gonna, it was gonna work.

524
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,920
And we're not disputing any of your belief systems or cause we believe in just about

525
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,600
every one of them anyway, sir.

526
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,200
I can't believe the weird thing.

527
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,100
That people get in.

528
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,600
And there he adds and start teaching.

529
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,740
J R Bob Dobbs.

530
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,440
He says, I don't want everyone to be able to reach me directly.

531
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,180
This is crazy.

532
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,900
The way this is set up, we have to change who can report to who I need to drastically

533
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,540
cut down the number of people who have direct access to me.

534
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,840
And, uh, yeah, it was when you.

535
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:31,000
Nonprofit freedom from religion foundation works to educate the public on matters

536
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,700
relating to non-theism and to promote the.

537
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,220
Constitutional principle of separation between church and state.

538
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,160
The foundation is the nation's largest association of free thinkers, atheists,

539
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:49,080
agnostics, and skeptics with over 16,230 members since 1978, the foundation has acted

540
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,580
on countless violations of the separation of state and church and has taken in one many

541
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,640
complaints and lawsuits to state church.

542
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,460
Entanglements.

543
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,680
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

544
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,120
Hey, babe.

545
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

546
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,120
I'm sorry.

547
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,420
I'm sorry.

548
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,060
I'm sorry.

549
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:06,680
I'm sorry.

550
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,260
I'm sorry.

551
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,420
Shut the fuck up.

552
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,720
Set processes for how decisions are made.

553
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,420
You would come in, you had to prepare a document in advance.

554
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,420
You'd present your case.

555
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,160
You'd present your answer.

556
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,940
He'd give you the feedback.

557
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,620
You'd move out.

558
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:23,040
He streamlined all of this so that he could focus on one thing at a time, make the best

559
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,360
possible decision or be as useful as possible and then move on to the next.

560
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,720
Hi, boss.

561
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,100
I was just starting to put.

562
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,620
I know.

563
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,280
I know.

564
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,560
Uh, is this the right room for an argument?

565
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,900
Is this the right room for an argument?

566
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,180
Is this the right room for an argument?

567
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,560
That's where you see it really add up and really impact people's lives.

568
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,100
And especially the people we want to serve most.

569
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,140
That's where you see it really add up and really impact people's lives.

570
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,000
Don't just want your credit cards.

571
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,900
We want your library cards, your voter registration.

572
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,600
Give it all up now.

573
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,220
Give it all up now.

574
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,940
Give it all up now.

575
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,000
Give it all up now.

576
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:09,460
They don't realize that you have just integrated them in a process that just got rid of seven or eight back and forth email messages.

577
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,660
Repeat process after process after process.

578
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:18,620
How can I, given what I can control, reduce the amount of back and forth messaging required to get this process done?

579
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:26,420
And just by pushing a button, I can have a hundred things going at once.

580
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,540
It's just amazing.

581
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,780
And we get all these people calling in going, this is the first time I ever listened to this show.

582
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,440
Oh, what are you guys doing?

583
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,560
What kind of a show is this?

584
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,540
Well, dear friends, this is the show about Bob.

585
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,280
Yes, the first mate of our great ship.

586
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,180
And you know what they mean by first mate.

587
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,720
First mate Bob and the crew of the good ship Grace.

588
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,320
The voices from the harbor called Haven of Rest.

589
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,760
I'm told that everybody likes it.

590
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,240
The story.

591
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,020
They like the story of Bob.

592
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,240
And life is a story.

593
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:17,920
Because Bob, Bob was a story, you know, but at the same time, he was a reality more hideous than anything you could imagine in your wildest dreams.

594
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,360
Those two wild and crazy guys.

595
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,940
Tonight's the night I should be talking about a flu.

596
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,760
The subject of word assertion.

597
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,440
Association football.

598
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,560
This is a technique out of living, much used in the practice makes perfect off psychoanalysis.

599
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,120
Dr and brother and one that has occupied piper.

600
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,700
The majority rule of my attention squad by the right number 123 for the last five years.

601
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,220
To the memory.

602
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:52,460
It is quite remarkable way for Charlie how much the Miller Sun is so called while you're out word Association immigrants.

603
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,900
Problems influences the manner from heaven in which we sleep it.

604
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,220
Karen Timorous Beasties.

605
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,560
All Americans speak the famous Explorer and the really well that is surprising partner in.

606
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:02,760
Crime.

607
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:02,760


608
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,100
Is that a lot in his wife, the last feeding time.

609
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:12,800
We may be CD effectively quite unaware of the fact or fiction section of the Watford Public Library that we are even doing.

610
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,800
It is a far, far better thing that I do now.

611
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,420
Then now, then what's going on with Christine Barra, the famous hearty part of the lettuce now praise famous mental homes for loonies like me.

612
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:31,420
So on the button, my contention causing all my headaches is that unless we take into account of Monte Cristo in our thinking George the fifth, this phenomenon, the other hand, we shall not be able to.

613
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,480
Satisfactor fiction.

614
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,880
Section of the Watford Public Library again early to understand retention when I'm talking to you and stop laughing about human nature.

615
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:44,920
Man's psychological makeup some story the wife will believe and hence the very meaning of life itself is passed to kick him in the balls on road.

616
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,720
And I saw this in the gratitude project.

617
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:58,820
I would wake up in a very my default mode of grumpiness and and I would force myself to call people and thank them and it was often very awkward.

618
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,960
How happy are you right now?

619
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,340
How happy were you yesterday?

620
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:09,880
And there we can see that whether what day of the week it is impacts our happiness levels and people are happier.

621
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:20,800
No big surprise on the weekend that they are on Monday mornings ready for a religion that considers you equal, not in your soul or in heaven, but in that most sacred of all parts of your body, your wallet.

622
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,240
Us too.

623
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,400
Now, just a minute, lady.

624
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,200
I won't haggle.

625
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,400
I'll double the amount of money.

626
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,740
Well, I don't know what money.

627
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,360
Did you say money?

628
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,400
I remember this stuff.

629
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,100
What do we do?

630
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,540
What do we sign?

631
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,260
Give me those contracts.

632
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,320


633
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,260
Grateful living, that is the thing.

634
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,400
And how can we live gratefully?

635
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:49,720
By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment, as we say.

636
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,640
It's a gift.

637
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,380
You haven't earned it.

638
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,820
You haven't brought it about in any way.

639
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,360
You have no way of assuring that there will be another moment given to you.

640
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,300
And yet that's the moment.

641
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:02,300


642
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,440
That's the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us.

643
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,560
This moment with all the opportunity that it contains.

644
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,180
If we didn't have this present moment, we wouldn't have any opportunity to do anything

645
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,640
or experience anything.

646
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,940
And this moment is a gift.

647
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,920
It's a given moment, as we say.

648
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,520
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

649
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,220
Because I am whatever you say.

650
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,300
Oh, God.

651
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,300


652
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,300


653
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,300


654
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,300


655
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,300


656
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,300


657
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,300


658
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,140
That's it.

659
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,260
This is not a rerun.

660
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,700
I eventually convinced her to sit down with producer Latif Nasser and sort of just walk

661
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,800
us through the tape.

662
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,480
Go for it.

663
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,280
You're in control there with the space bar.

664
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:45,920
All right.

665
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,440
Yeah, I'm on.

666
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,600
God, I hope they don't play this for a long, long time.

667
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,480
He's saying this guy's an outbred.

668
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,040
He was...

669
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,620
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

670
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:00,220
J.R. Bob Dobbs was on the number one list of frauds and phonies for Time Magazine.

671
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,600
And I didn't know who he was.

672
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,000
Exactly.

673
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,300
And I didn't know who he was.

674
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,300


675
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,300


676
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,300


677
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,300


678
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,300


679
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,300


680
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,940
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is the creator of the Church of the Subgenius.

681
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,980
This guy, the Reverend Ivan Stang, is one of their...

682
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,460
Disciples.

683
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,460
Disciples.

684
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,240
Disciples.

685
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,140
Yeah.

686
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,920
All right.

687
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,580
You know, it's funny.

688
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,300
I don't think Jesus had a disciple named Dopey.

689
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,300
Oh, but you are so wrong, pink boy.

690
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,800
Jesus did in fact have three disciples named Dopey.

691
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,120
And one named Grumpy.

692
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,960
And one named Sneezy.

693
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,600
Yes, and here comes Grumpy.

694
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,720
And he's well-named, too.

695
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,280
And he's well-named, too.

696
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,040
You'd better watch out for Sneezy or everything you know will be blown away.

697
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,720
Sharla, pink boy.

698
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,440
The most frozen and fearful of all the little dwarves, Sharla.

699
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:55,020
Sharla can hardly keep it together to do his whatever it is he or she is doing.

700
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,480
What is it doing?

701
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,500
It's making a chain of flowers.

702
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,100
No, it's meditating.

703
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:01,800
Look, it's...

704
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,780
It's not making...

705
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,440
It's making the flowers, but it's meditating on higher purple.

706
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,480
The burning elastic thing.

707
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,460
What is that?

708
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,040
It's thinking of new ways to kill.

709
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:18,020
Ah, it's one of the spandex used to kill its victims.

710
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,160
Slack takes many forms, my friend.

711
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,520
Killing is one.

712
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,240
Dying is yet another for some who pray to die.

713
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,820
Others pray to kill.

714
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,520
Which are you, my friend?

715
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,800
I'm a ghost.

716
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,280
I'm a ghost.

717
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:32,280


718
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:39,400
Why don't you come into the bosom of Bap and of mortality who is actually a better bosom.

719
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,140
Yes, the EEE bosom.

720
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:50,360
And learn all that you can know about the forbidden sciences and about occult incantations

721
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,720
that can lead you to mastery and power over your own wallet and your own personal guardian

722
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,240
demon.

723
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,640
Hey, I am the One, or the Signet.

724
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,420
Three times.

725
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,260
Take the Alabasta pepperoni and put it nearless.

726
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,280
your nostrils. The third

727
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,420
nostril will expand and the magic

728
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,120
door is not so

729
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,160
magic anymore.

730
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,840
Power and slack, I tell you.

731
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,380
Beyond your wildest imaginings.

732
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,120
Slug, it is called by my

733
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,360
people. We have yearned

734
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,360
for slack for so many years.

735
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,980
The name we use is

736
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,160
slug. It sounds

737
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,280
crude and simple to your people, I am

738
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,180
sure, but one of these

739
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,780
days we will master slug

740
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,220
and climb from the slimy pits

741
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,880
near the river where we have been

742
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,180
banged.

743
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,540
And we shall...

744
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,060
What are we going to do? Look, there is the slack.

745
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,120
Now, climbing up the banks

746
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,040
of the slimy river.

747
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,260
Yes, it's...

748
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,720
Hulking and looming.

749
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,300
Why?

750
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,800
Look at that slack.

751
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,560
Hulking.

752
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,720
It's majestically

753
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,600
looming.

754
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,660
It's the grandest and greatest...

755
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,120
No, no, no, no, stay back!

756
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,900
No, no!

757
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,260
Ah!

758
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,160
I didn't want to know

759
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,000
an evil book.

760
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,120
I don't know after all.

761
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,240
Even a man who is pure at heart

762
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,740
and

763
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,320
thinks he has his slack.

764
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,540
Yet if he eats

765
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,360
those pickles too soon,

766
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,560
we'll have pimples on his back.

767
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

768
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,700
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

769
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

770
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,140
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

771
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,520
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

772
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,240
I think that was on their brains, don't they?

773
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,180
Pimples and milk.

774
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,660
Oh, good old pimples and milk.

775
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,440
Pimples and milk.

776
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,000
And pimples.

777
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,420
Mmm.

778
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,700
Mmm.

779
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,780
Ho, ho, ho!

780
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:21,840
Hmm!

781
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,120
Quiet, numbskulls!

782
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,600
I'm broadcasting!

783
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,140
Ah!

784
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,920
Do you know?

785
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,080
Oh, where you going to?

786
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,080
I'm going to sell

787
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,500
the X11.

788
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:35,600
Say what?

789
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,660
Fifty ways to leave your lover.

790
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,420
Oh, yeah!

791
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,860
I'm just a little machine.

792
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,160
And I won't work for nobody but you.

793
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,400
Oh, what a night!

794
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,200
Late December, back in 63.

795
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,980
Shake it up, shake it down.

796
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,040
Who are you?

797
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,280
Me?

798
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,600
You?

799
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,400
I'm a disco major.

800
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,380
Just let your love go home.

801
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,260
Like a mountain stream.

802
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:10,900
Welcome back to that same old place that you laugh about.

803
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,800
Forget these bars.

804
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,700
Now just put it down.

805
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:16,440


806
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,700
You'd think that people wouldn't have had enough of silly love songs.

807
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,920
And I want to get over.

808
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,080
Sweetest hangover.

809
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,600
Skyrocketing.

810
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:28,920
Fly!

811
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,660
And dream delight.

812
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,340
Let's just kiss and say goodbye.

813
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,780
You're the brain in my heart.

814
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,220
I want to be in your heart.

815
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,620
Say it again.

816
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,120
Shake your booty.

817
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,300
Shake your booty.

818
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,520
Play that fucking music, white boy.

819
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,140
I'm a disco major.

820
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,840
I'm a disco major.

821
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:58,840


822
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,920
Baby, I'm a disco major.

823
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,180
And you love me hard.

824
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,880
I like salsa.

825
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:06,880


826
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,620
Can we have a few more shots?

827
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,580
A unbelievable manager of sorts.

828
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,540
And a раст Democrat.

829
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:21,060
The good awakening of a newτοq rati!

830
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,840
Well, I wonder how .

831
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,080
We're ready...

832
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,880
In Bible's truth основe, damn girl needjミ subscribing been.

833
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,080
Love that Batman's doing good!

834
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,900
A nochar rather than your Duke's stupid.

835
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:28,900


836
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,580
I watched her.

837
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,520
Born between July.

838
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,400
I'm led by the light.

839
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,080
A new kid in town.

840
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,360
You're soft as an easy chair.

841
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,500
You're a rich girl.

842
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,240
And you're going too far.

843
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,140
But you know it don't matter anyway.

844
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,940
Watch that scene.

845
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,760
It's so easy.

846
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,700
Don't give up on us, baby.

847
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,900
Don't leave me to stay.

848
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,400
We're back.

849
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,220
And it's just too early.

850
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:02,140
And you've already missed all the good stuff.

851
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,820
You're listening to WWYN.

852
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,220
What's with you now, PM Radio?

853
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:19,700
We've just heard rat semen in the toilet, dwellers.

854
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,560
With courtesy flush.

855
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,960
Before that, we had Sheeta Gray.

856
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,700
And the forecast 500.

857
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
With puddles for poodles.

858
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:40,640
Ahead of that, we had Cavity Search.

859
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,980
With their sugar sweet.

860
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,660
We started out that last set with Last Box.

861
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,880
Doing their hit Quit Looking from the LP.

862
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,200
Lost and found.

863
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:06,040
Now this news from Grinelda Pumper.

864
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:14,560
The president continues to angrily send relief to grief-stricken victims

865
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,300
in between sips of mocha-frosted, halo-infused Kino horse

866
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,780
through a crazy straw.

867
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:28,140
Visits to the devastated area.

868
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:35,740
Are scheduled by people that don't wear earbuds walking through the flooded town square.

869
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,860
This is the news from WWYN.

870
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,460
Simple, contagious, and deliberately true.

871
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,700
I'm Grinelda Pumper.

872
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,360
Back to you, Bunny.

873
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,840
That's Raphael to you.

874
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,200
You.

875
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,200
You.

876
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,660
I swear.

877
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,940
One cross-dressing parade in your branded folks.

878
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,180
And now, this message from our sponsors.

879
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,760
Life doesn't let you slow down.

880
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,140
That's why you drink.

881
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,860
Often and earlier.

882
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,960
It's 8 AM.

883
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:27,700
It's 8 AM.

884
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,160
You'll get up at least a half hour.

885
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,060
Here.

886
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,920
Have one now.

887
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:47,000
And now, here's an excerpt from tonight's exclusive interview with a well-renowned scientist

888
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,200
that quit.

889
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:57,620
If you are the leading expert on that particular disease, why?

890
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,420
Is it still a disease?

891
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,120
Yes.

892
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:12,620
Well, we are currently awaiting funding to research just that aspect of our...

893
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:13,620
Uh...

894
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,640
What was the question again?

895
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:23,380
Now, here's Horace Lake with a look at the business news.

896
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,480
With the sex-hemp.

897
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:27,600


898
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:27,600


899
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:27,600


900
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:27,600


901
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:27,600


902
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,500
Well, Horace.

903
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:51,360
Well, Horace.

904
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:51,920
Nice big unexpected twist there today.

905
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:51,920


906
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,920
Is again, five pic anh thui e.

907
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:02,640
Uh, Planetárias might be wrong, but is today, congratulations,

908
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:02,640


909
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:12,220
Con'y rr bueno y Qu Merry Christmas a toda a que?

910
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,760
Thanks, Chester.

911
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,520
this last weather forecast

912
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,020
from that crazy manicure lady

913
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,140
at the tattoo shop.

914
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,120
Stay inside, people.

915
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,760
Just stay inside.

916
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,460
They need to be pushed into shape.

917
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,560
They need to be molded.

918
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,300
These children need to be molded

919
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,580
like Jesus' head.

920
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,620
Remember how they molded

921
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,660
to Jesus' head?

922
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,640
And how they took each little frond

923
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,320
of hair and put it on

924
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,420
and then they had a chin curl.

925
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,180
So when they did the final...

926
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,860
Speaking of Jesus' head,

927
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,920
has anybody seen that porno movie

928
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,460
about Jesus that's going around?

929
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,560
I mean, not to be disrespectful

930
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,680
or anything, but...

931
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,840
Where they're slapping the Lord?

932
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,420
You know, there are some people

933
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,020
who would want to go see a movie

934
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,180
where they beat up Jesus

935
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,480
for different reasons

936
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,000
than others might.

937
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,560
Some might want to identify

938
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,400
with their Lord,

939
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:15,460
but they're not going to.

940
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,560
I just want to hear him go,

941
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,880
ouch, ouch, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,

942
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,740
and stuff like that.

943
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,380
Yeah, some people just want to see him

944
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:20,760
get beat up.

945
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,300
It's the sound.

946
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,020
It's kind of like an audio thing for me.

947
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:23,560
I want to hear him go,

948
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,920
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

949
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,020
I'm sorry.

950
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,060
I'm not into that.

951
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:27,900
What?

952
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,700
Hearing him being put up.

953
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,400
I'm not into anybody

954
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,640
getting beaten up, okay?

955
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,520
I'm not into anything.

956
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:33,760
I mean...

957
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,980
I'm not into anything either.

958
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,320
Well, you look like you're trying.

959
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:36,980
I'm like out of it, totally.

960
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:37,440
You are.

961
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:37,580
Okay?

962
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,820
But you look like you're trying

963
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:39,720
extremely hard.

964
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,400
That is so nihilistic, man.

965
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,220
Well, nihilism,

966
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,880
this is where we're at now.

967
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,340
This is the lowering of the table

968
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,620
and the connecting of the floor.

969
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,160
We're in the same place.

970
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:48,900
Everybody...

971
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,580
Nihilism is...

972
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,600
rules the land now.

973
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,260
Well...

974
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,100
You're not going to find

975
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,860
a lot of optimism.

976
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,680
You're not going to find

977
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,220
a lot of creative exuberance

978
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:58,860
going on.

979
00:47:59,140 --> 00:47:59,580
No, man.

980
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,560
Nihilism rules.

981
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,500
No, nihilism rules.

982
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,060
I don't know.

983
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,120
I mean, within the nihilism part,

984
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,240
there's a lot of sick,

985
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,580
sick, sick depraved enthusiasm.

986
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,500
Well, it is a form of enthusiasm.

987
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,380
Enthusiasm for people

988
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:11,380


989
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:11,380


990
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:11,900
for torture.

991
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,600
The elongation of the tongue,

992
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,440
disconnection of the maxillary glands,

993
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,400
mispronunciation in vowels.

994
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,140
Making fun of Jesus,

995
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,840
such as these...

996
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,380
Of course, the subgeniuses,

997
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,800
when that movie came out,

998
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,720
had to come up with

999
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,340
their best one-line review

1000
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,580
of Mel Gibson's Passion.

1001
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,840
And among the wonderful

1002
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,520
one-line reviews we got

1003
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,460
was Jesus Christ Reanimator.

1004
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,360
I spit on your mouth.

1005
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,200
I spit on your empty grave.

1006
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,840
Who's afraid of Judas Iscariot?

1007
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,180
The Longest Day.

1008
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,720
The Great Escape.

1009
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,880
Merry Christmas, Mr. Christ.

1010
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,860
Rosemary's Messiah.

1011
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,980
Last Tango in Bethlehem.

1012
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,540
Well, this is one of my favorites.

1013
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,840
The Fool on the Hill.

1014
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,640
The Fool on the Hill.

1015
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,900
Apocalypse Later.

1016
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,340
Apocalypse Later.

1017
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,280
And what else?

1018
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,820
Oh, Mr. Sister had the best ones.

1019
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,260
No Weddings and a Funeral.

1020
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,900
This is, of course,

1021
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,040
Mel Gibson's The Passion.

1022
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,500
One-line reviews.

1023
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,860
The Unforgiven.

1024
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,500
Mr. Iscariot's Holiday.

1025
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,200
It's a Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad World.

1026
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,340
One of my favorites here.

1027
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,260
Lost in Translation.

1028
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,480
And The Ghost.

1029
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,200
I like The Fool on the Hill

1030
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,120
because it reminds me

1031
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,340
of the old school joke where...

1032
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,340
Oh, My Big Fat Roman Crucifixion.

1033
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,320
Lord of the...

1034
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:41,860
The Nails.

1035
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,420
The Silencing of the Lamb.

1036
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,180
And The Ghost.

1037
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,740
And Mrs. Magdalene.

1038
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,620
Oh, those don't sound like they required an awful lot of thought, dang.

1039
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,520
They absolutely do.

1040
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,040
Someone is contemplating...

1041
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,700
Stop!

1042
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,020
Enough is too much!

1043
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,720
Go on and sing her!

1044
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,340
About your moon and your June about a swinger!

1045
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,780
Go on and sing her!

1046
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,180
About a sky of blue or a T for two.

1047
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,840
Anything with a swing or two.

1048
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,440
And I love you, I love her too.

1049
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,820
I love her too.

1050
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:13,940
I love her too.

1051
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:14,140
Sing!

1052
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:21,460
If you don't want to boil your brains in the zombie business corridors of empty pinkness

1053
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,720
or grinding poverty.

1054
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:27,200
If you don't want to feel the meat cook off your bones in a nuclear oven that was once

1055
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:27,700
your hometown.

1056
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,400
You'd better drop your mental candy bars and step out under the blinding light of the sun

1057
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,040
and make witness to what you really are.

1058
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,940
So I'm on the fence nervously watching what's going to happen here.

1059
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,020
What happens if I push that button?

1060
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,740
In fact, we don't really know the secret of fire.

1061
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,300
We are relying on the pagans to start those.

1062
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,260
Oh!

1063
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:09,580
Oh!

1064
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:09,780
Oh!

1065
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,280
Oh!

1066
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,800
I'll make powder on them.

1067
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,100
Now leave it alone let's come out there.

1068
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,200
Lately what's going on here?

1069
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,580
Pick up that stuff and get to work.

1070
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,760
So help me, this child ass.

1071
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:17,420
Stop!

1072
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,360
Come back here you stupid little...

1073
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:23,560
You.

1074
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,680
I pay you.

1075
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,160
Do not do it.

1076
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:28,640
I won't.

1077
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,440
Come on.

1078
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,360
Perhaps the impact of the zombie in me.

1079
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,740
This man will smooth out the swamp through out the mountain of misery.

1080
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,740


1081
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,760
I will assist.

1082
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,360
I got a lot of dog food!

1083
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:41,880
Ah!

1084
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:42,700
Whoa!

1085
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,900
Ah!

1086
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,140
No!

1087
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,160
No!

1088
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:49,720
Ah!

1089
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,080
Ah!

1090
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:51,800
Ah!

1091
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:52,500
Ah!

1092
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:54,460
Ow!

1093
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:55,560
Ah!

1094
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,240
Woo hoo hoo hoo!

1095
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,460
Ha ha ha ha!

1096
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:02,160
Hey la, hey la, come on for a big bag!

1097
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,980
She is coming, better cut out on the double!

1098
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:14,020
She wore blue velvet, and everybody calls it the sugar shack!

1099
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,360
Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

1100
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,800
Oh, the city gone wild!

1101
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,180
I'm leaving now!

1102
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:23,700
I'll be you!

1103
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,520
Let me niggity-gitty-gitty-gutter my way,

1104
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,940
Just like that, oh dear, poor little dog!

1105
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,720
And there I've said,

1106
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,300
I'm leaving!

1107
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,720
I'm leaving!

1108
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,080
Not this record!

1109
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,060
Not this record!

1110
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,480
Not this record!

1111
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,660
I'll see that Mrs. Bixby hears this record,

1112
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,420
and I hope she'll hire you for her program.

1113
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,580
All we gotta do is knock them dead with your song, and we're in.

1114
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,780
Just be careful of that record!

1115
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,220
Nothing's gonna happen to it!

1116
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,260
Well, it might get broke!

1117
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,700
Not with me handling it!

1118
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,460
Just be careful!

1119
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:58,900
Shut up!

1120
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,880
With me handling a record, nothing...

1121
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,760
Look what you did, now we're cooked!

1122
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,160
No we ain't, look!

1123
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,260
Here's a lot of records!

1124
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,560
You're getting a half a brain in your skull now, huh?

1125
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,540
Now all together!

1126
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,860
Now all together!

1127
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,100
You know, I may not always be happy,

1128
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,920
but I'm sometimes trying to trick my mind

1129
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,420
and say, acting as if,

1130
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,820
what would a good person do?

1131
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,260
What would a compassionate person do?

1132
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,600
What would a happy person do?

1133
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,520
And trying to do those actions.

1134
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:52,780
Wow!

1135
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,120
Wow!

1136
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,140
Wow!

1137
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:01,060


1138
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:01,060


1139
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:01,480
Wow!

1140
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,180
Wow!

1141
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:02,880
Wow!

1142
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:02,940
Wow!

1143
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,520
Wow!

1144
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:03,520


1145
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,840
Wow!

1146
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,800
World Capt час

1147
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:12,800


1148
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,580
World!

1149
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:15,380
World!

1150
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:15,380


1151
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,920
Ha-ah!

1152
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,340
Ha-ah!

1153
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:19,640
Nae-ce!

1154
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,320
Nae-ce!

1155
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:20,660
Ha-ah!

1156
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:21,080
Ha-ah!

1157
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,540
Na-eh!

1158
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,560
Hu-hin!

1159
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,600
U-kun!

1160
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,080
If the sole function of language was to communicate,

1161
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,940
we'd have one language.

1162
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,060
We have more than one language,

1163
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,560
therefore we have more than a sole function.

1164
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,360
We are...

1165
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,460
Why must we always wait for future events?

1166
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,520
What would it mean to you

1167
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,200
to wait for now

1168
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,260
or wait for the

1169
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:11,720
past?

1170
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,420
Can you translate

1171
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,920
what those whales are saying?

1172
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,780
How much tax

1173
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,440
do I have to pay for this oil

1174
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,060
on my

1175
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,160
baleen,

1176
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:36,560
sir?

1177
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,880
Can I get

1178
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,960
a dentist to clean my

1179
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,840
baleens?

1180
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,060
Doctor?

1181
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,720
But I'll tell you what, friends.

1182
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,520
I believe in America.

1183
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,780
I believe America could be the greatest

1184
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,100
nation that has ever walked this earth.

1185
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,380
Yes, America,

1186
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,180
or, in scientific terms,

1187
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,680
Brontotherium Amerigo,

1188
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,840
was the largest land

1189
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,380
mammal known in the

1190
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:14,080
anals of history.

1191
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,600
Although technically not

1192
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,860
a carnivore,

1193
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,680
the great America was able to

1194
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,260
use its thermonucleotops,

1195
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,640
or magic

1196
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,620
horns, to rend and

1197
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,740
tear the flesh of both its vicious

1198
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,600
foes and, during mating

1199
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,740
season, members of its own

1200
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,460
species. This

1201
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,680
rough beast slouching its

1202
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,520
way towards Bethlehem,

1203
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,320
this Beelzebush,

1204
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,780
consumed over

1205
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,020
87 times its own

1206
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,680
weight daily, and excreted

1207
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,620
107 times

1208
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,040
that into

1209
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,360
its own environment.

1210
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,180
Experts theorized that it

1211
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,160
had to spend most of its time

1212
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,220
afloat in its own

1213
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,320
fecal sea in

1214
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,180
order to prevent its bones

1215
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,240
being pulverized by

1216
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,320
its own enormous bulk.

1217
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,040
Thus, it

1218
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,780
wallowed complacently

1219
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,440
in the primeval seas,

1220
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,760
never guessing that it soon

1221
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,880
faced extinction at the

1222
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,380
hands of parasites,

1223
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,480
tiny bacteria

1224
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,320
bred from the endless

1225
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,900
smoldering heaps of its own

1226
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,520
refuse.

1227
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,460
It is said that nuclear

1228
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,500
fusion could occur at

1229
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,800
room temperature within

1230
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,680
the vast gullet of

1231
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,040
this behemoth.

1232
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,720
They lived

1233
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:46,400
in small parts of their

1234
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:46,400


1235
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:46,580
balance parts of the

1236
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:47,440
spermeltic cell of

1237
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:47,960
the human sperm.

1238
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,520
This is the

1239
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:53,520


1240
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:53,780
of the

1241
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:53,780


1242
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:53,780


1243
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:53,800
carcass animals

1244
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:53,980
at the

1245
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:53,980


1246
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:53,980


1247
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:53,980


1248
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:53,980


1249
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:53,980


1250
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:54,120
in the

1251
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:54,340
vast

1252
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:54,340


1253
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:54,340


1254
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:54,340


1255
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:54,340


1256
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:08,820
Aurium

1257
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:08,900
and prejudice.

1258
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:08,980
Depending upon

1259
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:09,560
the

1260
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,360
that the terrorists are bringing into our country.

1261
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,160
Yeah, you're going to feel real groovy.

1262
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:19,280
Yeah, man, the terrorists brought some smack into my veins.

1263
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,280
They'll do that every time.

1264
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:28,040
It's not my fault the terrorists shot that dope into my needle using my hand.

1265
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,480
Those terrorists mind-controlled me into driving drunk.

1266
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:37,180
Those terrorists mind-controlled me into destroying the Freedom of Information Act.

1267
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:43,160
Those terrorists forced me to declare war, terror, and freedom both at the same time.

1268
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,540
I'm not responsible.

1269
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,300
Freedom for Johnny Appleseed and the boys under the hills.

1270
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,520
It's a world of death.

1271
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,940
It loves it.

1272
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,300
It's death.

1273
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,780
They worship death.

1274
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,020
Not at strip joints, they have.

1275
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:03,980
No.

1276
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,560
You ain't been going out enough, man.

1277
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,100
Dollars.

1278
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:06,860
Oh, yeah, man.

1279
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,220
I've been going out plenty.

1280
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,700
Out of my mind.

1281
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,740
Don't you see what they're doing in the strip joints even, man?

1282
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,520
It's everywhere.

1283
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,020
That girl takes off this, she takes off that.

1284
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,500
She's putting something back on in your mind.

1285
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,520
Until next week.

1286
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,560
Keep your head on tight.

1287
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,520
Back to the wind.

1288
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,220
And you're sacking the saddle.

1289
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,640
Get that tag to Princess Pearl.

1290
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,080
Beneath the stains of time.

1291
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,820
The feelings.

1292
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,060
Disappear.

1293
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:44,380
You are someone else.

1294
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,720
I am still right here.

1295
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,100
I am still right here.

1296
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,140
I am still right here.
