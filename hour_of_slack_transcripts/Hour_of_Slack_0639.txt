The program you are about to hear, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, is parody, satire, and comedy.
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius, religion, politics, or any other touchy subjects
is intended only as humor and should cast no reflection on the high standards of WREK
Atlanta, its staff, or that of Georgia Tech.
Hit it.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
It's a man, it's a man, it's a man
It's a man, it's a man, it's a man
Better think about the future
Yeah, it's time we planned it
Better think about our future
It's time to get off this planet
So, pack your suit bags and grab that track
It's a desk for it
Guys, get to it
It's a man, it's a man, it's a man
It's a man, it's a man, it's a man
Yeah, it's time to stop nowadays
Not produced, done, gorgeous
Whoa, damn.
Damn, look at this place.
Oh, I ain't cleaning up after this mess, baby.
Earth looks just like Keith Moon's hotel room.
The X's aren't even here yet.
Boy, is it ever time for Bob to run this planetary Titanic
smack into the X's iceberg.
Oh, yes, Seekers.
The hour of our glorious subgenius Shagnarok is at hand.
Ooh, and I've got packing to do.
Oh, let's check it off here and see.
Ruby slippers, black pajamas, roll of quarters, pudding.
Ah, screw the Nikes.
They don't make a stiletto pump.
Oh, boy, am I ever ready to set sail over the rainbow
with my precious subgenius cult
on that mellow slack road through space and time.
Oh, I only hope I can hold out.
Oh, damn.
But June has been a rough month for the flues here.
Oh, I've been seriously preparing for this event for two months
and, oh, I'm nowhere near ready for it.
Oh, I've still got pasties to sew and props to gather
and tapes to make and rants to write.
Oh, plus Stank Hall asking me to make the giant clock for the pavilion.
The most important clock ever created
for the most important hour in all of subgenius history.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.




The clock that will strike out the last hour
of human existence on planet Earth.
Ooh, not too much pressure there now, is it?
Oh, but hey, yeah, I can do it.
I can do it, yeah.
I'm the biggest clock tease I know.
Oh, yes, let me make a final introduction of myself here.
I'm your sinister minister, the Reverend Susie the Fluesian.
And this?
This is my last episode ever of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.
The last episode before final total global apocalypse.
Ooh, and don't think that doesn't give me
just a little performance anxiety.
Oh, because I never thought I'd make it to this day, Seekers,
but now it's time for us to party like it's 1998.
Oh, and I'm frazzled to a frayed thread.
Thanks for watching.
Special thanks to the end times of vicious scheduling.
I've had to turn in three shows this month.
When the crappy equipment here
screwed up the last two Stan copies,
I had to go back in and do some cells-style reengineering
so it's been to ata one of five shows
for me on top of everything else.
If only all this added weight on my shoulders
were extra boobs.
Oh, So, please forgive me for being .
out. Oh, it's nothing compared to the way they're going to get birds in just one short week.
Oh, well. I may be going way over to my seekers because, oh, you wouldn't believe how much I have
to cram into this show. But I owe it to you lovely seekers out there to do this right.
Because this is my last chance to pluck the unsaved subgeniuses out of this planetary swill.
This is the final opportunity for redemption before the exes whip hand comes down. And, oh,
I can't let you down now. I have a sacred obligation to my ministry and to the true
yeti stock among us. Because, children, our heritage awaits us in the stars. And soon,
oh, yes, soon, as Bob is my witness, we'll never be slackless again.
Let the judgment begin. I'll get the ball rolling.
The end of the world? How near is it? We hear a great deal today about the end of the world.
When is it going to come? Some have been so presumptuous as to set dates. As a result,
people have sold their worldly goods, gone to a mountaintop somewhere, and waited for the end of
the world to come.
Others have taught and preached that there will be no end, that everything will go on as it is.
And both parties are wrong.
And I alluded to the fact that certain traditions of men teach that when a planet goes through,
or a comet goes through a certain field, was it the great hunter? I think it was. That means the
earth is coming to an end.
And I made the statement that it would be impossible for Hailey Bopp to hit the states unless of the
Americas unless a chunk broke off. And this lady thought I said a chunk was going to break off of
Hailey Bopp and me and the world. I didn't say that, all right. That would be an impossibility
is what I was actually saying. There's nothing out there that's going to run into Hailey Bopp.
But I had fun doing that. I hope you all enjoyed it. But no dates were mentioned other than
astronomical signs, and they had to go through. And I made the statement that it would be impossible
were taking place at those times.
The Church of the Subgenius is surely the church of the future,
or at least what's left of it.
The world as we know it will end in 1998.
1998.
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.
Subgeniuses come from a better world and they're going to a better world.
They descended from abominable snowmen and will evolve overnight
on some evening in late 1998 into overmen and overwomen.
It is an unbroken line of continuous change as opposed to that of pinks
who are an evolutionary dead end and have been spinning their wheels
as mere humans for the last million years or so.
Part of that involves freeing the, let's call them the normals,
pinks, the pink boys, the mediocrities from the depression
that the conspiracy is laying on them.
What am I doing?
Hurry, we've got no time to lose.
Going to the zoo?
I wouldn't hear of it.
Why, my little party's just beginning.
Not like mice, rats.
That's right.
Don't hurt them.
Don't hurt them.
Right away.
We'll let them think about it a little first.
It's time to pray, America.
There's a new sitcom coming, folks.
It's called Armegadon for Armageddon.
That's what it's called, Armageddon.
The greatest war of all wars will be fought.
The Battle of Armageddon will be fought.
The blood will flow in the streets up to the brattles of the horses for 200 miles.
Oh, this is a gap.
Ah!
Ah!
Looking forward to it, Mr. Stanton.
You are the basic truth in us.
You are the reality.
We will never let you down.
And we will always be grateful.
I'll tell you what.
Bob Dobs came to town to set you free.
Surely, I come quickly.
Amen.
man. My, people come and go so quickly here. In both instances, he's coming literally, visibly,
and bodily. Brother, every time I see another spaceship going to the moon in the exploration
of the moon and soon driving the new automobiles they're making for the moon, I say, my heart,
he must be coming soon now. Let each one who hears them say the same. Come. Let the thirsty one come.
Anyone who wants to, without charge. He who has said all things declares, yes, I am coming.
So, that's a taste of seed. Just try it for yourself.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Frightening him like that when he came to you for help.
Silence, whippersnapper. The beneficent Oz has every intention of granting your requests.
Yes, sir. What did he say? What did he say?
At first, you must prove yourselves worthy by performing a very...
small task.
He didn't tell us to clean up the fish pond. He said to fish in it.
We're in a world full of action. Something is happening.
We're in the race for the young generation. We're on the go. We want to tell all the nation.
Something is happening. Something is happening now.
Now.
Watch out for us. We're in a tonic reaction. Something is happening.
We've got the pressure of a new motivation. We're gonna live at first the chain of formation.
Something is happening. Something is happening now.
Now.
And now we are on the verge of the greatest and the final war.
If we have an all-out war now, let me tell you something. It will be the last.
And a blue-ribbon panel of experts from MIT and Harvard University were asked to do a study.
Using the...
Using all of the computers, the military experts and everything else to study and see what is the possibility of a nuclear war in this century.
They came back and they said, we expect a limited nuclear war before 1984 and an all-out nuclear holocaust before 1999.
And they said that we see it as inevitable.
And there's good reason for that.
Because of the wonderful things he does.
Those awful days that are still ahead for you and me.
Beginning in chapter...
Chapter 3 of 2 Peter, verses 10 through 14.
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise.
Some have thought this means perhaps a nuclear blast.
And the elements shall melt with fervent heat.
That's tremendous heat, isn't it?
The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up, seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved.
What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?
I suppose I could put on...
My black costume and fly over the Emerald City a few times on my flaming broomstick.
Double, double toil and trouble.
Fire burns and cauldrons bubble.
This is a potent wind through.
This is a potent wind through.

And we've cooked up just for you.
Just look inside our pot.
And see what it is we've got.
It's made of uranium.
Uranium.
And it's called the atomic bomb.
Or uranium.
Uranium超аков geography.

All the way up your collarbone.
Not am confuse in the dark.




What a bugger is he.

And he shouldn't use only half a thousand times at a time in a loop.
If you're bolted, you'll watch, wait for credit.
Until the end of the world we gets outraged why we had to goный марini first.
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.
They destroyed the world.
The entire Los Angeles area.
Already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain.
And civil defense authorities state that the situation is much the same across the entire country.
Martial law is now nationwide.
Major cities in all parts of the country, New York, Los Angeles, report plague victims falling dead in the streets, in their homes, at their work.
The first symptom appears to be severe choking, followed by immediate unconsciousness.
Death occurs within minutes.
Whether a state of war between China and Russia still exists is not important any longer.
Our fellow countrymen are dying.
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble under the dread assault of that horror, long feared, germ warfare.
Carlo Red, champion.
This is a Class 1 emergency.
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.
Stay in your homes.
Stay in your homes.
Those found without specific military orders are subject to summary execution.
Stay in your homes.
Repeat, Carlo Red channel.
This is a Class 1 emergency.
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.
But as soon as we're gone, you folks who are here unsaved, you folks listening by radio, you folks listening by record,
who know not Jesus Christ, once the church is gone, there's going to be a cataclysmic judgment.
And millions will die in those next few years.
Watch World War III on pay TV.
Television can be quite a thrill.
Sitting home in your chair, watch the boys over there.
Charging across your TV screen, being blown to smithereens.
Watch World War III on pay TV.
If you want to keep the kids at home, they'll be glued to their sets.
Watching rockets and jets, blowing up schools and factories.
Putting an end to the birds and bees.
It's worth every penny to tune in and see.
Who wins the Emmy at the root of the academy?
Watch World War III on pay TV before your television melts away.
See the hydrogen bombs explode.
And some mushrooms appear.
You'll be sipping your beer.
Zooming in with a zoomer lens.
Watching while the whole world ends.
It's worth every penny to tune in and see.
Who wins the Emmy at the root of the academy?
Watch World War III on pay TV before your television melts away.
La la la la.
Before your television melts away.
I think they're clear now.
Check the instruments, please Flash.
Yes, we're at about the 250 mile perimeter.
Does Ming's sensing equipment check position beyond here?
Only for approaching objects.
It's safe.
We have to set our course for Earth now.
Since we've made it, we're really free and on our way to Earth.
Yes, dear, and you must admit Aura kept her word to us.
I told you we'd make it.
My ship doesn't get radar challenged leaving Mongrel.
You know that my father's rocket attack is planned for 8 a.m. tomorrow, Earth time.
Yes, I know.
But what you probably don't know is that Ming is sending two waves of attacking rockets.
Two waves?
Why?
The first wave are merely dummy rockets.
Oh, I knew that.
Decoys with remote control and no warning.
They're designed to draw all of Earth's counter rockets and anti-missile fire.
That way Ming hopes to beat the second wave of attack.
We'll catch us on Earth, only our secondary line of defense.
Yes, it's a clever plan.
Our secondary offenses are only for small localized rockets.
It'd never be enough to stop Ming's interplanetary cruisers.
Precisely right.
My father isn't exactly a fool.
How many ships in each wave?
150 in the first wave, the decoy, and 200 in the second.
But Ming may change his plans now that you've helped us escape.
No.
The attack countdown has already started and he doesn't know that I learned of the attack plan.
He'll attack on schedule.
But you'll be able to warn Earth in time.
Flash, what about contacting Earth now?
Let them know right away.
Oh, yeah, baby.
Danger.
You better stop it.
You better stop it.
Danger.
You better stop it.
Danger.
You better stop it.
There's something happening right before our eyes that's more clear than the face of the sky.
And yet many are overlooking what's happening.
Long ago the prophets of Israel predicted a very precise pattern of events that would all come together and so forth.
Now there would be general signs in the weather and in physical phenomena.
Dorothy saw a cloud on the horizon even.
It was big and black.
And from the north she heard something loud.
Wind, storm.
Heaven sent her like a tide.
That sound could mean only one thing.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob will protect you.
Who?
Who's Bob?
If you don't know that, I can't tell you.
It's gonna be just like this.
33 years old, I don't know.
Nobody else really knows.
All I know is our body will be just like his.
No death, no sickness, no sorrow, no need of rest.
You won't have to go to bed at night.
Lock your door.
An eternal glorified body just like his.
Now Bob, I think I got a little problem.
When I asked you if there's something going on because Bob, I didn't have to hear it from your daughter.
I should have heard it from your mouth.
Not his.
I should have heard it from yours and Bob.
He slept with you.
On July 4th weekend.
And the fate you've made rather a bad enemy of the wicked witch of the west.
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether.
But which is the way back to Kansas?
I can't go the way I came.
No, that's true.
The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful wizard of Oz himself.
One day you'll find yourself up to your neck.
In false drugs, false sex, false jobs, false money.
And you'll say, but where's Bob?
Where's Bob?
You mean, you mean there really is a conspiracy?
You mean there really was a Bob?
You mean, you mean I could have had slack and I would have?
Ah!
What's the matter, Bob?
I'm up.

Is he good or is he wicked?
Oh, very good, and very mysterious!
He lives in the Emerald City and that's a long journey from here.
But how do I start from here?
It's always best to start at the beginning.
And all you do is follow the yellow brick road.
Follow the yellow brick road?
Follow the yellow brick road?
I can't get off.
Follow the yellow brick road.
Follow the yellow brick road.
Follow the yellow brick road.
Follow the yellow brick road.
Follow the yellow brick road.
There is a fabled land,
A strange and chatted land,
Where munchkins live and laugh and play.
This wondrous fairyland,
With jewels and flowers,
To a city's brand,
Is a place far, far away.
We all should spend some time,
Where living is sublime,
And troubles seem to melt away.
A thousand magic tricks,
And a road of yellow bricks,
Takes us to this land so gay.
Of course people do go both ways.
A new dimension opens up.
And I want to get back there so badly,
I'm going all the way to Emerald City,
To get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
You're going to see a wizard?
Do you think if I went with you,
This wizard would give me some brains?
I couldn't say.
Won't you take me with you?
Why of course I will.
Hooray! We're off to see a wizard!
You're not starting out very well.
Oh I'll try. Really I will.
To us? To us.
This strange enchanted land,
Where trouble and strife are left behind.
This wondrous fairy land,
Where life is always grand.
This land of ours,
Is in your mind.
Is in your mind.
Is in your mind.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
Wake up, honeymoon.
There's no place like...
World leaders are looking for something Phillipp's
drastic to happen soon.
Some call it the end of the world.
others the world's greatest war, and still others the coming again of the Lord Jesus Christ.
Teller, the father of the atomic bomb, tells us that Russia will be able to destroy us soon.
Yuri, the atomic scientist, has a doomsday clock, which is now set at 11.58,
two minutes before midnight.
And this, of course, has to do with a nuclear helicast.
Here is the instrument of cleansing, my brethren.
And nothing quite cleanses like fire.
Lord, Lord!
Lord!
To go into hell's fire, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
The fire is not quenched.
The fire is not quenched.
In Isaiah 33, 14, who among us shall dwell with devouring fire?
Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burning?
See the bomb, the door is open.
A bomb drop, big enough for you to carry if you're strong enough,
and this is the target by 200 yards.
When that bomb burst, 100,000 Japanese people died.
Some didn't because it burst out in fingers and behind hills and mountains.
Some of those homes even were protected.
One man who lived behind a great hill, a great bridge out in front of him,
stood on his foot and was shot.
He could move not a muscle except his eyes.
He said something and he stood there for many hours.
He heard something up on top of the hill, yelling.
He heard something up on top of the hill, yelling.
He heard something up on top of the hill, yelling.
He heard something up on top of the hill, yelling.
He heard something up on top of the hill, yelling.
And he looked up, over the top of the hill came 100 colored people.
He said, not only am I, am I in shock, but I've lost my mind.
There are no colored people in Japan.
Down the hill they come.
Some would fall and others would travel them to death.
Some got to the bridge and stood on the bridge and cursed
and jumped in the water committing suicide.
Oh, he said, it's when they cursed that I came out of my shock.
These weren't black people.
These were my old Japanese people, charred black by that terrible bomb.
They push this one button and in the middle of the night your radio and TV comes on.
They hope that it'll stall the next few years.
And they will say, Red China has just declared war.
You have 11 minutes to prepare.
Then it said you can either get up and look out the window and watch it happen or lay in bed and wait.
I didn't think it was very funny.
That's the way the world's talking.
I looked through a Gideon Bible one time for tales of great destruction.
The sun was risen upon the earth.
When Lot entered unto Zoar, I read.
Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.
And he overthrew these cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities
and that which grew upon the ground.
So it goes.
Those were vile people in both those cities.
It is well known the world was better off without them.
And Lot's wife, of course, was told not to look back.
She was told to look back where all those people in their homes had been.
But she did look back.
And I'd love her for that because it was so human.
So she was turned to a pillar of salt.
So it goes.
People aren't supposed to look back.
I'm certainly not going to do it anymore.
Red alert! Red alert!
Sensing the danger is report.
Nuclear war ends on the East.
Prepare for nuclear attack.
They are armed.
You fools!
Did you think my father and I would give up so easily?
Our nuclear attack force is now inside your defense perimeter without a shot being...
Look! Here come the flying monkeys!
Quick! Everybody down on the ground!
They're spitting peanut fat at us!
Oh, boy!
I thought they were supposed to be peaceful.
They usually are.
I can't understand it.
Careful now.
Get behind me.
Oh, here comes their leader.
It's going to be up to you.
It's going to be up to you.
What are you going to let happen to this planet?
What are you going to do about it?
Bob's going to let you decide what to do about it.
Is that what you're going to...
Are you just going to sit there?
They won't even have to do it.
Bob won't even have to see that the end of the world happens properly.
It'll happen by accident.
The spirits speak it expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith,
giving heed to seducing spirits.
Doctrines of demons.
Demonism's on the march.
Demonism is a growing phenomena.
An aerial disease is doubling and tripling all over the nation.
Love cults, hippies, shippies are shouting out their filthy four-letter vocabularies in mixed audiences.
Homosexuals now have organized into the Mattachine Society of America.
With Dick Leach as its president, and he claims 17 million involved in Sodom USA.
God help us.
If this continues, God will have to judge our nation.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!

Ah!
Be not deceived, God is not mocked.
All the time mocking
mocking mockies Bob, not too mock, and then have a whole��혹cent, and to will it be burned
up.
Here is evil.
Evil, evil.
Evil.
Is this not the place where all the dead
will burn?
Yes.
And this is the last of the dead.
And what shall we do with him?
My brethren?
Kill him.

Burn! Burn!
Burn!
Yes, sir.
Burn!
Give me a time check.
Time, 7 a.m.
Attack power, standby.
Report.
Enemy attack fleet, area 44, position 12.
Approaching 1,000 miles per minute.
Put them on the viewing screen as soon as they're in range.
Viewing screen ready.
Report.
Type a number of enemy ships.
Attack force, approximately 300 rocket ships.
300?
Type ASC-7.
Now the question is survival.
Is this the end of technological man?
Is this the conclusion of all our yesterdays?
The boasts of our fabled science?
The superhuman conquests of space and time?
The age of the wheel?
We were warned of judgment.
Well.
Here it is.
Here.
Now.
This is the end.
Paddy, you and the viewers will be interested in noting that the world ended.
As we know it, Hugh.
You're darn tootin', Paddy.
I sure am.
Just imagine this.
Four or five of their own fighting machines suddenly start off.
Heat rays right and left.
Not a Martian in them.
Not a Martian in them, see?
But men.
Men who've learned the way how.
May even be in our time.
Yes.

Imagine having one of them lovely things with a heat ray wide and free.
We'd turn it on Martians.
We'd turn it on men.
We'd bring everybody down on their knees.
That's your plan?
Yeah.
You.
Me.
You and more of us.
We'd own the world.
I see.
Fuck you.
I hear stately Holmas.
I hear it.


I hate to dismiss, could I have a beautiful smile?

Look, here's someone who can help you.
You got no business being sick! You got no business being in bondage!
You got no business living out of sin! You got no business living without sight!
This fire-cannon tether sets you free!
The Church of the Subgenius is probably the single most important organization in the 20th century.
Oh, Lizard, I have missed you, sweet talk.
There's just one way.
Stay right here. I'll be back in a jiffy.
The witch went into the castle and came out in a few moments carrying a bottle of large, green pills.
I guess Cian's believin', child, he said.
Yes, sir, Cian's believin'. And by golly, it's I.
I'll see you in the rapture.
See you in the rapture.
See you at that meeting in the air.
There we'll have lost each savior.
We'll live and reign forever.
I'll see you in the rapture.
Some sweet prayer.
There'll be no excuses. I didn't know.
There'll certainly not be any excuses for you because I just told you.
He said, recognize when you see all these prophecies coming together like the leaves of the fig tree, first and foremost.
He said, recognize I am at the door, ready to return.
And then he gives the...
It ends like this.
Booty wheat?
There's the big city!
Oh, we're almost there, at last, at last!
It's beautiful, isn't it? Just like I knew it would be.
He really must be a wonderful wizard to live in a city like that.
Oh, come on, Ann, what are we waiting for?
Yuppie, let's hurry.
Yes, let's run!
We're having a wood-journ-u-the-duck-jour-u-the-nock!
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

Oh, dear.

Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.











You see, none of this was real.
It was illusion.
Your art, your science, it was all a nightmare.
And now it's done.
Finished.
My brethren, our task is nearly complete.
He was the last of those who brought the punishment to us.
We have cleansed and purged this world.
Now we must build.
Build coffins.
That's all you need.
No, no, no.
Bring him.
I hope my strength holds out.
I hope your tail holds out.
We're not that far gone, but we're on the road.
The yellow brick road.
We're off to see the wizard.
Heavenly Father, we ask you in these last moments to speak to our hearts.
Hold a sign to the kind shocking signs all around us and their people who need Bob.
Bob.

And it's the nearest thing to true giggling that I should hope to see.
When I'm up in the sky, I hardly have to try.
My love keeps one bright star for me.
And it's the shining light on a singular flight that I should hope to see.
We return to Transylvania to prepare the transit team.
The bad dream is over, friend Neville.
Now we can sleep in peace.
Lisa!
Watch yourself, Dad.
You're the highly suggestible type.

Oh, you'll see it in a night of love
My love
Oh, you'll see it in a night of love
Under the mountain, a golden mountain
Where you pray that the lark is right
Oh, oh, you'll see it in a night of love
My love
Oh, oh, you'll see it in a night of love

Showing on the dirt and sand
Your former glory and all the stories
Like the walls within your hands
But oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
