1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,800
No wonder millions and millions of ladies say,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,160
I love body temperature.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,800
Morning, ladies.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,380
Good morning. Who are you?

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,200
I'm usually called Old Tyler.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,760
That's my husband's name.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,380
The Swatch.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,820
I'm sorry, but illegal possession of uranium is the one charge we can't hang on you.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,320
Listen carefully to the instructions.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,680
Your life depends on how well you follow them.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,060
One of the main components of this church is Slack, with a capital S.

12
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,500
And that's like this ability,

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,820
to, well, basically if you don't know what Slack is,

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,520
you probably are never going to figure it out properly.

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,340
And you don't deserve it.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,680
Right. You're going to know exactly what the church is talking about

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,540
when they tell you that the conspiracy is robbing you of your Slack,

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,420
based on your everyday life.

19
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,100
And fuck them if they can't take a joke.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,960
Yeah, and fuck them if they can't take a joke.

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,080
You're going to know exactly what's meant by Slack.

22
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,140
He also began modeling for hundreds of magazine ads,

23
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,900
leaving early clues of his presence.

24
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,720
These old ads are the only known photos of Dobbs,

25
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,160
for he otherwise remains elusive,

26
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,880
shunning both the spotlight and the authorities.

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,680
In 1979, he recruited two randomly selected nobodies,

28
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,800
Dr. Philo Drummond and Ivan Stang,

29
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,100
to begin a public outreach arm,

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,920
and begin spreading his seed word of Slack.

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,300
Basically, the church is so omnipervasive,

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,240
and so full,

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,300
that we could not possibly get into the dogma

34
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,740
in any less than three or four hours.

35
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,260
This will outline everything,

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,840
clear and concise detail,

37
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,300
easy to read,

38
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,420
keep it near you,

39
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,920
and we promise that any answers that you need

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,800
will be found in this handy little pamphlet right here.

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,160
One dollar for salvation.

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,820
One dollar.

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,140
Oh yes, dear friends,

44
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,360
have we got a treat for you tonight,

45
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,940
because this is, this particular hour of Slack,

46
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,060
number 1,713,

47
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,560
is actually somebody else's show.

48
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,560
An hour-long interview with Dr. Philo Drummond.

49
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,500
Last summer, our friend, Reverend Snappy Twig,

50
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,440
recorded this historic interview.

51
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,900
It's historic because you hardly ever get to hear Philo

52
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,000
without other radio doctors jumping from subject to subject.

53
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,960
And I think,

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,220
I think this better reveals the way that Dr. Drummond's minds work now,

55
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,200
and worked when the subgenius outreach was first being planned.

56
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,560
Reverend Snappy Twig, under his human street name, Sean,

57
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,340
has a podcast called Share a Slice with Sean,

58
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,980
which you can find at ShareASlicePodcast.com.

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,940
That's all one word, except for the .com.

60
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,940
ShareASlicePodcast.com.

61
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,080
His webpage for this episode includes over a dozen really excellent links

62
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,580
to various other subgenius and related websites

63
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,540
that you might be really glad to know about.

64
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,300
I thought he did a great job editing this

65
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,460
and encouraging Philo to tell the strange but true story

66
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,880
of how the church grew in the late 70s and early 80s.

67
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,260
It makes a great companion to the documentary movie about us

68
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,960
that's premiering at South by Southwest Film Festival

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,320
in March, March 10th, in fact,

70
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,100
and will probably be available a little later this year as a DVD.

71
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,920
Incidentally, the title of that movie is

72
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,460
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

73
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,860
for future reference.

74
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,220
And they spelled Bob right, and subgenius.

75
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,360
Anyway, thanks to Reverend Snappy Twig

76
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,000
for bringing us this great interview

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,780
with Dr. Philo Drummond, overman first degree,

78
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,660
and Bob Dobbs' personal friend.

79
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,600
.

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:25,960
.

81
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,200
.

82
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,700
.

83
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:42,840
.

84
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:42,880
.

85
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,360
.

86
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,440
.

87
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,100
.

88
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,380
.

89
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,540
.

90
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:44,540


91
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:44,740
.

92
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:45,720
.

93
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:45,740
.

94
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:45,760
.

95
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:45,780
.

96
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:45,780


97
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:45,960
.

98
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,100
.

99
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,100


100
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,140
.

101
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,200
.

102
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,320
.

103
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,600
Oh, hey, it's Christmas slash New Year's Eve holidays over here.

104
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,840
So welcome to a very relaxed and slackful episode of Share a Slice with Sean.

105
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,380
So way back in June, I think, I was honored to have a conversation with Philo Drummond.

106
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,280
And he's one of the co-founders of the Church of the Subgenius.

107
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,500
And that happens to be the cult, the UFO cult, that I belong to myself.

108
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,240
Because a while back, I sent them $35.

109
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,140
And that's what gets you in to the Church of the Subgenius.

110
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:47,840
As the introduction to this episode explains, Philo and his childhood friend, Ivan Stang,

111
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,800
were recruited in 1979 by this mysterious character called J.R.

112
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,680
Bob Dobbs, or maybe not.

113
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,000
Anyway, Dobbs is the figurehead of the Church of the Subgenius.

114
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:11,020
And he's apparently arranged it with an alien race called the Exus to come save all the

115
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,140
subgeniuses who've paid up their membership dues.

116
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,440
That's the $35 right now.

117
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,120
Get it now before the price goes up.

118
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,680
Anyway, they're coming on July 5th, 1998.

119
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,380
Which hasn't actually come yet, probably.

120
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,520
And it's called Ex Day.

121
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,720
So every year, members of the Church of the Subgenius go down to Ex Day.

122
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,120
And on the morning of July 5th, they wait for the Exus to come to pick them up.

123
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,600
So, so far, more than 20 times, it's just been practice drills.

124
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,480
But we're pretty sure that the next July 5th,

125
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,300
is going to be the one.

126
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,360
The interview itself, it turns out that that July 5th was not the one.

127
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,480
Which is good, because I can get this interview out to you now.

128
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:12,080
So, but definitely it's going to happen in 2019, or at least what the conspiracy calls 2019.

129
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,620
We all know it's actually 1998.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,880
It's pretty obvious that the conspiracy of pinks, or slash the normals, them, those people,

131
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,480
they've messed up the calendar.

132
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,860
So 1998 hasn't actually happened yet.

133
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:41,120
Or maybe J.R. Bob Dobbs also wrote 8661 on the napkin, telling us when the world would end, and not 1998.

134
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,720
After all, maybe it's actually upside down.

135
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:53,580
So either all this happened, or Philo and Stang just made the whole thing up on a lark.

136
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,460
A 1998 conspiracy.

137
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:01,120
Or maybe it's just the fact that the whole thing happened in 1979, and the thing just took off in Cleveland, and San Francisco, and other places in the 1980s.

138
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,940
And this whole thing still exists now, 40 years later.

139
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,760
It seems unlikely, but it's also a possibility.

140
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,160
I really think that with this material, it's probably best not to fight it.

141
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,880
Just don't keep your analytical brain on.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,480
Turn your brain off.

143
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,860
Just slack off, fade into this episode.

144
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,460
And just let it sink in.

145
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,200
Just let it sink into your brain.

146
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,620
It'll wash your brain out for you.

147
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,980
That's your key phrase.

148
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,900
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

149
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,300
Three, two, and one.

150
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,340
Now to continue with the tape recording.

151
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:53,460
So my first year of university back in 1993, I walk into the computer labs over there at the fancy McGill University,

152
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,140
in Montreal here.

153
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:02,560
And who do I see grinning back at me but this piped figure from the 1950s.

154
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,320
Looks like someone off of Leave it to Beaver or something.

155
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,460
And I'm like, well, that's kind of a bit kitschy.

156
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,360
I wonder what that is.

157
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,800
But I didn't really go any further.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,720
But his grin like just burnt into my mind.

159
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,880
And over the next 20 or 30 years, occasionally I would go back to that.

160
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,280
And I'd be like, what is this?

161
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,240
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

162
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,300
Well, we tried hard to make sure his face got out everywhere we could get it, you know.

163
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,400
That was the thing.

164
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,160
Yeah, exactly.

165
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:43,520
In the early membership packs, you always got your sticker page, you know, with lots of Dobbs heads and ways to duplicate them.

166
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,760
Sticker packs that you could put stickers in weird places, you know, and obscure locations.

167
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:58,940
And put them in the news, ready for newspaper, you know, our local civic club tabloid, those types of things.

168
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:07,900
J.R. I mean, I guess we'll back up a bit for some of my listeners who may not know really what the Church of the Subgenius is.

169
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:19,220
You and another fellow by the name of Reverend Ivan Stang, you guys founded the church.

170
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,100
I guess in the early, what, 1979, 1980, somewhere around there?

171
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,860
About there, yeah.

172
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,840
How did this church come out of being?

173
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:40,120
Because it's centered around this traveling, well, this salesman extraordinaire, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

174
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:49,200
Some say that I was tasked with the responsibility of finding someone who could start a church.

175
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,140
I think that he wasn't far of one.

176
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,960
I would embrace that practice, sir.

177
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,780
Tayler Diemel Update

178
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:09,780


179
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,080
Take a look in the lead-up to the biggest publication in history username, I'm the教o.

180
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,080


181
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:18,100
And the point of a lot of brightness is that I am an evangelist who have been spending thereular times to provide good news, one third of it, you know, that they can have a productive life there and be happy withly living in a quite guided state, well, the truth is that as other took that up, the pressure of joining a church, the fact that they were a papacy at one old age is their fear.

182
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,320
And so Chris and I decided to натury host the church, it was looking for a parent to cover his child with does this mean I can help?

183
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:25,820
or you know i mean that was that's what some people say and then there's other people that

184
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:32,700
say there was just a couple of guys who were who were uh trying to be funny so they could get a

185
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:43,060
little attention and those guys wrote some stuff and everything just went crazy after that yeah i

186
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,780
mean i don't know if you want to try to use occam's razor here i mean it seems like the

187
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,700
the first story is the simplest so it could be the most likely but the second one as outlandish

188
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:04,140
as it sounds i mean i guess it might be possible as well yeah take a deep deep breath go deeper

189
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,740
and deeper into relaxation you feel better than ever before in your life

190
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,980
two

191
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,420
two

192
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,040
two

193
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,040


194
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,820
deep deep breath much deeper than before

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,540
and as you exhale you enter deeper and deeper relaxation

196
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:34,680
three if you went go with the first story it seems like what i've read or what i've heard

197
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:42,280
is that you ran into this um mysterious uh jr bob dobbs at some point

198
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,040
and

199
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:50,700
and um i i don't know was it in the when was it i mean actually it was in college it was in college

200
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:58,580
you know and uh ultimately uh yeah he was like a upperclassman while we were in college and

201
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:07,180
um shared the same dorm i was in and uh we did some ran across each other during those various

202
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,060
college activities now this particular storyline is harder for me to remember

203
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,500
to remember

204
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,940
is the only thing about it so i'm going to work on that aspect but if some listeners go back and go

205
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:24,420
no that's not what happened that guy he wouldn't he was fake he wasn't really telling the truth

206
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:30,280
because i know what i read the book and i know what happened so i mean that could possibly be

207
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:39,740
a potential uh on the horizon because i'm working from a poor memory okay but um i'll tell you there

208
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,040
is that one of the um one of the um i don't know if i'm going to be able to do that but i'm going to

209
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,040


210
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,820
i'm going to be able to do that but i'm going to do that but i'm going to be able to do that but i'm going to

211
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:53,180
i believe on my web page quiveringbrain.com there is a there is a story attached to one of those

212
00:13:53,180 --> 00:14:03,940
links that re you know has a synopsis of that that meeting of dobbs and it's called the lost gospel of

213
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:11,040
bob or a lost gospel of dobbs i can't remember one of the two see it's been a long time since uh

214
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,640
i wrote that

215
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,780
um in any case you know i could send you a link later if you'd like to look at it

216
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:28,040
and it does go into detail about that specific occasion and meeting bob for the first time and

217
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:38,460
meeting connie and uh and the panty raid at college and bob being knocked out by the frozen

218
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,900
bra brassiere um

219
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:50,020
those those events are described in detail in that particular um document it was one of the

220
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:57,120
chapters that didn't make it in revelation x the lost gospel the lost gospel of

221
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:04,640
let me go look for it while we're talking here you actually met connie that time i didn't realize

222
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:12,820
that that was so early on oh yeah oh yeah yeah a lot of people met connie she was very popular

223
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:23,800
back in those days so connie is actually the most favorite wife of jr bob dobbs so they say

224
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:31,880
yeah of the ones we know of well i mean there are many it's sort of like you know hinduism i guess

225
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:40,320
you have potentially hundreds if not thousands with alternate universes many planets many times

226
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,740
many places yeah you know

227
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:56,340
many bobs jr bob dobbs i mean he he grew up he was a sales genius um then one evening after

228
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:04,300
basically conquering the world of sales and and and corporate retail everything he was um you know

229
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:11,080
he was busy uh some say he was building a television uh others you know others i'm not

230
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,040
quite sure said he was something to do with the world of sales but he was a sales genius and he was

231
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,760
something else i'm not sure selling roving material or something i can't quite remember what

232
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:28,880
and then um it was an an alien god that visited jr bob dobbs in a flash of light this would be uh

233
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,800
yahweh am i am i getting this right i don't want to screw it up and ruin my my uh cred too much

234
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,980
um see that's the trouble with

235
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:50,600
with stuff like this it's hard to remember those obscure details well you know not only that but

236
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,060
how do you know that but yeah i think the last time i heard and of course i could look in the book

237
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:04,340
but um i don't have a i have books not too far from here but and that's in the first book

238
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:11,220
and uh basically bob i may even be it may have even been in the first pamphlet i believe i believe

239
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,040
it was in the first stark fist of removing the book and i don't know if it's in the first pamphlet

240
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,240
but i think it's in the first pamphlet i believe it's in the first pamphlet

241
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,640
but i was behind a television set and was poking around behind a television set and received his

242
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:28,260
immaculation at some point right there i'm not sure what i don't think it was

243
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:34,600
yahweh or anybody i think it might have been jehovah one oh it was a retarded space alien

244
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,200
yeah i get them confused sometimes yeah they've got similar names maybe there's through some

245
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
convoluted you know

246
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:52,140
process they might be related to each other but but uh yeah the um jehovah one a retarded space god

247
00:17:52,140 --> 00:18:03,560
alien thing uh immaculated him against his will and uh and so yeah yeah that's definitely a that

248
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:09,680
was definitely a bad thing yeah sounds bad good good thing it was a bad for him but you know it

249
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,020
was good for i guess subgenius is everywhere

250
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:21,500
yeah i mean it's kind of like he got immaculated for us not really for us but we're definitely

251
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:28,820
good we could potentially benefit from it i suppose uh i mean uh yeah i've never been really

252
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:36,320
100 clear what exactly happens on the saucers themselves i mean i know we get it's not it's

253
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,880
really not him oh yeah we get everything we need everything we want and you know everything that we

254
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:48,280
we don't even know we want is already there waiting for us right we get there and go god

255
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,920
if i'd have thought about a little longer i would have thought of this

256
00:18:53,620 --> 00:19:02,180
you know but the main thing is you know the message is still there yeah the message is still

257
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:10,640
there you know and and until we get to the real 1998 then reverend stangle just keep preaching

258
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,560
and uh

259
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:19,240
and we'll see we'll keep up with our outreach ministries of using the internet whenever

260
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,480
possible because it's so cheap now so far reasonably free

261
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,980
all right all right now all right let's get to this slack you say in this little pamphlet you've

262
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,740
you've given me it says repent quit your job and slack off the world ends tomorrow

263
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,460
and you may die uh is this your message to the world what is those those are

264
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:48,520
sort of mind-catching slogans uh we do this is a church that does we do this particular

265
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,380
sick mind control cult does give you back your mind after we're through with it yes um but you've

266
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,980
heard the expression um oh there's no slack in the world or cut me some slack bob realized that

267
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,660
there was a vast conspiracy that didn't even know what it was doing because it's a conspiracy of

268
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:12,760
of uh normalcy and this conspiracy has been taking away people's slack since the day

269
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,040
there was a conspiracy of normalcy and it's a conspiracy of normalcy and it's a conspiracy of

270
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:18,240
what conspiracy all right now wait a second conspiracy and are y'all are out to put down

271
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,340
outrageous cult groups what does this mean no no this is an outrageous cult group

272
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:31,780
you might um show the book to the people so you get an idea of what's going on see this

273
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:37,160
it depicts the end of the world on july 5th 1998 which will happen if

274
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:42,400
enough people don't buy the book of the subgenius and now what was that date again

275
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:49,120
july 5th 1998 all right so y'all are a dallas-based group of humorists is this right

276
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:56,940
no no we're we're high priests of the unpredictable um and now again some people would say it's a put

277
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,780
on yeah we leave we believe that all decisions should be made by the individual so uh in in a

278
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,140
way the book of the subgenius can be the ultimate test you can pick that thing up and uh if it

279
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,740
confuses you then you're normal all right you may never get slack

280
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:19,800
satirical what what viewpoint lies beneath the satire what what is what are y'all trying to uh

281
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,560
project um

282
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,760
you and stang both come from texas right and you guys met in texas

283
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:42,540
is that how does that we met in texas you're like well uh um we were just happened to be in the same

284
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:50,060
uh area growing up and didn't we didn't know each other then and and uh we were introduced by

285
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:58,940
stang's uh sister-in-law and uh she was a she lived near me and she was like uh you know you

286
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,940
need to meet my brother and i was like i don't want to meet your brother i'm sure he's some

287
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,600
goofball and she would talk to him and yeah you need to meet my friend he was like i don't want

288
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,800
to meet your friend and you know so then she told me she said

289
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:20,300
well he likes he likes frank zappa and he likes comic books and you know and i thought well maybe

290
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,820
okay i'll think about it she told at the same time she told him hey he's a fan of captain beefheart

291
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:34,200
and he has a big comic book collection and and so uh he was like okay well maybe we'll maybe we

292
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,360
should meet i guess you know and so finally after a long time we i went over to his house

293
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,040
and we were just instantly instantly in touch and we were just instantly in touch and we were just

294
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,620
friends we had so much in common and we just started talking and our wives were like left

295
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,880
in the other room to you know hash things out while we went in the back and

296
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:01,820
immediately immediately you know like we've been old pals and so uh anyway yeah that was how we met

297
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:07,980
and uh through that introduction and we've been friends ever since but yeah it was after

298
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,800
after that that was probably in 78 or something like that maybe

299
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,900
78 and uh at some point you know we had these creative urges and things we wanted to do

300
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:28,880
something creative together and that was part of that whole you know subgenius thing i mean but uh

301
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,920
that's got to be the crate well yeah i can't i can't i can't even imagine like uh i mean how

302
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,660
would you even know that you would obviously you wouldn't what i'm trying to get it is like

303
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:52,580
you guys however it happens end up being the founders of this uh this cult church of the

304
00:23:52,580 --> 00:24:00,280
subgenius and then it just takes off in um in houston it started out as a pamphlet yeah it

305
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:07,020
really started out as a pamphlet and the pamphlet you know so when you're thinking about designing

306
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:12,520
something that has uh ultimately i think i guess i guess it had 16 pages

307
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:20,600
in it or something like that and there was a simple pamphlet design on eight and eleven by

308
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,360
17 or maybe it was eight and a half by 11 eight and a half by 17 i think is what it was

309
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:35,600
so we you know that was when we when the first pamphlet came out we thought that was all it was

310
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,900
going to be that was all we were even prepared to do that's we spent a long time

311
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:51,480
on that pamphlet yeah right and then we mailed it out and we thought well let's go well the first

312
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,400
thing we did with the pamphlet you know we have to we had it all printed up it's like how are we

313
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:02,100
going to distribute this thing so we had to think about that and we thought well let's go put it in

314
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:08,700
bookstores we'll we'll drop lift it you know it's the opposite of shoplifting it's where you bring

315
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,820
something into the store and leave it there so that it can be sold in the store

316
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:18,720
instead of stealing from the store you're actually giving them free inventory so we would go into

317
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,920
different bookstores and record stores and various places and we would walk to their publication

318
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:31,520
stand and surreptitiously deposit pamphlets on there for sale you know i've always wondered what

319
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,420
it would be like to have one of those pamphlets and walk up to the counter i should have just

320
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,520
tried it myself sometime and walk up to the counter and act like i wanted to buy it and

321
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,740
see what they said probably sell it to you but

322
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:47,040
we realized you know after we went to the four or five record stores in town

323
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:54,700
that this was going to be a real slow way of distributing it you know and besides what would

324
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:02,000
be cool would be if somebody else let's say a publishing company saw it and thought man these

325
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
guys this is great maybe these guys will write something else for us maybe they'll write a book

326
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,960
or maybe they'll want to be maybe they'll i can they'll want to be

327
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:20,820
a writing comedy for my television program you know we had the grandiose ideas of what

328
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:30,760
what talent we had so um you know after a while we uh his wife said you know you guys should just

329
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:37,580
send it to every publisher you can yeah so we mailed it out we got this book of american publishers

330
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,060
and we sent the pamphlet to

331
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:54,600
350 different publishers wow and and we had a we had a philo drummond was the pr manager for the

332
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:02,560
millennium management company and he sent the letters out to all those 350 with a copy of the

333
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:09,400
pamphlet and you know please take a look at this here's my my my clients are i can do these other

334
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,280
things similar to this as an example of their

335
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:21,300
great skills or whatever i can't remember exactly what i said and then we sent it out and we got

336
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:30,320
about 200 rejection letters back we have a really nice collection awesome collection

337
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,200
amazing you even got letters actually i guess some of them just ignored you yeah well back in

338
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:42,380
those days there was no you know there's no internet back then and there's no uh people did

339
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:48,700
things by mail you know that's how you communicated with businesses and things were in snail mail

340
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,340
that's what we called it back then we didn't call it that until the internet but

341
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:59,440
until there was email then we had to call that other thing snail mail but in any case we used

342
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,520
to do that and we sent them out we had this beautiful wonderful collection of rejection

343
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,560
letters and ultimately they're three of the publishers that ultimately published

344
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,400
subsequent subgenius books

345
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:24,240
were also uh sent us initial rejection letters so anyway after that uh once we got all those

346
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:34,440
rejection letters back we also got a lot of attention from different uh different parts

347
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:41,260
of the culture that are like more edgy and counterculture and off the beaten path and

348
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,120
obscure and

349
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,980
you know those kind of places that we liked anyway are suddenly giving us attention you know

350
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:55,260
and these different fanzines and magazines and even people magazine they're given they're giving

351
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:01,320
us this attention but not not people yet but these fanzines were giving us this great attention

352
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:10,280
because uh uh you know of the pamphlet and these we were getting letters from people that wanted to

353
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,160
join the church

354
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:24,260
um that didn't fit the functions of the pamphlet so we must have seen them and lastly let me let

355
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,280
me at least remind you of a symptom well there was no whispering um because we were there after

356
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,660
we had not been seen and uh i think wasn't necessarily a very stressful um rash y'm

357
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,940
i'm required to thick be drove really bad by a these really bad ones and and yeah if we didn't

358
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:42,520
fight there it wasn't easy to feel because we didn't wait that we had pressures um we didn't

359
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,400
questionnaire the questionnaire we didn't know how to build a questionnaire so we went and got

360
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:53,080
we went and visited every oddball cult we could find and scientology had this great

361
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,580
dianetics questionnaire we thought well we got to have one of those for it to be a cult worth

362
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:04,120
our salt we have to have all this stuff we got to have good charts we have to have good graphics we

363
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:10,580
have to have good dogma we got to have all this stuff that a good cult's going to have you know

364
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:20,540
and so we started building that stuff and uh you know after a while you know it seemed like a book

365
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:28,520
a real book if we could get somebody interested and and we published a couple more pamphlets

366
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,000
and finally we had some publishers that were interested

367
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:39,080
mcgraw hill was the first one the publisher of textbooks that that's so ironic and

368
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:47,840
robert robert crumb of weirdo comics also seems to have discovered you guys somehow or the comic

369
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:55,360
the comic yeah but that's when i said right when i said we were the counterculture i meant like

370
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:01,860
the ripoff press and some of the other um i can't even think of all of them now at the time there

371
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:07,320
was a lot of alternative press publications around magazines you know in those days since

372
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,440
there was no internet yet magazines that were doing a good business and

373
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:16,880
tabloids and fanzines and various alternative publications did a pretty good business back

374
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,920
then because that was that was the standard you know that was how you communicated back then

375
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:28,420
and uh and everybody wanted to find their niche and so there was not particularly underground

376
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:37,180
comics and um and you know uh it was kind of proto-punk you know it was after the punk scene

377
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,180
had yeah um

378
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:49,160
we had all this sort of uh alternative culture that was tapping into it and and their particular

379
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,220
publications and devices were picking it up and we were trying to make it so that it was

380
00:31:54,220 --> 00:32:01,540
easy for them to pick it up by encouraging copying you know xerox machines was like the was the apex

381
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:08,760
of technology for us back then but we could we could self publish you know so we did a lot of

382
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,560
that we did our own xeroxing and so it's kind of a pretty powerful way to explain what i call milegal and i guess that's more like it's like i'm in another line of fire so im band for now but but we always said you know one and few times that as well military Echo evening were sold to смогm extensively tear etc we're at teams of radars and voids and us and you know we talk a lot about the local peacemaking

383
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:17,740
stuff we encouraged other people to do that too and and play these jokes on people here's here's

384
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:23,640
a handy set of jokes you can just go play on people you know it it's interesting because

385
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:30,480
it's interesting because you've got your you got the church of the subgenius right and then you had

386
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:38,140
uh you know the cacophony society in uh in uh san francisco they were doing they were publishing

387
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:45,080
their own stuff and xeroxing it and even had freaking jack chick out there publishing his

388
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,040
stuff and sticking them in washrooms like that thing was going on in the early 80s everywhere

389
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:56,140
well that was going on early yeah that was jack chick was a good uh a good you know

390
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,620
he was a good example for us on on a way you could distribute things cheaply

391
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:07,700
yeah and easily you know and uh we had high respect for him not

392
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:16,300
as not as much for his his distribution skills as his weird obtuse uh theology you know

393
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:23,080
that he somehow got out there too he went he went some of that stuff was just totally i think there

394
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,960
was other people maybe writing some of it yeah and he was just adopting it but in any case it was uh

395
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:37,360
uh one of our one of our um our folks uh made a documentary on jack chick

396
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:45,120
uh i think it was papa joe mama um did that and uh might be something worth looking up sometime i

397
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:52,760
think uh reverend stang himself is uh in in that movie it's a documentary a really nice documentary

398
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,060
i think i originally saw it on netflix or somewhere i'll have to take a look but it's a

399
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:08,120
documentary on jack chick the bohemian grove is a real place in california where uh members of the

400
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:15,360
yale skull and bones society and their very important friends go to meet and they really do

401
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:26,000
they're described as sacrificing innocent children to a giant statue of an owl while they dance

402
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,740
naked in bacchanalian orgies it's kind of hard to imagine george w bush and dick cheney indulging in

403
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,120
these things but according to some experts that's exactly what they're doing they're just trying to

404
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,120


405
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,380
get them to do exactly what's going on

406
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:50,000
i i remember jack chick because uh i i grew up roman catholic and then as i was kind of kicking

407
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,900
that to the curb i decided i wanted to be a witch for a while so i was like one of these wiccan types

408
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:04,620
in the early 90s oh yeah i remember the it was cool back then and then uh i remember oh yeah i

409
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,900
remember seeing the jack chick tracks during that and then

410
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:14,060
i i liked his tracks because he was he was one of the only ones who was treat you know actually

411
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:20,880
taking wicca or any of that seriously i'm like oh wow he's actually believes this stuff that's

412
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:30,620
hilarious i feel so validated yeah yeah it's a shame he didn't make something about the

413
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:38,120
subgeniuses i guess we just didn't show up on his radar that's kind of sad um i'm not so sure

414
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:44,640
that he didn't at some point maybe yeah it'd be worth i know that there was i know that several

415
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:55,360
people including dr howe made a really good knockoff jack chick subgenius version and it

416
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:00,240
really looks good it looks like a real jack chick but i don't know i seem something's ringing the

417
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,560
bell that maybe he did mention it or do say something about it somewhere oh but i'll have

418
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,960
to find that uh i'm gonna find out about that

419
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:16,920
so i mean you should definitely check out that that uh documentary um yeah yeah definitely and

420
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:26,280
i mean they actually so the you guys swung the multimedia engine along and then all of a sudden

421
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:34,180
like this seems totally kind of out there to me uh radio shows started appearing uh like for

422
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,460
instance um you know puzzling evidence uh

423
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:46,060
uh and you had uh you had uh the hour of slack as well i mean someone i mean they let stang on

424
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:52,900
the radio right right they you know that's that was most of the time it was late at night or you

425
00:36:52,900 --> 00:37:02,160
know but yeah uh those were all both were pacifica stations so you know they're looking they're not

426
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,120
like a commercial station in that they actually have holes in their in their lineup that they're

427
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:13,440
they need to fill and so they're looking for people to do that you know people who work for

428
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,760
pacifica stations are volunteers so they don't get paid and it takes a lot to make somebody want

429
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,120
to get up at three o'clock in the morning and come in and do an hour and then go home and go

430
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:35,740
back to bed you know so um that's probably that that's probably how it was those slots were

431
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,500
originally acquired

432
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,340
being

433
00:37:38,340 --> 00:38:05,300
there they were there still as permanent guests kind of when the original show guy

434
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,860
had to leave or something so they just inherited

435
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:15,420
the show and then they they've still got it 36 years later you know basically and that's

436
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:21,780
different time slots but they were all at odd times that nobody wanted i think one time he

437
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:28,640
had a drive time show on sunday or something or friday then now that i was dreamed when i was on

438
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,420
that show that we could have a drive time you know like wow at six o'clock 6 30 or at seven

439
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,960
o'clock in the morning people going on their way to work to me that would have been the best time

440
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:48,860
to be doing that show and doing weird saying weird stupid stuff yeah i mean that while they're on

441
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:54,080
their way to work driving and just setting little bombs in their brains for the rest of the day

442
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,660
because they would be when you're driving you're kind of hardly there so i mean because you're

443
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:04,760
busy trying not to run into stuff hopefully so i mean yeah i want them to go what that guy just

444
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,400
say oh my god

445
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,780
my god i can't believe he said that on the radio

446
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,900
that's what i'd want to imagine happening you know

447
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,660
imagine you're in august of 1975 here with philo and how

448
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:25,040
well turn me on dead man standing at the beach and uh i may have been at the beach myself but

449
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:31,900
i would have been farther south five or six miles they shall go about five or six miles to my right

450
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,820
as i'm looking out at the beach which i would have been doing

451
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,300

452
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:34,560

and smashed into the ground

458
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:48,080
and then laid there and then laid there like this don't pick me up leave me alone i'm okay

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:57,860
i'm okay pick me up nine hours later nine hours he died oh he left his mortal coil

00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,040
come on

474
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,460
come on

475
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,000
come on

476
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,360
come on

477
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:32,640
and

478
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,340
come on

479
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,400
and

480
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,640
evidence and when you're driving in a country road in the middle of the night and you got

481
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,160
puzzling evidence going it really sets the the ambiance you know what i mean like it's different

482
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:53,740
yeah yeah exactly yeah i love to think that people are out there on the road somewhere we that was

483
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:58,060
our one of our fantasies is thinking that there's people on the road somewhere yeah listening to

484
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:03,340
this in their car truckers night imagine truckers that'd be cool truckers we would talk to the

485
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:08,980
truckers out on the interstate you know and try to try to get them to call in and we actually got

486
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:15,040
a few to call in from time to time and one of our more weird call-ins that we used to get

487
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,760
was some guys that worked in a coalinga slaughterhouse and they would have puzzling

488
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,300
evidence piped in there turned up really loud while they were slaughtering cattle

489
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,780
i just blew me away oh my gosh

490
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,300
it's

491
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:40,540
difficult to describe um i think that people just need to listen to puzzling evidence but um

492
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,500
i mean i guess the closest thing i can think of is it's kind of like a

493
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:57,180
uh a dada-esque uh free form uh uh sound collage with a bunch of uh with also some dialogue on top

494
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:03,120
of it i mean that kind of doesn't do it justice but that's kind of what it is it's something very

495
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:10,820
dada-esque about that show in my opinion get all fancy i think if you listen to the uh you'll

496
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:20,480
if you listen to the patter between the hosts you'll find that um it's it's more of a it's

497
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,200
improvisational interplay where the three guys know each other really well and they say things

498
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:33,280
and they're fairly erudite and they um play off of what each other says and they're fairly erudite

499
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,660
and they're fairly erudite and they're fairly erudite and they're fairly erudite and they're fairly

500
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:42,220
much the same way as a jazz band does you know as when they improvise so um it takes several

501
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:47,880
listenings but once you listen to it then it's interesting to listen to them and that

502
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:54,340
interweaving interplay that they do as well as the topical content of what they might

503
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:03,280
decide to enter to weave in there so that aspect of it is not like the collage so to speak it's

504
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:10,500
actually more of um and in there and i think that because they have good pun skills and things like

505
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:17,400
that that um though that the listener will be entertained in a humorous way as well

506
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:25,400
yeah you've got that and then you've got um dr howell's uh recitations as well

507
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,300
in the living room

508
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,280
the living room

509
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:41,460
the voice clock sang tick tock seven o'clock time to get up time to get up seven o'clock

510
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:49,440
as if it were afraid that nobody would the morning house lay empty the clock ticked on

511
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:58,760
repeating and repeating it sounds into the emptiness seven nine breakfast time seven nine

512
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,280
in the kitchen the breakfast stove gave a hissing

513
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:10,780
hissing sigh and ejected from its warm interior eight pieces of perfectly brown toast eight eggs

514
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:18,500
sunny side up sixteen slices of bacon two coffees and two cool glasses of milk

515
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:27,640
today is august 4th 2026 said a second voice from the kitchen ceiling in the city of allendale

516
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,500
california it repeated the date three times for memory's sake

517
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,240
today is mr feathered stone's birthday

518
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,080
today is the anniversary of tellita's marriage

519
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:47,280
insurance is payable as are the water gas and light bills somewhere in the

520
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,500
walls relays clicked memory tapes glided under electric eyes

521
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:01,200
eight one tick-tock eight one o'clock off to school off to work run run eight one

522
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,080
But no doors slammed.

523
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,000
No carpets took the soft tread of rubber heels.

524
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,100
It was raining outside.

525
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,000
The weather box on the front door sang quietly,

526
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,400
Rain, rain, go away,

527
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,880
Rubber's raincoats for today.

528
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:24,060
And the rain tapped on the empty house, echoing.

529
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,720
And Dr. Howell is some sort of...

530
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:35,680
I guess autodidactic genius or something.

531
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,900
He just... stuff comes out of his mouth.

532
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,960
Yeah, he's got a great memory.

533
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:39,780
Yeah.

534
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,500
He's got a really great memory,

535
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:45,560
and his father was like an English professor or something,

536
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,860
and poetry was really important in their family,

537
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,160
and he likes to be known as the resident know-it-all, you know.

538
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,360
So...

539
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:57,780
Yeah.

540
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:58,400
Yeah.

541
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:58,520
Yeah.

542
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:58,700
Yeah.

543
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:58,700


544
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:58,700


545
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:58,700


546
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,820
He doesn't know he's good at improvising,

547
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,800
so it still works out for him.

548
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:04,380
Yeah.

549
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,200
Like, yeah, he's got a regular show called the Ask Dr. Howell Show.

550
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:08,620
Right.

551
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,860
That rotates from here to there,

552
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,540
and always has a little bit of time at X Day where he does it as well.

553
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,540
Him and Chicken John there, they do live shows,

554
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,420
and then he's also on...

555
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,420
He was on the radio with his show,

556
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,640
but I don't know what's going on with Radio Valenza these days.

557
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:30,860
Yeah.

558
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,740
Yeah, I'm not sure either what they're doing.

559
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,180
It kind of comes and goes, and I'm not sure.

560
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,100
So...

561
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,960
I can't stay up that late.

562
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,400
No, well, you know, puzzling evidence.

563
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,340
I kept on meaning to call in, but I've got two kids and a wife,

564
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,640
and so it's basically lockdown here past 8 o'clock.

565
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,380
I just scroll away in the basement and can't make any noise.

566
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,540
It's kind of oppressive.

567
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,160
But I'm told it'll get better later on.

568
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,140
I used to do that, and I had that same setup,

569
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,400
and I got to where I had a big mixer and some good headphones,

570
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,220
and you could hear little dinky noises back there,

571
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,000
but everything else was done with headphones on.

572
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,360
That's the way to go.

573
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:22,000
I still had to soundproof the room a little bit, you know.

574
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,480
And so you got the film coming out,

575
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,700
and the film, I think, based on my...

576
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,720
perusal of it,

577
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,000
it looks like it's more sort of a documentary.

578
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,940
So Arise was more like a recruitment film.

579
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:42,420
So that discusses some of the history and the, I guess,

580
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,900
the theology of the church and, you know,

581
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,360
the story of J.R. Bob Dobbs, that kind of stuff.

582
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:53,000
So that's kind of a primer similar to the Book of the Subgenius,

583
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,960
whereas the new film,

584
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,400
the documentary made by...

585
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,520
by the actual documentary makers,

586
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,800
that one's more, seems to be more along the story of the church itself,

587
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,740
but being told from a...

588
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,920
how should I put this?

589
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,520
Less theology and more about the story itself of you.

590
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:20,000
I grew up as a little white boy in America in the 1950s

591
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,180
in a middle-class home.

592
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,620
I was in the perfect position of being desperate enough

593
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:28,620
to do low-budget promotion for a weird cult.

594
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,840
If you have never heard of the Church of the Subgenius,

595
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,840
do not look to us for enlightenment.

596
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,000
It all began with the Book of the Subgenius

597
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,560
and the church's deity, Bob Dobbs.

598
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:43,680
It was part pop culture, part science, part religion.

599
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,220
We tied together every occult, superstitious,

600
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,440
fringe belief you could think of.

601
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,500
It was so much fun!

602
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,500
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocratons,

603
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,620
these pink boys?

604
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,980
These box-dwelling Barbies and Kins?

605
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,620
These normals who have made normality the norm?

606
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,440
You either got the joke or you didn't.

607
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,400
And you got the joke instantly.

608
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,120
Yeah, you know, it's like if people that weren't members of the Church of the Subgenius

609
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,040
did a documentary on the Church of the Subgenius,

610
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,220
this might be what it looked like.

611
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,460
They're not members.

612
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,080
Their knowledge of it is...

613
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,700
most of them had no idea.

614
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:28,700


615
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,660
They had no knowledge of it.

616
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,880
Some of them did just from an early, you know,

617
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,100
a peripheral perspective.

618
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,800
So, that it was in their mind's eye,

619
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,240
but they never explored it.

620
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,560
You know, that type of thing.

621
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,980
And so that's the kind of connection they had to it.

622
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,500
So it's a different approach.

623
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,640
It's not the approach that we take in Arise,

624
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,320
our own documentary.

625
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,740
It's very much a church documentary.

626
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,740
That's why we can use it as a recruitment video as well.

627
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,400
You know?

628
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,900
It's less propaganda.

629
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,400
And I say propaganda in a good way.

630
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,600
It's less propaganda,

631
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:10,820
and it's more, I guess, what you'd watch

632
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,860
if you were an anthropologist, I guess.

633
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,380
Yeah, we don't say propaganda.

634
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,200
We say dogma.

635
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,460
Dogma, yeah.

636
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,800
Propaganda has a connotation that might not be true.

637
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,560
Propaganda is somebody else's dogma.

638
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:28,580
Right, right.

639
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,120
Okay.

640
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,620
I'll have to write that down.

641
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:33,860
Yeah.

642
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:34,940
Yeah.

645
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,040
maybe take this stuff a little seriously

646
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,760
to the point where maybe it seems like

647
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,440
they're no longer living in a slackful kind of life.

648
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,320
They're kind of, maybe they're exerting

649
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,900
their third nostril a little bit too much.

650
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:05,060
You know, they're like just straining a bit too much,

651
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,800
and maybe they need to kind of, you know, relax a bit.

652
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,800
I think they're just lost.

653
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,780
They're just lost, you know?

654
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,180
I think a true subgenius can figure out a way

655
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,440
to make it through tough times like that.

656
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,860
I think other people, other people, it's like,

657
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:21,780
oh, wait a minute.

658
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,960
Maybe I'm not a real subgenius after all.

659
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,760
You know?

660
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,620
Because this stuff wouldn't be bothering me so much.

661
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,000
I'd figure out a way to get around it

662
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,940
so I could maintain my slack, you know?

663
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,540
Well, thinking is a lot of effort too, you know?

664
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:45,680
Maybe you might be thinking a bit too much.

665
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,300
Overthinking.

666
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,100
A lot of people overthink, you know?

667
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,920
They should try underthinking for a little while.

668
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,640
Just to balance out.

669
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:55,720
Subgenius.

670
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,260
Yeah.

671
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,440
Just do some underthinking.

672
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,920
Or some breakthinking.

673
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,940
You know, it's like breakdancing,

674
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,360
where you kind of just throw your mind out there

675
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,360
and let it skitter around in every direction,

676
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,700
back, forth, up, and down, you know,

677
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,880
like a breakdancer does.

678
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,060
Yeah.

679
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,500
Breakthinking.

680
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,180
Exactly.

681
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,340
Just get out there.

682
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,620
If you want to think one way,

683
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,580
then flip it around and think the opposite way real quick instead,

684
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,320
just as an alternative.

685
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,420
Give your brain some exercise.

686
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,240
You know, it's like a muscle.

687
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,160
It needs exercise.

688
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,280
Brain needs exercise,

689
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:40,280
but not the kind of repetitive, stressful, you know?

690
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,980
Nobody wants to be doing pushups all day long, you know?

691
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:44,300
No.

692
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,680
They want to be doing other stuff.

693
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,300
You know how you've been on a bicycle,

694
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,640
and you start going downhill?

695
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,820
And then you pedal.

696
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,340
You pedal a little bit while you're going downhill.

697
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,440
You go even faster.

698
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,900
But it's effortless pedaling,

699
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,240
because you're already going downhill, you know?

700
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,380
It's easy.

701
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,240
And, you know, maybe people need to, like,

702
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,820
rather than trying so hard to win,

703
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,360
maybe they should just, you know,

704
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,700
try to fail every once in a while, too.

705
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:15,480
You're going to fail.

706
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,800
You're going to fail.

707
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,740
And my grandfather had a saying that said,

708
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:24,000
you need to grease your mistakes before they happen,

709
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,000
because they're going to happen,

710
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,320
so just be ready for them.

711
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,740
Grease them.

712
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,060
You know, make them so they slide past them easier.

713
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:33,740
Amen.

714
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:39,060
That sounds like a good plan, you know?

715
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,920
Especially dealing with these people,

716
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,580
because that's what causes other people to break, you know?

717
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,540
They just get all hung up on what's going on,

718
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,860
and they lose track of their slack.

719
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,660
They can't modify their plan on the fly, you know?

720
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:54,340
Yeah.

721
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,420
I mean, even...

722
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,740
Some people think slack means you don't have a plan,

723
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,220
you know, you don't have a plan.

724
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,960
Sometimes you don't have a plan,

725
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:06,660
but you've got to be prepared to accept what falls into your lap, you know?

726
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,220
That in itself is a type of a plan.

727
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,800
It is.

728
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,700
It's keeping things loose so that you can...

729
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:16,940
Yeah.

730
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,380
...limber, keeping things limber.

731
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,240
It's like go with the flow or roll with the punches, you know?

732
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,400
There's all kinds of idiomatic phrases to it.

733
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:25,400


734
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,220
There's all kinds of idiomatic phrases to describe that.

735
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:28,100
Yeah.

736
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,300
And J.R. Bob Dobbs, he was the king of that.

737
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,180
He was...

738
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:33,620
He was the...

739
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,300
You remember when...

740
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,520
He was...

741
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,880
He was good at dodging.

742
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,180
He could dodge like nobody,

743
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:43,960
although I remember that time that that guy threw the shoe at George W. Bush.

744
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,800
He dodged really well.

745
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,400
That was the time I was most impressed by him,

746
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,460
was that one video where the guy throws the shoes at him,

747
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:57,680
and he's just like one of those guys at a sideshow that's dodging the baseballs, you know?

748
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,660
Yeah, but...

749
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,760
He's just ducking and dodging and ducking and dodging.

750
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,060
Do you think Barbara Bush...

751
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:07,980
Do you think Barbara Bush probably throws pots and pans and shoes and all kinds of things at him?

752
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,880
Probably, if you'd mind, I guess.

753
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,240
In heaven?

754
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,020
From heaven?

755
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,340
Well, back in the day, I guess.

756
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,280
Or hell.

757
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,120
So, Philo, I don't know if my audience, how much they actually were able to learn,

758
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,440
but I hope that maybe some of you...

759
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,340
Some stuff sunk in a bit.

760
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,880
Definitely going to put links here to stuff.

761
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,860
Yeah, well, they'll probably at least be curious.

762
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,380
Yeah, for sure.

763
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,260
I would hope so, and if not, that's okay.

764
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,500
No problem.

765
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,880
I mean, when X Day comes and passes,

766
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,080
and they haven't sent in their membership,

767
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:48,080
they won't have to worry anymore after some extended period of torture and burning, etc., etc.

768
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,460
That's right.

769
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,720
It's all good.

770
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,420
At least we'll be happy.

771
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:52,980
We'll be having fun.

772
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:54,660
That's it.

773
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,160
We'll still be having fun, even if they're not.

774
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,340
I just want to remind the listeners that I'm going to be putting links up to all your media,

775
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,140
including your amazing music, on the show notes.

776
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:13,760
But in the meantime, the one thing that they need to remember is QuiveringBrain.com

777
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,760
and also the OSI 74 Roku channel.

778
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,200
They should check that stuff out right away.

779
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,120
Right.

780
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,700
And if you don't have a Roku box, you can go to my Vimeo channel.

781
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:32,460
That's vimeo.com slash philodrummon.

782
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:37,280
And most of the stuff that we have on Roku is also hosted there.

783
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,000
Awesome.

784
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,760
Thanks a lot for being on the show.

785
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,260
All right.

786
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:40,860
You're welcome.

787
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,960
Thanks for having me.

788
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:42,540
It was fun.

789
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,220
You're welcome.

790
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,240
You can all make it.

791
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,600
You can all tell them that no one here is beautiful.

792
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,900
Just keep it going.

793
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:50,500
Keep it going.

794
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:50,520
Keep it going.

795
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,060
Keep it going.

796
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:51,820
I hope you enjoyed it for this episode.

797
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,520
I'd really like to thank Philo Drummond for being on the show.

798
00:56:55,700 --> 00:57:00,200
And I'd like to encourage you to go visit his website, Quivering Brain.

799
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,340
There'll be a link in the show notes to that,

800
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:08,280
as there will be a link as well to subgenius.com.

801
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,420
And that's the Church of the Subgenius main site.

802
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:15,160
And check out Philo's music.

803
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,240
It's on Bandcamp.

804
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,320
He's on Mixcloud.

805
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,520
He's on SoundCloud.

806
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,560
He's on YouTube.

807
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,080
He's really out there.

808
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:30,460
So I'm going to be putting links to all that stuff on the website, which is available,

809
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,720
as always, over at ShareASlicePodcast.com.

810
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,240
Check that out.

811
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,200
Check out the show notes on your device.

812
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:44,600
And so this actual interview, it was done over the summer.

813
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,640
It was done before July, actually.

814
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,500
And I just never got a response.

815
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:50,500


816
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,440
I was just sitting around editing it.

817
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,320
I finally managed to get started on this during the Christmas holidays.

818
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,620
And I just never got it out the door.

819
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,380
I wanted to get it out on New Year's Day.

820
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,140
Didn't quite make it.

821
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:08,780
But just in the festive mood of the new year,

822
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:13,360
because the last year has been, frankly, challenging for everyone,

823
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,560
I thought I would start out the new year with a festive,

824
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:23,560
subgenius version of Old Lang Syne, that New Year's classics.

825
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,200
And this is by Reverend Yukon Jack.

826
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:31,040
And it's from the album Bob Song 7.

827
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,160
Bob's Prolapse Something Something.

828
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,120
So we're going to end off with this.

829
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:42,120
There'll be a link to this music, as well as all the other music, of course, in the show notes.

830
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,860
As always, thanks so, so much to everyone listening.

831
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:51,160
And I hope you'll be back next time for the next episode.

832
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,940
I guarantee you it'll be something different.

833
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,680
Happy New Year, everybody.

834
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,100
And hope to see you next time.

835
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,800
Bye.
