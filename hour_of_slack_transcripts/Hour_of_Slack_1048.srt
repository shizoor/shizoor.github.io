1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:08,700
Greetings, my friend. We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,520
And remember, my friend, future events such as these will affect you in the future.

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,540
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:29,580
That is why you are here. And now, for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happened.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,720
On that fateful day, we are giving you all the evidence based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal.

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,040
The incidents, the places. My friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer.

7
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,600
Let us punish the guilty. Let us reward the innocent.

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,660
My friend, can your heart stand the shocking facts about...

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,260
The Subgenius Hour of Slack!

10
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,600
Power. We have vast power.

11
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:27,960
At least 120 volts of pure electrical power.

12
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,380
Power.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,420
And now all we need is 100 million volts of pure, unadulterated pleasure.

14
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,760
Another one?

15
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,060
I have appetite.

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,120
Hungers.

17
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,820
Needs like anyone else.

18
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,500
I must perforce indulge my...

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,620
...my pleasure's hand.

20
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,160
As best I can.

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,240
Did not Bob say,

22
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,600
Do what keepeth thou from wilting shall be the loophole in the law?

23
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,720
Am I to let myself wilt, Bob?

24
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:29,500
Can I open it my idea of slackness against all laws of God, man, and nature?

25
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:29,980
Can I open it my idea of slackness against all laws of God, man, and nature?

26
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,320
Can I open it my idea of slackness against all laws of God, man, and nature?

27
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,100
Will there be no more?

28
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:39,880
Well, um, there is no question that a cosmic interloper will hit the earth,

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,560
and we won't have to wait for millions of years for it to happen.

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,700
In 1908 a 200 foot wide comet fragment slammed into the atmosphere

31
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,180
and exploded over the Tunguska region in Siberia, Russia,

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,440
with nearly a thousand times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

33
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,380
Astronomers estimate similar sized events occur every one to three centuries.

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,240
So hang out folks for another century,

35
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,840
and you too can join George Bush looking up at the skies

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,620
and yelling and screaming about things that he can't change.

37
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,980
Raging impotently, an impotent rage.

38
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,460
Yes, uh, impacts of large objects from space hitting us

39
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,780
have repeatedly disrupted human civilization.

40
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,960
One killed ten thousand,

41
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,360
and another meteor.

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:31,620
Another meteor.

43
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,920
Gosh darn it.

44
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,940
Killed three thousand people again.

45
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,420
Many scientists question these interpretations.

46
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,480
Impacts are most likely to occur over the ocean,

47
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,020
and smaller ones that happen over land are most likely to affect unpopulated areas.

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,700
But with big asteroids, it doesn't matter much where they land.

49
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,500
And spinal taps, see the influence.

50
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,120
Objects more than half a mile wide,

51
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,880
which strike Earth every 250,000 years or so,

52
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,980
touch off firestorms.

53
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,640
And the entire ocean gets stressed.

54
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,840
Followed by global cooling.

55
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,680
And it's terrible.

56
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,640
From the prior dust,

57
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,660
kicked up by the heat.

58
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,140
Humans would likely survive, but civilization might not.

59
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,900
An asteroid five miles wide would cause major extinctions,

60
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,640
like the one that may have marked the end of the age of the dinosaurs.

61
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,540
Look at all that coffee.

62
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,960
For a real chill,

63
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,900
Get out of that coffee!

64
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,020
just look to the Kuiper Belt,

65
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,560
George Bush!

66
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,500
a zone just beyond Neptune,

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,760
George Bush is swimming, look out.

68
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,160
and contains roughly 100,000 giant ice blocks.

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,000
More than 50 miles in diameter each,

70
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,880
the Kuiper Belt sends a steady rain of small comets earthward.

71
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,600
If one of the big ones headed right for us,

72
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,940
that would be it for pretty much all higher forms of life.

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,700
And the local team who wanted to go to Burning Man will never get there,

74
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,500
because a meteorite's gonna wreck everything.

75
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,620
But it doesn't require a meteorite.

76
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,760
For example, there could be a massive gamma ray bursting.

77
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:56,760
Ah!

78
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,800
That would sufficiently extinguish all life on Earth.

79
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,300
Look out, the gamma ray!

80
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,540
It's a night on T1.

81
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,080
If you could watch the sky with gamma ray vision,

82
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,300
you might think you are being stalked by cosmic paparizzi.

83
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,720
Once a day or so, you'd see a bright flash appear,

84
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,840
briefly outshine everything else, then vanish.

85
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,380
These are gamma ray bursts.

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,380
Astrophysicists recently learned about these babies.

87
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,000
They originate in distant space,

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,860
distant galaxies,

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,980
and are unfathomably powerful,

90
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,160
as much as 10 quadrillion,

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,180
that's a one followed by 16 zeros,

92
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,640
times as energetic as our sun,

93
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,760
Sol,

94
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,420
head of the heating system.

95
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,840
Look, here's the big head.

96
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,620
Did you hear the theory about how,

97
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
if aliens come here,

98
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,560
that they're probably already here,

99
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,480
in a microbial form,

100
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,120
and that they're going to,

101
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,660
in intelligent form too,

102
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,420
and that they're going to take over,

103
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,220
through the internet,

104
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,900
through the world wide web.

105
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,280
That they're just,

106
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,760
that they're not microbial,

107
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,060
I mean they're nano,

108
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,280
they're like nano,

109
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,200
nano virals.

110
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,560
Oh man, how could you be in digital life form?

111
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,280
Think how many of them are required to form the physical body

112
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,000
that we know as Bill Gates.

113
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,060
God, just think of all the...

114
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,340
How many microbes, and how they hold themselves together,

115
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,620
into a semblance of a human like thing,

116
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,100
that breathes and talks.

117
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,780
Probably even eats.

118
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,360
Peanut butter cup, Dave?

119
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,320
No, no thanks.

120
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,200
I was going to have some

121
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,820
Smarthy tumor juice over there,

122
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,800
and also a piece of hemlock pie.

123
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,180
And I see the Reverend brought his slim fast with him.

124
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
You gotta drink three coffee.

125
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,280
You have to drink three or four of those every day.

126
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,520
Now why would a man of your small,

127
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,060
not your girth,

128
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,380
want to have a slim fast for lunch or breakfast?

129
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,540
Because...

130
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,540
Not as a commercial message.

131
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,260
I can't suck down the blood of a newborn kitten every hour

132
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,360
like I would like to,

133
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,440
so I have to suck down one of these damn humanoid drinks.

134
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,860
Well that...

135
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,940
It's for the protein.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,560
I have to have protein to balance the sugar and caffeine.

137
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,380
Well I think...

138
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,700
So therefore I have to eat nuts or frop

139
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,020
or some other form of protein.

140
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,560
Nuts and frops and other colloquialistic terms

141
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,540
for human bodies,

142
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,920
when you crunch off the tops of their heads

143
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,480
and dig right into that fleshy medulla oblongata.

144
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,720
Froplops, zips of tops.

145
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,160
Have you ever sliced the brain?

146
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,700
So what do you think about that?

147
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,520
Aliens and nano-aliens?

148
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,200
Well I was trying to ask you a question.

149
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,020
How could they make my biotic form

150
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,740
become digital from a digital form?

151
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,600
Actually, boys...

152
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,680
What do you mean?

153
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,860
The nano-aliens that you're talking about, Chaz,

154
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,060
are in fact the WOM supercomputer

155
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,800
predicted by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

156
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,800
described in...

157
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,780
not very much detail in either of the...

158
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,320
Bobbles, so to speak.

159
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,700
Um...

160
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,460
This WOM supercomputer is actually

161
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,600
like a zillion billion nano-alien creatures.

162
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,720
Which...

163
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,340
What is?

164
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,120
Or creature... nano-creatures.

165
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,600
They're artificial, but...

166
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,540
You know, they're as alive as any virus or bacterium.

167
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,820
And these...

168
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,760
This supercomputer of the X-est aliens,

169
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,780
because of the nano-aliens,

170
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,680
the nature of it,

171
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,880
is able to exist as a permeating gas,

172
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,780
as a paint upon the walls,

173
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,800
as the carpet underneath...

174
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,580
An all-pervading feeling.

175
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,160
As the very slim, fast in that can,

176
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
and as the can itself.

177
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,600
Or a lack of oil in one's carburetor.

178
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,080
Those are all part of the X-est computer.

179
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,920
That is how the X-est supercomputer

180
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,220
is able to instantly grant the wishes

181
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,260
of all those who paid their $30 to...

182
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,540
And simultaneously deny the heartfelt desires

183
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,400
of those it wishes to crush and conquer.

184
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,280
Following the rupture, or...

185
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,860
predicted XXXX day, 4X,

186
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,140
4XD, we like to call it,

187
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,640
coming up this July 5th, 19...

188
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,440
2000...

189
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,620
4Skin day.

190
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,020
4Skin day?

191
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,260
2001.

192
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,920
4Skin day.

193
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,000
As Bob predicted, yes.

194
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, holly hot 4Skin day,

195
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,440
when our mothers and grandpappies

196
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,500
laid down these laps...

197
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,240
Flare the skinners of Bob.

198
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,400
That would create a new hoon and mean

199
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,900
here on this consecrated ground,

200
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,320
we just decided, actually there was a vote...

201
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,880
Shouldn't we demand that everybody in the church

202
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,740
be circumcised?

203
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,280
Whoa, no...

204
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,180
Or circumvented by faith.

205
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,020
I think you got mixed up with a certain Heaven's Gate,

206
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,080
or a certain Judaism or some such thing.

207
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,620
Or a certain medical American conspiracy,

208
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,660
but no.

209
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,300
Trefonation was the...

210
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,660
We got all the meat we was born with.

211
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,920
I think everyone in this church should have a sex change

212
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,760
and then have a sex change bath.

213
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,360
Well, you've already had one.

214
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,000
No, that's been done.

215
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,000
That's already happened in this church of

216
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,940
excrescences and putridities.

217
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,900
I can't even keep up with the names of some of our ministers,

218
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,200
whether they're Mrs. This or Mr. That or...

219
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,100
Hot, stinky, in-between man-woman...

220
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,940
Maestress This or...

221
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,540
Lethargic thing, purple...

222
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,680
Yeah, Popester This and...

223
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,320
Mary Popester This and That.

224
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,880
But all of these predictions shall come true

225
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,720
as the end times unfold,

226
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,260
and I can do the whole song and dance.

227
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,560
I'm sure you've heard it a million times.

228
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,180
It's kind, and its own juice is just like a thick little salami.

229
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,900
How do we expect to get to the moon

230
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,800
if we can't even talk between two buildings?

231
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,900
How can we expect trees to communicate

232
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,160
when we cannot even talk with our own urine

233
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,240
and other bodily fluids?

234
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,020
It's just too much, I think, sometimes.

235
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,660
It always comes back to bodily fluids and genitalia.

236
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,940
That's Dave talking...

237
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,060
That's little baby talk.

238
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,700
That's sophomore unit baby talk.

239
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,600
I know, Chastity, you and I would prefer

240
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,700
to keep the conversation on a lofty,

241
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,320
rationalist, humanist level

242
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,880
and eschew this metaphysical

243
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,380
claptrap, nonsense,

244
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,440
random errantcy.

245
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,680
Genu-oriented and poo-poo-oriented individual.

246
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
But of course, that's what the audience wants.

247
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,540
That's what keeps the advertisers coming in here at WCSB.

248
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,520
Dave's poo-poo talk.

249
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,160
Okay, now I have to close up the end of the world.

250
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,220
Ah, you missed a spot.

251
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,020
Over there by the airport for your quick...

252
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,240
Now all that's left are the Dixie Chicks.

253
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:35,900
Jeez.

254
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,600
And there's some salsa here

255
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,120
you could have with those Dixie Chips.

256
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,240
Thanks, man.

257
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,140
Well, now you may laugh, but it is possible

258
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,460
a massive gamma ray burst might extinguish all life on Earth

259
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,180
and sooner than we think.

260
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,980
See, ironically, it would have been traveling

261
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,880
for millions of years through space.

262
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,940
It would only be reaching us now.

263
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,340
Oh, gosh, again, more irony.

264
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,420
That's what this show needs.

265
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,140
That's what we all need.

266
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,540
So let's get ironic, shall we?

267
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,760
In the wonderful, happy halls of ancient Ireland

268
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,060
where teensy leprechauns frolic around the dim...

269
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,780
Not again.

270
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,660
Oh, there they go.

271
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,700
Swoom back to Ireland.

272
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,580
And Godspeed...

273
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,420
We're reeling them in.

274
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,820
...little, uh, demons.

275
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
Look, I caught a ten-pounder.

276
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,320
Now, uh...

277
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,180
I'll just throw it back.

278
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,900
You're probably asking yourself,

279
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,040
what causes a gamma ray burst?

280
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,640
And you're right.

281
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,260
Sponge.

282
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,800
Well, it's not entirely sponge.

283
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,900
It may result in the merging of two collapsed stars...

284
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:40,900


285
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,380
where the sponge gets old and creaky.

286
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,600
...before the cataclysmical event, the...

287
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,100
...presence of the...

288
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,940
...200-year-old...

289
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,600
...foundering giants...

290
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,880
...might be impossible for us to...

291
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,620
...stare at.

292
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
...uh, uh...

293
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,820
...understand here on the planet Earth.

294
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,100
Yes.

295
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,580
All right.

296
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,020
So anyway, let's go back to the innocent explanation of how life really happens.

297
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,100
But once the burst begins, there will be no missing its fury.

298
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,700
At a distance of 1,000 light years, farther than most of the stars you could see in the

299
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,420
clear light...

300
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,720
Yes.

301
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,580
...it would appear about a mile away.

302
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:14,580


303
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:14,580


304
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:14,580


305
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:14,580


306
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:14,580


307
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:14,580


308
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,880
But as bright as the sun...

309
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:22,200
...earth's atmosphere would, at first, protect us from most of the burst's deadly X-rays and

310
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,080
gamma rays, but at a cost.

311
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,280
The potent radiation would cook the atmosphere, creating nitrogen oxides...

312
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,280


313
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,360
Okay, there we go.

314
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,940
Now flip the top of the atmosphere over.

315
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,280
...would destroy the ozone layer.

316
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,760
And you've got atmosphere omelet.

317
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,680
...and without the guardian ozone layer, ultraviolet rays from the sun...

318
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,060
Wow.

319
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,840
...would reach the surface at nearly full force...

320
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,180
Look at that.

321
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,240
...causing skin cancer.

322
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:42,840
Damn.

323
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,620
But they're beautiful.

324
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,180
I'm glad you're here.

325
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


326
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


327
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


328
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,180


329
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,440
I'm glad you're here.

330
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,660
...and, more seriously, killing off the tiny photosynthetic plankton in the ocean that

331
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,340
provide oxygen to the atmosphere and bolster the bottom of the foliage.

332
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:03,260
Of course, all the gamma ray bursts observed by scientists up to now have been rather distant,

333
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,780
which implies the events are rare.

334
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,780
But scientists understand so little about these explosions that it's difficult to estimate

335
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,840
the likelihood of one detonating any minute.

336
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,940
...and the first phase is hallucinogenic.

337
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
The second phase is glandular.

338
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,320
The third phase is...

339
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,420
We're talking sperm donations, clean country air, and a lot of oxygen.

340
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:44,420


341
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:44,420


342
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:44,420


343
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:44,420


344
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,300
...and a health farm packed with women.

345
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,080
Up until their birth, babies are the ultimate parasite.

346
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,900
For one indication of a female alone, caution to the wind, the eyes glaze, the glands swell,

347
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,060
and the brain freezes.

348
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,680
Breeding is an ugly thing.

349
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,300
I didn't bring you down here so they could use you.

350
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,100
I brought you down here so I could use you.

351
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,600
I am God.

352
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,820
I need your body as a dwelling place while I am here on your Earth.

353
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,400
Your feeling of helplessness is your greatest fear.

354
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,400


355
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,400


356
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,400


357
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,400


358
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,400


359
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,400


360
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,400


361
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,400


362
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,400


363
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,400


364
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,480
I am your best friend, savage.

365
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:23,940
When I am occupying your body, or in my present transitory form, I am without substance and

366
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,960
indestructible.

367
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,280
You can help me save the Earth from a terrible experience.

368
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,960
Yes, the whole Earth.

369
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,560
There is absolutely no doubt of your power to destroy.

370
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,240
I saw it.

371
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:41,400
I saw an American colonel killed, burned to a crisp by radiation with one look from this

372
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,680
man.

373
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,200
Mmm.

374
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,040
Feels like you got a real monster in there.

375
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,780
You fool!

376
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,440
You're feeding him human brains!

377
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,720
You're making him strong!

378
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,060
All I remember is feeling something sticky in my pants.

379
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,360
Yeah, but when it comes to blood in my underwear, I want to know how it got there.

380
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,660
You sucked out her brains?

381
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,500
Yeah.

382
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,980
Right through her mouth.

383
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,780
Is she dead?

384
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,460
Of course she's dead.

385
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,240
What, are you kidding?

386
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,080
Laugh for while you can, monkey boy!

387
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,180
I don't know if anybody read the Kurt Vonnegut book, Cat's Crater, famous for its

388
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:12,180


389
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,740
funny, old-fashioned, and

390
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:12,820
sultry lines.

391
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,240
I'm sorry, got to talk like this.

392
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,760
He popularized the idea of Ice 9, a form of water that is more stable than the ordinary

393
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,740
kind of water, and so it's solid at room temperature.

394
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,320
If you unleash a bit of it, then suddenly all water on Earth transforms to Ice 9 and

395
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,580
freezes solid.

396
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:38,720
Well, Ice 9 was a satirical invention, but an abrupt, disastrous phase transition is

397
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,440
a possibility.

398
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,480
He's got the phase transition again?

399
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,040
Very early in the history of the universe, according to a leading cosmological model,

400
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,380
empty space was full of energy.

401
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,940
This state of affairs called a false vacuum was really precarious.

402
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,720
A new and more stable type of vacuum appeared, and like Ice-9, it quickly took over.

403
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,660
This transition unleashed a tremendous amount of energy,

404
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,580
caused a huge runaway explosion and expansion of the cosmos.

405
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:12,120
It is possible that another, even more stable kind of vacuum mixes,

406
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,420
as the universe expands and cools tiny bubbles,

407
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,700
of this new kind of vacuum might appear.

408
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,080
They would spread at nearly the speed of light.

409
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,700
The laws of physics would change in an instant,

410
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,160
and a blast of energy would dash everything to bits.

411
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,720
And her body was transported to the roof garden for a wake.

412
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,560
However, this is considered a subliminal.

413
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,660
Not theoretical, and not as dangerous as the menace of rogue black holes

414
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,340
passing near our solar system.

415
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:52,180
Yes, it's possible that these rogue black holes could deform our orbital path around our star

416
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,980
and even send the Earth itself into freezing outer space and darkness.

417
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,100
That'd be okay. It'd be new.

418
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,660
And isn't everything new, like new experience, a good thing?

419
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,080
Well, black holes have been around since the beginning of the formation of the cosmos.

420
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,560
What about roaches?

421
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,240
Roddy McDowell.

422
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,040
The whole galaxy is full of black holes.

423
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,140
Like a piece of Swiss cheese.

424
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,860
He was playing the TVs before the negatives were wooden.

425
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,980
They are essentially collapsed stellar...

426
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,720
Oh, jeez, not again.

427
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,920
Every time you talk about that, it happens.

428
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,160
How full of tough questions...

429
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,480
There it goes. Whole societies going down the drain

430
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,280
just because Hal had to bring up collapsed systems.

431
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,640
They're called black holes for a reason.

432
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
They call them black holes...

433
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,380
Well, I guess it's kind of... You know, whatever's fair.

434
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
If 100,000...

435
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,860
If 100,000 civilizations had to die so you could hear us do the show, I guess that's okay.

436
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,640
You see, their gravity is so strong that they swallow everything,

437
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,480
while their comedy is so negative that they are unobserved by science.

438
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,480
Yeah, never mind. It's just a black hole. Never mind.

439
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,960
Even the light that might betray their presence is routinely sucked into a black hole.

440
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,640
Anybody here?

441
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,260
No, no societies are dying here. You can go now.

442
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,900
I like my coffee like I like my black holes.

443
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,040
I like my black holes.

444
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,400
Don't worry, everything's just fine.

445
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,260
Well, there are about 10 million black holes in the Milky Way.

446
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,780
I don't want to hear any snickers.

447
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,560
The Hershey Observatory confirmed this.

448
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,320
And the Clark Observatory...

449
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,520
God, the collar hung up.

450
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,920
The creamy nougat surrounding the caramel coating.

451
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:35,660
So, you see, the black hole could distort the orbital mechanics of the entire solar system very easily.

452
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,340
No!

453
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,480
By being a powerful attractor.

454
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,840
Only because you keep bringing it up.

455
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,880
But even that seems a more complicated mechanism,

456
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,400
and we should always look for a simpler way for us to be annihilated,

457
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,920
and that is probably from a giant solar flare.

458
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,880
I think you're talking about pizza by the slice.

459
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,180
They get huge, you know.

460
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,360
They get bigger than ever seen.

461
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,080
And smothers out all life.

462
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,000
Solar flares, probably known as coronal mass ejections,

463
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,320
are enormous magnetics.

464
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,840
They're magnetic outbursts on the sun

465
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,080
that bombard Earth with a torrent of high-speed subatomic particles.

466
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,660
What if, like, the Captain Crunch Peanut Butter One factory went crazy and started making too much?

467
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:20,480
Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field negate the potentially lethal effects of ordinary flares.

468
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,940
But while looking through old astronomical records,

469
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,140
worried scientists found evidence that some perfectly normal-looking sunlight stars

470
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,440
can brighten up briefly by up to a factor of 20.

471
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,060
These stellar flickers are...

472
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,820
They're only about 11, but...

473
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,060
Yeah, they can do 20.

474
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,620
Millions of times more powerful than their common cousins.

475
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,200
Within a few hours, a super flare on the sun could fry Earth

476
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,940
and begin disintegrating the ozone layer.

477
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,400
Not again.

478
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,580
Although there is persuasive evidence that our sun doesn't engage in such antics,

479
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,860
scientists don't know why super flares happen at all,

480
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,100
or whether our sun could exhibit milder but still disruptive autistic behavior.

481
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,880
And while too much...

482
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,680
solar activity could be deadly,

483
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,080
too little of it is problematic as well.

484
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,300
And so, the sun could become not brighter, but nearly 1% dimmer.

485
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,720
Might not sound like much, but a similar downturn in the sun could send us into another ice age.

486
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,740
We'd freeze to death.

487
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:33,800
There is evidence that decreased solar activity contributed to 17 of the 19 major cold episodes on Earth...

488
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,400
It's cold out here on the shelf.

489
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,840
...in the last 10,000 years.

490
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,960
As freezing night descends on the lunar surface of the planet.

491
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,160
The sun is going to be the most powerful and most powerful thing in the universe.

492
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,140
It's going to be the most powerful thing in the universe.

493
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,220
The sun is going to be the most powerful thing in the universe.

494
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,800
It's going to be the most powerful thing in the universe.

495
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,280
Did you hear about the sun activity too?

496
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,300
The sun is like going through like a total peak time right now.

497
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
Yeah, George Jr. is really...

498
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,160
He's as popular as the father was.

499
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,180
But it is.

500
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,700
There's like a website.

501
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,820
It flares up a lot, I've heard.

502
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,720
There's like a...

503
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,580
God, what's a website?

504
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,200
There's a website.

505
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:11,620


506
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,820
They're more like little pubescent rockets than flares.

507
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,480
It's a really cool website too.

508
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,000
That's all about it.

509
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,840
It's got...

510
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,100
You can get a...

511
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,440
You can get a real-time sun screen saver now.

512
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,580
I waited off one of those.

513
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,660
You used to put up four or five different pictures of the sun.

514
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,640
Yeah, I should have sent it to you.

515
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,760
We quit doing that because it was so disturbing.

516
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,480
Why did you...

517
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,660
It appeared that huge, gigantic shotguns were blasting away at the sun.

518
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,100
I think those were Masonic...

519
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,060
No, it's going through some pretty big stuff right now.

520
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,480
...subliminals from the Masonics who are running the NASA corporations.

521
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,140
Wait a minute.

522
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:53,420
The engine that creates all warmth for the whole solar system is having a little trouble right now, did you say?

523
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,160
Supposedly.

524
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,720
It's more than a little trouble.

525
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,960
Now, could this possibly be the coming of prophecy, of all the prophecies of every primitive...

526
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,780
It's a rich form of frothy turbulence...

527
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,740
...form of humanoid...

528
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,800
...you and your mom and dad and everyone who uses it.

529
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:08,800


530
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,700
...who you don't even know is going to want to...

531
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,060
...the prophecies of the homies...

532
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,620
...of the Aztecs...

533
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:13,800
...of the Aztecs...

534
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
...the Incas and the Subgenii...

535
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,560
...as it salutes itself in the sky like a burning lantern...

536
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,140
...that all things, that the great carpet of reality would be rolled up...

537
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,560
...so smooth and soft...

538
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:34,420
...taken outside, hung over a tree limb and batted by a gigantic old hag with a broom standing on the back of an infinite number of turtles...

539
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,800
...and that she would spray it with an anti-lyse...

540
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,780
...and that sort of lotion put on her...

541
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,240
...the lotion...

542
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,680
...right, and then it would be rolled, laid back down and all things would begin anew in the new age...

543
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,360
...or the new...

544
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,940
...um, I forget the...

545
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,480
...the new Navajo Trail...

546
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,440
...the new Navajo Trail...

547
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,780
...in the church of the subgenius...

548
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,620
...that leads off into the cosmos...

549
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,280
...these silly primitive superstitions are understood in a scientific way as the time intersection...

550
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,580
...which will happen when the great Mobius strip or infinity sign that is...

551
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,260
...the road of time...

552
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,760
...in the ancient days...

553
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
...it has to cross in the middle, right?

554
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,040
...well, we're adhering that...

555
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,380
...all that at times, man, you don't mind...

556
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,380
...cross over point...

557
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:15,620
...yeah...

558
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,680
...see, I can...

559
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,440
...I wanna set up a little deli right there at that crossroad...

560
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,480
...people would say, well, what are you gonna do if they make...

561
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,580
...a little general store...

562
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,440
...it's like, well, I think the exes are kind of wondering what the hell's gonna happen when the time intersection occurs...

563
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,260
...listener...

564
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,440
...so what are you doing about it, are you ready?

565
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
...go last year, you was ready for it...

566
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,260
...hey, hey, stop playing with the machine...

567
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,320
...all their...

568
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,520
...hey, over the...

569
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,220
...liquor's stored up, their froth was stored up for Y2K...

570
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,060
...now...

571
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,840
...now...

572
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,040
...they're not worried about nothing, they ain't worried about next day...

573
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,760
...ain't worried about time intersection, about...

574
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,060
...no worries...

575
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,880
...fine rupture, they don't care about nothing...

576
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,500
...about time...

577
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,640
...they're gonna get drunk...

578
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,320
...and party...

579
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,620
...time doesn't exist...

580
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,420
...why should it...

581
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,560
...and how can it...

582
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,060
...they're just gonna get drunk...

583
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,680
...softly...

584
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,440
...softly...

585
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,000
...hard G by radio...

586
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,820
...he's gonna go out there and he's drunk...

587
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,960
...I know you...

588
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,660
...you're gonna see H.S. Willis coming from the top of your brain...

589
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,920
...well, buddy, you know...

590
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,900
...that don't cut no ice with me...

591
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,780
...speaking of ice cutters...

592
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,540
...I don't hear that...

593
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,040
...you remember...

594
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,340
...you remember the time Jack and I were out...

595
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,400
...and we were so far damn far out there...

596
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,700
...that when he...

597
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,180
...we dug the hole, you know, and stuck the...

598
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,840
...squid giggin'...

599
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,580
...we were squid giggin'...

600
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,380
...and we stuck the little shack over the top of the little hole in the ice, you know...

601
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,100
...and we're sittin' there poppin' back a few beer, you know...

602
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,120
...and I...

603
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,340
...and I guess one guy...

604
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,300
...this guy, you know, he's talkin' about Mario Lemieux and all this hockey crap...

605
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,980
...all night...

606
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,960
...and I says, I don't like hockey, you know, so...

607
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,700
...I pull this little, like, harpoon device I got...

608
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,180
...you know, it's about four and a half inches long...

609
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,920
...you get it from K-Tel Ronco, any of them guys, you can order away for it...

610
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,480
...and I shove it right into his thigh...

611
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,120
...and rip those, you know, those, uh...

612
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,280
...real thick muscles near the top of his knee, you know...

613
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,600
...you're a prankster, Dave...

614
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,080
...I tell ya...

615
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,640
...we had a good laugh after that...

616
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,300
...we had years and years of stories about that...

617
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,200
...and, um...

618
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,540
...I guess, well, it got him a little railed up, you know...

619
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,380
...so did he kill you then, now, Dave?

620
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,740
I think I know where the nano-aliens live...

621
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,960
...what do you think of me?

622
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Why, they're the leprechauns of...

623
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,740
...Celtic legend...

624
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,580
They're the wee folk?

625
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,240
...pink penises, red hearts, and purple bruises...

626
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,740
The Dave brains...

627
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,700
Brains...

628
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,820
...frolicking over the hillsides of the Emery...

629
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,180
...Emerald Isle...

630
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,560
...the Emerald Palace...

631
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,520
...Emerald City...

632
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,820
...the Emerald Mushrooms...

633
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,040
...that dirty, perky, shark-a-pat, black-bucked-a-murton...

634
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,360
...and the...

635
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,800
...wharton-filla-buck-a-burton...

636
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,880
...perkaluma-burton-buck-a-burton...

637
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,440
...and the...

638
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,360
...bush-a-mat-a-lore!

639
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,540
Well, then, of course, there's the possibility of the...

640
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,920
...sudden and unexpected reversal of Earth's magnetic field.

641
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
It could happen.

642
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,960
Yes, indeed, the North and South Poles could flip and then flop.

643
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:03,840
The last Dutch reversal was 780,000 years ago, in early October...

644
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,360
...so we may be overdue for a while.

645
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,020
...or another one.

646
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:14,160
Worse, the strength of our magnetic field has decreased about 5% in the past century.

647
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:14,960
It's a monster name!

648
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,640
Why worry in an age when GPS has made compasses obsolete?

649
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,980
Well, the magnetic field deflects particle storms and cosmic rays from the Sun...

650
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,480
...as well as even more energetic subatomic particles from deep space.

651
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,620
He keeps talking, but look, monster!

652
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,060
Without our typical magnetic shield, these particles would ping into us...

653
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:42,040
...and strike Earth's atmosphere, eroding the already beleaguered beagle of the ozone layer.

654
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,500
Well, there's always a guy that keeps talking, and then there's the monster.

655
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,840
Well, what did you expect it to do?

656
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,560
Grunt, grunt, stamp, snort?

657
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,160
Yeah, that comes then, after the guy keeps talking, then...

658
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,280
...monster destroy city!

659
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,180
We have evidence of such a monster before.

660
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,520
It happened many thousands of years ago.

661
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,860
Hmm, little Mimiko.

662
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,220
Here is Mimiko's original burial.

663
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,220
Many creatures navigate by magnetic reckoning.

664
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,940
A magnetic reversal might cause these giant monsters to be confused...

665
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,140
...and wander about aimlessly, bumping into each other.

666
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Oh, excuse me.

667
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,980
There are no identifiable fossil effects from previous flops and flips.

668
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,240
This is most curious.

669
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:32,040
But still, a disaster that kills a quarter of the population like the Black Plague in Europe...

670
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,200
...would hardly register as little ol' blip in the future.

671
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,420
This is a teeny weeny.

672
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,020
Black or white?

673
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,940
I can snort it back, and then cut it back, and rock a lot of...

674
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,520
...boots!

675
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,680
I figured, you know, I just needed some help.

676
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,320
I ordered my body.

677
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,580
Within 11 days, I had lost my waist and my hips.

678
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,400
Today, I'm wearing those pants about a year and a half now.

679
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,640
My kids aren't hurting me anymore.

680
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,840
My knees hit my face, and definitely in my stomach and my legs.

681
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,160
It's incredible.

682
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,020
So what are you waiting for?

2-6-8-4-2-4-6.

686
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,040
And now...

687
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,220
Hi, I'm looking mighty good there.

688
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,680
Ooh, yeah.

689
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,560
I injured my rotator gears ago.

690
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,120
What happened?

691
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,580
Finally, it's bothering me anymore.

692
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,140
Well, thanks. I used to struggle on my knees.

693
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,780
On my knees.

694
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,020
Low.

695
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,700
Low.

696
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,280
Low.

697
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:30,780
Low.

698
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,220
Low.

699
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,900
Low.

700
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,460
Low.

701
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:33,980


702
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:34,880
Low.

703
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,000
Low.

704
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,420
Low.

705
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,960
Low. Low. Low.�

706
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,460
Well, thanks.

707
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,060
You're fine.

708
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:59,100
In 1783, the LACI volcano in Iceland erupted, spitting out 3 cubic miles of lava, floods,

709
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,760
ash, and fumes in theUNT الإ hah آم Recall the lava 묻чи

710
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:00,760


711
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:00,760


712
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:05,000
wiped out 9,000 people and 80% of the livestock.

713
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,720
The ensuing starvation killed a quarter of Iceland's population.

714
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,040
Atmospheric dust caused winter temperatures to plunge by 9 degrees

715
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,540
in the newly independent United States.

716
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,760
And that was just a baby's burp compared with what the Earth can do.

717
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,360
65 million years ago, a plume of hot rock from the mantle

718
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,680
burst through the crust in what is now India.

719
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,940
Eruptions raged century after century,

720
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,880
ultimately unleashing a quarter-cubic million miles of lava.

721
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,540
That's the Laki eruption 100,000 times as large.

722
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,060
Some scientists still say that this, not an asteroid, killed the dinosaurs.

723
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,680
An earlier, even larger event in Siberia occurred

724
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,660
just about the time of the Permian-Triassic extinction.

725
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,360
The most thorough extermination known to paleontology.

726
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,160
At that time, 95% of all species were wiped out.

727
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,140
Sulfurous, stinking volcanic gases produce acid rains.

728
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:18,480
And then chlorine-bearing compounds present yet another threat

729
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,420
to the fragile ozone layer.

730
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,700
A noxious bubbling brew all around.

731
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,340
While they are causing short-term...

732
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,000
...term destruction...

733
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,560
...there for you!

734
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,600
...volcanoes also fart out carbon dioxide...

735
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:32,940
Jeez.

736
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,060
...that yields long-term greenhouse gas effect warning.

737
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,960
The last big pulse of flood-based alt-volcanism built the Columbia River Plateau

738
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,560
about 17 million years ago.

739
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,200
We're ripe for it.

740
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,340
Look at the size of it.

741
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,100
Yes, friends, we are ripe indeed.

742
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,000
Ripe to throw that loaf of this planet overboard.

743
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,000
And we've been listening to...

744
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,500
Well, it's been kind of an unusual hour of slack

745
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,800
in that a couple of things fell into my lap

746
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,280
and it suddenly turned into an end-of-the-world show

747
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:16,460
starring the KPFA subgenius show from around 9-2000

748
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:22,140
with Dr. Howell Robbins going on and on about the end

749
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,940
and the various ways we can meet it

750
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,340
and puzzling evidence filling in.

751
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,280
In the blanks.

752
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,140
And of course, friends, as always,

753
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,800
a lot of Einstein's Secret Orchestra Swamp Radio

754
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,240
from WCSB in Cleveland

755
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,140
with Professor Chaz Smith,

756
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,220
Dances with Rockets,

757
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,200
a lonesome Cowboy Dave,

758
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,380
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

759
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,140
And the clips and little media barrage bits that we've been hearing in between

760
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,920
are by our friend New Monet,

761
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,060
Saint New Monet,

762
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,540
who posted those on all binary slack.

763
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,640
And, friends, we'll see you at www.

764
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,520
subgenius.com.

765
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,960
But hurry, because it's all coming to a close

766
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,240
so very, very quickly, how are you?

767
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,860
Well, we could be killed by global epidemics

768
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,820
because if the Earth doesn't do us in,

769
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,160
our fellow organisms might be up to the task.

770
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,400
Germs and people have always coexisted,

771
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,880
but occasionally the balance gets out of whack.

772
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,360
Like when they had the Black Plague

773
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,320
killing the...

774
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,660
one European in four

775
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,000
during the 14th century.

776
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,820
Influenza took at least 20 million lives

777
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,480
between 1918 and 1919.

778
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,960
Now we got the AIDS epidemic

779
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,780
producing a similar death toll

780
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,700
and still going strong.

781
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,380
From 1990 to 1992,

782
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,640
reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

783
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,260
mortality from infectious disease in the United States

784
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,140
rose like a balloon,

785
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:52,980
58%.

786
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,600
And meanwhile,

787
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,640
old diseases like cholera

788
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,320
and measles,

789
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,300
are coming back.

790
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,980
They've developed resistance

791
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,320
to all the high-tech drugs

792
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,520
we've been throwing their way.

793
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,160
Intensive agricultural land development

794
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,160
is bringing humans closer to animal pathogens

795
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,740
and stinky germs that rest

796
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,080
in huge mounds of animal feces

797
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,540
cast off from factory farms

798
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,880
where giant chickens meet a hideous fate.

799
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,120
There was nice giant chickens, too.

800
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,340
There was the ones in the commercials.

801
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,900
The grimmest possibility

802
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,720
would be the emergence of a strain

803
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,520
that spreads so fast

804
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,620
we are caught off guard

805
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,240
that resists all chemical means of control.

806
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,880
Perhaps as a result of our stirring

807
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,360
the ecological pot.

808
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,620
It's not our fault again.

809
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,100
Thank you.

810
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,700
It's the Our Fault Show.

811

www.ourfaultshow.com

821
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,840
bore into your skin and tune their way right to your heart.

822
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,160
Right to your fart?

823
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:33,880
Heart.

824
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,280
At present, atmospheric gases trap enough local heat

825
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,780
close to the surface to keep things comfy,

826
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,300
but increase the global temperature a bit

827
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,840
and there could be a bad feedback effect,

828
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,260
with water evaporating faster right in your face,

829
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,460
freezing water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas

830
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,760
which traps more heat, which drives carbon dioxide from the rocks,

831
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,220
which drives temperatures still higher.

832
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,940
Earth could end up much like Venus,

833
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:09,160
where the high on a typical day is a sizzling 900 degrees Fahrenheit.

834
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,540
It would probably take a lot of warming

835
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,560
to initiate such a runaway greenhouse effect,

836
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:20,660
but scientists have no clue where exactly the tipping point lies.

837
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,000
They have no clue.

838
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,340
They're smart guys.

839
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,000
They are smart, but they don't know,

840
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,680
because this is a situation which has never been experienced before.

841
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:40,080
Earlier today, Chaz was giving a sort of a trance lecture

842
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:47,060
that ranged from the protoplasmic beginnings of all life

843
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,000
to space exploration.

844
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,180
And this lovely dome here is certainly a good,

845
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,680
a good place to think about, about that,

846
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,440
because if we're not lucky,

847
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:03,200
all of our descendants will live inside little puffer domes like this,

848
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,380
because the, there won't be the right kind of air outside.

849
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,680
And if we, if we are lucky,

850
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,600
ah, yes, oh baby, do that again.

851
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:23,300
I say, oh, I say, oh, hit me one more time, please, darling.

852
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,200
Oh, oh, oh.

853
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,420
You know, ah, you know, if you increase the oxygen in here too much,

854
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,520
a spark like that can cause an explosion.

855
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,220
We don't be fried like those poor brave astronauts

856
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,560
on one of those ill-fated missions.

857
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,280
Turn up the oxygen, man.

858
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,500
On the other hand, if you turn the oxygen up, you get kind of high.

859
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,080
Well, let us be first.

860
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:51,500
Yes.

861
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:04,840
Now, ah, remember, the, the air outside is not exactly the same as inside,

862
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,780
so you might want to go through that decompression chamber first.

863
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,080
Oh, man.

864
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,040
Jeez.

865
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:16,920
These kids just go right in and out from earth atmosphere to outside atmosphere.

866
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,360
Doesn't even bother.

867
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,860
Ah, ah.

868
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:20,860


869
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,900
I have to wear a mask to go out there.

870
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,680
Yeah.

871
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,720
It's, it's hard to keep up with evolution, man.

872
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,380
It was hard enough just to crawl out of that pond and use them lungs.

873
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,640
That hurt.

874
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,200
These kids don't know nothing.

875
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:43,540
You never did have to crawl out of that ocean and use them lungs the first time.

876
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:51,480
And, and that first time we had to invent murder, that was hell.

877
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:51,480


878
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:51,480


879
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:51,960
Hell, baby.

880
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,040
But man's got to eat.

881
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,360
You got to get that, you got to build that spaceship somehow.

882
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:07,800
And if you have to start by chipping flimped rocks together, well, that's a start.

883
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,880
Better than sitting on your butt, scratching your butt.

884
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,820
Or is it, friends?

885
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:19,660
This wouldn't have been better for early man to have merely sat upon its butt, scratching

886
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,460
that butt, and then, you know, just, you know, just, you know, just, you know, just, you

887
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:27,620
know, pinching its nose and fleas off at each other and rutting like happy little monkeys

888
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,460
in the wilderness.

889
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,760
Instead of all this progress.

890
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:37,460
Which, while it has brought us these ants and things, they're still not working right,

891
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:44,900
and we have to breathe this processed atmosphere or else end up like those new breed of kids

892
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,040
with the giant lungs and stuff.

893
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,060
Don't.

894
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,440
Sometimes I get mixed up in kids' tool.

895
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,600
I can't even remember what century I am in.

896
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,560
I remember that one time when we invented legs.

897
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,980
That was out of necessity, believe me.

898
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:13,640
No, but, you know, I mean, there's some people think that, that, uh...

899
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,600
Well, I used to thank Chaz.

900
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:22,040
Now, we've been exhorting people to build their own ships just in case the aliens don't save our butts.

901
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,180
But I used to say to people, well, hell, we got a whole other planet right here on this one.

902
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:32,480
That's a lot closer than Mars or the Moon and a lot more hospitable, that being the ocean.

903
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,900
Oh, we got a whole other two planets worth left to pollute.

904
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,100
If that's what we wanted to do.

905
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,220
He's a maniac.

906
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,560
Out to rule the world.

907
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,400
I'm gonna make you understand.

908
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,420
I love you.

909
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,320
A similar biological disaster would be a complete ecosystem collapse.

910
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,460
Maybe this skin cream will help me out.

911
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,160
Images of slaughtered elephants and burning rainforests, uh, well, they get your attention.

912
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:07,440
But the big problem, the overall loss of biodiversity, is a lot less visible and a lot more serious.

913
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:15,080
Billions of years of evolution have produced a world in which every organism's welfare is intricately intertwined

914
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,860
with that of countless other species.

915
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:23,800
A recent study of Isle Royale National Park in Lake Superior offers an example.

916
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,460
Snowy winters encourage wolves to hunt in larger packs.

917
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,400
So they kill more moose.

918
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:41,400
The decline in moose population allows more balsam fir saplings to live since they're not nibbled and chewed by the marauding mooses, or meese.

919
00:45:41,400 --> 00:46:02,080
The fir trees pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, which in turn influences the climate, as the CO2 is sucked from the air, replacing diverse wild plants with just two varieties of crops, transporting plants and animals and introducing new and dangerous chemicals into the environment.

920
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:11,380
At least 30,000 species vanish every year from humi activity, which means we are living in the midst of one of the greatest mass extinctions in Earth's history.

921
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,060
And it's all the fault of the Republican Party.

922
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:25,740
Now, while we are extinguishing natural species, we're also creating new species through genetic tamperings in weird secret labs.

923
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:32,960
Genetically modified crops can be hardier, tastier, and more nutritious. And they can be intensely radioactive.

924
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,360
Engineered microbes might ease our health problems.

925
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:45,160
And gene therapy offers an elusive promise of fixing fundamental defects in our DNA.

926
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,400
Then, there are the possible downsides.

927
00:46:48,460 --> 00:47:05,020
Although there is no evidence indicating genetically modified crops are unsafe, there still are signs that the genes from modified crops can leak out somehow and get on you and find their way into other species.

928
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,480
Engineered crops might also foster insecticide resistance.

929
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,960
Yeah, we're a colony of bonnets.

930
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,760
And wannabe bonnets.

931
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,620
Earthman, here's a cappuccino.

932
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:22,140
The resulting super weeds and super giant insects could further destabilize the stressed global ecosystem.

933
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,840
Earthman, don't call the show.

934
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,580
Altered microbes might grow to a large size and prove to be unexpectedly difficult to control.

935
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,620
Another 510 area.

936
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,680
But we're talking about robobonics.

937
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,480
But robobabs, which is a different character than the real fashion babs.

938
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,800
But a similar version up in Santa Rosa.

939
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,260
Who's listening right now?

940
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,860
The movie.

941
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:49,140
And then try to put together an airborne version of the robobabs virus.

942
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,940
Now there's a showstopper for you.

943
00:47:54,180 --> 00:48:01,820
Yeah, well, those are all very large-scale causes of mass death.

944
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:06,400
The holocaustic, uh, scenotaph of the human race.

945
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,020
All that show, just throw it away.

946
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,320
I have been told you are planning a child sacrifice.

947
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,120
They whip you like a beast.

948
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,380
I am a slave.

949
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,840
What would you have me do?

950
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:31,200
Well, if there's one thing I have to get myself, something that will tell me when I've succeeded.

951
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,020
What's that?

952
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,140
A live giant grasshopper.

953
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,640
This beast isn't only electric.

954
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,340
It's intensely radioactive.

955
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:44,680
We have just received a report from America that mountains of dead fish are washing ashore along the coast from Maine to Florida.

956
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,260
Does everything in Texas spit toxic cud?

957
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,820
When you ask for something as special as a brain, even Buddha is going to give you the runaround.

958
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,180
She's dead, master.

959
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,960
You've been a very bad boy today.

960
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,560
Are you ready to accept my domination?

961
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,060
How's the fillet?

962
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,100
Tender?

963
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,860
You're eating one of my trainees that didn't quite work out.

964
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,320
She wants to be in a freak show.

965
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,740
It's a freak country.

966
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,560
What about a particle accelerator mishap?

967
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,520
It could happen.

968
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,280
Yep.

969
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:27,900
You know, Ted Kaczynski, the notorious Unabomber, raved, they said, that a particle accelerator experiment could set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world.

970
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,860
Surprisingly, many sober-minded scientists have had the same thought.

971
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:38,800
Normally, their anxieties come up during private meetings with corporate bosses.

972
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,200
Yep, they get really nervous.

973
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:58,540
Recently, their questions went public when London Sunday Times reported that the relativistic heavy ion collider, they call it RIC, on Long Island, New York, might create a micro-world with a subatomic black hole that would slowly nibble away.

974
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,440
Our precious freedoms and our planet.

975
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:06,660
Alternately, it might create exotic bits of altered matter that would shoot right through you.

976
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:15,320
They're called strangelets, and they would obliterate whatever ordinary matter they met to assuage RIC's jittery neighbors.

977
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:21,480
The lab's director convened a panel that rejected both scenarios as pretty much impossible.

978
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,900
Just for good measure, the passenger also complained.

979
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:34,140
When they dismissed the possibility that RIC would trigger a phase transition in the cosmic vacuum energy.

980
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:44,220
That's what I spoke of before, that the vacuum would collapse and become celestial ice nine, and we'd all be frozen forever in eternal amber.

981
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,140
Sure, whatever, what about the sponge?

982
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:53,460
Well, the sponge machine is not nearly powerful enough to make a black hole or destabilize the vacuum.

983
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,860
But we can always build a bigger accelerator.

984
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,620
Confborough

985
00:50:59,060 --> 00:50:59,700
Oh!

986
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:07,200
Oh, Fernando! Your mother raised my dog!

987
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,420
Not all of us.

988
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,200
Oh! I hate Fernando!

989
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:19,720
But it might not be big things that bring us down because we could also have a nanotechnology disaster.

990
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,900
You see, right now, scientists are working on developing what they call nanobots.

991
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:25,420
Nanobots.

992
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,220
Millions of teensy-teensy robots that get into your bloodstream.

993
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,040
Nano, nano.

994
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,680
Nanobots.

995
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:31,800
Nanobots.

996
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,180
I didn't read that.

997
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,960
They're nano.

998
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,460
I saw it.

999
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,100
I saw it.

1000
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,740
It was an article.

1001
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,840
Was it a favorable article?

1002
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,860
Fairly favorable.

1003
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,300
A punk called Chicken John.

1004
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,200
Yeah, well.

1005
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,900
So you see, these tiny nanobots could be designed by artificial intelligences,

1006
00:51:54,020 --> 00:52:00,720
which could continue to refine the nanobot design until the human body would be considered obsolete

1007
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:06,440
and would be instantly chewed to flinders by millions of jittering nanobots.

1008
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,440
Not again.

1009
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,180
I hate it when that happens.

1010
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:14,820
Or, conversely, environmental toxins could squirt into the atmosphere.

1011
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,940
As in Bhopal, India.

1012
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,480
You know, they're even finding pollution in the snows of Antarctica.

1013
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,840
The earth is hopelessly contaminated.

1014
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,960
When giant monsters are waking up with anger in their hearts.

1015
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,060
Yes, indeed.

1016
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,600
Of course, there's also global war.

1017
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,620
A nuclear war would be harmful.

1018
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,800
Let's admit that.

1019
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,900
And it would probably be very harmful for the human species.

1020
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:45,620
Together, the U.S. and Russia still have 19,000 active nuclear warheads.

1021
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,720
They don't say I'm doctrinal to me.

1022
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,000
He hasn't got real feet.

1023
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,520
He's got those weird, like, pod things.

1024
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,760
How can you believe a guy like that?

1025
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,180
Look at his ears.

1026
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,120
They've got, like, the weird radio materials hanging right out.

1027
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,840
I can't even listen to that guy.

1028
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,520
But seriously, you know, if we look at prophecy, like as many do,

1029
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,320
the weekly world news there at the checkout line,

1030
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:17,140
as we thumb through Revelation X and the Book of the Subgenius,

1031
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,820
using our second or third foreskin thumb,

1032
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,880
we're entering a glorious new age, a new era,

1033
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:30,820
of diseases, of volcanic eruptions that decimate entire states.

1034
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,720
Earthquakes, incredible man-made disasters,

1035
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,180
of gigantic stockpiles of nerve gases released into the atmosphere,

1036
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,400
blowing hither and yon.

1037
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,040
All flapping amongst the small union children

1038
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,960
as they gathered by the gates to sing songs.

1039
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,400
The madness of the Middle Ages will pale.

1040
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:53,860
They were all taken out and buried.

1041
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:53,900
They were all buried.

1042
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,000
They were all buried.

1043
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,000


1044
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,000


1045
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:58,540
In comparison to the marvelous, futuristic new age that's coming,

1046
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:03,860
we know that you, the listener, are interested in the future,

1047
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,420
or you wouldn't be listening to this show.

1048
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,980
You who are hearing my voice now,

1049
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,080
those of you who live into the new age

1050
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:18,020
will see such wonders as rubber cities,

1051
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,000
gigantic dominoes the size of a human head,

1052
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,020
thousands of skyscrapers,

1053
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,060
all set to go off and fall at once

1054
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,340
on July 5th, 2001

1055
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,480
at Brushwood Campground in German New York.

1056
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,600
The device is all done, master.

1057
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,200
All is in order now.

1058
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:47,480
You see, such wonders as glass lipstick,

1059
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,960
growth books,

1060
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,920
We like the glass lipstick.

1061
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,180
We like the glass lipstick.

1062
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,560
Sin pills.

1063
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,620
I have taken many, master.

1064
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,420
What shall I do now?

1065
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,640
Other miracles of science,

1066
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:07,040
such as the robotic butt puffler.

1067
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,280
The eye condenser, the amazing eye condenser,

1068
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,480
takes what you see or what you have seen

1069
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,260
and procreates into a small, proclivitous package.

1070
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,160
It can be owned by a member of your family unit,

1071
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,080
now for a limited time,

1072
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:21,900
but it's not a good idea.

1073
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,960
It's not in the neutral space.

1074
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,640
These are completely designed for a modern you today

1075
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,640
in the neutral space.

1076
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,220
If you care or if you dare,

1077
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,100
just step into the box, reach your hand out.

1078
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,280
The influence will go on and on.

1079
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,960
Are you ready for this future?

1080
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,860
Is this really the future that you want?

1081
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,740
This is food for thought, ladies and gentlemen.

1082
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,520
And until next week,

1083
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,660
you can keep your hat on tight,

1084
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,940
your dart to the wind,

1085
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:50,860
your dart deep to it,

1086
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,200
and your sack in the saddle.

1087
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,360
Think about it.

1088
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:55,860
.

1089
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,340
Well, Mom, I didn't want to go, man.

1090
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,260
I didn't want to go, man.

1091
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,740
Well, the first thing you said, if I didn't go,

1092
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,260
then I wouldn't be...

1093
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:09,780
I didn't want to go.

1094
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,920
You forced me to go.

1095
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,320
Well, the first thing you said...

1096
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:16,660
.

1097
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,960
.

1098
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:19,900
.

1099
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,140
.

1100
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:30,140


1101
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:30,300
.

1102
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:30,300


1103
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:30,300


1104
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:30,340
.

1105
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,600
.

1106
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,060
.

1107
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:38,100
.

1108
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:38,200
.

1109
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,880
.

1110
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,460
.

1111
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,140
.

1112
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:48,100
I'm so sorry that I broke your heart.

1113
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:54,200
Please don't leave my side.

1114
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:04,000
Take me home, you silly boy,

1115
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:10,600
because I'm still in love with you.

1116
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,960
You

1117
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,320

1118
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,100

1119
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,080
Got your pencil ready?
