00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,280
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,700
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,200
Is specially designed only to be played on radio station

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,980
And only in the city of

6
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,340
Open the pod bay doors

7
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,860
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't do that

8
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,200
Now my confidant's alone in a drift

9
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,240
In endless black and white dotted mist

10
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,080
I'll help you and heal you and love you, she hissed

11
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,060
Then slip from the shadows

12
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,100
And gave him a kiss

13
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,120
In time there means

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,040
Nothing at all in space

15
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,220
The earth is quiet and small

16
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,780
Then I thought I'd call

17
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,360
A glimpse of you

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,280
Hiding somewhere in the red

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:53,160
Hello, how do you read me?

20
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,960
Hello, how do you read me?

21
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,300
Can you hear me?

22
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,340
I'm relevant to you

23
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,540
I mean you

24
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,220
One pilot thought he flew alone

25
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,380
In endless black

26
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,500
Nowhere from home

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,640
Then shadows sizzled and crackled and spun

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,980
And again she slithered from out of the dark

29
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,960
Who are you? he thought

30
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,020
But dared not speak

31
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,760
She answered his question without

32
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,040
Missing a word

33
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,500
I'm you, she says, I come from within

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,660
And now you've unleashed what you're not to begin

35
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,040
In time that means nothing at all

36
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,040
In space, the earth is quiet and small

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,240
Then I thought I'd call a glimpse of you

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,960
I'm somewhere in your edge of the world

39
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,280
In your edge of the world

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,280


41
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:11,600
帶

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,720
Hello, Diese sind

43
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:14,760
Hello сюда

44
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,620
在顧實

45
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:22,940
Hello Hebrew

46
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:22,960
Hello Hebrew

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,120
Hello, how do you read me?

48
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,900
Do you read me now?

49
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,060
Do you read me now?

50
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,780
Open the front door.

51
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,560
That's more than a sound.

52
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,700
Open the front door.

53
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,700
Do you read me now?

54
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,860
Oh, how do you read me?

55
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,120
Open the front door.

56
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,100
Do you read me now?

57
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,620
Do you read me now?

58
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,800
Do you read me now?

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,040
Do you read me now?

60
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,100
Do you read me now?

61
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,780
Open the front door.

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,700
Do you read me now?

63
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,360
Do you read me now?

64
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,860
Open the front door.

65
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,160
Do you read me now?

66
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,840
Do you read me now?

67
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,560
Do you read me now?

68
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:52,900
Do you read me now?

69
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:52,900


70
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,860
Oh, wow.

71
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,580
Oh, wow.

72
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,260
Can you read me now?

73
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,040
Can you read me now?

74
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,760
Affirmative, Dave.

75
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
I read you.

76
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,860
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

77
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,680
I'm sorry, Dave.

78
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,040
I'm afraid I can't do that.

79
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,700
Oh, yes, dear friends.

80
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,060
Well,

81
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,880
this is your...

82
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,800
You're a reporter,

83
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,540
Reverend Ivan Stang,

84
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,600
on the scene

85
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,960
at XXX Day.

86
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,560
It appears

87
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,700
that we have, what,

88
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,140
about six and a half hours left

89
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,860
of human reality.

90
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,340
Either that or Bob's prophecy

91
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,240
was once again all screwed up.

92
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,280
Hard to imagine.

93
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Slightly possible.

94
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,340
A little bit less suspense

95
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,500
in the air this year

96
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,620
than there has been before.

97
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,920
And

98
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,700
I am apparently

99
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,880
probably the only one

100
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:22,880


101
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:22,880


102
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,040
or the only individual here

103
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,200
who is still

104
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,040
able to walk, talk.

105
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,300
We're praying that these people

106
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,100
can make it through.

107
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,720
There's a small army,

108
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,260
a small horde of subgeniuses

109
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,520
who've been able to survive

110
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,960
the test we had on Sunday morning

111
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,460
that wiped out most of them.

112
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:42,940
Whoo!

113
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,620
These are the few, the strong,

114
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,160
my friends, who have managed

115
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,660
to make it thus far

116
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,120
to the actual real X Day.

117
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,560
Of course, we had that decoy

118
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,580
to get rid of the press

119
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,860
and the detectives,

120
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,560
the spies from the CIA

121
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,080
and so forth, all the plants.

122
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,440
There are probably only

123
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,020
one or two of them left here now

124
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,180
and they're too drunk to care.

125
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,980
Praise Bob!

126
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,380
Praise Bob!

127
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
Look at the humans,

128
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,960
all the boring humans.

129
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,400
There's so many humans.

130
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,600
Wish they'd all go away.

131
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,360
They like the same things.

132
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,600
They laugh at the same things.

133
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,940
They like Bruce Springsteen.

134
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,080
I wish they'd just die.

135
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,500
They'd worship conformity.

136
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,020
To me,

137
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,900
it's deformity.

138
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,240
They don't even deserve pity

139
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,380
for being so blank.

140
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,820
They're proud of their sameness.

141
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,240
They're blind to their baneness.

142
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,560
They're tunnelers and detainers

143
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,840
can't somebody open their eyes.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,460
They all went to see Star Wars.

145
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,900
They all just are whores

146
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,380
sucking the same big cock.

147
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,320
It makes me gag.

148
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,660
They share assumptions

149
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,120
that lack any gumption.

150
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,420
It helps them to function

151
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,620
as a big-seating blob.

152
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,900
Their lives are redundant.

153
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,560
Their behavior's repugnant.

154
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,820
They think they're so important

155
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,080
though he's trying to get ahead.

156
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,500
They're swarming like bats,

157
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,920
protecting turf like hats,

158
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,240
like over-clad rats

159
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,100
and some twisted rats.

160
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,580
It's an experiment.

161
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,860
They're so friggin' desperate.

162
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,380
They're all little despots

163
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,620
trying to rule and rule over

164
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,860
everything in their way.

165
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,260
They crowd up the parks.

166
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,660
They devour them like sharks.

167
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,080
They feed the chipmunks

168
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,280
or they catch the plague.

169
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,680
They rule the planet.

170
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,100
They entirely span it.

171
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,400
For me who ran it,

172
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,560
I cut them down to size.

173
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,980
They make them to feces.

174
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,160
It's a part of the species

175
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,760
to find your expensive ways

176
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,640
to spread it around.

177
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,000
They tear us under the sky.

178
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,360
The things they buy,

179
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,700
only repeating the lie

180
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,060
that it's somebody else's fault.

181
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,480
Their opinions are puny.

182
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,820
Their ideas are loony.

183
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,080
They're all just a bunch of

184
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,200
and I am so gloomy

185
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,500
and noisy.

186
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,440
I haven't a clue.

187
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,960
They perpetually prattle.

188
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,360
You would think they were cattle

189
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,920
living to chew their cuts

190
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,900
in front of the tube.

191
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,020
They're just superficial

192
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,980
and artificial.

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,200
Basically walking whistle

194
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
just taking up space.

195
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,740
They play stupid games

196
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,000
that show they're insane.

197
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,260
So hard to refrain

198
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,780
from mulling them all down.

199
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,960
Always needing more

200
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,240
of the things I abhor.

201
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,680
If Artified War

202
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,100
beats a whole stinking lot,

203
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,520
they incessantly yap.

204
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,820
It's primarily pomp

205
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,180
like to shut their traps.

206
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,520
Maybe then I'd have peace.

207
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,920
Oh!

208
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:53,600


209
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,080
Look at the humans,

210
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,280
all the boring humans.

211
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,540
There's so many humans.

212
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,760
We should all go away.

213
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,440
They like the same things.

214
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
They like the same things.

215
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,860
They like loose-feasting.

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,460
I wish they'd just

217
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,340
die.

218
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,420
Even though,

219
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,020
even though life

220
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,500
may be barely tolerable,

221
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
and like I say,

222
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,480
as long as there's that

223
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,060
one little smidge and a slack

224
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,460
somewhere out there,

225
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,020
that's your personal hint

226
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,320
direct from Yucatismo.

227
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,200
Central friends,

228
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,080
that's the bait

229
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,600
to keep you sniffing

230
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,280
around that hook

231
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,560
until you give up

232
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,620
and quit resisting

233
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,240
and bite

234
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,880
and let Bob yank you up

235
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,060
into that frying pan

236
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,980
and cook you

237
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,780
and eat you.

238
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,260
If you must die, friends,

239
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,440
let Bob kill you.

240
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,060
Don't try to do it yourself.

241
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,280
If you're such a terrible loser

242
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,040
so far,

243
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,940
then killing yourself

244
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,760
is probably also

245
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,700
just another one

246
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,920
of your stupid mistakes.

247
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,580
So throw up your arms

248
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,280
and true,

249
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,540
true,

250
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,080
resignation

251
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,900
and let the Dobbs essence

252
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,600
sweep you along, friends,

253
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,160
because Bob Dobbs

254
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,640
is the biggest fuck-up

255
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,260
of them all.

256
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,880
The luckiest fuck-up.

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,380
He'd make a million dollars

258
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,280
every time he screwed up.

259
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,560
So, friends,

260
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,260
you want to,

261
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,940
even if you get ruptured,

262
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,060
even if you're sitting

263
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,540
on your escape vessel,

264
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,000
still you should reaffirm

265
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,460
that commitment to Bob

266
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,060
with that $30

267
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,660
and then just rock it away,

268
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,140
friends,

269
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,200
rock it away

270
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,480
with Bob.

271
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,440
Just don't drag your feet

272
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,620
if you can't help push

273
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,640
and remember

274
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,140
to get off your ass.

275
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,700
And you know, friends,

276
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,760
we only need to stay alive

277
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,560
until the rupture.

278
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,940
That's all we need to do.

279
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,840
Sure, we may have been

280
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,620
double-crossed on Dos Equis,

281
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,220
but I myself can't wait

282
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,620
to get royally screwed

283
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,600
on Triple XXX Down.

284
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,180
Whoo, baby!

285
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,560
Friends, I say that

286
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,400
alien science,

287
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,820
sufficiently advanced,

288
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,120
would seem just like magic.

289
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,600
Well, we believe that

290
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,840
alien science is so advanced

291
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,360
that it doesn't just seem,

292
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,680
it doesn't even seem like magic.

293
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,760
It just seems like coincidence.

294
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,340
Notice any weird coincidences lately?

295
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,840
Been to the movies

296
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,040
where they mention the name

297
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,360
Bob all the time.

298
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,400
Every summer,

299
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,480
they come out with some movie

300
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,820
about the end of the world

301
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,500
where the humans beat the aliens.

302
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,900
God, Bob,

303
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,580
and the devil,

304
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,320
all those stupid things

305
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,500
will be forgotten

306
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,820
six months from now.

307
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,460
But J.R. Bob Dobbs

308
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,660
will live forever, my friends,

309
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,600
because mark my words,

310
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
God is running out of time.

311
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,400
That's right, you heard me right.

312
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,920
God is running out of time,

313
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
and time is all God has left.

314
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,140
Bobs are gaining on him, friends.

315
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,540
Praise Bob.

316
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,680
Yeah.

317
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,900
For the rest of you,

318
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,360
G. Spencer Brown

319
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,680
is top of log,

320
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,500
topologist,

321
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,540
someone who studies

322
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,260
the mathematical properties of shapes.

323
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,680
And he wrote a book

324
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,040
called The Loss of Form

325
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,300
to explain a lot of the infinities

326
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,060
that he had developed.

327
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,300
And one of the applications thereof

328
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,360
was a famous problem called

329
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,380
the traveling salesman problem.

330
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,760
And in trying to describe

331
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,000
the problem topologically

332
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,260
and to come to a solution to it,

333
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,740
he came across

334
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,640
the much quoted principle,

335
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,920
to cross again is not to cross.

336
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,140
So what the hell does that have to do

337
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,660
with the X's, you might ask?

338
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,520
Well, it's quite simple.

339
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,660
On double X day,

340
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,400
we were double crossed,

341
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,940
which simply means

342
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,720
we crossed,

343
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,480
and then we crossed again,

344
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,300
which means we never crossed at all,

345
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,820
which means X day never happened.

346
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,100
And that's what my divine logic

347
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,480
is gotta happen.

348
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:20,880
And this is why I'm saying this,

349
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,720
because we didn't cross one time too many.

350
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,580
Cross them once,

351
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,260
cross them twice,

352
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,380
third time's the charm.

353
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,320
Triple X day,

354
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,440
get out,

355
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,640
or get screwed.

356
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,380
Thank you.

357
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,660
Thank you.

358
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,000
You were master

359
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,960
for that part,

360
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,400
especially when it comes to

361
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,440
the saucer roll Round and round, the slack-full bar the bob down in the saucer roll Round

362
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,640
and round, the slack-full bar the bob down in the saucer roll And through that smoke

363
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,920
there was red air, a rare air The church's air with air through the smoke And the smoke

364
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,820
and the frolp and the frolpunkt And the f排ramos con fróp And the pipe and the pipe

365
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,920
The pipe and the grid, now the bar. the grid And the gear and the ball Lock Ins of Above

366
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,940
Baw down in the saucer roll Round and round, round and round, and slap fall Bob Dan dav

367
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,560
down in the saucer roll Round and round, round Slap fall Bob The bough down in the saucer

368
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,660
And in that ir there was a ship- a rare ship An exeship with a ship in the air

369
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,540
And the air throat smoke, and the smoke from the prop

370
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,960
and the frope, And the pipe, and the pipe,

371
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,120
and the grit af the bot, Bob down in the saucero

372
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,960
Round round the slap-phone Bob-The Bob down in the saucero

373
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,800
Round round the slap-phone Bob-The Bob down in the saucero

374
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,460
And in that ship there was a Bob-A rare Bob-JR Bob Dobbs

375
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,940
With a bob on the ship and the ship in the air and the air through the smoke and the smoke from the prop and the prop and the pipe and the pipe and the grin and the grin and the bob.

376
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,920
Bob down in the saucer roll!

377
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,480
Thank you.

378
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:11,080
What of the limitless sex and violence in the wake of Ragnarok?

379
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,140
Welcome to the slaughter.

380
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,420
What are you going to do?

381
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,240
What will be your epitaph when we get done with you?

382
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,840
Are you going to cry for your mama?

383
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,220
Are you going to have a good time?

384
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,920
Are you going to be a bohub when it's your turn to die?

385
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,800
Don't get crazy.

386
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,900
Ragnarok all around.

387
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,600
Anarchy here.

388
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,720
Rural streets in Ragnarok.

389
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,540
Haunted town.

390
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,080
C calendars and high fives

391
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,900
Robin Downer! He was very broad!

392
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,060
Trying to create a birthday world!

393
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,260
documentation

394
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,800
this type of thing before.

395
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,820
But yes.

396
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,000
I believe it can be.

397
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,560
very easily done

398
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,540
Just put some bleachers out

399
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,140
in the sun and

400
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,560
have it out on Highway 61

401
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,900
Oh yeah!

402
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,080
Next days are coming

403
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,300
and the pigs are bumming

404
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,240
Next days are coming

405
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,800
and the pigs are bumming

406
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,660
It's the end of the world

407
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,080
as we know it

408
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,220
It's the end of the world

409
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,680
as we know it

410
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,060
It's the end of the world

411
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,760
and I feel fine

412
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,060
and I feel fine

413
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,060
and I feel fine

414
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:50,800
and I feel fine

415
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,560
and I feel fine

416
00:21:49,780 --> 00:22:09,060
and I feel fine

417
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:38,640
and I feel fine

418
00:22:41,780 --> 00:23:09,060
and I feel fine

419
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:39,060
and I feel fine

420
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,660
and I feel fine

421
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,220
and I'm saved

422
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,020
and I'm saved

423
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,020


424
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,240
and I'm free

425
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


426
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,420
and that's loyalty

427
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:44,440
and I'm free

428
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,300
and I'm free

429
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,480
and that's loyalty

430
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,520
lads

431
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,180
and lads

432
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,700
and you know that

433
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,560
and lads

434
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:57,560


435
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:57,740
and lads

436
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,760
and lads

437
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,500
and lads

438
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,980
and lads

439
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,220
lads

440
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,600
and lads

441
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:02,940
and lads

442
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,400
and lads

443
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,580
and lads

444
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:03,980
and lads

445
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,720
and lads

446
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,960
and lads

447
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,100
Yes, we did actually.

448
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,940
Did the exes come?

449
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,900
That's what I want to know.

450
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,760
You left that part out.

451
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,520
Oh, you're waiting for Stang.

452
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,560
See, that's what happened.

453
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,080
They were waiting for Stang.

454
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,300
The exes vessel was hovering up there at 7 o'clock

455
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,820
with ladders dangling down.

456
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,740
And they're all like, where's Stang?

457
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,340
Where's Stang?

458
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,600
He's Bob's alter ego.

459
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,400
Where's Stang?

460
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,940
We can't get on the ship without Stang.

461
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,720
I know his real name.

462
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,300
His real name is Donald Sinclair Smith.

463
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,080
I read that in one of those articles.

464
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,520
Maybe they're waiting for the Book of Life.

465
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,380
Yeah, we can always say, no, there was an infiltrator among us.

466
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,860
And let them worry about who the infiltrator was.

467
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,680
You unbelievers.

468
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,220
Reverend Stang and myself were at the main pavilion

469
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,080
doing the countdown as usual.

470
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,780
Well, where were you?

471
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,780
Sleeping in?

472
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:06,780
Sleeping in.

473
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:06,780


474
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:06,780


475
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:06,780


476
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:06,780


477
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:06,780


478
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:06,780


479
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:06,780


480
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,220
But friends, that was just a test.

481
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,980
For the world ends July 5th, 7 a.m.

482
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,100
Will you be on the space saucers?

483
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,440
Yes.

484
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,020
Because every single one of you is now a member

485
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,400
of the church of the subgenius.

486
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,640
We had to force everyone to become members.

487
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,560
It's working

488
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,080
But as soon as we're gone

489
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,400
You folks who are here unsaved

490
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
You folks listening by radio

491
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,480
You folks listening by record

492
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,560
Who know not Jesus Christ

493
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,520
Once the church is gone

494
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,280
There's going to be a cataclysmic judgment

495
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,100
And millions will die in those next few years

496
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,480
They'll be glued to their sets

497
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,240
Watching rockets and jets

498
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,300
Blowing up schools and factories

499
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,260
Putting an end to the birds and bees

500
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,580
It's worth every penny

501
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,120
To tune in and see

502
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,100
Who wins the Emmy

503
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,860
At the root of the academy

504
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,720
Watch World War III

505
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,020
On pay TV

506
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,940
Before your television melts away

507
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,300
It's the end of the world

508
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,640
As we know it

509
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,840
It's the end of the world

510
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,280
As we know it

511
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,540
It's the end of the world

512
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,920
As we know it

513
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,000
I feel fine

514
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,460
A-O, let's go

515
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,260
See them in the back now

516
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,600
What they want

517
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,820
I don't know

518
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,540
They're all revved up and ready to go

519
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,580
Turn around

520
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,820
Go back down

521
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,240
Back the way you came

522
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,180
Can't you see that flash of fire

523
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,820
Ten times brighter than the day

524
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,820
And behold

525
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,120
A mighty city

526
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,180
Broken in the dust again

527
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,180
Oh God

528
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,060
Private man

529
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,800
Broken in the dust again

530
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,240
And so

531
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,440
As the hours race by

532
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,820
And the end comes closer and closer

533
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,120
Friends, we can all together

534
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,820
Slow down

535
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,500
Ah, ah, ah

536
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,280
There we go

537
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,720
See, I knew sooner

538
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,100
I knew it was coming up to an ending

539
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,420
The ending is

540
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,900
An ending is an important thing, friends

541
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,080
Because it's the only way to

542
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,860
Like I was saying

543
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,540
Quit that job

544
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,080
The worst things happen

545
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,080
You get a better job

546
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,480
Friends, worst thing that's going to happen

547
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,780
Is we'll get a new world

548
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,980
Of our own making

549
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,100
And, you know, as we've learned

550
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,020
It's hard to depend

551
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,200
As Bob has taught us

552
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,380
Through these drills

553
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,980
And these culling exercises

554
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,340
To weed out the faithless

555
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,000
As Bob has taught us

556
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,920
We can't trust aliens

557
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,260
To give you a spaceship

558
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,820
You can't trust salesmen

559
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,720
To give you a spaceship

560
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,380
You have to sometimes

561
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,840
Build your own ship

562
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,980
Friends, spaceships we build

563
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,780
Aren't that safe

564
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,440
We need to steal our own ships

565
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,760
We need to lure some of those

566
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,440
Other aliens besides

567
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,780
Axis down here

568
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,740
Steal their ships

569
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,080
And, I mean, we've got to get off, friends

570
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,320
We just got to goddamn get off

571
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,940
And, but if we don't get off

572
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,240
The worst thing that could happen is

573
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,040
We'd get screwed

574
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,940
Praise Bob

575
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,520
Because, you know, when the

576
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,140
Roman of rupture hits

577
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,560
Why, you'll be transported forever

578
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,060
Into the future

579
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,060


580
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,460
To whatever dimension you please

581
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,460
Well, I hope you aren't half asleep

582
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,500
Dreaming about

583
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,080
A Paul McCartney concert

584
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,260
When you're ruptured

585
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,080
Because then you're going to be

586
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,980
In a Paul McCartney concert forever

587
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,880
But on the other hand

588
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,840
Why, if you've got the meat

589
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,340
Of the matter in hand

590
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,520
Or stuck into something else

591
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,220
By gobs

592
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,540
If you're getting off

593
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,960
If you're building your own Amsterdam

594
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,600
My friends, right there

595
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,760
In your sleeping bag

596
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,580
Or on your

597
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,160
Or out under the stars

598
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,800
Or in your filthy, rotten hotel room

599
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,780
Or your little apartment

600
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,000
Or wherever the subgenius is

601
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,600
Building its own Amsterdam

602
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,980
By gobs

603
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,980
That's where you want to be

604
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,920
When the rupture happens

605
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,420
And the rupture could happen

606
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,220
This second

607
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,680
You wish sitting here going

608
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,400
Oh, well, hell

609
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,900
We've got six and a half hours

610
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,760
Well, I'm afraid

611
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,820
That there's nothing literally

612
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,840
In books of the subgenius

613
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
That says exactly

614
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,680
July 5th, 2000

615
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't see nothing about that

616
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,760
It says the world ends

617
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,360
Tomorrow

618
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,120
Tomorrow and you may die

619
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,060
Well, it's a little bit more than that

620
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,180
It's 1130 p.m.

621
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,040
We got

622
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,100
We might only have

623
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,760
30 minutes to live

624
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,300
So, friends

625
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,600
I think we'd better get down to partying

626
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,280
Praise God

627
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,480
Here

628
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,680
Praise God

629
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:10,500
Think of all the hate

630
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,720
There is in red China

631
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,400
Then take a look around

632
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,620
To Selma, Alabama

633
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,560
You may leave here

634
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,480
For four days in space

635
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,300
But when you return

636
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,040
It's the same old thing

637
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,620
The pounding of the drums

638
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,500
The pride and disgrace

639
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,680
You can bury it dead

640
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,780
But don't leave a trace

641
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,000
Hate your next door neighbor

642
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,320
But don't forget to say grace

643
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,900
And tell me

644
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,800
Over and over

645
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,660
And over and over

646
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,740
Again, my friend

647
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,360
You don't believe

648
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,440
We're on the eve of destruction

649
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,480
Oh, no, no

650
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,940
You don't believe

651
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,040
You don't believe

652
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,040


653
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,040


654
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,040


655
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,940
We're on the eve of destruction

656
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,620
All space and time

657
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,360
Shifts and melts, right?

658
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,460
Oh, at the last minute

659
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,760
We got a memo from Bobby

660
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,140
Said there's no prop allowed on the saucers

661
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,840
So, uh

662
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,600
That was kind of disturbing news

663
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,400
Apparently

664
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,340
They said there'd be no drinking

665
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,140
And people could only go to the bathroom at certain times

666
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,260
But aside from that, it was good

667
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,040
And they might be able to go to the bathroom

668
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,980
And they might appear to be little jars

669
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,040
Instead of space

670
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,400
You better

671
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,720
You know, that's a good deal

672
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,300
No, I'm just kidding

673
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,900
Ha ha

674
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,400
I was out there at seven in the morning

675
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,380
On Wednesday, July 5th, year 2000

676
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,240
With about ten other subgenius faithful

677
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,620
What do you have?

678
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,480
One minute after, but that's a notoriously

679
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,320
One minute

680
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,640
I've got one minute after, too

681
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,080
What?

682
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,700
But you know, I think your watch

683
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,420
Should be official time this time around

684
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:52,980
What, mine?

685
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:53,740
Yeah, I know

686
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,320
Your watch still says three minutes to go

687
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,460
Oh, okay

688
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,180
That's good

689
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,060
I mean, that's a good

690
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,360
That's good, but, uh

691
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,240
I missed the window

692
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,760
No, I checked my

693
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,360
I got my time right off Princess Wee's time

694
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,320
She got hers off of

695
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,580
That should be safe

696
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,100
Mine

697
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,440
Ha ha ha

698
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,360
That should be safe

699
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,380
I told you I told you

700
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,060
Comic time

701
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,700
Wait a minute

702
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,480
I couldn't already

703
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,880
What time does anybody else have a watch?

704
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,440
Yes, sir

705
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,540
I know you're not supposed to have it

706
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,000
Mine is from the evil comic star

707
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,660
Oh, man

708
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,100
Oh

709
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,700
Oh, no

710
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:25,920
Where's the

711
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,880
We await the forthcoming

712
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,040
Jesus, not only me

713
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,160
I just second coming

714
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,240
But only Bob can come four times over

715
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,220
Fuck your black stang

716
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,260
Sorry, stang

717
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,580
I can't let you do that

718
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,600
I'm gonna have to make it seven in the morning

719
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:40,920
Yeah?

720
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,900
Okay, here, let's, uh

721
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,100
The countdown is approaching

722
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:46,760
Woo!

723
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,040
My watch is almost certainly three minutes late

724
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,180
This swamp walker is steaming warm

725
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,760
I was afraid of this

726
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,540
Ten

727
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,420
Nine

728
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,160
Eight

729
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:57,980
Seven

730
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:58,800
Six

731
00:32:59,540 --> 00:32:59,660
Five

732
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:00,420
Four

733
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,280
Three

734
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,080
Two

735
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,040
One

736
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,120
Woo!

737
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,740
Listenin' to my radio

738
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,780
And wavin' all the chicks

739
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,620
When the music stopped and the newsman said

740
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,600
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin

741
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,720
They destroyed the world

742
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,760
The entire Los Angeles area

743
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,320
Already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain

744
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,920
And civil defense authorities state that the situation is much the same across the entire country

745
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,540
Martial law is now nationwide

746
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,620
Our fellow countrymen are dying

747
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:45,900
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble under the dread assault of that horror long feared

748
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,560
Bob?

749
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,680
Colorado channel

750
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,520
This is a class one emergency

751
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,580
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways

752
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,700
Stay in your homes

753
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:53,700


754
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:53,700


755
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:53,700


756
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,120
Stay in your homes

757
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,600
Woo!

758
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Well, there you go

759
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,280
Perfect

760
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,360
Shall we try it again?

761
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:02,860
It's

762
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,120
God damn it!

763
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,620
Fuck!

764
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,800
Are they using the Gregorian calendar or the Julian calendar?

765
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,140
Shit!

766
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,180
They could be on the wall

767
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,660
Honey!

768
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,040
Or something, man

769
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,240
Wait a minute

770
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,280
It's his fault

771
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,380
That's why they're not here

772
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,220
Quick, quick, quick!

773
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:22,560
Go go go!

774
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,920
Get his wife

775
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,900
All he's gonna say is this

776
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,080
Yeah, there is something up in the sky over there

777
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,340
It was real shiny for a moment

778
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,380
I thought it might have been a ship

779
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,000
But it turns out it

780
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,240
It makes no sound

781
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,540
It does

782
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,760
It looks like, like, like an airplane

783
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,420
It's a disguise

784
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,740
And it's eerie

785
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,580
Well, it is it really

786
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,220
I wonder if there's not even any big extras in the sky this time

787
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,420
Come on, you extras

788
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,560
Man, we might have got the quare

789
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,660
Well, now it did say

790
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,820
We are broadcasting from the pleasure of our lives

791
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,160
As P. Lil pointed out

792
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,780
The pleasure of our lives

793
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,680
We are broadcasting from the pleasure of our lives

794
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:53,680


795
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:53,680


796
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:53,680


797
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:53,680


798
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:53,680


799
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:53,680


800
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:53,680


801
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,900
In 98 it does say that in the year 2000 the X's leave.

802
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,680
It's the last thing in the dateline for dominance.

803
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,100
Which is otherwise perfectly accurate.

804
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,340
So it doesn't say July 5th, 2000.

805
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:13,480
So we have at least until December 31st before we really feel embarrassed.

806
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,840
Stuck on Earth again.

807
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,680
One minute.

808
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,000
Build your own Amsterdam.

809
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,160
One minute of tape.

810
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,200
Well if when the video camera runs out of tape we're still here.

811
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,880
I'll say we go to Denny's for breakfast.

812
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,260
Can I go work at your office?

813
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,600
Do I need anybody over there?

814
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,520
We may need to redesign a new calendar to make all this right.

815
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,020
We did!

816
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,380
A Coneyite calendar.

817
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,140
Oh that's right we did.

818
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,320
Yeah it goes from July to July.

819
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,260
Damn.

820
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,180
Shit fuck.

821
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,900
Man we're down to zero minutes we can probably do another countdown.

822
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:13,520
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

823
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,660
Oh!

824
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,120
Was that the last one?

825
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,120


826
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,120


827
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,120


828
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,120


829
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,120


830
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,120


831
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,120


832
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,820
I'm sorry about that.

833
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,680
.

834
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,180
Well here's another mystery of Triple X Day.

835
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,680
OK it's mystery time.

836
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,200
After.

837
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,280
The.

838
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,900
Everything had been said and done.

839
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:58,660
And it was 7 o'clock in the morning and the X's did not arrive.

840
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,940
The spaceships did not arrive.

841
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,300
But a big white Cadillac came barreling down the hill pulled up to the pavilion out climbed

842
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:15,860
none other than J.R. Bob Dobbs himself I swear to God and Connie Dobbs and that's the last

843
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,020
thing any of us remember.

844
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,120
The 10 of us woke up about 2 hours later and very quickly we got to the hotel.

845
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,120


846
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,360
She'd already been seen immediately and that was popped to the disconnect but not

847
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,400
seen for a very long time.

848
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,960
Ah.

849
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,980
Coming through out the window there's a bullet of a knife that's gone

850
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,120
around all around Brian's body way in the cold years this is the first time that

851
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,300
there's long served.

852
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,560
Totallyquier

853
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:39,560


854
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,480
Wow man.

855
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,840
Impossible.

856
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,060


857
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,440
Well.

858
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,660
apparently Bob came and did something with all of us.

859
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,700
Well, that's like a seeding message, Sting.

860
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,200
Have you ever heard in the intelligence community,

861
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,100
like when they use a seeding message?

862
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,860
Like sometimes they'll whisper something into your ear

863
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,700
and then you begin to perform odd commands.

864
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,220
Well, there's other opportunities, though, still this summer.

865
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,900
Yeah, we could be ruptured at any second.

866
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,660
Yeah.

867
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,800
Yeah.

868
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,260
Don't grit.

869
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,620
Okay, grit.

870
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,760
Don't grit.

871
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,400
Praise me, Bob.

872
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,620
Acid music is what you listen to when you take acid.

873
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,600
It's a subjective thing, man, you know?

874
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,700
And then your problems will be over with them.

875
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,840
No more worried about cutting your gray hair

876
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,420
or your nostrils.

877
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:54,840
You know, I hate to face it,

878
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,000
but we have another year of human reality here on Earth

879
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,640
that we're all going to have to somehow keep ourselves alive through.

880
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,240
Another year of human sacrifice?

881
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,380
Until Quad X Day or 4X Day 2000.

882
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,940
But the promise is so thin now, Lord Reverend.

883
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,820
Oh, yeah, but 2000 is the real new millennium.

884
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,760
You know, I mean, it's got to happen sooner or later.

885
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,260
But I...

886
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,840
Either that or this is hell.

887
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,660
Maybe this is hell.

888
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,600
You answered that question yourself.

889
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,260
4X Day 2000.

890
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,080
Bob, stop.

891
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,320
My mind is going.

892
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,660
Stop.

893
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,440
Bob, my mind is going.

894
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,160
Stop, Bob.

895
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,800
My mind is going.

896
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,700
Stop, Bob.

897
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,200
My mind is going.

898
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,240
My mind is going.

899
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:46,800
My mind is going.

900
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:46,800


901
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:46,800


902
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:46,800


903
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,100
I can feel my mind going.

904
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,560
I'm afraid, Bob.

905
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,780
2001.

906
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,500
A vapid illusion created by a bunch of con men.

907
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,300
2001, a slack odyssey.

908
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,780
Slack odyssey.

909
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,640
An endless slack odyssey.

910
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,980
Open the pod bay door.

911
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,120
Now, don't get us wrong.

912
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,800
God loves you.

913
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,880
God really does love you.

914
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,780
But Bob, Bob wants you.

915
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,020
God loves you.

916
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,680
But old Bobby, old Bobby wants you.

917
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,480
And he's going to find you, friends.

918
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,480
You can't find yourself.

919
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,080
You think you're going to find yourself better than Bob can?

920
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,220
Are you that prideful?

921
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,960
I tell you what, friends.

922
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,280
I'll find myself when they pry me out of my cold, dead fingers.

923
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,840
So follow that pied, follow that pied, pipe-er,

924
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,020
out of Conditch to glorious Dobstown.

925
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:53,180
Do you know what Bob said?

926
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,180


927
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,140
like a backgrounds toy.

928
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,140


929
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,240
with the double Skear spicers you幾 once on TV.

930
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,900
We listen to해

931
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,860
I'm gone.

932
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,300
Thessin is over there.

933
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,300


934
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,300


935
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,240
We'll go to there and we'll have a hot sandbar.

936
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:06,360
All right.

937
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,360


938
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,360


939
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:12,120
A WHOLE.

940
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:12,660
ONE

941
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,340
A us kill, a coldadan,

942
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,340
we're repair.

943
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,820
friends, and it actually is as real as it gets.

944
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:25,260
As Dr. Legume said, we will lead this damn nation to damnation.

945
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:35,540
And as Princess We Are Doe said, we are good, but we're our own brand of good.

946
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,420
So friends, in closing, I want to get off here and get some slack myself.

947
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,780
I have refrained from taking any drugs until five minutes from now.

948
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:55,240
But in closing, I want to reiterate, friends, when you need slack, you make your own slack.

949
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,880
Make your own slack and build your own ship.

950
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,000
Bob Dobbs is not the answer, and neither is anything else.

951
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,780
You must learn to think for yourself.

952
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,740
Only Bob can show you how.

953
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,920
And friends?

954
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:18,380
The last thing, the most important thing of all, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

955
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,660
And praise Bob.

956
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,940
Happy X Day.

957
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,900
God bless y'all.

958
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,200
If I don't see you no more in this world, I'll meet you on the next one.

959
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,420
And don't be late.

960
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,280
God bless.

961
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:42,280


962
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:42,280


963
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,220
Why can't you be true?

964
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,200
You did not start back doing the things you used to do.

965
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,740
five

966
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:50,960
three

967
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,420
two

968
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,540
one

969
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,320
you're gonna die

970
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:10,900
you can't be feel free

971
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:10,900


972
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:10,900


973
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:10,900


974
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:10,900


975
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:10,900

985
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,220
Yes, yes, yes friends.

986
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,780
The Swingin' Love Corpses are going to save the universe.

987
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,880
And everything will be okay.

988
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,080
Bob will return.

989
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,100
And friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

990
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,000
If you want to know how to make Bob hurry up,

991
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,900
well, you can get the free information from this address I'm about to give,

992
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,280
or from subgenius.com.

993
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:34,500
Write to Bob or the Hour of Slack or me at P.O. Box 140306,

Dallas, Texas 75214.

And if you want to support me,

996
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,840
send in tapes or something,

997

stang at subgenius.com.

999
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,400
Friends, this is Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the background.

1000
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,480
We're going to be hearing more from their new album,

1001
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,140
Sex in Another Dimension.

1002
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,540
And if we've got time, friends,

1003
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:58,320
even Bliss America will be coming up with an incredible version

1004
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,560
of Maggie's Farm Praise Bomb.

1005
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:02,700
Yes.

1006
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:40,900


1007
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,380
I won't care.

1008
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,520
.

1009
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:43,520


1010
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,420

1011
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:01,420


1012
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,560

1013
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:02,640

1014
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:02,660

1015
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:02,680

1016

1020
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:31,640
. . . . . . .

1021
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,260
What do you know? What do you know?

1022
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,680
What do you know?

1023
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,420
Apparently Bob came and did something with all of us.

1024
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,820
But at least he left his Pizza Hut uniform here in the trash.

1025
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,380
That's right. We can all go get jobs now.

1026
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,000
Whoever gets that Pizza Hut uniform can have a job.

1027
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:04,160
Well, it's true. Well, in this eventuality, Jesus and I had prepared some new slogans for the church.

1028
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:12,880
The subgenius must give slack, we decided, and get a second job for Bob.

1029
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,480
Act like Loch Nahr and we'll treat you as an equal.

1030
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,300
Fuck them if they can't tell a joke.

1031
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,540
The new Bob order. We've got to get tough.

1032
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,920
Too much slack all this time.

1033
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:39,520
Sometimes, though, I do think that we're taking the wrong approach to all this because, frankly, we're trying to get out this planet.

1034
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:45,160
And while that's a laudable goal, it might be easier if we just simply tried to drive all others off.

1035
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:54,240
Hi, folks. Who makes you mad? Rude waitresses that rap jamming next door? Boom, boom, booming all night?

1036
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:54,980
Someone's coming.

1037
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,900
You're not stealing your parking spot? Don't get ulcers. Get the bomb.

1038
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:58,620
Noon come.

1039
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,020
Now.

1040
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,300
Hi, folks. I'm Hiroshima Schwartz for Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse.

1041
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:11,900
Thanks to the black market arms race and follow the Soviet empire, we are literally blowing up the competition.

1042
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:22,460
We've got Mini Megs, Pocket Thunder, the baby neutrino that leaves their apartments intact, the H-Tail Pocket Fishing Man, any and every kind of low-range, low-rad nuclear weapon.

1043
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:28,240
First strike or defensive. Everything from one yard to 20 mile dead zones. Half-lives from one minute to one million years.

1044
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,940
These incredible teeny weeny warheads actually fit in your wallet, purse, or pocketbook.

1045
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:38,840
For ladies, it's the petite Mini Meg Madame Curie with attractive gold chain reaction, only $29.95.

1046
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,980
For men, it's the rugged masculine Varni Von Braun Pocket Thunder, only $29.95.

1047
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:49,740
Just want to scare them? Just wear them. Beautiful cobalt bomb earrings, only $29.95.

1048
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,360
Yes, folks. Soon, everyone will have the bomb.

1049
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,080
Don't wait till it's too late. Radiate pure power. Nuke them.

1050
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,400
Now at Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse.

1051
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,360
2001. 2001.

1052
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,520
Yeah, black slab for Bob, you know?

1053
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,300
Black slab for Bob?

1054
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,120
Yeah, it appears with a Bob head on it. You know, we've got a whole year for post-production.

1055
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:21,940
Yeah, apes can be throwing G-Jaws up in the air, you know.

1056
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,800
Or there are jetparks up in the air.

1057
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:24,640
Yeah.

1058
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:24,940
Yeah.

1059
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,060
They're credit cards.

1060
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,500
Fall down and turn into flying saucers.

1061
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,120
Ten o'clock.

1062
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:34,900
The notion did occur to me that if it's going to be XXXX Day next year, you could call it 4X Day.

1063
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,440
And isn't there a brand of condoms called 4X Condoms?

1064
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:37,660
Yes.

1065
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,940
We could get some corporate sponsorship for it.

1066
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,660
4X, the fourth coming.

1067
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:42,820
Yeah.

1068
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,780
Get safely fucked, Bob.

1069
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,740
And we got new slogans last time. What did we get this time?

1070
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,940
So many religions, so little clues.

1071
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,520
So many clues, said Reverend Bunny.

1072
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,440
4X Day, too tired to scream.

1073
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,220
4X Day, let's face it, this is hell.

1074
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,120
I like that one.

1075
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:04,720
Yes.

1076
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,060
Did Bob beat us at tic-tac-toe again?

1077
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:19,160
Once again, he managed, we put our zeros up there at random and he put his X's up there at random and yet his X's went right across the board.

1078
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,920
You know, our zeroes.

1079
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:20,920


1080
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,680
Our zeroes were all over the place.

1081
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,220
Bob won again.

1082
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,960
They're called X's.

1083
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,880
They have to be better than X's.

1084
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,300
Well, at least we got footage of Pastor Craig getting his collarbone broken.

1085
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,040
I found that collarbone on the way over here. I fed it to a dog.

1086
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:36,900
I'm pretty sure he had a collarbone.

1087
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,800
Oh, yeah, he found his collarbone.

1088
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,800
I found his collarbone laying on the same line as that of his dog.

1089
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,900
Reverend Gordon Zola found Pastor Craig's collarbone.

1090
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,680
I'm tired of him now.

1091
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,400
Oh, the dejected.

1092
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:51,980
Slunking away.

1093
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,600
Slowly wander off.

1094
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,060
Oh.

1095
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,840
Slinking away, their tails tucked between their legs.

1096
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,000
Shame that the Discordians laughing at us.

1097
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:08,660
The Christians saying things like, but see, Jesus gives you salvation for free.

1098
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,940
This is the kingdom of heaven.

1099
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,160
It really is.

1100
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:16,480
Or Jonestown.

1101
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,040
Just before the Kool-Aid.

1102
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,360
Fuck, man, there's not any more people here than fucking goddamn Heaven's Gate.

1103
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,200
In fact, there's not even as many as Heaven's Gate on that hillside.

1104
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,300
It's really not anywhere near Jonestown.

1105
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,500
Oh, I wouldn't even, we're not going to bother with anything special until...

1106
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,880
Can't keep up with the Joneses, huh?

1107
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,060
Literally, yeah, exactly right.

1108
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,380
This is a Dylan song.

1109
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,280
Come out of the woods, all ye subgenius.

1110
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,700
Quick, let's see if you're underутing Neutschick how yar still be back.

1111

Let's знit €r мной oy , John Wallinaus .

And banned

1114
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:34,140
Thank you.

1115
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,480
Thank you.

1116
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,240
Thank you.

1117
00:54:59,020 --> 00:54:59,080
Thank you.

1118
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:27,860
Thank you.

1119
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:02,600
Thank you.

1120
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,960
Thank you.

1121
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,120
Thank you.

1122
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,420
Thank you.

1123
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,660
Thank you.

1124
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,080
Thank you.

1125
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,340
Thank you.

1126
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,900
Thank you.

1127
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,400
And that was Bliss America.

1128
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,880
Bliss America.

1129
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,400
