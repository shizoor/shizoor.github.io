1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
Listen.

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,980
All right, on one.

3
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,120
Going up in five, four, three, two, one.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,840
The Soggy Power of Swag.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,860
We'll meet again at midnight.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,140
And let's have another disclaimer.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,700
The program you are about to hear, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse,

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,320
is actually a special edition of the Hour of Slack tonight.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,340
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Jub Genius.

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,120
The Church of the Jenkum Genius.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Religion, politics, or any other touchy subject is intended only as humor

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,020
and should cast no reflection on the high standards of WREK Atlanta,

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,840
its staff, nor that of Georgia Tech.

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,600
Ah.

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:57,920
Ah.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,400
We're going to have to change it to Church of the Jub Seniors after this.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,340
Yeah, man.

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,560
I have two brain cells left.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,140
They're on opposite sides of my head and they're not touching.

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,580
You can't have them.

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,260
I've only got a half of them.

22
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,760
No, you're not getting one of them.

23
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,500
I've only got a half of them.

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,040
Why do you think I only have two left?

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,080
You've caged all my brain cells.

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:19,860
I did.

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,600
It was like a pack of cigarettes.

28
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,180
I wish I knew what happened to them.

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,840
I must have smoked them.

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,420
Hey, do you need to flip CDs?

31
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,040
Or anything?

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,520
Yeah.

33
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,600
Because one CD only lasts 80 minutes, right?

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:32,980
Well, no.

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,760
I'm making a huge file and then I'll split it in half.

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,260
Oh.

37
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,880
Yeah, I'm doing things on Soundforge.

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,180
Huge.

39
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,840
She grabbed her bosom while she said that.

40
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,900
She got excited.

41
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,180
She wants that huge file.

42
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,460
Or what she could grab of it.

43
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,360
It takes more than two hands.

44
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,760
She wants your huge file.

45
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,080
I can kind of grab part of it and shove it around.

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,800
See?

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
She wants your huge file.

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,300
Mm-hmm.

49
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,680
It's a huge file.

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:57,680


51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:57,680


52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:57,680


53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:57,680


54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:57,680


55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:57,680


56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:57,680


57
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,320
Oh, there's going to be a huge file.

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,160
Oh, man.

59
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,760
I'm about ready to upload.

60
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,220
Yeah, there's a huge file on you somewhere, don't you know, Stank?

61
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:06,960
Yes.

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,440
Oh, I've tried to add to it.

63
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,200
Uh-huh.

64
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,120
Have you applied for your FOIA?

65
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,060
No.

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,160
No.

67
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,800
No.

68
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,280
No.

69
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,560
No.

70
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,320
I don't want to know.

71
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,340
No, I actually had to contact the FBI at one point and go,

72
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,180
look, you guys probably have a file, but let me pad it for you.

73
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,100
Here's some other.

74
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,760
Uh, thank you, my love.

75
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,180
Just so you don't get surprised.

76
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,140
A secret service showed up at my house.

77
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,020
Again?

78
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,980
No, no.

79
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,180
Back in the olden days.

80
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,480
In 1981.

81
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,080
Did you know that when I came to the door, they asked me, they asked if I was, I, um,

82
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,300
they didn't know my last name.

83
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,180
This is the secret service.

84
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,000
All they had was my first name and my middle name.

85
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,460
And this is my street human name.

86
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,640
So I was, you know, is this Doug St. Clair?

87
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,460
And I, at that point, that was my cue to say no.

88
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:57,700


89
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,260
Technically, technically you were right.

90
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:09,260
They just wanted to see if I was a turban wearing type of cult leader or just a regular joke kind of cult leader.

91
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,940
Or like, you know, wind turban or.

92
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,160
And when I saw the swing set in the backyard and so forth.

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,420
You were swingers?

94
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:16,900
Yeah.

95
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,360
Yeah.

96
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,960
Back then.

97
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,360
Wow.

98
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,320
Back then.

99
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,360
Nobody would have this now.

100
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,600
Nobody except others.

101
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,260
What was it?

102
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,000
Jubb seniors.

103
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,800
Jubb seniors.

104
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,260
Yeah.

105
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:27,700


106
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,400
That's easy for me to say.

107
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,920
Church of the gum seniors.

108
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,420
Look, when you, when you get the dentures, I'm not keeping track of the jar.

109
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,020
Adventures in dentures, baby.

110
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,280
My, my granny ran over hers.

111
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,260
That was hilarious.

112
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,120
They were in her mouth at the time.

113
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,580
My dad's, this is not a joke.

114
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,100
My dad's dog ate his dentures.

115
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,960
Now wrap your head around that for just a second.

116
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,460
The dog just sat on my foot.

117
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,100
He bit me.

118
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,480
Ah.

119
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,580
The dog ate my dad's false teeth.

120
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,600
Which was a complete set.

121
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,040
The kind like the three stooges would, you know, run around chattering or something.

122
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,480
You had, you had denture hound.

123
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,440
He's rare.

124
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,420
What a smile that dog had.

125
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,740
Man, he had these weirdest canines.

126
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,480
They were just sort of not pointed the right way.

127
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,500
But hey, it worked.

128
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,080
He thought he ever wanted after that was mashed potatoes.

129
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,380
That, that helps those dogs that are so ugly and shave them and make them walk backwards.

130
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,300
Yeah.

131
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,080
The teeth would help.

132
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,980
That dog died of a rattlesnake bite.

133
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,260
Sad.

134
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,580
He tried not to bite anyone.

135
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,020
Dogs has always been my friend.

136
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,040
Uh huh.

137
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,960
I feel bad about laughing now that your dog is dead.

138
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,380
Well, that was my dad's dog.

139
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:51,900
Right.

140
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,820
Absolutely.

141
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,540
That is okay.

142
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,480
Actually, you know, um, they could have been a dog.

143
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,480


144
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,480


145
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,480


146
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,480


147
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,480


148
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,040
They come and go and animals don't last forever out on out in the countryside.

149
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,460
They's good eatin' huh?

150
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,620
Yeah, they're well, there's coyote traps everywhere.

151
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,300
You know, it's amazing how varmints have adapted to humanity.

152
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:23,760
Certain, certain varmints have actually spread that used to only live in certain areas are now spreading into new areas of the country like coyotes and so forth.

153
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,160
Right.

154
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,080
And they are showing up where they never used to be because they fit in quite well with, uh, humanity and their pets.

155
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,020
Mm-hmm.

156
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,780
Because they eat our pets.

157
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,200
Mm-hmm.

158
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,840
That's what most coyotes.

159
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,440
They eat your mammals.

160
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,720
Yeah, they, they, right.

161
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,500
You people who own mammals, that's sick.

162
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,820
Hey, I don't own a mammal.

163
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,920
They have teats, they have fur, they have sweat glands.

164
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,240
Ah!

165
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,040
But I happen to own an amphibian.

166
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,420
Ooh.

167
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,760
How's that?

168
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,600
Ooh.

169
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,800
Miss reptile lady.

170
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,460
Excuse me.

171
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,060
Snake woman.

172
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,960
I, I suddenly have professional courtesy.

173
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,140
Listen, we're going to have a little bit of a discussion.

174
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,140


175
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,140


176
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,260
I have a little bit of respect for you.

177
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,980
You vertebrate lovers.

178
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,880
Oh, uh, uh, we, I was thinking how we, of, um, how my poor newt, Fig, hasn't been fed

179
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,380
his, uh, sea monkeys.

180
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,120
Oh.

181
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,280
Wow.

182
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,300
And we had a sea, there was a sea monkey at, in the audience at our, at the panel.

183
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:14,860
She was gorgeous.

184
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,400
Did you tell her that you fed her kind to your amphibian?

185
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, I did.

186
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,620
I made a real big deal out of it.

187
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,460
Sea monkey, do monkey.

188
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah.

189
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,900
She was, she was pink, but she looked just like the sea monkeys.

190
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,520
In the air.

191
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:24,820
On the package.

192
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,300
Yeah.

193
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:25,700
Yeah.

194
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,900
Yeah.

195
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,660
She was, and she was like the teenage daughter sea monkey.

196
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,500
Yeah.

197
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:29,960
Uh.

198
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,180
She had really nice scales on her chest.

199
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:32,580
Judy.

200
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:32,600
Yes.

201
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,400
She was, yeah, she was, she was really.

202
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:34,840
And a tail.

203
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,160
And she had the three little antennas on top.

204
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,700
Yeah.

205
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,320
And, and when they took, somebody took her picture with me, I held up two, three fingers

206
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,360
behind her head.

207
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:43,820
Oh.

208
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:44,880
See.

209
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,260
Oh.

210
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm, I'm a real humorist and jokester.

211
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,720
That's, that's pretty smart.

212
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,880
But yeah, that was one of my favorite, uh, costumes was the, the sea monkey, or, or.

213
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,640
When you, uh.

214
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,580
Uh, no, apologies to Reverend Artemia Salina.

215
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:57,880
I was gonna ask.

216
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,320
Who's probably not listening.

217
00:06:59,580 --> 00:06:59,880
No.

218
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:00,540
Mm.

219
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,380
Out of spite.

220
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,820
Not, not if he knows his deal.

221
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,620
Right.

222
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,140
No, no, no.

223
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,500
Cause you're, you're making fun of him.

224
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,480
Uh, no.

225
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:09,880
No.

226
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,020
No.

227
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,120
I, I, I've, I've genocided his people.

228
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,560
Well.

229
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,260
The sea monkeys.

230
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,040
That's a, that's a version of making fun of people.

231
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,480
Sea monkeys, my left butt.

232
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,380
That's Brian Shrimp.

233
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,340
When the ex-

234
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,180
Genocide has always been considered comedy.

235
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,980
Don't you know that?

236
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,900
When the exes come down and wipe out the human race, they're gonna say, oh, we were just

237
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,280
playing around.

238
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,600
What's up?

239
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,240
I'd be laughing.

240
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,460
I think that's pretty funny.

241
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,160
It's just the way it is.

242
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,240
Not every.

243
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,780
If we're lucky.

244
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,960
Well, you know, most religions in, I think in most religions, people kind of want everybody

245
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,020
else to die.

246
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:44,900
Yeah.

247
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,420
That's nothing.

248
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,780
I mean, that's kind of what a religion's all about.

249
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,760
Religions are nothing but telling you who to hate.

250
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:51,840
Basically.

251
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,860
But what's gonna happen to them for, for not having faith?

252
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,080
It's not that we love Bob so much.

253
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,560
It's that we love the idea of everybody else going to hell.

254
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,160
Yeah.

255
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,280
Damn straight.

256
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,100
Yeah.

257
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,580
Damn straight to hell.

258
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,400
The envisioning of, of the, of the various ways to.

259
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,240
The burnings.

260
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,380
Yeah.

261
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,220
The screams and agony.

262
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,120
The nerve endings held in fire.

263
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,280
You mean all I gotta do is pay $30 and that'll help everyone else go to hell?

264
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:18,640
Right.

265
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,560
Sounds like a bargain.

266
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,100
Yeah.

267
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,140
What a deal.

268
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,240
Wow.

269
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,020
Well, you know, burning.

270
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,600
What were we, what was back on burning?

271
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,520
Can we go back to burning?

272
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,520
And every time you make a deal, Bob gets a deal-do.

273
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,220
That's a new one on me.

274
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,440
That makes him so happy, I'm sure.

275
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,280
I hope he's got some lubricant with that.

276
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,780
I'm surprised I can still sit down.

277
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,520
Yes, yes, yes.

278
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,200
Long ago, I had said.

279
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,520
Goat Seed by Bob.

280
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,760
That every subgenius.

281
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,260
Oh, ouch.

282
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,660
Every single subgenius.

283
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:49,980
The boat.

284
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:49,980


285
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,060


286
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,060


287
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,060


288
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,060


289
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,060


290
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,060


291
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,060


292
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,060


293
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,060


294
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,060


295
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,060


296
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,060


297
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,440
No, that pipe is big, man.

298
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,800
Is a part of Bob.

299
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,980
Every subgenius is a body part of Bob.

300
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,060
And I figured out stangs.

301
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,760
Adenoids.

302
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,680
Why does everybody pick on me?

303
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,800
You're the scribe, man, you know?

304
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,500
I think Charlie Brown said that, didn't he?

305
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,280
So, so which part would I be?

306
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,600
Well, it's the part where all the crap comes out.

307
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,120
You don't want to know.

308
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,120


309
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,120
The mouth.

310
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,280
The mouth.

311
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,420
The mouth.

312
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,840
Kind of in a back ways way of looking at it, unless it's a William Burroughs story,

313
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,000
and then it could be the mouth.

314
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:26,360
Yeah.

315
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,160
You know, we're all pipes in a way, because we're basically donut shaped.

316
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,260
There's a hole at one end and a hole at the other.

317
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,860
And you can actually run a string all the way.

318
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,060
And it's like a crazy straw.

319
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,540
You could run a string all the way through.

320
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,160
Yeah.

321
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,500
And the same.

322
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,080
Matt's crumb effect.

323
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,440
I've been tired of Knight's Monster Tri-Z.

324
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,340
Almost every single.

325
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,060
And I think I saw an S. Clay Wilson drawing where the smoke was actually.

326
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,180
Yeah.

327
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,260
Actually filtered through the whole person there as a filtration device.

328
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,100
Oh, wow.

329
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,600
Wow.

330
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:55,860
Yeah.

331
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,760
Well, topologically, we are pipe shaped or donut shaped.

332
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,220
Right.

333
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,600
A pipe is just a very weird shaped donut.

334
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,100
You could say.

335
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,060
A torus.

336
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,280
A toroid form.

337
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:08,740
Yeah.

338
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:08,740


339
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,280
Maybe we're all Klein bottles.

340
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,600
Uh-uh.

341
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,620
That would explain a lot.

342
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,780
I tell you, it freaks me out to think about that.

343
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,820
When my son was little, he.

344
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,800
I was a Mobius child.

345
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,320
I was a stripper.

346
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,560
The term, the word infinity really bothered my son.

347
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,220
I can see that.

348
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,240
The concept of it irritated him and scared him.

349
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,800
And just hearing the word made him think of it.

350
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,060
He was more into infinity.

351
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,360
Which it hurt his head, you know.

352
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,720
He was sort of precocious.

353
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:46,400
He also, like me, seems to feel the cold breath of the Grim Reaper breathing down his neck

354
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,800
every second of his life.

355
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,900
I feel that down my pants.

356
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,440
Does it?

357
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,360
It doesn't like to waste time because of that.

358
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:03,580
Which means, you know, not wasting time could mean you should sit around doing lazy, pointless

359
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,000
things that you sort of like to do because you should.

360
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,580
Some wise man said you should live as if this was your last day or as if you were going

361
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,200
to live forever.

362
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,040
One or the other.

363
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
Anything else is a cheat.

364
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,060
From PR News in Washington.

365
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,780
I'm Sarah.

366
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,920
I'm Sarah McGuire.

367
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:23,920


368
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:23,920


369
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,820
won't let students see former Attorney General John Ashcroft.

370
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,680
Ashcroft was arrested yesterday for murdering his own family last weekend

371
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,400
at a mobile home park near Brunswick.

372
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,040
Seven of the eight people killed were repugnant.

373
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,860
Space shuttle Discovery astronauts are reporting humans started the space station today.

374
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,760
This is PR.

375
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,700
American lawmakers are now 42% contained.

376
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,460
They're expecting an uptick in unfair PR news in Washington.

377
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,500
Wow.

378
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:58,580
I feel like I'm in a restaurant somewhere off of Route 29 in North Carolina.

379
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,140
And the guys in the band are wearing sparkly jackets.

380
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:02,920
Right.

381
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,220
Bright colored handkerchiefs on the pockets.

382
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,600
I'm trying to order a fettuccine Alfredo, but a man with a pipe comes up to me.

383
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,540
Try the veal.

384
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,480
He says, look, Pisces, don't order the Alfredo.

385
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,480
And I say, but Bob, I like Alfredo.

386
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,420
Look, Pisces, don't.

387
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,480
Order the Alfredo.

388
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,300
I said, well, then I don't want to eat here.

389
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,600
He goes, fine.

390
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,720
And I leave.

391
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,460
And the place blows up.

392
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,640
Wow.

393
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,160
See, there's a moral to the story.

394
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,240
Do what Bob says.

395
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,060
Exactly.

396
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,840
I'm Alfredo to dark.

397
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,100
The band Devo did what Bob said.

398
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,160
Bob said, Devo, Warner Brothers isn't any good.

399
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,280
You need to end your contract with Warner Brothers and go with some little label.

400
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,680
And then do music that's going to appeal to the mainstream.

401
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,120
And they did.

402
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,900
And that was the end of Devo for about 10, 15 years.

403
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,860
Now they're back doing all their old stuff.

404
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,900
Having a good time?

405
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,440
Oh, yeah.

406
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,220
Having a great time.

407
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:15,740
So as far as I know, I've actually seen most of the Devo's fairly recently.

408
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,760
They're, you know, I think Jerry's 61.

409
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,260
Yeah.

410
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:20,260


411
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,700
Now, but he's just as filthy minded as ever.

412
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,120
Oh, that's a relief.

413
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,600
Yeah.

414
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:27,880
Yeah.

415
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,960
He's he has his own band called Jihad Jerry.

416
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,840
Have you ever heard any Jihad Jerry?

417
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,920
Oh, it's great.

418
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:40,740
He's a he wears a turban and it looks like a jihadist, basically.

419
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:47,480
But it's kind of a cocktail lounge turban terrorist outfit, you might say.

420
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:47,920
Wow.

421
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,980
Nairobi trio.

422
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,720
Space age.

423
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,140
Bachelor terrorists.

424
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,780
By way of Somalia.

425
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,260
Right.

426
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,460
Snapping and...

427
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:54,980
Yeah.

428
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,100
Yeah.

429
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,220
Yeah.

430
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:55,600
You can...

431
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:03,860
Or devotees, if you didn't know about Jihad Jerry, just Google or Goggle or whatever that

432
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,700
is, Twitter it or tweet it or whatever you kids do nowadays.

433
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,280
Not necessarily beautiful, but mutated.

434
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,160
It's come out what?

435
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,980
Number eight?

436
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,620
Yes.

437
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,260
Volume eight.

438
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,640
Now?

439
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,140
Yes.

440
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,540
I have not mentioned that yet on my show.

441
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,760
And St. Byron Werner, who's spinning the discs here.

442
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,240
He was a part of the show.

443
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,240


444
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,500
I'm a potato.

445
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:20,500


446
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:20,500


447
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:20,500


448
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,440
Yeah.

449
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,600
The rural war room cover of...

450
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,920
I'm a potato.

451
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,320
I'm a potato.

452
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,960
It has to be heard to be believed.

453
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,700
Then you will be heard on our Slack number 1,221.

454
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,720
It's fantastic.

455
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,280
Yeah, that's it.

456
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,240
I also like Devo Dan's version of hey homo.

457
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,380
That's wonderful.

458
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,180
This sounds like the launching sequence for the...

459
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,220
The launching sequence.

460
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


461
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


462
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


463
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


464
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


465
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


466
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


467
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


468
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


469
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


470
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


471
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


472
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,220


473
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:58,840
The lady who turned me on to hey homo, I have a recording of her doing a gorgeous gospel

474
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,820
Bob song.

475
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:06,160
She's also in the Mutant Mountain Boys, which is a bluegrass group out of Appalachia that

476
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,040
covers Devo.

477
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,740
So that'll be coming up on our Slack.

478
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,920
That was a little subgenius gospel tune.

479
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,680
And we've got one more for you tonight.

480
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,220
I know you're sick of us already.

481
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,200
And we need you all to tell us what you think.

482
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,200


483
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,200


484
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,580
So we're going to play a little bit of the song.

485
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,880
So if you get to know the tune to this, sing it along with us.

486
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,280
Help us praise Bob.

487
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,260
Thank you.

488
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:48,860
May your records be unbroken by and by, by and by.

489
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,180
I'm a potato.

490
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:50,180


491
00:15:52,660 --> 00:16:05,380
There's a vine of heaven waitin' in the sky Bob, in the sky.

492
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,780
Well I've played the beast that beat me.

493
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:20,340
One bright and sunny day

494
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,780
When I've been listening too fast

495
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,100
I put on some Q&A

496
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:37,140
My turntable started jumping

497
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:42,040
What it did I know not how

498
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,000
Won't live by the looks of how I cried

499
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,600
When it scratched my duty now

500
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,120
Sing it with me

501
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,560
May your records be unbroken

502
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,480
By and by, by and by

503
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,320
There's a vinyl

504
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,300
Every way they turn in the sky

505
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,020
By and by, by and by

506
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,780
There's a vinyl

507
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,600
Every way they turn in the sky

508
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,620
But I bought a second copy

509
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,040
Listened through red-eye express

510
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,300
When my girlfriend

511
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,260
She came on to me

512
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,760
Started taking on her dress

513
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,220
So when I could've, could've

514
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,580
I should call me

515
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,020
My turntable started jumping

516
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,000
With a sweeping, silky voice

517
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,680
I just told her

518
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,960
You gotta wait now

519
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,800
Girl, I'm listening to the freedom of choice

520
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:01,240
May your records be unbroken

521
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,960
By and by, by and by

522
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,080
There's a vinyl

523
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,920
Every way they turn in the sky

524
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,240
By and by, by and by

525
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,080
But I know I've been a sinner

526
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,540
In my life, that evil twist

527
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:33,280
Gotta say I ain't no Christian child

528
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,100
Cause I'm a new traditionalist

529
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,660
But I know I'm a new traditionalist

530
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,060
But I know I'm a new traditionalist

531
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,060


532
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,760
And I hear that truth evolving

533
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,300
Oh no, I never stop

534
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:54,360
But my heart is never glad of it

535
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,580
When I shout that name above

536
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,580
May your records be unbroken

537
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,000
By and by, by and by

538
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,040
Oh no, I never stop

539
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,300
There's a vinyl

540
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,220
Every way they turn in the sky

541
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,900
By and by, by and by

542
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,520
There's a vinyl

543
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:22,520


544
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,880
Now I know I

545
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,080
Ain't no youngin'

546
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,900
One day I gonna be old

547
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,120
I got that

548
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,260
Turntable

549
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,020
And I got that devil feelin'

550
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,560
And now it can't be told

551
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,280
But I got my high five

552
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,020
I got my jukebox

553
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,440
I got my album and my ladder

554
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,120
Should I ever lose my way

555
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,040
Now I'm a sinner in my life

556
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,820
Like I spoke no lie

557
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,920
Now I'm a sinner in my life

558
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,760
May your records be unbroken

559
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,380
May your records be unbroken

560
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,240
By and by, by and by

561
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,460
By and by, by and by

562
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,600
There's a vinyl

563
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,380
Heaven waves it in the sky

564
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,100
Oh I'll bear the sky one more time

565
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,700
May your records be unbroken

566
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,020
May your records be unbroken

567
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,020


568
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,160
May your records be unbroken

569
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,480
By and by, by and by

570
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,600
There's a vinyl

571
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:58,040
Heaven waves it in the sky

572
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,300
In the sky

573
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,400
By and by, by and by

574
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,600
In the sky

575
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,700
Baby there's a diamond sketch

576
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:09,700


577
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:09,700


578
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:18,060
Oh-oh, oh-oh, one day I gotta get old

579
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,060


580
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:23,320
This game is in the way

581
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,120
of your life

582
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:37,520
Mind is all about knowing

583
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,680
group out of Detroit that covers

584
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,940
Negative Land

585
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,480
called the 180Gs

586
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,100
and listeners

587
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,220
who are familiar with Negative Land

588
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,800
will be

589
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,700
how shall I put this, excremeditating

590
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,600
their britches when they hear

591
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,200
this stuff.

592
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,660
It's kind of rare because the only way to get

593
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,300
it is you have to buy Negative Land's new

594
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,760
DVD

595
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,840
My Favorite Things

596
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,040
or some of our favorite things

597
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
which is absolutely

598
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,620
mind-raping

599
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,760
DVD.

600
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,040
Does it tie you down first?

601
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,680
Huh? Does it tie you down first?

602
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,160
It doesn't have to.

603
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,620
Only if you ask it not to.

604
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,560
Your brain bends over and takes it.

605
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,580
Recording.

606
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,740
Everything's going fine.

607
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,660
No trouble.

608
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
Just get set and get going.

609
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:30,980
Amen.

610
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,180
Recording.

611
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,340
Everything's going fine.

No trouble.

613
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,000
Just get set and get going.

614
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,440
Amen.

615
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,720
Recording.

616
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,880
Everything's going fine.

No trouble.

618
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,620
Just get set and get going.

Everything's going fine.

No trouble.

623
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,220
Just get set and get going.

624
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,760
Amen.

625
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,920
Recording.

626
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,060
Everything's going fine.

627
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,380
No trouble.

628
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,920
get set, get going.

629
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,320
Amen.

630
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,460
Recording.

631
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,660
Everything's going fine.

No trouble.

633
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,440

00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:18,920
Amen.

635
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,120
Recording.

636
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,400
Everything's going fine.

637
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,600
No trouble.

638
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,140
Get set, get going.

639
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,540
Amen.

640
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,640
Recording.

641
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,960
Everything's going fine.

642
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,320
No trouble.

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,180
No trouble, no trouble, no trouble

644
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,020
Get set, get going, do it

645
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,040
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

646
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,280
Everything's going fine

647
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,380
No trouble, do it

648
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,700
Get set, get going, do it

649
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,800
I wanna see you one day

650
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,960
Everything's going fine

651
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,200
No trouble

652
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,620
Just get set and get going

653
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,420
Do it, do it, do it, do it

654
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,020
To the S, to the E

655
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,080
To the X, to the D

656
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,380
To the I, to the R, to the T

657
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,300
To the Y, to the Z

658
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,040
To the 180 G

659
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,800
Coming at y'all from the studio

660
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,600
In full live stereo

661
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,840
Some songs are old

662
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,860
Some of them be new to y'all

663
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,680
Ain't no trouble

664
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,060
Making new music out of mass media rubble

665
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,960
Everything's going fine

666
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,800
Hanging round the microphone

667
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,260
With a bottle of cold duck wine

668
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,180
We got fruit and crackers

669
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,040
And three kinds of cheese

670
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,680
Please allow me to introduce to you

671
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,060
The 180 G

672
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,280
To the S, to the E

673
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,780
Everything's going fine

674
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,880
We know y'all gonna listen

675
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,180
And try to understand

676
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,920
We're taking a positive journey

677
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,960
Through a negative land

678
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,260
Duh, duh, duh, duh

679
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,580
Calling the number is 180

680
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,940
Everything's going fine

681
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,740
And the letter is G

682
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,940
No trouble, no trouble

683
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,580
Get going up, up, up

684
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,200
Calling the number is 180

685
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,480
Everything's going fine

686
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,400
And the letter is G

687
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,560
No trouble, no trouble

688
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,260
Get going up, up, up

689
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,740
You know, I'm going to have to call my ride in about 10 minutes or so, I think.

690
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,420
Oh, that's what they call it now.

691
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,760
Yeah, that's what the cast...

692
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,800
I got to pick that up from my kids.

693
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,260
Who's the one being ridden?

694
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,300
Are you the rider or are you the driver?

695
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,280
I'm always the catcher.

696
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,660
Or the flak catcher.

697
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:22,700
I thought the job was slack catcher, but it turned out to be flak catcher.

698
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,340
Is it more like crack snacker?

699
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,540
Don't they wear lobsters on their legs?

700
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,480
I noticed here at the WREK studio,

701
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:38,260
there was kind of a mailbox set up with different shows.

702
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,980
With Dymo labels.

703
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:47,020
Yeah, the one for my show seemed to say the hour of lack.

704
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,560
Yes, I like that.

705
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,520
There was some problem.

706
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,780
They had problems with their S.

707
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,760
I like that.

708
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,220
I have problems with my S's sometimes.

709
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,420
Yeah, mine gives me no end of grief.

710
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,060
No end.

711
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,840
No end.

712
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:02,960
Yeah.

713
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,640
What a wise S.

714
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,600
What a wise S you are.

715
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,940
Yeah, she is pretty wise.

716
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,760
Yeah, I was cracking up.

717
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,320
Yeah, they offered to make me another label when I said the hour of lack.

718
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,580
They're like, no, I love it.

719
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,080
It says everything I think about your show stinks.

720
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,680
Thanks so much, Susie.

721
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,320
Yes.

722
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,320
Can you feel the love in this room?

723
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,360
It's sort of thick and heavy and smothering.

724
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,820
Oh, I can feel the love all right.

725
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,020
It smells like a mean spirit.

726
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,460
It's not dead.

727
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,780
Which also smells like a fish.

728
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,160
It smells like fish.

729
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,600
Mm-hmm.

730
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,360
What doesn't?

731
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,600
Give it enough time.

732
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,220
Everything smells like fish.

733
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,920
After three days, right?

734
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,540
Yeah.

735
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,560
Okay, that's what I thought.

736
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,720
I think Ben Franklin said that.

737
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,460
Mm-hmm.

738
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,720
In a way, maybe.

739
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,440
Something about dead bodies, fish.

740
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,220
Yeah.

741
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,600
Yeah.

742
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,700
Ben Franklin also said lighthouses are more useful than churches.

743
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,460
Good old Ben.

744
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:02,760
Yeah.

745
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


746
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


747
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


748
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


749
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


750
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


751
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


752
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


753
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


754
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


755
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


756
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


757
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,760


758
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,300
The only president who was never president.

759
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:06,980
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

760
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:13,400
I heard a woman homeschooling her kids when I worked in the library, and she was saying

761
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,960
something about Ben Franklin and I'm shelving books, and I almost fell out, she said.

762
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,980
She was telling him about things he discovered, and then she held up the book, and she said,

763
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,480
children, here's a picture of President Franklin.

764
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,860
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

765
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,760
I heard a lady at our library said, Ben Franklin, you're the only president in the world.

766
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:32,760


767
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:38,440
I heard a lady showing kids this statue out in the garden of Icarus, and she's saying,

768
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:44,180
well, this happened a long time ago, and no one was sure if it happened or not, but there

769
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,880
were a lot of eyewitnesses.

770
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,600
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

771
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,840
Yeah.

772
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:50,980
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

773
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,680
Arkansas.

774
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,840
Ladies and gentlemen, and this is why everything is screwed up.

775
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,220
Diva was right about everything.

776
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,580
About everything.

777
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:02,860
About her.

778
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,620
Gosh, that's a great song.

779
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,320
Yeah.

780
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:05,940
Yeah.

781
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,100
Yeah.

782
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,800
She's...

783
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,440
Pisces is referring to a song by a British group called The Attery Squash, and Reverend

784
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,020
Diva Schematic is the lead singer in that.

785
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,600
She is incredible.

786
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:33,860
She's incredible.

787
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:34,980
She's incredible.

788
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:57,760
I love her.

789
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:02,600


790
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:02,600


791
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:02,640
I love her.

792
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:02,720
I love her.

793
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,960
around Nobody recognises substance in its sound

794
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,460
Remember?

795
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,700
We danced in groups, that was the fashion of the time

796
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:18,560
To songs we moved every night We built our lives on fire, that neon dream

797
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,960
pop And now, and then, it was our time

798
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:44,360
Now every generation needs its own identity So they just borrow one from two decades back

799
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,100
Then they get bored with it and pass a glowstick to a younger band

800
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,880
Who haven't yet become all jaded and pratt

801
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,780
Now we don't mind our future listeners of the song

802
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,560
You don't remember who we are or where we're from

803
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,700
And that's okay, cause when they reassure us

804
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:02,700


805
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,140
You've been stressed We can't pretend that we were here

806
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,440
Way back in the day

807
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,680
We danced in groups, that was the fashion of the time

808
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:18,640
To songs we moved every night We built our lives on fire, that neon dream

809
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,940
pop And now, and then, it was our time

810
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,640
We danced in groups, that was the fashion of the time

811
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,700
To songs we moved every night We built our lives on fire, that neon dream

812
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,020
Part of me I'm a dream pop

813
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,040
And now, and then, it was our time

814
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,320
Now life's too short to wait

815
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,440
For the enemy to tell you

816
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,020
What guilty pleasures are

817
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,520
And what's too cool for school

818
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,880
Though lucky us, this song

819
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,620
Coincides with some revival

820
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,340
Don't wait for anyone to tell you

821
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,120
What to like

822
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,220
Oh wow, a black and white

823
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,200
That shows we've got the common touch

824
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,000
Kids make themselves unhappy

825
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,380
Just to fit in

826
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,500
And if you need this song to realize

827
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,240
That quite simplistic point

828
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,660
Don't worry, here comes another big old

829
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,280
Sing along

830
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,380
We dance in groups

831
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,620
As was the fashion of the time

832
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,200
To songs we move every night

833
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,980
We built our lives

834
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,880
Off of our own me on dream pop

835
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,840
And now, and then, it was our time

836
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,520
We dance in groups

837
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,220
As was the fashion of the time

838
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,360
We dance in groups

839
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,700
We dance in groups

840
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,480
We dance in groups

841
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,620
As was the fashion of the time

842
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,960
She is incredible.

843
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,180
You know, I don't know what she looks like

844
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,100
I do.

845
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,300
I have a Facebook recognition problem

846
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:55,780
Right.

847
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,160
Isn't there another song?

848
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,020
I think Caldivo was right on

849
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,220
Not Necessarily Beautiful But Mutated

850
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:03,820
Number 7

851
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,540
With some guy doing it

852
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,080
I don't know

853
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,160
I thought you might have gotten that one

854
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,520
You're thinking Byron was wrong about everything

855
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:13,980
Yes

856
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,260
That wasn't on volume 7 though

857
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,620
Who did that? Pivo?

858
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Or is it Wevo?

859
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,680
Pivo, I think

860
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,940
Oh man

861
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,220
Man, non-stop Pivo

862
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,680
The new Pivo record is out of sight

863
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,540
I just gotta say

864
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,400
Well, you're one of those Japanophiles, right?

865
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,840
I like some of the stuff from Japan

866
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,680
The stuff that's really lively and Devo-inspired

867
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,340
Like Poly6 or P-Model

868
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,560
Or groups like that

869
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,060
Pivo

870
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,240
I wish I wasn't completely and utterly deaf

871
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,200
What?

872
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,240
I could still hear music

873
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,780
What?

874
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,700
I can read your lips

875
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,560
Quit making that joke

876
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,380
But you can't read

877
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,980
You know, everybody says that

878
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,420
Well then try it like this, Stang

879
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,480
There are some lips you cannot read

880
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,940
I can make fun of you because I'm almost deaf too

881
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,320
It's the price we pay, friends

882
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,640
So you should donate the next pledge drive to this station

883
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,280
Whichever station you happen to be hearing this on

884
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,220
We don't need pledge drives, we're rich

885
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,780
And, uh, really?

886
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,020
Yeah, WREK doesn't do pledge drives

887
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,660
We're rolling in money, what do you think you're sitting on?

888
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,000
That's bales of money, Stang

889
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,900
Oh, what?

890
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,160
Wow

891
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,520
Yeah, look at this

892
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,480
Look at this place, it's so posh

893
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,880
The station I leech off of is at a state university

894
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,640
Well, this is a state university, isn't it?

895
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,940
No, it's Georgia Tech, that means they're God

896
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,760
Oh, so it's Rich Kid College, right?

897
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,620
Yeah

898
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,040
Yeah, see, ours is for the poor farm kids

899
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,920
And look, we're not fighting over microphones

900
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,340
We've got extra microphones here

901
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,320
And you've got turntables

902
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,100
That's where Bob is sitting on mic number two

903
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,840
Because these microphones

904
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,060
Bob is full of number two

905
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,060
And they don't interfere with my boobs

906
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:04,780
Yeah

907
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,540
That's true, they're not causing feedback

908
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:07,980
Yeah

909
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,160
No feedback

910
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,900
Pisces is, uh, built like a house

911
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,360
A ceramic defecatorium

912
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:23,700
Yeah, and, um, and we, at Ex Day with our Tarzan's radio station

913
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,020
We discovered that you were kind of a feedback machine

914
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,440
Right

915
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,180
In certain positions

916
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,420
Wow, just like Sherman and Mr. Peabody

917
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,300
We should have set you up in front of a theremin

918
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,620
You get a kind of a liquidy sound

919
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,780
I've played the theremin with my boobs before

920
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,160
Yeah

921
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,800
I did not know my boobs had any musical talent

922
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,360
Right

923
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,000
One for volume, one for pitch

924
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,960
Right, yeah

925
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,180
See, I can even try

926
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,800
Yes, well, but see, we're not, we don't have speakers

927
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,600
There's no, there's no big speakers

928
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,860
That's what that, so you can't

929
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,020
I was hoping we were getting feedback

930
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,220
Maybe we don't have enough ums

931
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,860
Ums?

932
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,380
Ums

933
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,560
Listen, I wish you listeners could see what I'm seeing

934
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,800
This doesn't have a camera in it, does it?

935
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,080
No, every, everywhere has cameras

936
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,100
It's a good thing no one has a camera in this studio right now

937
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,680
The camera's probably under there

938
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,520
Yeah

939
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,620
We're in a public building, and they've got cameras

940
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,220
Oh, okay, so

941
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,620
No, I meant, you know, like the streaming kind

942
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,880
Some, some, uh

943
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,340
Oh, it's streaming somewhere

944
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:28,960
Somewhere

945
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,940
Some unparanoid stations have

946
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,560
That's not a sprinkler nozzle

947
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,820
Have a little, have a little camera so that

948
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,680
He's just glad to see you

949
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,900
The internet listeners can watch a person sitting there

950
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,440
Pushing a button every now and then

951
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,800
That's a camera, and it also releases a sleeping gas

952
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,620
Oh

953
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,620
They're very thorough here, I mean, they study a lot of things

954
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,600
That's pretty professional, yeah, I guess

955
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:50,760
Yeah

956
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,120
Yeah

957
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,520
Quest for Knowledge covers up a lot

958
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,340
I saw that, it had Ron Perlman in it, right?

959
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,140
What?

960
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,880
Oh, Quest for Knowledge, yeah

961
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,200
Yeah, he played the caveman

962
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,020
Yeah, yeah, and, uh

963
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,880
I played the caveman

964
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,940
And my, my daughter was in it

965
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,080
Tommy Chong's little, little girl's in that

966
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,980
She teaches Amadou, well, dance

967
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,520
Down here, they called it the Quest for Far

968
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,860
Right, a dance

969
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,260
Yeah, she teaches Amadou dance face-to-face

970
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:17,980
Yeah

971
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,840
Rather than a kind of a rumba or something, I guess that was

972
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,460
Far

973
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,820
You know, there's a town in North Carolina, and it's spelled K-I-N-G, but it's called

974
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,220
K-I-N-G

975
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,300
There's a place called Fuquay Varina

976
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,080
Yes

977
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,040
North Carolina

978
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,100
And as, and as you can imagine, I want you to, listeners, say that

979
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,680
Fuquay Varina

980
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,420
I had to drive there in the middle of the night

981
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,460
And all I wanted to ask the guy, where did this place get a name like that?

982
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,620
Here's what you should all do

983
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,640
There's a town in Ohio by the name of Chardon, C-H-A-R-D-O-N

984
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,720
Where the kids are always knocking off the C's on the street

985
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:58,800
Fuquay Varina, North Carolina

986
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,560
That's a suburb of Cleveland

987
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,740
I call it Chardon

988
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,180
Sure, sure

989
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,180
Chardonnay

990
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,740
There's also a street called Ivanhoe

991
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,260
Which I like

992
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,700
They got that right

993
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,160
It intersects with St. Clair

994
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,060
That's one of the most deadly

995
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,680
Neighborhoods on the planet

996
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,880
I promise you

997
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,080
I go to work once a week

998
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,720
I do the ghost tour up at

999
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,520
Marietta Square

1000
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,600
And I have to report to work on the corner

1001
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,320
Of Dobbs and Church

1002
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,460
Streets

1003
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,760
Wow, that's pretty good

1004
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,680
Show us a JPEG

1005
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,020
It's right by

1006
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,760
It's about just a few feet

1007
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,020
From JonBenet Ramsey

1008
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,780
Show us your JPEGs

1009
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,660
Show us your GIFs

1010
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,240
Oh, that's a thing nowadays

1011
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,900
Never look a GIF horse in the mouth

1012
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,600
Or up the other

1013
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,580
And are we gonna go see

1014
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,400
JonBenet while you're in town?

1015
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,060
You know she asks about you all the time

1016
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,720
She remembers how you

1017
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,840
Desecrated her grave when it was fresh

1018
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,800
The last time you were in town

1019
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,660
In 1997

1020
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,280
Do you remember that little trip?

1021
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,400
Yes, I remember

1022
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,820
I've still got the letters

1023
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,120
You blamed Jesus for it

1024
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,220
You robbed a murdered little girl's grave

1025
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,220
Yeah, we did

1026
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,440
And not only that, but we read the letters

1027
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,200
Over the air

1028
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,580
She stole the letters over the air

1029
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,140
And the letters that were left there

1030
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,960
They were just amazing psychological

1031
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,480
Windows on really hideous lives

1032
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,420
Okay

1033
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,320
Okay, quick

1034
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,840
Live with me if you wanna come

1035
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,920
I know why you're here

1036
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,780
Oh yes, I understand

1037
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,620
The needs which drive you

1038
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,600
The desire, the lust

1039
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,560
That libidinous twist

1040
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,520
Inside you

1041
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,060
Because you want to get a little slack

1042
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,400
I'm right, aren't I?

1043
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,820
I'm crazy, but I'm right

1044
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,800
Oh yes

1045
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,920
Oh

1046
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,360
Oh yes, I can smell your need

1047
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:14,940
On you

1048
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,400
Through my bob-given third nostril

1049
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,300
Oh, that third nostril

1050
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,860
That he's gonna open up for you

1051
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,720
And I can whip-read

1052
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,620
The psychic stench

1053
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,280
Of a mere handful

1054
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,220
Of precious, unsaved subgenius souls

1055
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:30,860
Out there

1056
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,980
I know you're out there

1057
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,100
And you know, I know

1058
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,240
That you wanna give it up

1059
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,220
For Bob

1060
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,620
Yeah

1061
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,700
Oh, that is always good

1062
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,860
Because, seekers, this is

1063
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,920
A feel-good religion

1064
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,980
And the Church of the Subgenius

1065
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,820
Says not only that

1066
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,580
We're a feel-good and after-you-go-good religion

1067
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,240
You get your rocks off

1068
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,420
You walk away and leave the mess

1069
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,040
Yes!

1070
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,080
In a nutshell

1071
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,720
That's the promise of X-Day

1072
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:15,220
Because we want to leave this stinking, smoking, charred world behind us

1073
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:20,220
Oh, we shall commune with the sex goddesses of Planet X

1074
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,740
Thanks to Bob

1075
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,620
Oh, sure, it hasn't happened yet

1076
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,580
Oh, but we are going to get our slack

1077
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,280
By any means necessary

1078
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,600
We take our slack where we can get it

1079
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,420
We can abuse an inch of slack

1080
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,040
Into a parsec

1081
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,560
Absolutely

1082
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,220
Oh, but also within this hideous, compelling course

1083
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,500
Is concealed the face of death

1084
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,880
Death is ever lurking

1085
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,320
A clear and present enemy

1086
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,780
Sucking at your heels

1087
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,260
But even worse is a conspiracy

1088
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,820
About the death of a subgenius soul

1089
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,400
Because you might look

1090
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,360
Like you're alive

1091
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,740
Oh, but you're smothered in false slack

1092
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,400
It might feel like the real thing

1093
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,600
If you drink enough of this beer

1094
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,360
Or if you wear these shoes

1095
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,100
Or if you drive this car

1096
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,620
You are going to be just as happy

1097
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,100
As the idiots you see in the commercials

1098
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,280
That's not possible

1099
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,920
Because friends, that is a base illusion

1100
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,460
You might think you're surfing the lux lane with Bob

1101
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,220
When in reality you can't see it

1102
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,520
But baby, you're tailgating the honey wagon

1103
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,940
Dance Trace

1104
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:43,460
And you don't even smell the shit looming

1105
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,200
In your immediate future

1106
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,420
You've been brainwashed to ignore the shit

1107
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,260
You're swimming through now

1108
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,820
How can you accept the existence of more shit

1109
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,440
If you're blind to that?

1110
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,460
Oh, because you're suffocated

1111
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,640
Under layers of expectations

1112
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,140
And responsibilities

1113
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,280
And vapid media

1114
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,360
Entertainment

1115
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,500
And all of the snores you can't even see

1116
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,580
The conspiracy's rigid template

1117
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,460
Is constantly pressing down on you

1118
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,820
And you have to cut off parts of yourself

1119
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,640
Just to fit in

1120
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,780
Well

1121
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,720
As much as I hate to quote Dr. Phil

1122
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,620
How's that been working for you so far?

1123
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,940
Sounds like you need a little bit of a change

1124
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,540
Because you know, Seekers

1125
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,720
If you're not happy

1126
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,020
That's not your fault

1127
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,320
In your helpless pursuit of happiness

1128
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,760
The conspiracy of the normals ensures

1129
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,780
That your miserable existence

1130
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,000
Is more of a curse than a joy

1131
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,900
When you know that you are the superior species

1132
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,820
Aren't you?

1133
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,760
Aren't you?

1134
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,180
Dance Trace

1135
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,260
Dance Trace

1136
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,600
Oh yes

1137
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,440
Because

1138
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,340
Uh

1139
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,260
You've been called so many names

1140
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,920
You who have been called weirdo

1141
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,380
Geek

1142
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,220
Mutant

1143
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,120
Oddball

1144
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,220
Psycho

1145
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,180
Throwback

1146
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,520
Dildo

1147
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,560
Dipshit

1148
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,120
Doofus

1149
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,100
Have been spectacle-y

1150
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,680
Don't slab a wimpy

1151
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,620
You are boss me

1152
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:33,940
You are boss me

1153
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,280
Listen to my horse croak

1154
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,300
Oh you're gonna be doing that little girl voice stang

1155
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,120
Hi dear friends I'm my friend Susie the Flussy

1156
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:48,180
And yeah I'll have to put some cheaters in there

1157
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,640
And give you a nice stuffed balcony

1158
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,580
Some cutlets

1159
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,340
Yep

1160
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,980
We'll get real chicken cutlets

1161
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,580
That'll work

1162
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,120
Well our nice devival will be the most merciful devival

1163
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,440
Because we're limited to only 40 minutes

1164
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,780
We're in between two giant Tesla coils

1165
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,520
You're right

1166
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,340
And they have to cool down

1167
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,480
Yeah we will be performing between gigantic

1168
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,440
Testicle coils

1169
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,020
Yeah

1170
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,080
Teslacles

1171
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,700
Is the jargon term

1172
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,060
Teslacles

1173
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:16,680
Oh okay

1174
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:16,900
Yeah

1175
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,760
They play music with them

1176
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,180
It's that that Nicholas Tellsa

1177
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:21,920
Yeah

1178
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,000
Have you said

1179
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,940
He's from Venus

1180
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,540
He's on the Czechoslovakian money

1181
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,020
Nikola Tesla is

1182
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:29,940
And uh

1183
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,680
No I think he's on the nickel

1184
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,540
No we were shown the bill and it also had Bob

1185
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,600
What

1186
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:37,940
What

1187
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:42,920
Well it could have been a printing error somewhere after it left the treasury

1188
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,940
Well there's a

1189
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,480
Czechoslovakia

1190
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,880
Maybe they launched a nickel on the Telstar satellite

1191
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,400
You know the communications

1192
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,500
Marijuana is the fuse

1193
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,380
But LSD is the Bob

1194
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:02,160
I would take a bunch of Bobs

1195
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,960
And blow up

1196
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,600
And blow up

1197
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,940
All the planets

1198
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,780
Man yes the most evil of the super villains is only six years old

1199
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,760
Wait until he's ten

1200
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,740
My God

1201
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,700
He'll take on whole galaxies

1202
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:22,480
Maybe he'll blow up the planet Bob that we heard about in Titan Asia

1203
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,840
Oh God yeah

1204
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,540
Fortunately he was too short to hit the destruct button

1205
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,860
On the thing you must be at least this tall to destroy the earth so

1206
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:36,500
Yeah they actually had an earth destruction machine in that super villain

1207
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,840
That's kind of a risky place to bring a machine like that

1208
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,520
That sounds like a Warner Brothers thing that Marvin the Martian would have

1209
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,620
It had a big shiny candy like button

1210
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,580
Candy red button

1211
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:52,460
And when you pushed it smoke started coming out of it

1212
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,480
Yeah and weird lights and bad noises

1213
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,240
It was a good history eraser machine

1214
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,300
And smells but I think that might have been from the audience

1215
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,860
Oh you mean it wasn't just like wire grown

1216
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,660
I think they pooped themselves in fear because that thing looked lethal

1217
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,420
Yeah yeah

1218
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,140
Well we've fallen in with the scientists now

1219
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:16,180
We're no longer relegated to the comics track

1220
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,260
They never know what to do with the church

1221
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,420
We defy categorization

1222
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,440
Scientists are weirder than hippies

1223
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,800
Yeah oh man we're in with the freaks now

1224
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:31,900
Well we could sort of be in the skeptic track except that we're religious for now

1225
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,980
I don't believe in that stuff

1226
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,820
Skeptics are going to have to prove it to me before I believe their point of view

1227
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,780
I think we'll be in the filking track next year

1228
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,380
Oh God

1229
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,640
I want to be in the mime track

1230
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,400
You're a Dallas street mime weren't you?

1231
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,600
Yes I was

1232
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,440
Well not exactly but I was in the mime track

1233
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,480
I was a person who delivered balloons to sick people

1234
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,780
You were a Dallas street mime don't try to candy coat

1235
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,780
And then one day the car broke down

1236
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,600
Yes that's right

1237
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,680
And you had to go into some place and make a phone call

1238
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,640
And it turned out to be a rough sort of leather biker bar

1239
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,760
Where they were only too happy to see you and greeted you in a royal style

1240
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,340
That well was more like Catherine the Great

1241
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,040
Actually it was the Salvation Army

1242
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,880
Oh

1243
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,340
And I had to walk into the downtown Dallas Salvation Army

1244
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,080
With white face on and a tuxedo

1245
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,940
And all these homeless dudes sitting around going

1246
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,120
And I had to get

1247
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,380
I had the balloons for me

1248
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,740
The balloons for me

1249
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,600
The lightest man they've ever seen

1250
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,080
I had the balloons for me

1251
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,020
You didn't forget my birthday after all

1252
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,780
No he's going away

1253
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,160
God them was lean years

1254
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,220
You know I'm still

1255
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,600
To the left or to the right?

1256
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,120
I'm still

1257
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,800
Lanyards I think it's pronounced

1258
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,700
You can hang yourself with it either way

1259
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,680
Ha ha ha

1260
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,760
Ha ha ha

1261
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,060
And I thought my jokes were bad

1262
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,780
What?

1263
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,220
It's five times a day now

1264
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:58,940
Jokes?

1265
00:48:59,060 --> 00:48:59,140
Yeah

1266
00:48:59,140 --> 00:48:59,800
Jokes?

1267
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,420
Do you know some jokes?

1268
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,000
I got to say that to one guy dressed as the Joker

1269
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,260
It's a Joker line

1270
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,320
It's the first line Joker says in the Batman movie I think

1271
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,100
What?

1272
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,600
And I thought my jokes were bad

1273
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:16,480
Oh

1274
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,480
When he walks in on some gangsters just before he

1275
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,380
You said that kind of like

1276
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,320
Just before he does the magic trick where he makes them go

1277
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,260
And he makes the pencil disappear

1278
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:28,200
You said that as if Charles Nelson Riley and Paul Lynde had a baby

1279
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,380
Ha ha ha ha

1280
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,440
Ha ha ha

1281
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,600
I think they did

1282
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,020
Which one's going to carry it though?

1283
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,940
You know I saw

1284
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,280
They'll fight over it

1285
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,500
I saw people dressed as the Watchmen in all sizes

1286
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,240
There were silk specters that were tiny and skinny

1287
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,380
And they were great big large silk specters

1288
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,000
Ha ha ha

1289
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,160
They're just

1290
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,180
All of the Rorschachs were little guys though

1291
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,260
That was good

1292
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,420
I saw a 350 pound middle aged Batman

1293
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:03,100
Who had a 250 pound middle aged Robin with him

1294
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:03,660
Right

1295
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,340
They were walking on the street and it was just

1296
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,000
It was the spectacle

1297
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:09,480
That's beautiful

1298
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,880
That was

1299
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,480
That's so beautiful

1300
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,580
Normals are cruising by to take this in

1301
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,560
And I have no idea what they think of some of this

1302
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,060
Are you sure that wasn't actually Adam Webb?

1303
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,360
Adam West

1304
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:22,900
Trust me

1305
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,660
But he had the nipples

1306
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,880
Like on the gay Batman movie

1307
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,560
But they were on big man boobs

1308
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,140
Adam West he used to go by the name Bill Anderson

1309
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:37,600
When he advertised for the Piggly Wiggly markets in Hawaii

1310
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,800
Ha ha ha

1311
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,020
Adam West was once

1312
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,060
Bill Anderson

1313
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:46,960
Once given a professional massage by Sister Decadence

1314
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,160
With Happy Ending?

1315
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,520
He asked

1316
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,580
He asked about that

1317
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,040
And she doesn't actually do that

1318
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,220
Everyone asks about that

1319
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:54,920
Yeah she

1320
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,380
But

1321
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,320
Except for Charles Nelson Riley

1322
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,720
She was

1323
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,940
She was honored

1324
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,760
But she had to pull out

1325
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,120
He was a gentleman about it

1326
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,120
He was

1327
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:04,640
He wondered

1328
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,600
Do the Batusi

1329
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,040
He was pretty suave about the way he asked

1330
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,460
What else he could get besides just the regular massage

1331
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,840
I don't doubt that

1332
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,940
I read Burt Ward's tell all book

1333
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,260
Boy Wonder My Life in Tights

1334
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,300
Oh my God

1335
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,200
It was nothing but a huge sex romp with him and Adam West

1336
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,280
He wears the tights when he's not working

1337
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,560
They were up to their eyeballs in trim

1338
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,440
Constantly exploiting it

1339
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,120
Well there were TV stars

1340
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,860
I mean

1341
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,920
Boy those are tall women

1342
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,060
Just saying

1343
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,120
Ha ha ha

1344
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,640
I saw a perfect Julie Newmar Catwoman today

1345
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,160
I mean she

1346
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,800
Was she being a bitch?

1347
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,080
Well I've heard that that goes with the territory

1348
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:49,580
But

1349
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,300
She looked right

1350
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:52,780
That was unfortunate

1351
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,080
She did look right

1352
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:54,320
To find that out

1353
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,620
Julie Newmar moved to Dallas for some reason I think

1354
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:03,020
I saw her from a distance hobbling around somewhere

1355
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:09,520
That upper lip was so full of collagen now it's gonna cut off all of the edges of the nose

1356
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,580
I'm just saying

1357
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,440
Just saying?

1358
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,000
Yeah

1359
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,120
You don't have to hold back

1360
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,660
We got a history I don't want to bring it up

1361
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,920
Okay fair enough

1362
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,760
Fair enough

1363
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,100
Mm-hmm

1364
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:20,700
Mm-hmm

1365
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,680
My fellow citizens

1366
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:28,120
I stand here today

1367
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,200
Yet

1368
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,960
For us

1369
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,220
For us

1370
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,880
The time has come

1371
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,700
To seek the pleasures of riches and fame

1372
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,060
In places like Concord

1373
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,460
For us

1374
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,260
Because we have chosen conflict and discord

1375
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,080
Petty grievances and false promises

1376
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,620
And worn out dogmas

1377
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,680
Now

1378
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,640
Every so often

1379
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,240
A watchful eye

1380
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,500
Can spin out of control

1381
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,080
And so

1382
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:05,380
Recall that earlier generations who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents

1383
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,180
We are a nation of Jews

1384
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,060
Who seek to sow conflict

1385
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,120
These things

1386
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,680
Are true

1387
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,380
Thank you

1388
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,660
God bless you

1389
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,060
And God bless the United States of America

1390
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:21,600
Thank you

1391
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,580
You know it's only about what ten minutes before we press the big button

1392
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,260
Five minutes

1393
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,560
If that

1394
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,020
Seven

1395
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,720
Six

1396
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,880
Oh wait maybe five

1397
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,960
What the heck

1398
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,720
These are so

1399
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,420
You guys have some sort of read out here in the station

1400
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:35,920
I see

1401
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,240
One, two, three, four

1402
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,460
We've got six minutes

1403
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,280
Shau pha san twai waj mahal ya

1404
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,000
Don't say that

1405
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,160
It'll open up the dimension

1406
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,220
And the elder ones

1407
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,380
Will cross over

1408
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:45,040
Dammit

1409
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,460
You didn't say that out loud

1410
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:46,900
Did you

1411
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,560
It's all those technical things.

1412
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,960
Whatever you kids do now, don't knock on that trap door there and say,

1413
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,580
Y'all saw Toph three times.

1414
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,200
Would you stop?

1415
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,260
Okay, Mom, we won't.

1416
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,780
Really? Really?

1417
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,780
I can now have on my tentacle sex outfit.

1418
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,000
Eh, what?

1419
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,100
That brought a halt to everything.

1420
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,800
Tentacle sex outfit or something.

1421
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,100
Molioka. Molioka.

1422
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,440
When I have tentacle sex, I take my outfit off because that slime gets all over everything.

1423
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,400
That's why I said I have to have on the right outfit to start.

1424
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,940
And then it does turn into pulpo.

1425
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,140
It always does.

1426
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,860
It's always about pulpo.

1427
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,320
Polka?

1428
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,340
Pulpo.

1429
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,400
That's Californian for octopus.

1430
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,620
That sounds a lot like pup torb.

1431
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,200
Is there pulpo in pup torb?

1432
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,140
Is there pup torb in pulpo?

1433
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,480
You got your pup torb in my pulpo.

1434
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,200
You got your...

1435
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1436
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,400
It's slimy.

1437
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,880
This tastes awful.

1438
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:50,740
It smells like dead fish.

1439
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,700
We've seen it all.

1440
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,100
Maybe we'll get high.

1441
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,820
It's not a fish.

1442
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,120
It's an invertebrate.

1443
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,020
Boy, that sounds really intolerant of them.

1444
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,120
I said they smell like fish.

1445
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,860
It's a mollusk.

1446
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,660
No.

1447
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,940
I dig my own grave.

1448
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,720
It's a cephalopod or whatever.

1449
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,760
Yes, a cephalopod.

1450
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,600
Encephalitis pod.

1451
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,280
It's an encephalopod.

1452
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,440
But then it's a...

1453
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,120
Yeah, it's both.

1454
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:17,880
But you know...

1455
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,700
It's a mollusk and it's a cephalopod.

1456
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,940
It's too late for me to be up.

1457
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,100
If you get in a really, really, really bad pickle for some squid...

1458
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,340
A really, really bad pickle.

1459
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,620
I've had a few of those.

1460
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,680
Cuddlefish will do.

1461
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,260
No, no, no.

1462
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,220
If you get in a bad pickle for some squid sex,

1463
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,380
an octopus will do.

1464
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:36,920
Right, yeah.

1465
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:37,440
Sure.

1466
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,140
If you can't find a prairie squid and you can't...

1467
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,520
Or you found a prairie squid and you're stupid

1468
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,960
and didn't get your debeaking tool when you picked it up,

1469
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,080
an octopus will do.

1470
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,240
Dummy.

1471
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:46,420
Dummy.

1472
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:46,660
That was advice.

1473
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,780
Well, now, I thought I was coupling with a prairie squid

1474
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,900
in the 1996...

1475
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,640
Oh, that was a real...

1476
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,200
No, no, that was a Mississippi Delta squid.

1477
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,260
I found out later I'd been raped.

1478
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,360
Well, well...

1479
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,920
That was like I didn't know I'd been raped

1480
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,020
until the check bounced.

1481
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,180
It was a lot like that.

1482
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,480
Hey, be glad it wasn't an Amazonian tree...

1483
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,600
Well, arboreal squid.

1484
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,500
Candiru squid.

1485
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,800
Yeah, they're really bad.

1486
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,100
Someone told me that the cuddle bones,

1487
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,400
the little parakeets,

1488
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,740
like so much, actually comes from the cuddle fish.

1489
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,340
Yes, yes, they do.

1490
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,740
That you don't want to cuddle with either of them.

1491
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,640
But if you want to know how to get squid,

1492
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,960
there's only one address you need to know to write to

1493
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,080
for free information

1494
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:36,400
about where to get these fabulous, squishy sex partners.

1495
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,580
And got that squid ink ready, friends?

1496
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,120
Yes.

1497
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,460
That's right to Bob.

1498
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,340
That's right, Bob.

1499
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,840
That post office box.

1500
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,820
1-8-1-4-1-7

1501
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,100
Cleveland Heights, Ohio

1502
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,040
44-1-1-8

1503
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,160
Wow, I'm impressed.

1504
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,160
I have trouble doing that sometimes.

1505
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,900
I do it so much, it's imprinted.

1506
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,700
And every time you change that P.O. box,

1507
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,660
I'm going to rip out more chunks of my brain.

1508
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,620
But if you're not handwriting friendly,

1509
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,180
you can always visit the website.

1510
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,860
Yes, that's right.

1511
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,560
Which is?

1512
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,080
Subgenius.com and Subgenius doesn't have an O in it.

1513
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,180
But dot does and com does.

1514
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,320
But you don't have to write out the dot part.

1515
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,080
Yes.

1516
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,020
I just thought I'd confuse him real good there.

1517
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:34,000
For a while, we owned the domain subgenius.com

1518
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,380
because it would forward,

1519
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,320
bump them on over to the correct one

1520
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,840
because so many people,

1521
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,000
they didn't want to leave the O out and look ignorant.

1522
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:45,740
Well, I...

1523
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,920
They're not geniuses.

1524
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,140
By definition.

1525
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,280
Well, yeah.

1526
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,960
We know that.

1527
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,840
Everyone down to amoeba.

1528
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,240
Well, this has been a wonderful show.

1529
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,520
It hasn't been Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

1530
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,540
It hasn't been the hour of slack.

1531
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,460
Yeah.

1532
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,700
It's been both, yet neither.

1533
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,640
It's been no slack at all.

1534
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,000
It's been neither fish nor fowl,

1535
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,640
but it smells.

1536
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,320
It smells like fish,

1537
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,560
and it's been very foul.

1538
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,620
And the rash.

1539
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,820
I'd like to thank Reverend Ivan Stang

1540
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,100
for being our special guest tonight.

1541
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,900
St. Byron Werner for mixing the sounds.

1542
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:34,520
Priestess Pisces for providing what she does the best.

1543
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,600
And yes, even Fat Joe himself showed up to help out tonight.

1544
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,440
Who are you?

1545
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,000
I'm Reverend Susie the Floozy

1546
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,620
of the Church of the Seaside.

1547
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,200
Subgenius and of WREK Atlanta.

1548
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,600
Good night, Seekers.

1549
00:58:54,680 --> 00:59:02,360
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

1550
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,360
Oh.

1551
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,780
And that, kiddies, is our fairy story for tonight.
