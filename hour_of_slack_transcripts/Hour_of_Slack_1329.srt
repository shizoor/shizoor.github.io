00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,660
You have no choice. You must obey. Obey. Obey. Obey the mechanical voice. Do not step off the assembly line. Do not step off the production line. Do not slow down. Obey. Obey. Obey.

2
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,100
Obey the mechanical voice.

3
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Summit Genius Power Balls Black

4
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm Shlack.

5
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,480
The National Guard is airlifting washed-out anti-government activists in Canada,

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,000
visiting rebel leaders in New Jersey blamed for more than billions of deaths and nearly a dozen child sexual assaults.

7
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:10,000
A 13-year-old boy is also vowing that its armed rebels will be merged into water in Washington.

8
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,340
Far out a major hit.

9
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,020
Dear Ben Laden, please take me now.

10
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:27,660
But you can never have what's inside my perverted, sick, demented head!

11
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:54,940
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,580
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,060
I'm sorry.

14
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,800
I'm sorry.

15
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,020
I'm sorry.

16
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,700
I'm sorry.

17
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,500
I can't

18
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,680
repeats until he fails

19
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,140
half a moon and half a god

20
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,340
a man's not made of steel

21
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,820
twist away

22
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,440
now twist and shout

23
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,200
the earth there moves too slow

24
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,760
but the earth is all we know

25
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,240
we pay to play the human way

26
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,500
twist away the gates of steel

27
00:05:52,780 --> 00:06:17,000
twist away the gates of steel

28
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:47,000
twist away the gates of steel

29
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,900
Man is Real

30
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,980
A man is real

31
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,100
That's how I feel

32
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,800
Ah, the commercial break.

33
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,040
You know, commercials are now woven into the tapestry of our lives,

34
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,000
answering the questions we first pose to ourselves.

35
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,640
Who am I? What do I believe? What is my worth?

36
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,120
Before commercials, these questions were merely rhetorical and thus unanswerable.

37
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,580
But when viewed through the magnifying lens of commercials,

38
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,500
these questions, like all others, yield answers.

39
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,840
Imagine, no more wondering about identity, self, or beauty.

40
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,140
If you allow your life to reflect images in commercials,

41
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,460
the nagging doubts and feelings of inadequacy will fall away,

42
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,260
leaving the person you've always dreamed of

43
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:04,620
confident, assured, bold, or beautiful, sexy, loved.

44
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,640
Yes, America, you love your commercials, and why shouldn't you?

45
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,540
Commercials are themselves lovers.

46
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,680
Gentle are their words. Tender their caress.

47
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,300
Commercials know what you like, and they want to give it to you.

48
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,000
Attuned only to your wants and needs, commercials stir the passions and arouse desire.

49
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,080
Commercials give and give, reaching lovingly deep inside of you,

50
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,620
creeping tentatively at first and then relenting into a singly-focused writhing,

51
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,840
searching out the source of your ache, pushing fiercely into your loneliness

52
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,640
and into a spot you never knew existed.

53
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,880
Commercials fill you up with hopes and dreams, with new desires and new possibilities,

54
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,660
delivering you into an eerily delirious ecstasy.

55
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,240
Afterward, you'll sleep as only someone who's been completely satisfied can,

56
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,860
only vaguely sensing the arm of commercials draped over your body,

57
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,500
holding you, keeping you safe and secure.

58
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,820
And you'll dream of ballroom dancing, of game-winning home runs, of first kisses,

59
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,460
and of commercials.

60
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,760
And the eternity, at last, is this.

ุ

88
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,500
thattrail

89
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,400
by Lee Carlton.

90
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,500
Gates of Steel, the Devo classic,

91
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,500
was done by House of Sectionals.

92
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,380
And the Lymphnode Institute

93
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,900
from Bob's Slack Funhouse on WREK Atlanta

94
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,040
did that commercials bit that was so great.

95
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,460
But now the new Rudy Schwartz Project album.

96
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,980
Look at these taters.

97
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,700
Look at these taters, Mr.

98
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,280
Look at these taters.

99
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,960
I think they just got on the ground.

100
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,480
Harper Brown, he parked his plow,

101
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,180
came running out from the barn.

102
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,100
First in patient desperation,

103
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,180
present in patient desperation.

104
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,160
And he ran the screen door,

105
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,520
slammed saliva dripping from his mouth.

106
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,580
Coming, flaring, nostrils flaring,

107
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,600
dimples booming, britches dropping.

108
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,440
Mrs. Brown, she knew the score.

109
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,360
Seen it several times before.

110
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,480
Threw her apron on the floor

111
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,500
and shot right out that kitchen door.

112
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,860
Taters are going to sprout.

113
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,020
Taters are going to sprout.

114
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,060
Taters are going to sprout.

115
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,020
Taters are going to sprout.

116
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,340
Got these daughter taters in a barn that's not too far.

117
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,500
Taters are going to sprout.

118
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:08,500


119
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,000
You're a good amount of use.

120
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,120
Well that's more like it

121
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,900
than you put her out of herぼ Telomere.

122
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,360
Taters are going to sprout.

123
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,660
Swoosh, swish.

124
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,520
Wanna see the ghost?

125
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,300
Taters are going to sprout!

126
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,820
Twivities, twos, thumbs up!

127
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:33,820


128
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,540
roadmap nose,

129
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,700
millimeter?

130
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,180
Taters want to get estavausha.

131
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:36,180


132
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:36,360
Turn on your earphones.

133
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,360


134
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,360


135
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,960
And look at all these taters!

136
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,240
Happy Halloween!

137
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,240


138
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,480
Well, good thing someone's gone.

139
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,980
Oh!

140
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,960
Moisture can promote conversion

141
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,080
Starch and sugar

142
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,980
Starch and sugar

143
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,860
Starch and sugar

144
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,020
Starch and sugar

145
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,860
Starch and sugar

146
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,980
Starch and sugar

147
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,240
Starch and sugar

148
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,520
Which will easily

149
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,960
Disroutes

150
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,540
Darkish grey crevices

151
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,640
And not holes form on soft

152
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,580
Gossamer coated rocks of

153
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,500
Yukon gold

154
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,560
From these crevices tiny growths

155
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,320
Appear permeated with

156
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,140
Toxicity

157
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,040
But case in point

158
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,460
Aunt Mavis went down to the cellar to fetch some

159
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,500
And bumped her head on cedar

160
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,020
Planking

161
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,320
God damn you grandpa

162
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,080
When you gonna fix these blasted stairs

163
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,180
Woman could crack a bone

164
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,640
Fetch it comestibles

165
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,480
Groping for pickles and confiture

166
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,120
Mavis was surprised

167
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,000
To find the polenta in cold storage

168
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,700
Hell

169
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,720
It'd been years since they'd switched to cornmeal

170
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,880
And she wasn't getting any younger

171
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,200
Only then

172
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,660
Did she stumble across the tater sack

173
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,460
And the milky tentacles

174
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,660
Poking from within

175
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,520
Told her

176
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,200
These taters had

177
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,800
Done gone to sprout

178
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,960
1, 2, 3, 4

179
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,460
To keep the

180
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,480
сам

181
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,000
To get out of here

182
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,400
1, 2, 3, 4

183
00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Clicks 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5

184
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,780
Thank you.

185
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,220
Thank you.

186
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,020
Dale ain't seen his birth certificate.

187
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,600
Hey, look.

188
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,420
Opie's all grown up.

189
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,040
Ah, yes, dear

190
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,980
friends, and we're back with

191
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,760
the subgenius radio ministry

192
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,060
hour of slack, hopefully

193
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,720
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

194
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

195
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,680
This is Charles Weatherby at the downtown

196
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,340
Mugbitt waiting the

197
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,100
execution of the new commandant

198
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,880
to the Reverend

199
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,240
Ivan Spinks.

200
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,920
And, uh, Princess,

201
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,820
we are the queen of all

202
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,300
the UFOs.

203
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,240
She's with us tonight.

204
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,960
And, uh, with the theme

205
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,040
music of slam-bang theater

206
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,580
in the background to get me...

207
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,260
Hey, Icky.

208
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,920
Quiet, I can't hear an audience.

209
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,580
Quiet, I can't hear myself think.

210
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,480
Quiet, I can't hear myself think.

211
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,800
Now what the hell are you talking about?

212
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,700
Quiet!

213
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,300
Is that Icky Twerp?

214
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,520
That was the voice of

215
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,080
Icky Twerp, the

216
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,580
late Icky Twerp. He was, uh,

217
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,040
the children's show host that I

218
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
listened, watched every day

219
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,120
after school. He played the Three Stooges

220
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,020
and Popeye and Warner

221
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,120
Brothers cartoons, and that's why we're

222
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,180
subgeniuses.

223
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,100
It's heartwarming to hear his voice in the background,

224
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,980
especially under this music

225
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,920
or, you know, right now above

226
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,440
this music, wherever he's hovering.

227
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,640
It's like so many of those, um,

228
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,080
stars of the past of the late

229
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,820
night or late afternoon

230
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,880
shows. They're still with us.

231
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,620
They're geared towards kids. They're still with us.

232
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,320
They won't freaking leave.

233
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,980
They won't, they're not dead. They're hanging

234
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,020
around in your front yard looking for beer.

235
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,160
Or money to buy it.

236
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,920
This music in the background

237
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,840
is Little Jack Melody

238
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,520
and his Young Turks.

239
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,800
Little Jack Melody sounds

240
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,420
obscene. No, it doesn't.

241
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,940
Well, it'd be like if you were singing

242
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,960
to yourself when you were compulating with an orange

243
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,080
or something. You have a dirty, dirty

244
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,520
filthy, filthy

245
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,020
mind, London Cowboy.

246
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,440
Twisted and misted.

247
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,840
I thank you so very much for the compliment.

248
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,300
Twisted.

249
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,480
My body, uh,

250
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,760
well, my body is as dirty as my mind.

251
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,380
Yes, please don't mention your body.

252
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,060
I ate just a little while ago.

253
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,020
Well, I'm close to a mirror

254
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,840
and I also ate, so I'll have to watch

255
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,240
my step. Oh, no.

256
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,500
Man, the other day

257
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,920
I, uh,

258
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,880
was in line at the post office

259
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,580
and I opened up,

260
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,080
uh,

261
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,280
I got my mail out of the

262
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,340
sacred P.O. box

263
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,260
and I opened up a little envelope and inside

264
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,680
was something that made...

265
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,320
The guy behind me, it's, he's lucky

266
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,420
he didn't have to clean his shoes off.

267
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,000
I was so surprised

268
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,460
and I did a backflip and I can't

269
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,780
even tell the

270
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,200
audience, the audience of a

271
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,340
broadcast radio station what it

272
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,620
was.

273
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,300
Well, you certainly didn't explain what it was

274
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,000
in any way.

275
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,320
It was something I

276
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,180
opened up.

277
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,020
At the mailbox.

278
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:02,760
That's...

279
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,100
And it smelled like the excrement on shoes.

280
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,580
No, it caused me to almost

281
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,520
excremeditate right there in line

282
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,180
on the guy behind me.

283
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,760
Ha.

284
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,100
Uh, it would have,

285
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,380
because it would have run down the...

286
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,540
Look, we're not supposed to talk that way,

287
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,100
uh, here.

288
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,440
In fact, one thing I wanted to, uh,

289
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,360
to mention to our radio broadcast listeners,

290
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,320
as opposed to our internet listeners,

291
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,420
is every now and then, a couple of times a year,

292
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,660
stuff gathers up that's so...

293
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,740
It just wouldn't work if you cut the, the, the, uh,

294
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,940
curse words.

295
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,100
The profanity.

296
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:38,740
Yes.

297
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,140
It even makes it better sometimes.

298
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
Many times.

299
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,240
Uh, so, um, anyway, we took advantage of one of those shows,

300
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,800
a couple of shows back, to explain a situation

301
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,480
that the church was in.

302
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,500
Uh, it was, uh, one of our X-rated internet shows,

303
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,540
and at the very end of it, there was a, a, a, a rant

304
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,860
that I can't do on these, these stations that we're on

305
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,440
are college and, uh, independent, uh, you know,

306
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,500
community stations.

307
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,160
They're all non-commercial stations.

308
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:15,120
That means I can't raise money for anybody but the station.

309
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,900
But I took advantage of a, of an internet-only show

310
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,800
to try to, uh, do what I can't do here.

311
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,120
And, and, uh, it, it was almost our last show.

312
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,400
Honest to God, that's how bad things were.

313
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,500
Well, it's been that week for the last 22 years,

314
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,380
but, you know, I know what you mean.

315
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,400
Well, that's true.

316
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,440
I mean, at any moment, X-Day could come.

317
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,960
That was the, the whole lesson of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

318
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,060
Indeed.

319
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,800
Uh, and the, the, uh, X-Day drills over and over again,

320
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,340
I think.

321
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,120
Uh, is that, we don't know.

322
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,860
It could happen tomorrow.

323
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,340
But if it had happened that week, I would have,

324
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,460
I would have died in poverty.

325
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,760
And, uh, listen to these people.

326
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,400
They're just laughing.

327
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,100
They think it's funny that we were...

328
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,200
They're laughing about probability

329
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,020
and the different variables you've introduced.

330
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,140
Oh, yeah, they think it's real, real funny.

331
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,900
Oh, ha, ha, ha.

332
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,280
Well, that's the way they are.

333
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,560
If only Reverend Stang was off the air,

334
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,680
then it would really be funny.

335
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

336
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,900
These are people who are incontinent

337
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,780
and whose foreheads sweat when they're in cool weather.

338
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,440
These are the kind of people that you want to avoid at all.

339
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,520
At all costs, because they're trying to get something from you.

340
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,520
They're, they're, they're like, um, you know, little bugs

341
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,900
that are crawling up and down your neck, taking a little chew,

342
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,560
and by the time you slap the bug, they've moved on to another place.

343
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,940
I don't mean to say they're inconsequential as human beings,

344
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,420
other than the fact that their foreheads are low,

345
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,080
and their eyes are very, very small,

346
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,120
and their ears protrude, but there's nothing inside them, between them.

347
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,660
Actually, Dave, the people giggling in the background are German midgets.

348
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,340
Well, that explains it.

349
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,840
It was a recording of German midgets by Lee Carlton,

350
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,520
and, uh, who's doing, like, a, uh, scholarly paper about the Church of the Sub-Genghis.

351
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,540
Well, I don't blame him for listening to that.

352
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,180
I understand why Martin Luther went haywire.

353
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,020
I understand even the rise and fall of the Third Reich.

354
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,940
Tater Gumphreys, Reverend Tater Gumphreys wanted to do that, too.

355
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,960
Now, that Ritty Schwartz project song we just played,

356
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,700
it's called Tater's Gone, Tater's Done Gone to Sprout.

357
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,260
It's from his new CD, The Year They Switched to Cornmeal,

358
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,400
which, in fact, is the title of the music playing in the background.

359
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,280
This is the title track that's playing in the background,

360
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,780
The Year They Switched to Cornmeal.

361
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,220
On some future show, I'll play it without us sullying it with our vocals.

362
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,560
Now, is someone actually, this is an actual performance of a unique, uh, an original piece, isn't it?

363
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:49,980
Yes.

364
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,140
I would say that this is...

365
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,960
Ritty Schwartz project is exceedingly original.

366
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:01,300
I would say that this is very, very, very, very, um, almost structurally perfect.

367
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,860
I would say the design is eloquent.

368
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,180
Oh, don't listen to this guy.

369
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:11,280
No, but really, I mean, man, this is like, you know, classical piano concert without a headphone on your head.

370
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,280
Classical jazz.

371
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,340
You know, I, uh, unless I'm mistaken, he does this in the public library in Montreal.

372
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,480
There's a keyboard there?

373
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,640
They have a little sound lab at the public library.

374
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:34,000
He used to do albums in Texas long ago and, uh, got sick and tired of, of, like I did about one month ago,

375
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,420
got sick and tired of knocking himself out.

376
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,480
As he put it, quote, Joe Newman of Ritty Schwartz project,

377
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,880
Yeah, Stang, I know how you feel.

378
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,380
It's real easy for him to call you a genius, but try to get nine bucks out of him for a year's worth of work.

379
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,680
Now, I immediately tried to send him $27.

380
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,440
But he wouldn't take it.

381
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,620
He said that three quarters of the people that knew about his music all seemed to have gotten it from Hour of Slack.

382
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,440
And that's, that's one of the things I've wanted to say.

383
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,960
First off is thanks to the people who heard what I was saying on that show that you can't hear.

384
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:22,140
Uh, thanks to the stations that couldn't play the show you can't hear, which include WQFS at Guilford College,

385
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,660
WREK at Landmark.

386
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:23,660


387
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,720
Uh, that Guilford is in Greensboro, North Carolina.

388
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,800
WORT, Madison.

389
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,360
WMPG, Portland, Maine.

390
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,160
WHUS, Storrs, Connecticut.

391
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:39,140
And beloved WEFT in Champaign, Illinois.

392
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,740
Also on this list are, oh, and Ellen, Rob Zarca of, uh, I think it's WCNI.

393
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,880
That's a news station that's carrying him.

394
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,860
Your name is on the same list, Dave.

395
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,540
I hope it's not the list.

396
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,960
It's headed for, uh, you know.

397
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,580
It's the list.

398
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,200
Yeah, it is.

399
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,980
It's the, it's the, uh, it's the death squad list.

400
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,180
It's everybody Obama is going to send to the, the death, what is it?

401
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,000
I can't even remember.

402
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,880
No, wouldn't this be the perfect time for me to thank those friends of mine that responded to my outcry?

403
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,280
They helped also.

404
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,500
All three of them.

405
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,440
All three of them.

406
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:19,880
Yeah.

407
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,700
It's not that she only has three friends.

408
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,360
It only, they were only three friends at the hour of Slack meant anything to you.

409
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,520
Despite outcry from around, uh, from, from across the land, actually.

410
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:47,440
It's, it's great that we got a lot of letters from people offering support because they could hear in this, uh, internet only rant that I was, I didn't, I didn't, I did it at my most upbeat, but it was written when I was down and they could tell.

411
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,700
And, uh, and we got, and I have some, oh, you'll like this letter from Emily.

412
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,800
Emily in North Yorkshire who said, please believe me.

413
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,540
What you do is worthwhile.

414
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:11,280
Your voice has found me in some of the darkest places that a soul can visit through heartbreak and terror and has helped me hold onto the feeling that my life is worth living.

415
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,420
I could tell you some sad stories, but I think you're in need of a happy one.

416
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,560
I love you.

417
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,320
Princess.

418
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,420
We, and all of your crew.

419
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,400
Cowboy Dave's voice.

420
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,240
Melts me by the way.

421
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,800
And I hate the thought that you can't take some kind of satisfaction from the wonder you have spread while I'm doing that right now.

422
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,420
Uh, it's called a J O.

423
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,880
Anyway, I'm sure our paths will cross eventually.

424
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,580
I hope you get all the slack you need.

425
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,200
I remembered when Robert Anton Wilson was on his death bed.

426
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:48,340
I went out with fly Agaric 23 and we busked until we had some money to send to help him out.

427
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,440
And it scared me a little.

428
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,380
I'm not going to lie.

429
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:56,400
I'm going to wait until you're at the checkout before I show you my respect and appreciation.

430
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,180
Keep up the good work.

431
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,420
Perpetual wonder.

432
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,820
And that's Emily in Yorkshire, Dave.

433
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,960
Well, that's beautiful.

434
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,160
And you made her melt.

435
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,620
You melt her.

436
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,480
You melt her.

437
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,820
What does melting by the way mean?

438
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,680
Does that mean near the overpass or in the roundabout or underneath the ceiling?

439
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,400
It's more like what happened to Leo G. Carroll in that movie Tarantula.

440
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,700
But I'm probably talking over the heads of, or under the heads of most of our crew.

441
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,600
I remember when his mustache got really big and his eyes started twirling one time.

442
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,220
I mean Leo G. Carroll.

443
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,860
Now that was, you're thinking of a Man From U.N.C.L.E. episode.

444
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,700
But that was also before any of our listeners were born.

445
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:35,860
Any?

446
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,960
Well, not any.

447
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,260
Not any.

448
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,920
Including, yes, even Reverend Any.

449
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,860
I'm sure it was long before Reverend Any was born.

450
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,820
That's hard to believe.

451
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,580
I don't know.

452
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,760
Have you seen Reverend Any?

453
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,380
She looks like she's about 25.

454
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,320
Well, that's the good part.

455
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,620
And I've known, we've known her for what, like 15 years or something?

456
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,180
She still looks that way.

457
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:57,580
Yeah.

458
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,440
She looks younger every year just like Princess Wee.

459
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,120
Who now looks about, and sounds about five.

460
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,760
Everyone will agree.

461
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,740
What up?

462
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,260
What up, mouth?

463
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,160
What up, mouth?

464
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:11,000
People drive by us and honk and I think what the honk means is.

465
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,340
You're dead.

466
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,540
You should not be touching your granddaughter that way, old man.

467
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh, I don't even.

468
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,740
There's something like, you know, you want to.

469
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:18,900
You don't think so.

470
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,940
It appears like you'd already expired to them or something.

471
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,580
No, I can, here's a funny letter.

472
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:31,140
I've been a listener since my days back in Dallas over, I should do this in pig man voice.

473
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,200
I've been a listener since my days back in Dallas and 20 years ago.

474
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,120
I do feel like a douche bag for not getting ordained.

475
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,460
But better late than never.

476
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,180
I even tried to go to a few devivals in Texas but I never could find them.

477
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:53,480
I remember one Sunday driving all around south of downtown Dallas, just on the other

478
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,160
side of I-30, all over an abandoned warehouse district looking for the party but I probably

479
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,300
was far too mentally altered to actually be in the right place.

480
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,280
Looking back, you were probably in Deep Ellum.

481
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,100
And we were.

482
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,420
It was at Club No or Twilight Room.

483
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,500
The only places in Dallas that would have us.

484
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,160
Thanks for all the years of letting me know that no matter how mentally warped I am, I'm

485
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,780
not the type of person to be.

486
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:23,060
There are others who ain't nothing like me but they are nonetheless pretty bat boop crazy

487
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,800
weird.

488
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,260
Without our slack, I would have had to find all this out by some other method.

489
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,420
Oh geez, oh man.

490
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,620
Dr. Neal.

491
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,120
Dr. Neal.

492
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,200
It's amazing how many people call up and, or not call up but who actually email this

493
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:47,020
enthusiasm to, and that you can actually accelerate it by just the stupid things you're saying.

494
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,140
Yeah.

495
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,180
You're right.

496
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,540
I'm trying to figure out what I'm saying right now.

497
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:55,040
We also have, besides the sappy and funny letters, we also have some limericks,

498
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,480
Dave.

499
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,220
Oh.

500
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,140
Reverend Hazel.

501
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,280
There once was a man named Stang.

502
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,880
Yes, there is one like that.

503
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,480
You want to hear it?

504
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,720
He was long and he was lame.

505
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,260
His feet were asunder and that's why he's a cucumber.

506
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,920
Invented these.

507
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,440
Never mind.

508
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,420
And spoke of his gigantic blank.

509
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,160
Slank.

510
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,160


511
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:14,920
Blank, yeah.

512
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,140
No, actually these are all by the way.

513
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,140


514
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,140


515
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,140


516
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,140


517
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,140


518
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,140


519
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,640
These are all by Reverend Hazel of the windmills and I think they're all clean enough for the

520
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:21,940
radio.

521
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,480
Here's the Ivan Stang one.

522
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:30,240
Ivan's, I'm going to turn the music back to this because it, oh, right now.

523
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,680
Yeah, you want it to sound more medieval, you know, if you're reading a limerick.

524
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,760
Well, you can't do a limerick when there's another rhythm going on in the background.

525
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,640
Even though the limericks are not formed quite easy, so much so that most find it cheesy.

526
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,480
But when Bob is your guide, your brain's stem opens wide and spews verses.

527
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,700
Verses both lofty and sleazy.

528
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,320
But anyway, here's her Ivan Stang one.

529
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:58,100
Ivan Stang, the young talented hack, said repent, quit your jobs and get slack.

530
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:05,800
He sold people opinions to get rich off his minions, but got only stress and a bad back.

531
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,260
Isn't that sweet?

532
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,500
Actually, I don't have a bad back.

533
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,040
Sounds like nepotism to me.

534
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,120
Here's a good, here's two variations on a Bob one.

535
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,160
No, it's not nepotism.

536
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,400
She's related to you.

537
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:19,880
Come on, admit it.

538
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,820
Well, for all I know, she might be.

539
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,640
I don't know who any of these people really are.

540
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:24,660
Oh, yeah, right.

541
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,420
Leaky, leaky.

542
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,540
I don't know if her name is really Hazel.

543
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,740
I don't, you know, I'm not on Facebook all the time.

544
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,700
It could be your mitochondrial mother.

545
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,340
I don't know what their real names are.

546
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,140
I don't want to know.

547
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,460
You can tell the CIA I don't know his name.

548
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,620
I don't know who did it.

549
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,560
And they don't want to.

550
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,640
You have to remind them.

551
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,940
She has a very French last name, you know.

552
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,700
No way, no way.

553
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,060
They're gone.

554
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,460
Now, let's talk about the other one.

555
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:46,900
Let's talk about Bob.

556
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,020
Let's get back to Bob.

557
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:54,560
There is a smug salesman from Dallas who's known for his prolific phallus.

558
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:02,500
But when Connie comes through to her, he stays true in fear of her feminine malice.

559
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,240
Ah.

560
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,800
But there's a variation on it.

561
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,360
There is a smug salesman from Dallas who's known for his prolific phallus.

562
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:16,220
He's fathered a race of sub-mutants from space armed with bulldodders,

563
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
slack-frop, and malice.

564
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:28,000
And I might as well do the last one, next to the last one, before I put the music back

565
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,240
on.

566
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,940
There once was a town filled with pinks, and Tater declared,

567
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,280
This burg stinks!

568
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,340
So he got off the bench and started a clench.

569
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,560
Now he pays to know what he thinks.

570
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:46,460
There's another Tater one on here that's, that's, uh, Hazel Starks.

571
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,720
She says she only wrote the last line of this one.

572
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,640
The first four were provided by Tater, Reverend Tater Gunfrey.

573
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,040
Oh.

574
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:58,580
When Tater goes hunting for squirrels, don't care if they's boys or they's girls,

575
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,560
cause they go in a pot with whatever you got.

576
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,760
Then everyone eats till they hurls.

577
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,080
Isn't that cute?

578
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,980
That was cute.

579
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,760
That's what the Vabatorium is for.

580
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:10,980
Yes.

581
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,620
There's an ad in...

582
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,480
29 Lashes.

583
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,000
She did a poem at X Day, which we played on the show.

584
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:22,560
And it also included some more Tater poems, but we can, we can move on.

585
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,940
What else did I have here?

586
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,860
I want to read some more of those letters, but we oughta...

587
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,040
Have you heard of this new Occupy thing?

588
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,300
Oh, of course.

589
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,520
I've been occupied for at least three weeks now.

590
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,760
Oh, is that why the bathroom was, said that on it?

591
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,480
Yeah.

592
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,640
I've been trying to get in there for this whole...

593
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,740
Because of all the thousands and thousands of protestors outside demanding for their share.

594
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,420
This bathroom occupied.

595
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,340
Princess, will you have another obscure antique word for the Occupy movement?

596
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,500
In my day, they used to call it a sit-in.

597
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:04,400
And I was telling her that, you know, if they called it a love-in, they might get even more business.

598
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:12,100
And, you know, cause that would bring up the open copulating and city parks and stuff at the love-in.

599
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,720
Except that nowadays, you'd have gay cops.

600
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:14,960
Yeah.

601
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,760
And couples doing it, too.

602
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,080
And some stick in the mud would get upset, and you'd have a big fight at the love-in.

603
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,720
Yeah.

604
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:21,960
Yeah.

605
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,940
That's what would happen today.

606
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,880
That kind of defeats the purpose.

607
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,160
I like the way the media is doing it.

608
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,340
The certain aspects of the media are doing it right now.

609
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,980
They seem to interview all people with green hair and like huge, like nose rings and stuff

610
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,520
like that.

611
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,620
None of the old ladies.

612
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,060
And like one ear that sticks, you know, is about the size of a football and stuff like

613
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,340
that.

614
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:41,780
Right.

615
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,540
And they'll walk right by people.

616
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,700
You know, like, oh, look.

617
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Like a normal person of the middle class who's a little bit irritated of a slightly

618
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,100
younger or slightly older group, you know.

619
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,280
They'll just walk right by them and go to the people who look really, really weird.

620
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:08,020
Well, it's funny because I keep reading, you know, I don't do TV or radio as an audience

621
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,980
member, only as a show-off.

622
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,060
But I do read the comments.

623
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,840
I read the comments at the end of news articles.

624
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:23,580
And I've noticed that the, it's funny that the, for lack, let me use the polite term,

625
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:30,360
baggers, the people who work behind the counter at the grocery store and bag your groceries,

626
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,740
the baggers seem to be upset about this Occupy thing.

627
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,820
It's like it's stealing their thunder and they won't join it.

628
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:44,040
And even though they have spent the last 25 posts saying, obviously, I'm not going to

629
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,440
vote for you, I'm not going to vote for you, I'm not going to vote for you, I'm not going

630
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:44,440


631
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:44,440


632
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Well, where's them jobs, Obama, Obama?

633
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:56,280
Then when they comment on the, on the Occupy people, they go, they ought to be out getting,

634
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,440
looking for a job pounding the pavement like I do instead of protesting.

635
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,540
Yep.

636
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,280
And I guess like, what about the jobs, Obama?

637
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,420
And that's when I realized what the presidency really is.

638
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,480
It's a temp agency.

639
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,980
I had no idea.

640
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,760
That, that, that.

641
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,240
The White House and manpower were basically the same thing.

642
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,420
You know, like, it's, it's like no wonder people.

643
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:21,640
That's how they run the show.

644
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,000
They can write it off and write it back on again.

645
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,480
It just goes on endlessly and endlessly.

646
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,500
They can just keep on writing checks and say, we need to do this, and then they'll do that,

647
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,540
and then they'll say we don't need to do that, and then they'll still do that.

648
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,980
And they'll do what they like to create whatever they want to happen.

649
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,400
Well, um.

650
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,500
That's what I find very disappointing.

651
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,660
Depressing as shit.

652
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,440
Everything is very depressing and sad.

653
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,380
Everything.

654
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,500
Even what I'm about to say.

655
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:59,560
This guy on Scrub Genius Forum suggested, he said the Warner Brothers made a mint off

656
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:05,800
of those Guy Fawkes masks, you know, from V, that are worn by people in Anonymous when

657
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,540
they do protests.

658
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,940
We could make a million-some cheap crappy Bob masks to the Occupy people.

659
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,120
That's what I'm saying.

660
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,300
Which immediately struck, I went, yeah, let's make Bob horseshoes, too.

661
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:24,500
Wouldn't Bob be the ultimate icon of, you know, what big business is all about?

662
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,680
What a, uh, a tampoon or something?

663
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:25,920
Exactly.

664
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:31,540
Bob is probably one of those one-percenters ripping everybody off.

665
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,100
Exactly.

666
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,460
Only he's ripping off all the other one-percenters.

667
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:40,980
I also don't particularly want my trademark associated with what the government is probably

668
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,100
going to decide is a terrorist.

669
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:49,160
A terrorist group, even though it is just plain regular folks who got tired of it.

670
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,280
Grassroots.

671
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:56,540
By the way, the music in the background is Boron Nuzzle live at X Day.

672
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,420
An unusual man he was, too.

673
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,480
Boron Nuzzle.

674
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,380
Men with four eyes.

675
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,880
Literally four eyes.

676
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,100
Anyway, this Occupy.

677
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,820
On top of each other.

678
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,800
This Occupy thing, man, I think they're thinking too small.

679
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,360
Because there's like an Occupy Cleveland, right?

680
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,520
Princess Weaver's thinking about going to that because she doesn't have a job.

681
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,940
She's retired.

682
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,600
No, but I was helping a friend today and I couldn't.

683
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,740
How many people have showed up at Occupy Cleveland?

684
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,560
I was curious because I haven't been cognizant of my own.

685
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,280
Me neither.

686
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:27,800
I don't know.

687
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,660
But anyway, here's my idea.

688
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,460
Much bigger idea.

689
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,300
Much more all-encompassing.

690
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,660
Occupy space!

691
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,340
And all of us are occupying a little bit of space.

692
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,160
A little more space every year, I'm afraid.

693
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,600
I can't put it any more succinctly.

694
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,020
Occupy space!

695
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,760
You're already doing it.

696
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,220
Why not do it all the way, kids?

697
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,280
I wouldn't have too many words.

698
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,440
Occupy space!

699
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,700
So that's my agreement on that, too.

700
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,500
Oh, here's some more politics.

701
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,080
Reverend Skull the Tasteless said,

702
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:16,940
Now that old Milt's Mormonism is becoming an issue with the values voters,

703
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,900
That was the whole sentence.

704
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,940
Susie the Floozy said,

705
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,980
Susie the Floozy answered,

706
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,100
Wait, they're spelling moron with two Ms now?

707
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,520
She's a proofreader, so she was quick to catch up on that.

708
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,820
Now let's see.

709
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,900
And a proofreader sometimes when it's elegant.

710
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:37,980
A what?

711
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,640
And a proofreader, too, when it's necessary.

712
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,120
Isn't that what I said?

713
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,580
No, you said proofreader.

714
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:49,800
As in a so-called poor-eyed person who spends a lot of time near lamps.

715
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah.

716
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,780
What did you say?

717
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,560
Cheesy poofreader?

718
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,400
A cheesy poofreader?

719
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:56,760
Yeah.

720
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:03,040
We saw cheesy poofs in the store in the mall the other day.

721
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:03,600
Yes.

722
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,440
And did you comment on their behavior loudly like a teabagger would?

723
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,080
Or did you run to the parking lot and wave to the aliens?

724
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,980
I just did.

725
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,260
Like you always do.

726
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,260
I just did.

727
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,620
I just did comment it on the radio.

728
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,480
No, I meant the part about waving to the aliens.

729
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:19,800
I'm sorry.

730
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,140
I'm sorry.

731
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,800
I got you.

732
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,920
I didn't mean to talk about it.

733
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,380
OK.

734
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,500
Here's another letter.

735
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,840
Here's another letter titled, Touched by Bob.

736
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,200
That's the bad touch.

737
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:38,480
Reverend Stang, surreptitiously listening to Hour of Slack is all that sustained me through

738
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,120
the toils and tribulations of my last conspiracy job.

739
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:46,200
In all seriousness, it warms my heart in the darkest of times

740
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,780
to know that in strangeness and slack,

741
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,760
there is real truth about the human condition

742
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,400
and that there are brave souls willing to preach the unpreachable

743
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,140
not once or twice, but for over 30 years.

744
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,240
You, sir, have been doing fine and honest work

745
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,860
longer than I have been alive.

746
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,120
They all remind me how old I am.

747
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,320
It is really genuinely inspiring to think that I, too,

748
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,320
could someday dedicate my creative life so richly and thoroughly

749
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,260
to something I love.

750
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,460
And he says, the econo-cluster, beep,

751
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,200
has kept me jobless for a few months now,

752
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,740
but it's the least I can do for someone

753
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,260
who has brought me real and lasting slack for many years now.

754
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:30,940
Oh.

755
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,880
Wow.

756
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,700
Talk about fellatio.

757
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,960
I know.

758
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,940
That's what I'm doing right now to myself.

759
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,860
Now, okay, I did this rant.

760
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,880
I did this rant on the Internet.

761
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,920
You're the most wonderful person in the world.

762
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,780
As a person and as a magnet to millions,

763
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,540
I found reading, listening, and talking to your interesting introspections

764
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:58,400
about the fate of mankind one too many times,

765
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,600
and it saved me from jumping off that abutment over there

766
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,960
in my, off the periphery of my vision.

767
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,720
You're not supposed to say that on the radio.

768
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,000
I'm sorry.

769
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,780
You said abutment, man.

770
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,620
I just said it.

771
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,360
But, but, but, but, but.

772
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,120
It's all in the spelling, you know.

773
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,380
Anyway, these letters were prompted by a rant

774
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,640
that was only on the Internet,

775
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,780
on X-rated hour of slack number 1,300,

776
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,360
no, 1,327.5XXX,

777
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,800
available at subgenius.com if you wanted to hear it.

778
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,560
But somebody used it on YouTube.

779
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,320
This is new.

780
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,240
Princess Wee.

781
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,660
Dow Jones wrote in and said,

782
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,000
this is odd, I just ran across this video

783
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,040
by way of a comment on a Huffington Post news story.

784
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,720
It was put on YouTube with a Sarah Palin speech

785
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,540
as visual backdrop.

786
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,300
It was the audio from my rant,

787
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,840
and you have to put a picture with it,

788
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,000
so he had Sarah Palin giving a speech with my,

789
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,980
Oh, man.

790
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,520
rather serious thing.

791
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,860
And there was one friendly comment on it.

792
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,580
About 70 people had seen it.

793
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,360
He just put it up.

794
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,600
But there's one negative comment,

795
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,040
and I'm going to read this negative comment

796
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,180
the way it was written, okay?

797
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:24,760
Okay.

798
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,400
This was in response to a subgenius video.

799
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:35,240
So, ooh, a cult whatever is deadly broke penniless.

800
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,540
So, comma.

801
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:37,980
So, comma.

802
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:42,980
Ooh, just use you, cult, and your cults.

803
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,540
So, comma.

804
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:44,540


805
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,940
You actually used the apostrophe right.

806
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,860
Your cult's so-called subgenius to scam money from public,

807
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,120
capital P, public, for ooh and er cult.

808
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,740
Well, that's John Cue, what's the name of it?

809
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,460
Only one problem.

810
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,320
All genius are anti-cult.

811
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,660
He capitalized the first letter of each word

812
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,340
on that sentence.

813
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,960
No way in the world you, cult,

814
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,220
cult scumbag would have a chance

815
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:15,600
to even talking to any genius for ooh, letter R,

816
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,320
too disgusting.

817
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,500
And that was sent 13 hours ago by Kara C3X.

818
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,240
That's my daughter-in-law.

819
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,960
Anyway, it was so horribly written.

820
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,480
It was somebody telling us we'd never have a chance

821
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,240
to meet a genius, which, what do you think

822
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,800
is the whole point of the name?

823
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,880
So genius!

824
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:36,900
Anyway.

825
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,480
It was like, I couldn't make this stuff up.

826
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:44,120
It's too humanly real for any subgenius to invent.

827
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:49,400
And Dow said, the simple idiocy of the average human

828
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,080
denies the wildest imaginings of the creative spirit.

829
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,880
Dow Jones himself, Dow is spelled T-A-O, by the way,

830
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,480
is actually a really good writer himself.

831
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,500
He is really funny, great guy.

832
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:06,800
So.

833
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,180
I'm gonna say that.

834
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,340
Ooh, subgenius, dumb,

835
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,180
buh, ah, ah.

836
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:15,880
Urstupid.

837
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,380
Urstupid.

838
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,900
Urstupid, spelled with an E in stupid.

839
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:20,800
Ooh, and R, cult.

840
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,160
That was my very favorite comment

841
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,800
on our deliberately stupid Numa Numa takeoff.

842
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,120
Maybe you missed something.

843
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,860
Maybe he was saying, you be the.

844
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:31,780
This is stupid.

845
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:31,940
Stupid.

846
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,220
Maybe he was giving you, like,

847
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,020
he was insulting you in French or something.

848
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,940
And you didn't get it, because you're not a stupid.

849
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,160
Stupid enough, and he was right all along.

850
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,900
You never met a genius in your life,

851
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,760
and you never want to avoid one either.

852
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,140
Oh, I know some geniuses,

853
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,180
and they're the most unhappy people in the world.

854
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,200
I'm so glad I lost those brain cells.

855
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,160
I can help anyone.

856
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:58,220
I can help you get rid of those unwanted brain cells.

857
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:58,620
Yes.

858
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,320
That's what we do.

859
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,840
We can exorcise those demons.

860
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,680
That's the whole point of the Church of the Subgenius.

861
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,460
Well, it's not the whole point, but.

862
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,580
If you're thinking too much, you're probably causing too much friction

863
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:14,800
somewhere close to your corpus callosum, and it can make your brain catch on fire

864
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,120
spontaneously, like, you know, spontaneous combustion of human bodies.

865
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,280
That's probably where it starts.

866
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,560
For so many of those out there.

867
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,660
Probably.

868
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:23,920
Probably.

869
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:27,800
Dave, can you believe there's only, like, 10 minutes left in the show?

870
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,300
I can only, I'm having a hard time believing there's only 10 minutes left

871
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,520
on this planet's existence.

872
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,440
That's the one I'm having a hard time believing.

873
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:35,440


874
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:35,440


875
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,020
I'm having a hard time swallowing.

876
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:43,560
And just, you know, found out just before calling the show that indeed tonight is the

877
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:48,260
night where the hydrogen waxes poetic, so to speak.

878
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,080
Oh, the war, World War III starts tonight?

879
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,780
Well, it doesn't start as World War III.

880
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,560
It starts as a couple of idiots arguing.

881
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,360
At the love inn.

882
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,400
Yeah.

883
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,960
The Occupy love inn.

884
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,380
And that's the meaning of Occupy Space after.

885
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:05,420


886
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,220
There'll be plenty of space.

887
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:14,020
I have space that I have to talk about that could be occupied voluntarily.

888
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,880
There's an event coming up that nearby listeners may be interested in.

889
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:26,000
This happens next Saturday, October 15th, near Cleveland.

890
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,200
It's the Northeast Ohio Witches Ball.

891
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,400
Have you ever heard of the Witches Ball in Columbus?

892
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,420
Yes.

893
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,340
Are they making fun of me when they say that?

894
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,940
No, I'm getting paranoid.

895
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,040
Anyway, this is the...

896
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,980
I was invited to speak at this.

897
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,500
And at first I thought they were talking about the Columbus one.

898
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,920
So there was a lot of mix up back and forth.

899
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:58,080
But next Saturday, October 15th, you can find this on subgenius.com events page at the Clarion

900
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,440
Hudson.

901
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:03,080
It's a combination of the Northeast Ohio Witches Ball and Conn.

902
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:03,400
I'm sorry.

903
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:03,400


904
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:03,580
I can't remember.

905
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:03,580


906
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:03,580


907
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:03,580


908
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:03,580


909
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:03,580


910
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:03,580


911
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:03,580


912
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:10,460
I'm going to go to the one on the Cobb, which is like a big arts and crafts party mixed with

913
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:16,620
the gaming, video gaming and belly dancing, a magic show by Michael Murth.

914
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,860
We met him at Starwood.

915
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,460
Oh, yeah.

916
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,420
He's a good, nice guy.

917
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,080
He's a good old buddy.

918
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,960
He does a kind of magic, I believe.

919
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,860
People wearing stars and moons.

920
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:25,320
Yeah.

921
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,960
He does stage magic.

922
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,140
Well, but here's the other thing.

923
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,340
There's an art show and miniatures.

924
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,240
Now I happen to be into miniatures.

925
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
There's a miniature show.

926
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:38,400
They're showing some movies, including Rocky Horror Picture Show, I think.

927
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,760
And parties and debauchery.

928
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,560
That's our part.

929
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,700
That's what we're there for.

930
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,340
Adopt a Geek.

931
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:51,800
The Odd Mall Emporium of the Weird, which I'm not sure what that is.

932
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,720
Maybe that means us also.

933
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,000
Vendors.

934
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,320
Drum circle.

935
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,300
Yep, you were right.

936
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,960
And dancing and belly dancing.

937
00:49:59,140 --> 00:49:59,920
We mentioned that.

938
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:00,340
Yeah.

939
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,200
Oh, yeah.

940
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,440
Con on the cob.com.

941
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:05,340
Con.

942
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,920
Or neowitchesball.com.

943
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,080
That is N-E-O, witchesball.com.

944
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:18,080
It took me the longest time to catch on that neo meant northeast Ohio.

945
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,200
Yes.

946
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,740
We don't acknowledge the word neo.

947
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,320
Like if I was to call you a neo-Freudian.

948
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:24,980
Yeah.

949
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,900
Or a neo-fascist or something like that.

950
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,460
That would be more likely.

951
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,560
You would assume that you were a Freudian from northeastern Ohio around here.

952
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:33,600
Right.

953
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,220
And that's it.

954
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,360
Well, that was what kind of worried me.

955
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,140
Now, we had other—

956
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,100
We're any sane man of your stature.

957
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,760
God, I have all this stuff I—

958
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,380
Two inches.

959
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:46,800
I've got—here's stuff that I'm not going to play.

960
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,300
Ministry of Slack and Evolution Control Committee live together at—remember that night?

961
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,580
Saturday night at 14X Day?

962
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:54,980
Yeah.

963
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,960
They were jamming.

964
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:56,360
Yeah.

965
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,220
Well, we'll go out with that tune, okay?

966
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:05,360
After that, I had a little Jack Melody song with circus music called Lock Up Your Daughters.

967
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:12,100
Now, that's what the people at that convention should do in Hudson, Ohio.

968
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,420
Definitely.

969
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,460
Clarion Hudson in Hudson, Ohio.

970
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,640
But they should lock up their daughters.

971
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,240
Lock up their daughters.

972
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:19,760
Yeah.

973
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,220
And I had another Rudy Schwartz project.

974
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,980
One called Hoppy the Sheet Rock Boy.

975
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:24,980


976
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,260
Yeah.

977
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,420
And I had a little Jack Bunny, but we'll have to wait until next week for that.

978
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:27,840
Oh, man.

979
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,120
What a tease you are.

980
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:29,720
Hoppy the—yeah.

981
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,320
Yeah.

982
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,980
There's some good stuff here.

983
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:36,960
Oh, and the Ministry of Slack and Evolution Control Committee doing War Pigs.

984
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,000
Oh, man.

985
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,100
Oh, how various.

986
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:43,800
Very, very—this will be the—that was like the third version of War Pigs played at 14X

987
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,040
Day.

988
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,520
Yes.

989
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:49,160
There was—Fat Mandy did—sang like a torch version of it.

990
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,980
And salivated the whole time.

991
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:52,800
She was great.

992
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,960
I didn't mean to interject that, but it was—it was—it was—it was—it was—it was—it was—it

993
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,140
was—it was sad.

994
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,840
Well, to some.

995
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,940
It was happy to others.

996
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,880
Now, here's something sad and happy.

997
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:03,960
I've been—

998
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,000
The theremin.

999
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,840
I'm—oh, and this is somebody in England, again.

1000
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,140
I'm writing minutes after hearing the latest Hour of Slack.

1001
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:15,440
Well, not this one, but the, you know, two—two ago on the website.

1002
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:15,980
Uh-huh.

1003
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,240
And I have to say it touched a nerve.

1004
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:22,320
I only discovered the church this year via the Out There radio podcast, in case you

1005
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:22,640
wondered.

1006
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,940
And I've been listening to Hour of Slack, researching the church, and I've been reading

1007
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:24,940


1008
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:24,940


1009
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:24,940


1010
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:24,940


1011
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:24,940


1012
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:24,940


1013
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:29,360
the books, and basically trying to delve as much into the world of subgenius as possible

1014
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:35,020
ever since, not to mention becoming ordained as Reverend Ian Prolix.

1015
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,980
Uh, thanks, by the way.

1016
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,860
I married someone to a can of lager a few months back during a gig.

1017
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,260
Still going strong.

1018
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,340
Um, the one thing I don't do is follow the online discussions, blah, blah, blah.

1019
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,200
It sounds unbearably trite, but I do know how you feel to an extent.

1020
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,740
I have clinical depression.

1021
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,800
I've done it for—

1022
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,240
For about as long as I can remember, and while I won't bore you with the details, part of

1023
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,800
it's to do with money.

1024
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:07,780
I know how devastating it can feel to be in a position of having to deliver with no cash,

1025
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:12,380
and to make it happen, and furthermore, to present yourself to the public as not having

1026
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,000
these problems.

1027
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,400
On the contrary, you're expected to be an entertainer.

1028
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:22,000
What I haven't done is lay myself bare to everyone, telling exactly what I'm going through,

1029
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,360
and I really admire what you've done.

1030
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,080
That takes courage.

1031
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:24,760
Uh-huh.

1032
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,380
I mean, to see someone I respect who's brought me a lot of enjoyment and pause for thought

1033
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,940
over the past year do that, it genuinely brings a tear to my eye.

1034
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,660
It angers me to know that people you call friends can turn on you at your lowest ebb.

1035
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,040
That didn't actually happen.

1036
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,020
I was just paranoid.

1037
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,380
It's happening to me various times.

1038
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:46,000
It's happened to me countless times, but to see it happen to someone else shows that for

1039
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,240
the absolutely, beep, vile behavior it is.

1040
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,160
So you see, people do care.

1041
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,000
You did have one case of that, Derek.

1042
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,240
They do.

1043
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,740
They actually appreciate their stuff.

1044
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:54,780
They do.

1045
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,720
They love you.

1046
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,140
They love you.

1047
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,400
You've had one case where you felt like someone's kicked you.

1048
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,200
I don't care if they love me.

1049
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,060
I care whether they love Bob.

1050
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,520
Well, so you say.

1051
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,080
Anyway.

1052
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:04,500
No, I do.

1053
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,440
We do.

1054
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,040
You do.

1055
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,960
I truly do.

1056
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:13,100
I want them to understand what J.R. Bob Dobbs is all about, and it's not the-

1057
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,720
Well, it's not pretty.

1058
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,580
That's one thing.

1059
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,560
Bob, very few people can see his face.

1060
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,480
Stones did a song about that.

1061
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,460
Just want to see his-

1062
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:24,640
Oh, no.

1063
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,360
That was about Jesus.

1064
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:28,900
Anyway, it's like with Moses and God.

1065
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:39,120
If you look, seeing Bob's true face will like to kill you, but if at best you can see his

1066
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,520
buttocks as he's walking away from you.

1067
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:48,960
I think Dr. Howe pointed that out in her previous show that the WCSB people won't hear until

1068
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,600
next week.

1069
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:50,680
And-

1070
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,200
Dave, are you building a chair?

1071
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,080
Listen to these guys.

1072
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,520
This is Boron Nuzzle still.

1073
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,080
They're flabgastrious.

1074
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,300
Just arguing with myself.

1075
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,860
I had to have a private moment to argue with myself.

1076
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:13,700
Hello?

1077
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,460
Yeah.

1078
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,200
I'm sorry I was listening to these guys.

1079
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,240
I haven't heard this part.

1080
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,440
I hope there's some cussing in it.

1081
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,380
I like to keep change.

1082
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,180
That's what I like to do.

1083
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:23,180


1084
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:23,180


1085
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:23,180


1086
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:23,180


1087
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:23,180


1088
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:23,180


1089
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,760
They did this for 18 minutes.

1090
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,060
This was like a great three-note jam that went on for eight minutes.

1091
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,420
There's a lot more than three notes in this.

1092
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,280
Oh, it's not a swingin' love.

1093
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,180
I get mixed up with the swingin' love corpses song.

1094
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:35,200
No.

1095
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,960
These guys are mootling all over the place.

1096
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,200
We're nearing end of show.

1097
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,200
What am I supposed to say?

1098
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:47,700
Oh, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack number 1329.

1099
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,900
Long may she reign.

1100
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,260
Long may she reign.

1101
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,180
From the studios of WCSB, I'm Dave Newell.

1102
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,180


1103
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,180


1104
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,180


1105
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,180


1106
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,180


1107
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,180


1108
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,180


1109
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,180


1110
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,940
The other half of them pay up soon.

1111
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,060
That's a joke, huh?

1112
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:11,300
And you can learn more about the Church of the Subgenius, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Princess

1113
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:18,640
Wee, and all the links to all the bands that we play on subgenius.com.

1114
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:23,160
And if you push the radio button near the top of the page, that's the place to find

1115
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,160


1116
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,160


1117
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,160


1118
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,160


1119
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,340
part that's about Hour of Slack,

1120
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,940
but you'll notice there are a bunch of

1121
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,000
other parts. If you click on the

1122
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,200
contact part, you'll get

1123
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,860
a zillion web links to a zillion

1124
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,920
subgeniuses, subgenius bands,

1125
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,880
subgenius monster

1126
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,920
movie collectors, subgenius

1127
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,780
prostitutes,

1128
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,660
subgenius pets,

1129
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,380
and you name it.

1130
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,120
Fellow mutants here and there and everywhere.

1131
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,420
Yes.

1132
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,380
Well, I'm going to...

1133
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,960
Where the cheese is to rise from the earth.

1134
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,260
And give us sucre and balm.

1135
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,620
And also a tasty snack.

1136
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:58,680
Uh-huh.

1137
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,400
Mm-hmm.

1138
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,960
The Church of Blob,

1139
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,520
you might add.

1140
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,000
Not to be confused with the Church of Blob,

1141
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,400
except, and please,

1142
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,060
please don't accept any cheap

1143
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,500
Canadian imitations.

1144
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,160
Nothing against Canadia,

1145
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,640
but there is a really, really

1146
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,020
lousy Canadian imitation

1147
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:19,700
out there.

1148
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,880
Think about the dollar, too,

1149
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,320
because...

1150
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,000
Listen to that, man.

1151
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,160
American dollars, you might say.

1152
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,560
Borah Nuzzle finished the song

1153
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,640
just in time to finish the show.

1154
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,680
Perfect.

1155
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,120
What an improvement on nature that is.

1156
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,720
Yeah, Dave, I'm going to fade that out.

1157
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,840
I'm going to fade you out.

1158
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,020
I'm going to fade out,

1159
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,700
and I'm going to play this

1160
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,180
Ministry of Slack jamming

1161
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,480
Saturday night at 14X Day.

1162
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,920
But the light of dobs won't fade away.

1163
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,320
Never will.

1164
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:50,300
The pipe.

1165
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:50,760
Unfortunately.

1166
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,780
Keep the pipe lit, friends.

1167
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,920
And smoke it early.

1168
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:51,260
Keep the pipe lit.

1169
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,880
I'm tired of getting all of the guilt,

1170
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,360
but none of the sex.

1171
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,000
You're one of them.

1172
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,380
I'm tired of getting all of the guilt,

1173
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,840
but none of the sex.

1174
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,380
None of the sex.

1175
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,060
There is a simple answer,

1176
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:07,880
dear friend.

1177
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,900
A glowing beacon of slack

1178
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,660
amidst the turmoil and darkness.

1179
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,560
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1180
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,260
the living slack master

1181
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,720
in this church of the subgenius.

1182
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,960
Bob brings a new destiny

1183
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,800
for the abnormal.

1184
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:22,840
For Bob,

1185
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,020
it comes to justify our sins.

1186
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,840
To unmask the conspiracy

1187
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,380
and get us back

1188
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,400
the slack they stole away.

1189
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,760
It's us versus them.

1190
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,140
Are you gonna

1191
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:37,260
cry in hell on Earth?

1192
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,700
Inside the pink

1193
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,620
Inside the

1194
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,840
Cry in hell on Earth alone.

1195
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,060
Cry in hell on Earth alone.

1196
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,120
Inside the pink, boys.

1197
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,220
Inside the pink, boys.

1198
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,200
Boss versus them.

1199
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,660
Are you gonna cry in hell on Earth

1200
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,400
alongside the pink, boys?

1201
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:00,580
Inside the pink, boys?

1202
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,040


1203
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,040


1204
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,260
Sire, there is no more money.

1205
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,720
We gotta get some money.

1206
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,360
Black dirty purges,

1207
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,320
hark a backflag,

1208
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,900
We wantin' Phillip Hunter Burton,

1209
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,180
Perkaluma Burton,

1210
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,540
Durkin bustin' that wall.

1211
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:20,460
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1212
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,780
and we're even more glad that some of us

1213
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:26,800
have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1214
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:31,800
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1215
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:38,900
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1216
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:44,400
you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page,

1217
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:49,700
or the catalog store pages, and help out financially as best you can.

1218
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:54,080
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1219
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,720
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1220
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,700
But some of you still have jobs.

1221
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:07,580
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1222
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,980
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1223
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:18,780
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Stevejobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1224
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:19,160
Okay.

1225
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:24,240
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1226
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:36,700
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1227
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,940
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1228
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,240
We'll see you next time.

1229
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:19,720
Money!

1230
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,140
Box!

1231
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:20,900
Kill me!

1232
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:21,980
Money!

1233
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:22,960
Box!
