1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,520
From

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,500
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm being trained to fight in the East and Midwest.

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,520
Do you need water?

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,060
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights says she wants systematic torture in The Hague.

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,460
I believe that crimes against humanity.

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,020
Human Rights Watch today says it has conducted

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,500
torture and action.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,420
Harming civilians.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,920
PR is bad.

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,980
PR News is bad.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,840
Officials in southwestern China say they are suspending plans to open a PR News.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,660
This was the scene captured on video in China's Sichuan province.

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,960
Angry crowds faced off against PR News, who responded with a gaping wound to the face.

15
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,980
Chrysler says PR is bad.

16
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,440
This is PR News.

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,180
Angels flash through the heavenlies.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,000
You know.

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,040
Ezekiel saw a wheel.

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,980
But what a lot of us do not realize is that in chapter 1 of Ezekiel, verse 4,

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,460
the angels traveled in whirlwind fashion.

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Not like our jets straight ahead.

23
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,020
Whirlwind.

24
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:37,280
They moved from one end of heaven to the other like a flash of lightning, verse 14.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,960
And verse 15 says their color was burl.

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,240
Do you know what they put into?

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,000
Spaceships now that are heaved out there.

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,960
The only thing that can withstand the heat.

29
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,320
Other things would disintegrate.

30
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,580
Burl ilium.

31
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,180
I get real scared, Bob.

32
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,100
Because I've seen them.

33
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,440
I've seen them before.

34
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,080
But there's more of them now.

35
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,080
And because there's lots more.

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,640
They're floating in the air.

37
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,460
And they're living in the wood and the rocks and everything.

38
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:33,140
And they're always kind of laughing and feeling and laughing all the time.

39
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,680
Duncan Lunan of the British Interplanetary Society has interpreted the signals as a message

40
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,700
from a space probe.

41
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,720
A message from a dying planet in that.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,360
Well, the little green man's name was real headcats.

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,900
Rocking and a-rolling through the crazy flats.

44
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,760
Brought out a sax and it started to flow.

45
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,660
Brought out the drums and it started to roll.

46
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,480
Blind saucer, rock and roll.

47
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,280
Blind saucer, rock and roll.

48
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,860
I couldn't understand it.

49
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,680
A thing Ed said it was a crazy beat.

50
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,880
It just stopped me dead.

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,180
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack,

52
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,060
and a concert.

53
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,420
And a conspiracy of pinks, the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

54
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:23,780
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1998, when the television signal of Amos and

55
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,720
Andy reaches the men from Planet X, the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

56
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,000
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth.

57
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,100
They're going to...

58
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:42,040
They will put us out of our misery unless Bob can explain to them in ways that they can understand.

59
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,040


60
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,500
That there is something on Earth worth saving.

61
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:53,280
And only the subgenii, the dues-paying, book-buying, receipt-in-the-pocket, paid-in-full-to-the-church subgenii,

62
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,880
have the tiniest prayer of survival.

63
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,140
The rest of them?

64
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,920
It's a tough world, Jack.

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:09,200
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m., when we all have hangovers, Wotan's judgment will take place

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,300
in the form of what the pre-scriptures call,

67
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:11,800
the,

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,260
Advent of the Angelic Host.

69
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,520
Happy, happy Independence Day.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,240
Happy real Independence Day, my friends.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,220
Uh, because, uh, here in Dallas, Texas, which is in its own time zone, you know, uh, all

72
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,920
the cities that get the hour of slack are in different time continuum.

73
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:41,260
But here in Dallas, yesterday was July 4th, the day before real Independence Day.

74
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:50,120
You see, for subgeniuses, uh, July 4th is like the day of disappointment and shattered

75
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,160
dreams.

76
00:04:51,600 --> 00:05:00,440
It's a day of lies and rushes to judgment of drunken pinks and car crashes and depressing

77
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,680
desert storm parades.

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,340
And we mope around and think about things like Wounded Knee and JFK and assassination

79
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,920
and the Spanish-American War.

80
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,020
And, uh, we're not going to talk about that.

81
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,020


82
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,520
We're going to talk about the war and Vietnam and Iran-Contras and Watergate and so on.

83
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:32,080
But dear friends, dear friends, July 5th, July 5th, that is a day of hope and promise

84
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,720
for the subgeniuses.

85
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,740
Yes, friends, the day with the true America, the, the, the Bob's America, the America of

86
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,020
our Masonic society.

87
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,020


88
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,020


89
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,780
The subgenius Patriot forefathers and foremoms and, uh, foreslaves.

90
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:56,000
Today, July 5th, in Dallas anyway, is the first day of the end of the world.

91
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,140
The end of their world, dear friends, because it's the first day before the beginning of

92
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,880
our world, our subgenius planet.

93
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,400
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

94
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,000
It makes me feel so good.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000


96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000


97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,520
So good to have a subgenius holiday.

98
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,560
We need more subgenius holidays.

99
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,100
Of course, every day is Bob's birthday, but you know, that gets unrealistic after a while.

100
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,740
And so we call, well, July 4th, what the pinks call their independence day.

101
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:35,020
We call July 4th, X day E and, uh, uh, X day night.

102
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,480
Of course we call X day E, sort of like Halloween, but X day is our independence day.

103
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,740
Not July 4th, not Juneteenth, but X-est-mas.

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,200
X-est-mas, dear friends.

105
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:55,200
And you know, the night before X-est-mas, the whole family, the subgenius fully extended

106
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,720
nuclear family goes out and watches fireworks or else illegally sets them off in their backyard.

107
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,960
And then everyone, the kids and everyone go in and watch Freddy Krueger, Nightmare on

108
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,220
Elm Street videos around the fireplace.

109
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,460
Oh, yeah.

110
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,580
And, uh, the kids are tucked in, of course, about one o'clock in the morning and the grownups

111
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:23,620
stay up all night, frobbing and frobbing and dooning and, and gleaning and, uh, doing

112
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:33,260
X day chants about how the time is nigh for their arisal and, uh, songs, you know, X day

113
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,880
holiday songs like take me off to space, which we'll be playing soon.

114
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,440
And, uh, on X day morning, of course, uh, well, the grownups go to the bathroom and

115
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,440


116
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,940
the kids get up real early because on X day, the children are allowed to eat breakfast.

117
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,740
And just before seven o'clock, all the grownups and everybody sit out doors on their easy

118
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,160
chairs like I did this morning with beers or whatever in their hands.

119
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,640
And, uh, and they do a countdown up till 7 a.m.

120
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,220
And then since it's not really X day yet, they meditate friends on what it's going to

121
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,420
be like when those men from Planet X come down and destroy the whole planet.

122
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:11,420


123
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:11,420


124
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:11,420


125
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:19,760
Well, and what's formaan Signis the phenomenon?

126
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,220
Cone?

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,280
Auf 1 St 75.

128
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,360
And this woman is a well-deserved icon.

129
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:24,920
Careful here.

130
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,800
So, uh, um, there's, um, say that one thing.

131
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:29,980


132
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,760
do this on X day, Okay.

133
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,200
People aren't washers.

134
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,020
And, okay.

135
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,120
Oh yes.

136
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,180
dancing and so forth.

137
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,600
And then everybody goes to bed, usually fairly early in the day,

138
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,880
because you have to sleep.

139
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,400
I've been up all night on X Day Eve.

140
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,640
And they need to have energy for X Dayeen.

141
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,600
X Dayeen, the night of Xmas, when everybody dresses up in costumes,

142
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:07,420
dress up like angels or devils or God or Jesus or Bob or even Negi.

143
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,100
And, of course, you can get those Bob and Negi masks

144
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,460
from your favorite subgenius vendors at Fracton Company,

145
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,600
as seen in your Sark fist.

146
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,620
Ah, yes. Ah, yes, yes, yes.

147
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,300
Shalakandala Dabasoya.

148
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

149
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,580
Oh, oh.

150
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,640
Bye-bye.

151
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,740
You have to go?

152
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,400
So funny, Lembo.

153
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,000
Scary monster.

154
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,580
Get the shock of a lifetime when they close and counter.

155
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,220
Third time for the first time.

156
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,600
Then they wake up.

157
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,720
Good morning, America.

158
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,420
Good morning, America.

159
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,080
Good morning, America.

160
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,320
Good morning, America.

161
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,160
Good night, Nina Hagen.

162
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,900
She came to our Los Angeles revival in 1985

163
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,040
and walked backstage right when I was telling somebody

164
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,820
that she was full of crap with her UFO contactee shtick.

165
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,360
But I don't think her mind let her hear me.

166
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:19,240
Anyway, aren't those old show clips from 1996 and 1980s media barrage tapes

167
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,120
charmingly innocent and hopeful?

168
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,600
We still trusted calendars back then.

169
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,520
We thought we'd be an air-conditioned planet

170
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,480
sized with life and death stars by July 5th.

171
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,140
For contrast, let's listen to Priestess Pisces

172
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,140
describe the scene and the schedule

173
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,460
at the live wisterian hour of slack

174
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,700
from alleged July 5th, alleged 2012,

175
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,580
what turned out to be the 17th X-Day drill.

176
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,320
For one thing, we didn't get the air conditioning.

177
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,680
And instead of sex goddesses, we got ice cream and chili.

178
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,720
But at least we had that.

179
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,320
Boys and girls, I recognize it's very hot outside.

180
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:04,980
It is.

181
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,220
Isn't it?

182
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,120
The cafe would like you to come in.

183
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,980
We'd like you to know that they have ice cream.

184
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,400
Ice cream.

185
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,160
Also, around 5 o'clock today down in the Grindhouse Theater,

186
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,420
there will be chili available.

187
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:16,860
Chili?

188
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,760
In case you would like to lift off on your own later.

189
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,220
Chili today, hot tomorrow.

190
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,380
Really?

191
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,860
There's chili at the Grindhouse?

192
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,340
Around 5 o'clock, yes.

193
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,120
Bad movies and chili?

194
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,180
What's not to like?

195
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,040
You know, to tell the truth, the best time I've had this X-Day

196
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,020
was Princess Wee and I went down to the Grindhouse

197
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,200
after the show yesterday.

198
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,180
What was playing?

199
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,100
Playing?

200
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,380
Eddie Boop cartoons and some Warner Brothers stuff.

201
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,480
And it was just the two of us,

202
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,320
and we spent the most slackful 20 minutes of the whole X-Day

203
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,480
sitting there watching those cartoons.

204
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,220
Sounds nice.

205
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,340
And with chili, that would round it out perfectly.

206
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,740
A burst of movie music came out during the nuptial ceremony.

207
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,520
During the end of Stang's sermon,

208
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,220
some wonderful, cranky old movie music came floating out.

209
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,300
It was a magical moment.

210
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,580
Anyway, please attend to Priestess Pisces.

211
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,260
Okay, again.

212
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,280
So again, remember the cafe has ice cream.

213
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,040
That'll cool you off.

214
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,420
There will be chili down at the Grindhouse around 5 o'clock.

215
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,420
After the live hour of slack, when these boys are done,

216
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,720
there will be the Bulldada auction.

217
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,040
So if you have anything to bring up for the Bulldada auction,

218
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,840
please bring that.

219
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,320
Registration and swag does close at 5 o'clock.

220
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,960
If you have not registered and I don't see you around with a band,

221
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,180
I'm going to embarrass you.

222
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,820
You should have a little green or orange band on your wrist,

223
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,100
or you will be publicly humiliated,

224
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,800
or worse.

225
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,340
It doesn't take that much time.

226
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,800
I've got two friendly gentlemen waiting right now

227
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,500
to take your money and your registration.

228
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,860
In addition, there's a number of,

229
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,520
there are a few left of 2X or 3X T-shirts over there

230
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,400
that I've put aside.

231
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,680
I don't see a band on Reverend Codini,

232
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,260
and he just sat down right next to that registration table.

233
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,800
Wow.

234
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,420
I hope Codini remembers to go register.

235
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,460
You can get T-shirts to participate in the esoteric subgenius team.

236
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,200
He probably thinks having his artwork on the front of the table is a good idea.

237
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,560
It's a free ceremony.

238
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,120
Right.

239
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,900
It's worth $35.

240
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,660
In addition, after 5 p.m.,

241
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,580
when registration and swag check closes,

242
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,100
there will be a slack black mass at 8 p.m. at the main stage,

243
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,580
which will be very interesting.

244
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,720
Conducted by his eminent son, Shaw.

245
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,900
In addition, at 9 p.m.,

246
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,240
Reverend Sam Singleton, the atheist evangelist,

247
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,700
will take the main stage.

248
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,020
An actual professional performer, friends.

249
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,640
Our headlining music performer of the night is the great,

250
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,580
and well-renowned Duke of Uke,

251
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,940
who will be playing at 10 p.m.

252
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,980
The Duke of Uke, ladies and germs.

253
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,220
So, and also, at any point in time today,

254
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,720
and actually at any point in time,

255
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,520
the rest of this festival,

256
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,880
impromptu water-getting battles will occur.

257
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,460
At some point, there will be topless pillow fighting.

258
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,880
What do you mean, at some point?

259
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,880
Because it's a surprise.

260
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,200
I heard there were even one.

261
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,180
There were women invited to that.

262
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,040
Okay, now...

263
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,100
So those are the announcements for now,

264
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,260
and I'll let these boys get back to what they do.

265
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,140
Well, that's mighty nice of you.

266
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,240
As you know, the high points of this are ice cream,

267
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,600
chili at the Grindhouse,

268
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,340
the wonderful parade of events taking place at the main stage,

269
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,720
not the least of which the black mass conducted by Suds Shaw.

270
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,460
Have we never heard about your honeymoon,

271
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,160
Paisley?

272
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,280
You see, I'm sorry, I forgot to ask.

273
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,760
Did everything go all right?

274
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,580
Did you need any other instructions?

275
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,820
I can give lessons.

276
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,920
Just remember, it takes all types of critters

277
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,320
to make Grindhouse fritters.

278
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,340
G. Gordon Gordon has reminded me to insert

279
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,420
that first you eat the chili,

280
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,760
then you eat the ice cream.

281
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,860
I guess a little bit of remedial culinary,

282
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,040
instruction goes a long way.

283
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,140
In your enthusiasm, you might bolt down the ice cream

284
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,140
and then place on top of its glaucous mass

285
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,300
the incendiary column of chili

286
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,920
to bedevil your digestive system.

287
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,860
Mine is still struggling with the pig flesh

288
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,180
I ingested yesterday.

289
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,180
Thanks to Reverend Heathen,

290
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,300
I have a case of ranch-style beans

291
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,000
you could wash that down with.

292
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,580
Always with the ranch-style beans.

293
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,800
I don't understand.

294
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,700
Besides the one I just finished up here,

295
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,080
thanks to Mr. Sister.

296
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,180
Yes, you ate your octopus?

297
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,240
Yeah, yeah, I'll...

298
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,280
You know, if somebody else pays for it,

299
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,320
I'll go ahead and eat an intelligent creature.

300
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,780
You know, one of the things that I...

301
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,180
I'm not going to pay my own money

302
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,100
to eat an animal that might be as smart as me.

303
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,320
Your dolphin MRE's whooping-crane paste

304
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,560
and heart-of-century-plant salad

305
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,260
will be served this evening.

306
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,320
You won't see me eat crow.

307
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,180
There's actually a lot of free food

308
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,360
around this campsite.

309
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,400
Down in the pond, there's orange speckled newts.

310
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,400
That's right.

311
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,320
Papa Joe Mama caught one of these elusive salamanders

312
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,960
with his bare hands.

313
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,280
Oh, really?

314
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,840
While I was there, being eaten by clouds of insects.

315
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,420
They make great soup.

316
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,560
And, of course, when you go on the other path,

317
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,860
you can...

318
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,660
The other path.

319
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,740
The other path that heads in the other direction,

320
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,080
go a couple miles that direction,

321
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,540
you're guaranteed to pick up dozens and dozens of ticks,

322
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,280
which are very helpful in making your own

323
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,340
subgenius brand of tequila.

324
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,640
And finally, what other free foods do they have?

325
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,880
Well, there are leeches.

326
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,940
I don't know if they're edible.

327
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,520
Ah, yes, the leeches.

328
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,300
Those are good for medical purposes.

329
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,280
Yes.

330
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,120
That's why one, I'm told,

331
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,660
one should not visit the other side of the pond.

332
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,380
Of course, this is just some legend,

333
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,460
some exaggeration made to scare unwary campers.

334
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,840
Well, leeches are actually very tasty in pasta.

335
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,440
You don't even have to cook them.

336
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,660
You go ahead, I would.

337
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:23,100
Like octopi, best enjoyed when they're still squirming a bit.

338
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:31,700
That's in that Japanese tradition of eating still live arthropods and things.

339
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,700
This is going to be amazing.

340
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,300
No more fighting over which bed they can sleep in.

341
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,140
Now they have plenty of room, plenty of floor space,

342
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,320
and it's pink. Fantastic.

343
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,260
A new female co-star, and she starts Monday.

344
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,020
What? A new co-star?

345
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,440
Never heard your Bob story.

346
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,620
Oh, okay.

347
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,140
Well, you know, I had Bob on the phone,

348
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,740
and I suddenly realized that I...

349
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,360
You can't tell that story now.

350
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,620
He belongs to Bob.

351
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,420
What do you mean?

352
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,600
You signed the release.

353
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:57,980
Yeah?

354
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,560
All right, I'm back in the game.

355
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,600
Hello?

356
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,700
It's Bobby.

357
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,680
No, you got the wrong number, kid.

358
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,520
It's your grandson, Bobby.

359
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,740
Why haven't you called?

360
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,580
Bobby, you gotta stop calling.

361
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,740
Okay, goodbye, Bobby.

362
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Don't call anymore.

363
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,280
I'm dead now.

364
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:15,780
Gotta go.

365
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,220
Hey, Bob.

366
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,520
Boo!

367
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:16,920
Bob!

368
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,980
The state calls Mr. Bob to the stand.

369
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,560
How about you cut me a little slack, okay?

370
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,560
Heads are turning, and people are hitting the streets of Austin, Texas,

371
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,960
to catch a glimpse of it.

372
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,200
Because believe it or not, the Lone Star State is home to the world's first and only

373
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,940
Bob.

374
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,500
Bob decided to turn...

375
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,120
My friend Bob had shock treatments.

376
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,060
The second main courier that I had was a Bob Jr.

377
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,200
His father was a drug, a big drug dealer who I knew.

378
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,060
Hey, you gonna do stuff outside, Bobby?

379
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,740
Yeah, yeah, Mr. Hill.

380
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,140
Got any other work you want to throw my way?

381
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,420
So I, I enlisted him as one of my couriers.

382
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,080
Let's do that.

383
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,880
And it was a big mistake on my part.

384
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,180
Princess, we and I have been, we've been in a relationship for a long time.

385
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,180


386
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,180


387
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,180


388
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,180


389
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,180


390
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,180


391
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,180


392
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,180


393
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,180


394
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,180


395
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,180


396
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,300
We've been lately taking annual cross-country trips in the wintertime.

397
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,540
She retired from her conspiracy job at Weather Control, and I learned how to continue to

398
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,440
do my slave labor from on the road.

399
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,280
As long as I carry enough membership packs with me for sale over there.

400
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:29,580
Anyway, we started making a, sort of a regular and formal exploration of subgenius homes.

401
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,740
Wow!

402
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,140
How many have televisions in every room that are on all the time?

403
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,400
How many have no television?

404
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:44,060
How many have a slack altar that takes up part of one room?

405
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,000
And how many have a house that the whole thing is a slack altar?

406
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,080
Guilty and guilty.

407
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,680
And we've been putting these online.

408
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,640
Actually, we haven't put Potter Nostril and Petal's Place online yet.

409
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:06,920
But their entire house is what you would call a slack altar.

410
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,200
I've had people come in and look at one shelf in my house and go,

411
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,240
Man, I wish I had so much cool stuff.

412
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,660
Well, that's their entire house.

413
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,960
And Susie the Floozy's place is legendary.

414
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,880
The Floozyum is online, both her previous one and the current one.

415
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,540
And you have to set aside four hours to look at,

416
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,920
her Baldotta collection.

417
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,780
And keep your hands in your pockets at all times.

418
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,540
Philo's house is about a half slack altar.

419
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,100
Philo has many slack altars indoors and outdoors.

420
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,780
His house is riven with them.

421
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,120
But you can't say that every inch of it has been turned into a slack altar.

422
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,440
Well, many things there are reliquaries of bones and the weird remains of various creatures.

423
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,600
It's a wonderful place to visit.

424
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,700
And there's slack altars.

425
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,320
Dr. House?

426
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,460
Philo's house or room has been featured in magazines as a slack altar.

427
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:05,980
Wow.

428
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,560
And a miracle of packing, miniaturization.

429
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,420
Especially after the San Francisco earthquakes when everything's dislodged and thrown.

430
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,700
Very little of it fell down.

431
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,840
You'd have to see them to believe it, really.

432
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,940
That's the miracle of these slack altars.

433
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,800
A tree fell on their slack altar just two days ago.

434
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,660
And the word was,

435
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,620
the tree fell on the slack altar.

436
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,040
And the word was,

437
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,060
the tree fell on the slack altar.

438
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,060


439
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,100
the tree fell on the slack altar.

440
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,720
And yet they get there and it was the Porsche they were planning on taking down anyway.

441
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,680
Right.

442
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,520
So, involuntary slack.

443
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,780
You build for slack, you will get slack.

444
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,160
It seems like a disaster at first and then you realize it's the best thing that ever happened.

445
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,100
Oh, my God, I lost my job.

446
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Oh, my car got wrecked.

447
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,940
Oh, they stole all my heroin.

448
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,240
And it turns out that was the involuntary slack you most needed.

449
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,580
That doesn't always happen, granted.

450
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,560
Sometimes.

451
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,800
Sometimes it's just a horrible mess.

452
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,240
Sometimes the heroin isn't contaminated.

453
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:04,900
But...

454
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
For the most part.

455
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,540
You know, I mean, certainly...

456
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,500
Now, there's Dr. Drummond slowly making his way.

457
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,980
Now, he's heading for that sweat lodge down there.

458
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,880
This heroin is 10% sugar.

459
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,960
Or the turd, as Mr. Cicero calls them.

460
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,360
He's going to recycle some of that beer that he picked up in Athens.

461
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,100
Well, we'll see him before long.

462
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,960
I know.

463
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,500
It may be a while.

464
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,040
I have faith.

465
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,840
I don't know why he's heading so rapidly down the hill.

466
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,360
I can tell by the way he's walking.

467
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,260
It could be...

468
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:29,600
It could be.

469
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:29,600


470
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:29,600


471
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,800
At least 10 or 15 minutes.

472
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,260
He's heading for the port-a-potty to relieve his special tensions.

473
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,300
And now he knows that everyone up here is sort of kind of keeping an eye on there

474
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,860
to see how long it'll take him.

475
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,520
That's right.

476
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,320
Whether he's still zipping up when he walks out or pulling his pants up.

477
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,120
I notice none of those port-a-potties are in the shade.

478
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,980
Every single one of them is in the heat.

479
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,740
In the boiling sun.

480
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,360
Well, it's funny.

481
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:55,960
There used to...

482
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,400
Last year, there was a fabulous...

483
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,540
Deluxe...

484
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,120
Deluxe chem toilet for handicapped people.

485
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:02,920
Right over there.

486
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,160
That was my favorite one.

487
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,280
I pretty much monopolized it all the time.

488
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,900
Well, you have a handicap, as we all know.

489
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,580
And there was another normal one next to it.

490
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:22,960
Now, and they never struck me as unusually unpleasant as chem toilet sweat lodge tortoises go.

491
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,280
You know, it's all relative.

492
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,920
Some are worse than others.

493
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,880
And I understand that...

494
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,840
One last year was legendary

495
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,580
because someone with a great capacity

496
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,100
didn't even bother to lift the lid.

497
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,940
They just placed it right across the top of the lid

498
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,620
as if to make a statement.

499
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,140
That's because these people don't bring a light.

500
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,400
See what I can do.

501
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,740
You've got to bring a light.

502
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,760
Gaze upon my works.

503
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,080
Ye mighty and despair.

504
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,940
That brought up a new term here.

505
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,140
I didn't see it myself.

506
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,620
I had advanced a theory that some...

507
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,860
Sissy city girl that forgot her flashlight had done that.

508
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,980
Oh, that's called ground capping.

509
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,000
Ground happy?

510
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,560
Ground capping.

511
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,120
Thanks to Mr. Sister.

512
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:16,220
Susie said that whoever created this was probably not a small woman,

513
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,740
but someone of large and experienced capacity.

514
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,040
But they knew it was a woman.

515
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,380
Well, you never know.

516
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,740
They knew it was a woman because it was written in cursive or what?

517
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,740
No, well...

518
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,560
She was trying to say it wasn't.

519
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,000
At the end.

520
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:38,560
Yeah, it was curled like a Dairy Queen softie.

521
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,920
Yes, I was trying not to say that, but there it is.

522
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,240
But see, Susie herself does that.

523
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,300
She brags about that.

524
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
T-M-I.

525
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,100
Well, it takes a lot of...

526
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,180
You know, it's sort of like twirling those little things on the ends of your breast.

527
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,460
You've got to have perfect synchronization.

528
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,960
Well, and she can do that too.

529
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,600
Absolutely.

530
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,720
There are many...

531
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,840
There are many talents here at the church.

532
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:06,760
Every subgenius has a superpower that no one else has.

533
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:16,180
And I think every subgenius has a superpower that he, her, or it doesn't know is possessed.

534
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:22,140
That will be found out in the crucible of extremity.

535
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,400
You will find out what your secret path, what your secret power is.

536
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:27,640
Yes.

537
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,640
What's the name of that one subgenius from days of yore that could play the trumpet through his ass?

538
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,500
Who was that?

539
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,860
Oh, Lepetimane.

540
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,480
Lepetimane.

541
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,920
Yeah, the great Lepetimane.

542
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
He could also squirt water out of there.

543
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,140
Well, he was the most highly paid performer in Paris at his time.

544
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,660
He outsold Sarah Bernhardt, who was the most famous actress.

545
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,780
You don't know this.

546
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,080
Tell us something new, euphoria.

547
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,280
But could he outperform Sarah Bernhardt?

548
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:54,720
It's not me.

549
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,940
I didn't bring it up.

550
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,100
I didn't bring it up.

551
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,300
I didn't bring it up.

552
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,380
I didn't bring it up.

553
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:57,380


554
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:57,380


555
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:57,380


556
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:57,380


557
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,340
Yes, there's a...

558
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,320
I knew about Petimane when you were running down your daddy's leg.

559
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,620
Yeah, but you were 85 when I was running down my daddy's leg.

560
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,300
You probably saw Lepetimane.

561
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,760
You probably paid for scout tickets to see that guy in 1890.

562
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,400
He was in Baghdad when you were in your dad's bag.

563
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,700
Well, you have to remember, there's always a new generation of subgenius.

564
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,700
They can't all be as young.

565
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,760
However many years young as Gordon Gordon is.

566
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,340
So a few of us...

567
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,440
That's right.

568
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,960
He can be brought up to speed.

569
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:34,940
What?

570
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,560
I'm not even saying that.

571
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:43,180
It's Papa Joe Mama who's making these disparaging, ageist comments.

572
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,360
Thank you, Hal, for taking that sling and arrow on my behalf.

573
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,700
Well, I'm sure I'll have solacisms myself I'll have to pay for.

574
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,120
I don't wish my own burden to grow too heavy.

575
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,860
You're reminding me of Judy.

576
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:57,820
David de Beaver.

577
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:07,740
No one is more bold than Papa Joe Mama, rhetorically and in the arena of intellectual and even,

578
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,680
dare I say it, physical combat.

579
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:16,840
I hate to say it, but Papa Joe Mama is the only subgenius that we had to censor once.

580
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,360
Good.

581
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
More than once.

582
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,440
Good.

583
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,780
Well, that's, yeah, you know you're on the right track.

584
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,240
Well, like I said...

585
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,520
I put out a stark fist.

586
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,360
If, if, if...

587
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,600
If Gary Hughes and Paul Mavridis had had any say in it, I would have been hung just for

588
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,080
thinking about it.

589
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,660
Was this never Screw the Cops?

590
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,740
It was the really, really, yeah, the hot sex issue of the stark fist, the last of the giant

591
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,000
ones.

592
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,140
I always wondered why you cut off just before the anal scene kicked in.

593
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,840
The whole idea was to infuriate my PC buddies in San Francisco.

594
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,400
Honestly, it really was.

595
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,660
And boy, did it ever.

596
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,820
It worked.

597
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,820
They said, there's never going to be girls in the church from now on.

598
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,220
And boy, were they wrong.

599
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,740
The subgenius ladies saw that offensive magazine and went, oh, these boys think they're so

600
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,120
gross.

601
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,480
And they proved us to be rank amateurs, especially the rank part.

602
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,540
Who would have ever thought that there are women out there who actually enjoy sex?

603
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,640
Unbelievable.

604
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,800
We unearthed the ladies that liked the three students.

605
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:25,800


606
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,060
The four stooge.

607
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,720
The missing stooge.

608
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:27,720


609
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,100
It's the fourth stooge, the missing stooge.

610
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,840
Are you the fourth stooge, my friend?

611
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:41,220
That was Papa Joe Mama, Dr. Hal, and me from the 50 Next Day stage.

612
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:49,100
Except for PR News, which is by Lemur, the collages tonight are, by and large, by The

613
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,520
Large.

614
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,600
Or they're from very old subgenius media barrage albums.

615
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,780
Or the ancient E-Mail.

616
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:55,780


617
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:55,780


618
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:55,780


619
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:55,780


620
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:55,780


621
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:55,780


622
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:55,780


623
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:55,780


624
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:55,780


625
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,460
The ESO Swamp Radio Show from WCSB Cleveland.

626
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:05,980
Speaking of variety, we had a very special guest at 50 Next Day, an actual professional

627
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,340
preacher, and not a subgenius one, at least not originally.

628
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,080
He is a very busy and popular atheist preacher.

629
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,020
And he delivered a pretty amazing one hour long sermon, which we'll be playing in 10

630
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,120
minute excerpts for the next few shows.

631
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,240
This is Reverend Sam Singleton.

632
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,800
The Atheist Evangelist.

633
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,440
Goddamn!

634
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:36,340
I always figured there are three kinds of people come out to the show.

635
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,480
Atheists, like Brother Sam.

636
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,720
Agnostics, like, well y'all aren't like anything.

637
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:55,220
And the ones that say they actually believe in God.

638
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:57,900
Theists.

639
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,940
And I'm going to be talking to each group at different times, and sometimes all together.

640
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,780
So pay attention.

641
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,560
And I realize that the godly will have to pedal harder to keep up.

642
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,220
Maybe you can sit behind an atheist and get carried along in the slipstream.

643
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,200
I'm going to spend some time talking about how silly the Bible is, and how stupid it

644
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,200


645
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,200


646
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,400
is, and how its main characters are all curiously preoccupied with penises.

647
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,660
They own and other guys.

648
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:42,980
Which I suppose is inevitable, seeing as how the Bible is so patriarchal.

649
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,140
Not much ink gets spilled on the ladies.

650
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,680
Lucky for you, Brother Sam has gone to the trouble of actually reading the Bible.

651
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,260
So you don't have to.

652
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,320
Just like the clergy.

653
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,940
You're welcome.

654
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,100
Just so you know, you're not missing much.

655
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,380
For one thing, that motherfucker is long.

656
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,040
And it just gets sillier and boringer.

657
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,780
Till...

658
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,660
Until...

659
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:22,660


660
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,700
Until...

661
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:23,700


662
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,780
And I hate to spoil the ending.

663
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:32,180
Till you've suffered through about oh-twelve hundred pages before you realize it was nothing

664
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:36,000
but one of those juvenile gags in which the punchline is just the word penis.

665
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,020
There's no object.

666
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,520
No moral to the damn thing.

667
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,620
Maybe the writers knew what they were doing, given their intended audience.

668
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:56,000
I think they must have just figured there was no need to exert themselves trying to

669
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,320
stuff a bunch of actual content into the Bible when all that was necessary to get all the

670
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,800
lurid little snickers and giggles they were after was to keep steering the story back

671
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,500
to penises.

672
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:17,340
And you can't get very far into any exploration of biblical dicks before you come upon the

673
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:17,720
paper.

674
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,140
Patriarchs, the Bible's heroes, who all made penile history.

675
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:31,920
It is no accident that the word monogamy does not appear in the Bible.

676
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,140
Neither does incest.

677
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:45,420
My point is that the very people who model their morality on the examples of the patriarchs

678
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,260
and their God...

679
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,500
...are screwing us while we stand.

680
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:56,100
And the only way to stop them is to say right out loud.

681
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:05,380
Now, there may be ten times more y'all than there are of us, but that don't mean you can

682
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,040
fuck me without me saying something about it.

683
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,800
I'm hitching up my britches and going home.

684
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,240
And I hate to be so blunt.

685
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,000
But there it is.

686
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,740
The question isn't whether they've got us outnumbered.

687
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,460
They have.

688
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,220
It's by how much.

689
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:36,760
In the USA, the degree to which majorities feel emboldened to go up your you-hoo without

690
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:43,940
so much as a by your leave is never less than proportionate to their numerical superiority.

691
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:49,240
In what passes for a democracy, numbers are important.

692
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:55,360
You get yourselves undercounted, and you're guaranteed to be underrepresented, underheard,

693
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:07,300
underpaid attention to, fucked like I say, speedily, mightily, regularly.

694
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:13,100
I've seen polls say that non-believers count for about 11% of the population.

695
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:13,920
I don't believe that.

696
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,360
It works out to about 31 million of us.

697
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,740
Double what it was ten years ago.

698
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:27,020
If atheism were a religion, it would be expanding at a clip similar to that to Islam here in

699
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,440
the USA.

700
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:36,300
And if you think that sounds good, just remember it still leaves 89% of the people in the air

701
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,680
traffic control towers at the triggers of the nuclear arsenal.

702
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:51,460
In the government, the military and the police, 89% of your fellow Americans, all claiming

703
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,040
that they have an imaginary friend that tells them what to do.

704
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:05,160
And the ones with the imaginary friend have turned their fantasy into a culture, a form

705
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,920
of governance, mediocrity.

706
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:08,940
And that's what we're going to see.

707
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:18,980
In which 11% of the population, the top 11%, need not apply.

708
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,040
Being a minority in the USA is not all it's cracked up to be.

709
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,040
In fact, it'll get you hosed every time.

710
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,460
Or 89% of the time.

711
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,860
Part of our problem is we're not conspicuous enough.

712
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:43,740
We need to dress up funny one day a year and have big atheist pride parades all over the

713
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,100
place.

714
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,780
That's what we need to do.

715
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,400
Rolling over and playing dead has got us mistaken for actually being dead.

716
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:01,600
You do that shit long enough one of these times, you're not playing anymore.

717
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:08,180
If you wind up getting a Christian burial, don't say you weren't warned.

718
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,920
You'll be dead and they'll still be fucking you.

719
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,760
Necro-theism.

720
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,140
It's the Christians that are supposed to turn the other cheek.

721
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,580
I'll tell you one thing about my Christianity.

722
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:31,880
I'm a Christian, Ken.

723
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,360
My cheeks involuntarily clench whenever I'm around them.

724
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:46,520
Reverend Sam Singleton, the atheist evangelist, live at X-Day, the part one.

725
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,160
He can be found at samsingleton.com.

726
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,580
Evidently, his upbringing was not very subgeniously.

727
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,820
It was fantastically pink.

728
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,720
And I think if I could, I'd probably have my wedding as pink as hers.

729
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,540
Come on, Bobby, let's go party.

730
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,560
It looked really glitzy and princessy, which is just kind of how I want mine to be.

731
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,760
My beef was pink and very pink.

732
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,020
I know a lot of people like it like that, but I didn't.

733
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,060
It's certainly gone with the pink theme and it's not over the top.

734
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,460
It's very subtle and really, really beautiful.

735
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,380
Bob made $760 on their Tesla hemorrhoid pad.

736
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,240
No!

737
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,760
Pink frosting fixes everything.

738
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,500
Listen, McCloud.

739
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,000
When I broke in tonight, the numbers and figures I saw didn't add up.

740
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,620
Something's wrong and Blake's trying to cover it up.

741
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,840
What do you want me to do?

742
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,500
Help me.

743
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,220
I can't. Not now.

744
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,020
What happened to the McCloud that everyone believed in?

745
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,140
That was 40 years ago. I'm an old man.

746
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,300
Are you all right? What's the matter?

747
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,760
You gotta go.

748
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,660
Don't remember this day for a thousand years.

749
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,440
The day we protected the planet from the sun.

750
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,680
I'd like to bring up two beautiful people that I spent a lot of time masturbating thinking about them.

751
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,360
And I hope you do too.

752
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,820
And if you don't, I don't know what's wrong with you sick fucks.

753
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,760
Please, welcome to the stage.

754
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,820
Dr. Hal and Princess Wee!

755
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,700
Thank you, Mandy.

756
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:52,100
What we're going to do is recreate for you a subgenius traditional hymn.

757
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,740
And like all these traditions, they start to evolve.

758
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:55,740


759
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,880
And they start to mutate the moment they happen.

760
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:06,240
So to stabilize the lines, we have got little cards which should keep most mistakes from happening.

761
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,440
But at any rate, hello everybody.

762
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,160
Hello.

763
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,440
X day is here.

764
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,420
The mountains fall.

765
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,300
I cringe and hide my head.

766
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:31,380
I never send in my 35 bucks.

767
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,640
My soul is filled with dread.

768
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,860
Oh Bob, won't you let me live?

769
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:49,060
And all that is mine, I John Shirley will give.

770
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:54,180
Oh lift me away in your great song.

771
00:39:54,180 --> 00:40:00,000
Oh, I'm a lost ship to my subgenius home.

772
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:11,640
Oh, bear me away in your great shining ship to my subgenius home.

773
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,020
I laughed at Bob.

774
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,960
Ah, woe is me.

775
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,460
I thirst for slack in vain.

776
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,820
For here he now sits and smokes his pipe.

777
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,060
I must have been insane.

778
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:41,920
I saw the pinks and normals flee.

779
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:47,580
The dreadful harvest from the sky.

780
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:52,640
In millions they in agony.

781
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,680
And not one of them knows why.

782
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,840
Oh Bob, won't you let me live?

783
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,660
And all that is mine, I John Shirley will give.

784
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:15,300
Oh lift me away in your great saucer ship.

785
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,900
To my subgenius home.

786
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:31,360
Oh, bear me away in your great shining ship to my subgenius home.

787
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:38,340
The towers of the proud did fall.

788
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,040
There was no shelter from that storm.

789
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:49,680
While from far above the subgeniuses watched.

790
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,180
In comfort safe and warm.

791
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,660
But then I woke.

792
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,340
It was but a dream.

793
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,440
True slack can still be mine.

794
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:10,680
I wrote out a check to Ivan Stang.

795
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,300
And signed the bottom line.

796
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,460
Oh Bob, now I may live.

797
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:26,160
And all that is mine, I John Shirley will give.

798
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Oh lift me away in your great saucer ship.

799
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,120
To my subgenius home.

800
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:43,280
Oh bear me away in your great shining ship to my subgenius home.

801
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,220
It is the last time I will see you.

802
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:45,220


803
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:45,220


804
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:45,220


805
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:51,080
To my subgenius home.

806
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,620
Thank you, Fat Maggie of Pittsburgh.

807
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,960
I'll be right here.

808
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:19,520
And we'll be sending that little almond-eyed gray humanoid around to your door to collect those organs.

809
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,360
So he'll be in the cute little uniform.

810
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,440
So don't be afraid.

811
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:25,780
They're your friends.

812
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,760
They're here to help.

813
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,340
They're our brothers from the stars.

814
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:35,080
You should believe anything they whisper into your ear in the dead of night as you try to sleep.

815
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,460
They're your friends.

816
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:47,680
They want to teach humanity and lead us into a new age of enlightenment under their gray jackboot.

817
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,660
Whisper, whisper.

818
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,200
Now listen.

819
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:49,800
Now listen.

820
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,480
Now listen.

821
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,080
Now listen.

822
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:51,880
Now listen.

823
00:43:52,080 --> 00:44:06,160
If you wake up in a vat of poison with little aliens standing around outside the vat wrapping, tying napkins around their necks, sharpening their knives and forks,

824
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:10,860
be glad because you've just fell into the hands of the good aliens.

825
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,480
The bad aliens are far, far worse.

826
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,280
Whoa!

827
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,220
They're not like the thing.

828
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,080
That was a cuddly little Benji of an alien compared to what we're...

829
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,560
They aren't like aliens in that movie Aliens.

830
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:36,040
Those are silly little werewolves among monsters compared to what we're talking about.

831
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,300
That is in the box.

832
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,940
What we're talking about is more like what's growing in your refrigerator right now.

833
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,580
That's what it looks more like.

834
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,380
That is in the box.

835
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,280
The effect is...

836
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,460
It turns you into the alien.

837
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,500
But man, take my word for it.

838
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,220
It's worth it.

839
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,640
It's great, man.

840
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,120
It's cool.

841
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:02,960
You'll love it.

842
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,780
It's for your own good.

843
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,700
What's the matter, you fray?

844
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,420
What's the matter, you chicken?

845
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,860
Come on, man.

846
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,140
Everybody's doing it.

847
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,080
Go ahead.

848
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,380
Go ahead.

849
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:25,780
Stroke the alien and collect the dew that builds up on the side of its neck like a appendage.

850
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,620
Go ahead.

851
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,980
Now demagnetize your head.

852
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,780
Okay?

853
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,540
I think you know what to do next.

854
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,520
I don't think you're the kind of listener that I'd have to explain that to.

855
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,340
Now are you?

856
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,660
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

857
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,520
Bye.

858
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,880
Yeah, I think they know just what I'm talking about.

859
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,800
Oh, they like it too.

860
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,960
Oh, they're first and good.

861
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,180
I don't know what to do next.

862
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,620
You stand up on the hillside with your bat call and blow into the bat call.

863
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,240
It's not like a moose call or a duck call.

864
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,480
You can't hear it.

865
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,600
Yeah, but it's super...

866
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,120
This is superfluous, cock.

867
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,600
I give you the wrong name.

868
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,240
And just make sure you...

869
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,540
Make sure you've got your antidote pudding ready for when that bat lands on your face.

870
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,820
You're going to have to use that pudding mighty quick.

871
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,300
But it's worth it.

872
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,640
You'll dig it.

873
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,340
Well, I don't know.

874
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,700
I'm kind of scared.

875
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,320
Well, it's always scary the first time.

876
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,540
That's part of the kick, man.

877
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,340
Come on, everybody's doing it.

878
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,120
I ain't never going to do it.

879
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,260
I'm too old to do it.

880
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,240
Aren't you susceptible to peer group pressure?

881
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,540
I'm too old for it.

882
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,320
What are you, some kind of a weirdo?

883
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:45,800
Yes.

884
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,720
No, I'm not a weirdo.

885
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,560
I want to be like everyone else.

886
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,440
No, no, no.

887
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:51,840
Good.

888
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,380
Then you'll take this little alien home and...

889
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:54,920
I am a weirdo.

890
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,120
Hey, stop rubbing your...

891
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,460
I'm not doing the game.

892
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,180
I don't think there's a reason for her to be confused.

893
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,640
There's something you find when you open the door.

894
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:09,240
You take these keys, and one of the keys says Bob on it.

895
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,400
You stick it in the lock, and you open up the door.

896
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,220
And if you're lucky, the green carpet rolls out.

897
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,220
And if you're not...

898
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,940
The red carpet rolls out.

899
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,100
Yeah, back in my day, we didn't care about expiration dates.

900
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,180
We didn't even look at those things.

901
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,480
They were just complicated codes.

902
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,780
We didn't believe that type of stuff.

903
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,100
No one knoweth his expiration date.

904
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,340
Yeah.

905
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,020
And now you notice they don't even print expiration dates.

906
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,580
It's all sell-by dates.

907
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,260
You can take a picture with your cell phone.

908
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,940
Everything's got so many preservatives in it,

909
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,960
and none of it expires.

910
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:42,640
It's all pretend.

911
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,780
They're just making you think,

912
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,700
oh, this has got a limited lifespan.

913
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,880
You're going to have to throw it away,

914
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,960
buy new ones.

915
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,840
Well, good luck in buying a new can of Diet Moxie

916
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,600
in this neck of the woods.

917
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,680
Whoever heard of a Twinkie expiring?

918
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,400
I mean, come on.

919
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,460
Well, they say in their ads that Twinkies are baked fresh

920
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,920
and so forth.

921
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:07,080
Preposterous, but they make this bald-faced assertion.

922
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,260
They found Twinkies in the ancient pyramids of the pharaohs

923
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,580
that are still piping fresh the moment you open them.

924
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,180
Yeah, perfectly good.

925
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,800
That's a lie.

926
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,480
That's total...

927
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,680
Okay, they were snow cones.

928
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,780
They weren't Twinkies.

929
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,500
They were those little snow cone things.

930
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,500
They were Little Debbie's, damn it.

931
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,140
What's wrong?

932
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,020
They're snow cones like snow cones.

933
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,280
We were once driving behind a Little Debbie's van,

934
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:29,980
true story,

935
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,720
and the back of the van opened up,

936
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,880
and out came a big box full of delicious

937
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,880
Little Debbie oatmeal cream-filled cookies.

938
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,040
And I thought, my God,

939
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,160
this is the best slack I have ever encountered.

940
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,300
But, dear Dad,

941
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,360
I couldn't believe shame.

942
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,600
Here's a Шاصлы как на Diese.

943
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:54,200
Fantastic.

944
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:55,360


945
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:55,920
because I'd never thought

946
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:05,600
There was aadventure production

947
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,860
through Twinkies in the very early 50 years.

948
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,400
But at the time,

949
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,240
there were a whole bunch of Christmas candy

950
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,460
that I listened to for three years.

951
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,000
And as I watched that expansions was umaiding,

952
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:17,230
It was dry.

953
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:19,010
Yeah, the oatmeal ones are good.

954
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,390
Yeah, the oatmeal ones are great.

955
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,390
But this is like, where's the lesson in this?

956
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,850
And I did learn from that occasion.

957
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:35,450
Your story reminds me of those irritating newspaper stories of chumps who see money fall out of the back of armored cars.

958
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:41,890
And then they return these bags of cash that they were too inept to guard.

959
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,790
Because it's the honest thing to do.

960
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,210
Oh, yes.

961
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,170
The bank is really going to...

962
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:50,770
Well, Miss Bertha, thank you so much.

963
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:57,950
And as a special reward for you returning this $3,476,000 to Chase Bank,

964
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:04,910
we are going to give you this certified check for $100 to give to the charity of your choice.

965
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:11,150
Or to put against the foreclosure which our bank is busily contriving for you.

966
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:14,450
Well, the important thing, friends,

967
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:14,710
is,

968
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:18,330
if you're walking through a parking lot and you see a $20 bill on the ground,

969
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,070
go ahead and pick it up and put it in your pocket.

970
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:21,570
I do.

971
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,750
But don't stop there.

972
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:30,050
Look around and see if there isn't a bullet-ridden bank robber with a sack of $20 bills.

973
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:31,790
Well, you want to be careful with those.

974
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:33,050
Because people come looking for them.

975
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:34,410
Behind the bushes, you know.

976
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,770
That's the big mistake so many people make.

977
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:39,330
Oh, my God, I found a $20 bill.

978
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,590
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

979
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:44,770
And they walk right by the dead bank robber with a sack of $20.

980
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:49,070
Well, the old Civil War soldier who wants to tell you where all the gold is buried.

981
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,470
Don't be like that silly, inobservant subgenius.

982
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:54,250
As he clutches a .45 pistol in his bloody hand,

983
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:59,850
some remaining muscular spasm might cause him to tighten his finger on the trigger

984
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:04,890
while you try to pull the blood-smeared bag out of his cadaverous grip.

985
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:09,170
So you don't want to pour any of that last bit of liquor out of your small little vest pocket canteen.

986
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,890
Hey, well, we've got a new episode of Breaking Bad.

987
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,050
Let's send him the script.

988
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:14,770
Into his son parking lot.

989
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:15,070
Large lips.

990
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:22,370
From PR News in Washington, I'm under fire on a highway south of Mexico City, injuring two people.

991
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,350
But Mayor Michael Bloomberg says this is PR News.

992
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,990
Lance Armstrong will no longer be called seven-time doping champion.

993
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,770
Armstrong maintains he's tired of doping embassy personnel.

994
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,670
German Chancellor Angela Merkel met the Greek Prime Minister in Berlin today

995
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:41,510
and said she wants PR News in Washington.

996
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:50,730
Then revealed false important personal hench members dot com.

997
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:07,550
While the美元-era increasingly

998
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:07,850
controversial

999
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:14,750
Indo-Bolivianmoments match Clay Việt's

1000
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:14,750


1001
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,730
We're asked to bring a man they weren't interested in.

1002
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:18,650
Somebody brought Bob.

1003
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,210
And the rest is history.

1004
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,270
I love that.

1005
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,770
One woman's trash is another woman's treasure.

1006
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,710
When you go in in the morning, you say hi to everyone,

1007
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,950
and then for some reason throughout the day,

1008
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:38,430
you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them.

1009
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,110
If you walk in the morning, morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? Fine.

1010
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,390
You want to find Bob?

1011
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:42,850
Yes.

1012
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:44,710
And what made you think he'd be here?

1013
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:50,310
Well, this is a church, and people who believe go to church.

1014
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:51,250
Exactly.

1015
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:55,130
So why would he be here preaching to the choir?

1016
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,930
Shouldn't you be embracing my decision?

1017
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,610
Based upon what you've told me, no.

1018
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:06,070
Look, I'm sick and tired of people turning to Bob for the answer just because they've turned 30.

1019
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,130
No, I am not looking for answers. I just...

1020
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:09,890
Bob may be a woman. Did you ever think about that?

1021
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:12,350
What if he were female?

1022
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:13,470
What's your point?

1023
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:16,130
My point is, you could just be looking for a man.

1024
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,670
Having struck out on Earth, you're turning to the heavens.

1025
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,190
Why not start at the top?

1026
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:20,610
What?

1027
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:23,930
What kind of a wacko minister?

1028
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:27,110
I mean, I'm here looking for my holy savior.

1029
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,470
You're here because you have a void in your life.

1030
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:30,910
Is it spiritual? Is it emotional?

1031
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:32,550
It could be just sexual.

1032
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:33,610
And if that's the case...

1033
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,030
Oh, yes, I'm looking to make love to him.

1034
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,570
My friend Mary says he's amazing in the hay.

1035
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:37,990
You're looking for a husband, not Bob.

1036
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:40,310
What if you'd found some guy last week?

1037
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,030
Would you be here today?

1038
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,710
Or might you be...

1039
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:45,670
in a motel somewhere calling out Bob's name?

1040
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,730
Let me talk to her.

1041
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,270
He's not running a Lonely Hearts Club. Tell her that.

1042
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:57,610
You have to forgive our minister, Mr. Penishead.

1043
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:59,370
We just did a recent survey,

1044
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:03,410
and 70% of our single congregants join church to meet somebody.

1045
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:04,230
Ugh.

1046
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,070
He's frustrated.

1047
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,410
Oh, it's a lonely world.

1048
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:11,970
Time takes a cigarette.

1049
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,310
Put it in your mouth.

1050
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:21,270
You pull on a finger, then another finger, then a cigarette.

1051
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:25,130
The wall to wall is calling.

1052
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,130
It lingers, but you forget.

1053
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:30,710
Oh, no, no, no.

1054
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,930
You're rock and roll suicide.

1055
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:37,630
You're too old to lose it.

1056
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,070
You're too young to choose it.

1057
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:42,690
You're too young to choose it.

1058
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:42,690


1059
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:46,990
But the clock waits so patiently on your song.

1060
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:52,770
You'll walk back the cafe if you don't eat when you've lived too long.

1061
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,010
Oh, no, no, no.

1062
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,230
You're rock and roll suicide.

1063
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:05,750
Shepherds are snarling as you stumble across the road.

1064
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:12,210
But the day breaks instead, so you will be home.

1065
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:17,210
Don't let the sun glass your shadow.

1066
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:20,350
Let the milk floats ride your mind.

1067
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:25,250
It's unnatural, and blitzly unkind.

1068
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,250
Oh, no, little love, you're not alone.

1069
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,950
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair.

1070
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,710
Got your head all tangled up.

1071
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,090
Violently make you care.

1072
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,190
Oh, no, love, you're not alone.

1073
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:46,490
No matter what or who you've been.

1074
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:49,590
Got your head all tangled up.

1075
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:52,890
Analyzing to lacerate your brain.

1076
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:56,210
I've had my share to help you with the pain.

1077
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,190
You're not alone.

1078
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:04,430
Just turn on me and me.

1079
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:06,910
And you're not alone.

1080
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,770
So turn on me and me.

1081
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:12,050
And you're not alone.

1082
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:12,130
So turn on me and me.

1083
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:12,170
And you're not alone.

1084
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:13,550
And you're not alone.

1085
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:18,110
Give me your hands.

1086
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:20,190
And you're not alone.

1087
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:25,010
Give me your hands.

1088
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,850
And you're not alone.

1089
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,630
Give me your hands.

1090
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:33,750
And you're not long for.

1091
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:37,550
Give me your hands.

1092
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:55,930
How do you handle possibly now it may be time for somebody else to come along?

1093
00:56:56,510 --> 00:57:04,050
I've seen Bob drink human blood and consume human flesh and...

1094
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:08,350
How do you handle Bob?

1095
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,150
How do you handle him?

1096
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:10,830
I mean, what do you say to people?

1097
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:12,950
Do you just...

1098
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:17,910
What it is, it's a symbol of a phallus going into a vagina.

1099
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:25,690
And so that these people aren't human as we would know human, they've been pretty thoroughly demonized.

1100
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,830
We go back in time.

1101
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:30,890
You know, I know...

1102
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:31,610
Bob.

1103
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:34,610
No Bob, no slack.

1104
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:38,950
But no Bob, no slack.

1105
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,790
And thanks to Reverend...

1106
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:44,130
Wilhelm Stahlhelm for making that timely collage.

1107
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:48,010
Well, it was timely when I was assembling the show two weeks before you hear it.

1108
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,830
That's time control, see.

1109
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:57,210
And before that, that was the Duke of Uke live at 15X Day performing David Bowie's rock and roll suicide.

1110
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:59,610
Praise the Duke of Uke.

1111
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:02,830
And before that, a The Large collage.

1112
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:08,330
The music in the background right now is The Slot Rods live at 15X Day.

1113
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,350
And this show is The Hour of Slack.

1114
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:17,890
1,378 from the Church of the Subgenius as seen on TV and at subgenius.com.

1115
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:21,890
Which incidentally has roughly 30,000 pages.

1116
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:23,330
Praise Bob.

1117
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:26,630
And now from Lemur, something bad.

1118
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:30,570
From PR News in Washington, I'm even worse.

1119
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:31,150
Hello.

1120
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:35,990
But forecasters say in Colorado, Syria will be in Geneva for Stockton, California.

1121
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:39,110
Along with residents of the Air Force Academy.

1122
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:39,910
That's good.

1123
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:40,630
What's next?

1124
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:42,930
On Wall Street, 8115.

1125
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:44,930
This is PR News.

1126
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,590
I don't understand it.

1127
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:50,330
As PR's violence tells us, PR's continue to rage.

1128
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:51,930
PR News.

1129
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:52,390
PR News.

1130
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:53,030
PR News.

1131
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:53,210
Yeah.

1132
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:59,030
And stories and movie scripts like when Harry Met Heartburn in Seattle and many more.

1133
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:02,890
PR's reports say it's PR News, Washington.
