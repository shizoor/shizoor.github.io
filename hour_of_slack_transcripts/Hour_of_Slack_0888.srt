1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
Uh, yes, dear friends, this is Hour of Slack number 888.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,480
An auspiciously named show, don't you agree?

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:20,080
So auspicious that I'm going to celebrate and slack off by rerunning a show from WREK Atlanta.

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,360
Bob's Slacktime Funhouse with the Lymphnode Institute.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,740
In this case, their wonderful, salacious springtime sex.

6
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,020
Spectacular.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
I really enjoyed pre-screening it.

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,560
I patted it down real good.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,520
And, well, their choice of music is perfect.

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,960
And their in-between banter dada is even better.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,500
So, now.

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,340
Mommy, I want to ask you something.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,840
What is it, dear?

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,120
What I wonder is, how did the baby get started in this?

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,180
Let me tell you how it is.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,580
There's a special opening just in front of the place where you have your BM.

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,700
It's very, very tiny in a little girl, but as you grow, it grows too, right along with the rest of you.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,180
Until when you're grown up, it gets to be just about this size.

19
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,340
The special opening that little girls have.

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,500
The special opening that little girls have has a name, the penis.

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,200
Now, you know that little boys like our Johnny have a vagina.

22
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,740
When a boy grows up and is ready to be a father, he is able to put his vagina into the penis.

23
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,060
That special opening that mothers have.

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,600
Do you understand?

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,100
Yes, I think so.

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,940
But if I forget it, you can always tell me again.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,580
You're listening to Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.

28
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:52,920
Whee!

29
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,220
The Lymphnode Institute Edition.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,480
Edition.

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,200
Edition.

32
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,200


33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,340
Edition.

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,340


35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,340


36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,340


37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,340


38
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,340


39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,340


40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,940
Black Time Funhouse.

41
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,120
The Lymphnode Institute Edition.

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,860
Presents.

43
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,360
Presents.

44
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,060
Our salacious spring sex spectacular.

45
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,260
What?

46
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,920
Accidents happen.

47
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,560
Accidents do happen.

48
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,800
And on the subject of sex, that's how babies are made.

49
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,280
Babies are made with accidents.

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:09,780
Mm-hmm.

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,060
Often.

52
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,420
I spilled my seed.

53
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,620
I blasted my photon torpedo into her nebula.

54
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,660
Yeah, so in the 70s, they stopped being so puritanical about sex and did a lot of blow and got kind of naked dancing.

55
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,420
The pill.

56
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,900
Yeah, the pill facilitated that.

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,320
And then AIDS came in.

58
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,040
And it shut it down.

59
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,100
Your mother was a whore in the 70s.

60
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,200
Wow.

61
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,320
Really?

62
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,760
I don't know your mother.

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,600
It's just a general statement.

64
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,540
Casual sex, though.

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,660
Isn't that like, isn't all sex pretty much casual?

66
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,660
Unless you're Catholic.

67
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,080
I guess casual sex really just means...

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,360
Don't want to know your name.

69
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:45,800
Exactly.

70
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,360
Just give me the hole or the rod or whatever it is you're after.

71
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,380
Hey, you look like the gender I prefer.

72
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,060
Come on back.

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,580
Exactly.

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,420
If you multiple times you're always cartoons.

75
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,920
Too fucking exaggerated.

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:15,920


77
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,520
You know, I love her.

78
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,380
You love her.

79
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:18,380


80
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:18,840
I miss her.

81
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,380
I miss her.

82
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,020
One, two, three

83
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,620
By the duty of a Nick Roy

84
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,280
Don't

85
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,060
Come spread your tail on me

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,960
Wild wonder of a midnight

87
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,840
Forrest

88
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,100
Toss down your glossy

89
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,500
Wham

90
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,640
She's got me by the level

91
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,800
Sticking it out, sticking it out

92
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,840
Insinuating leather

93
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,060
Sticking it out, sticking it out

94
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,240
I think she broke my terror

95
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,960
Come on, come on

96
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,100
Keep on coming on now

97
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,420
The ladies on the television, I know they like sex

98
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,660
And if I just buy the product they associate with

99
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,440
You'll have sex

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,060
Apparently

101
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,100
With them or a woman much like them

102
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,420
Much like these beers you should be drinking

103
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,460
Hi there, what can I get you?

104
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,920
I would really like a water right about now

105
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,760
Oh, are you sure you would like a refreshing adult beverage?

106
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,420
Well, you've piqued my curiosity with your challenge to my order

107
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,200
What would you suggest?

108
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,560
How about a vertical smile beer?

109
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,080
Vertical smile beer?

110
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,480
Mmm, yes

111
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,080
A cold vertical smile beer

112
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,480
Yes

113
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,840
Satisfies when I'm hot

114
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,480
Yeah?

115
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,460
Oh yeah

116
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,940
And after two or three I begin to lose my inhibitions

117
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,660
Wow

118
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,240
Mmm

119
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,900
I love it when vertical smile hits the back of my throat

120
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,960
I'm overcome

121
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,440
I'll drink it all

122
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,100
Uh

123
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,480
A cold refreshing vertical smile satisfies me deep inside

124
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,180
You want one?

125
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,960
Are you implying that vertical smile will allow me to have sex with you and by extension all women?

126
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,380
Mmm

127
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,340
Are you getting thirsty for vertical smile?

128
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,500
You're really hot

129
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,300
So?

130
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,360
Do you want it?

131
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,500
I've lost my capacity for rational thought

132
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,100
I want it

133
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,860
You, I...

134
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,720
I want...

135
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,300
Smile, sex, beer

136
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,020
You got it, sure

137
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,160
Vertical smile, raise one to your lips

138
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,280
Meanwhile, at a popular bar

139
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
What can I get you, buddy?

140
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,300
I don't know

141
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,920
Something bothering you, pal?

142
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,860
Yeah, my girlfriend dumped me

143
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,300
Mmm

144
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,680
Now that's a shame

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,180
Say, friend

146
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,360
How'd you like to have two chicks at the same time?

147
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:44,720
What?

148
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,780
That's right, two chicks at the same time

149
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,880
The new adult beverage from the makers of Vertical Smile

150
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,300
What?

151
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,420
Vertical Smile, you say?

152
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,160
Well...

153
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,740
Here, chum

154
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,940
On the house

155
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,460
Aw, gee, thanks

156
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,280
Wow

157
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,040
It tastes like a hot redhead with big...

158
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,780
And a hot blonde with even bigger...

159
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,980
While I take her from...

160
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,200
All over those huge...

161
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,720
Like a...

162
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,900
Fire hose

163
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,760
Sure does, partner

164
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,900
You see, the brewers of two chicks at the same time

165
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,320
Use only the finest hops and barley

166
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,340
Cold, double-filtered

167
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,740
And aged in real oak barrels

168
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,200
For that hot girl-on-girl flavor

169
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,420
You can only get one other way

170
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,200
How likely is that?

171
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:15,880
Uh...

172
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,580
Not very?

173
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,380
Damn right

174
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,220
A guy like you?

175
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,040
Hey, I don't...

176
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,020
And the new wide-mouth bottle

177
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,400
Allows more of that adolescent fantasy-drenched flavor

178
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
To flow right into your insatiable face

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,920
Right, buckaroo?

180
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,200
Well, I...

181
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,500
You bet

182
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,420
Get out of your plain, ordinary beer

183
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,020
And get into two chicks at the same time

184
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,360
Can I take this bottle home?

185
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,520
Sure thing, amigo

186
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,860
You've earned it

187
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,900
So you see, Mr. Bungle

188
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,860
Film's spunging up your whole campaign

189
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,080
He's totally incompetent

190
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,840
Sleeper X commercials will be laughed off of television

191
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,560
If you approve his campaign

192
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,040
Well, that's very interesting

193
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,060
I never thought too much of film, now that you mention it

194
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,000
And I'm starting to think that's a good thing

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,000


196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
I'm starting my own agency, Mr. Bungle

197
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,320
I could do a hundred percent better job than that turkey

198
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,560
I'll bet you could

199
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,600
What you say is very interesting

200
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,620
In fact, you are very interesting

201
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,240
Oh, Mr. Bungle, I didn't know you were interested

202
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,140
And you will give me your account for my new agency?

203
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,920
Later

204
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,520
We'll talk business later

205
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,780
Right now I want to make a love to a beautiful

206
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,800
Beautiful body

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,500
I heard everybody get a set host ding-dong

208
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,580
Grab an egg while I run my walk

209
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,300
Don't let my sister see you dip in my pong

210
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,420
Give me a kiss, I'm an average French

211
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,080
And I'll tell you about the good, the good, the smart, and the less

212
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,760
Keep blowing my gong, cause here I come

213
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,300
Gonna get you all the secrets of my boy, yeah

214
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,680

Just a little friend, friend

221

With a fork and a spoon

222
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,600
I'm a friend of mine

223
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,560
I'll give you a friend, friend

224
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,640

And a bob and a face

226
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,740
With a fork and a spoon

227
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,920
I got yogurt meat, loaves, middle of my ass

228
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,620
Smoked in the interbars and a gift of the gas

229
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,380
Top of cream from the steaks and the Levi's cheese

I'm a zoo skaboos

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,720
Gonna give her a boost

236
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,400
Like a chicken project

237
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,560
Super goop, poop, goop, loop, loop

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,780
Cheeky goop, shorty boop

Top of the hippie jeans, please, please

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,180

And fuck your hoes

256
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,740
Its a long road

257
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,800
Searching the

258
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,220
Obstruction

We'll be right back.

00:10:51,020 --> 00:11:03,900
We'll be right back.

262
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,420
We'll be right back.

263
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,280
We'll be right back.

264
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,300
We'll be right back.

265
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,060
We'll be right back.

266
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,700
We'll be right back.

267
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,140
We'll be right back.

268
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,000
We'll be right back.

269
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,120
We'll be right back.

270
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,640
We'll be right back.

271
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,320
We'll be right back.

272
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,520
We'll be right back.

273
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,780
We'll be right back.

274
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,460
We'll be right back.

275
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,100
We'll be right back.

276
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,000
We'll be right back.

277
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,260
and then you have a really big sneeze

278
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,940
and the mucus goes all over the back of the girl's head.

279
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,460
It's a little like that.

280
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,960
At the same time, a spurt of quite thick, sticky stuff

281
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,820
comes from the end of the man's penis.

282
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
And this goes into the woman's vagina.

283
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,660
Or whatever.

284
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,140
Well, believe it or not,

285
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,900
this sticky stuff is how you and I all started.

286
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,380
It's called semen.

287
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,920
And in the semen are sperm.

288
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,420
And they make babies. The end.

289
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,580
And that's why your mother's a slut.

290
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,440
The End

291
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,720
I'm calling you

292
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,520
I'm calling you

293
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,480
I'm calling you

294
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,400
One, two, three

295
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,780
By the beauty of the necronom

296
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:16,400
Come spread your tail on me

297
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,760
For a wonder of a midnight forest

298
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,820
Toss down your glossy web

299
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,360
She's got me by the leather

300
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,300
Sticking it out, sticking it out

301
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,340
In simulated leather

302
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,520
Sticking it out, sticking it out

303
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,580
I think she broke my tether

304
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,680
Come on now, come on now

305
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,760
Keep on coming on now

306
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,340
And that brings us to your mother.

307
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,880
I'll tell you about my mother.

308
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,200
That zish, swilling whore.

309
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:06,740
Oh my.

310
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,460
Your mom talks like a bitch at least once.

311
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,440
Almost guaranteed.

312
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,680
Your mom and dad, I know you don't want to think about it,

313
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,560
but think about it.

314
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,640
They fop, nek-hop, nek-hop

315
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,920
like there's no tomorrow.

316
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,740
The happiest day of their lives

317
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,880
was when, when you left the house

318
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,380
so they could fop anywhere they wanted to.

319
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,040
Your parents are ingy-hop in your bed right now.

320
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,060
And their wife's swapping too, man.

321
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,560
Your dad's flying on wits and cuffs his mom.

322
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,120
And she's zis-flying on wits and cuffs dad.

323
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,960
Don't put me on, cause I'm on fire

324
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,280
And I can't quench my desire

325
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,520
Don't you know that I'm burning up for your love

326
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,820
You ain't convinced that dad is enough

327
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,540
I put myself in this position

328
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,720
And I presume he in position

329
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,140
But you know I'm alive

330
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,420
And there's something in my heart

331
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,380
It won't die

332
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,520
I'm burning up

333
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,380
I'm burning up

334
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,560
I'm burning up

335
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,040
I'm burning up

336
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,260
I'm burning up

337
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,240
Ooh, you're always closing the door

338
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,360
But that only makes me want you more

339
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,800
Day and night I hope for your love

340
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,060
You're unconfirmed that dad is enough

341
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,420
To justify my wanting you

342
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,700
Tell me what you want me to do

343
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm not lying, and I know

344
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,260
That you don't want to want me

345
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,500
But you can't let go

346
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,620
I'm burning up

347
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,220
I'm burning up

348
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,520
I'm burning up

349
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,480
I'm burning up

350
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,360
I'm burning up

351
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,300
You're a super-elmo-mese

352
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,580
But you know that's not a word you please

353
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,240
But like me, you're a super-elmo-mese

354
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,940
But you know there's nothing way to thank

355
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,340
I hate to say it, but I'm on fire

356
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,880
I'm burning up

357
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm burning up

358
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,580
I'm burning up

359
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,140
I'm burning up

360
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:40,240
I'm burning up

361
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,000
I want my gold

362
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,880
I want my gold

363
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,100
When you want to see me

364
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,140
Care all my needs

365
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,520
When you don't

366
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,420
The back is down

367
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,460
When you please

368
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,180
I'd like to hear

369
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,780
This after any day

370
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,680
I ain't the same

371
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,080
See I got no shame

372
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,220
I'm on fire

373
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,760
I'm on fire

374
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,300
I'm burning up

375
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,540
Fire

376
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,360
You'll notice that

377
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,260
we haven't made really

378
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,080
any mention of homosexuality.

379
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,400
So for the

380
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,260
purposes of our

381
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,080
homosexual listeners

382
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,580
man means top

383
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,360
and woman means bottom.

384
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,620
You know what's funny?

385
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,880
Is you can

386
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,580
sexualize anything

387
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,920
if you focus

388
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,000
on one thing

389
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,360
like Peggy Hill's

390
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,580
big sexy feet.

391
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,780
She's a cartoon character.

392
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,540
Yes she is.

393
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,540
That would be a fetish as well.

394
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:56,920
Oh yeah.

395
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,960
Cartoon characters.

396
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,840
Ask the Japanese

397
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,480
all about fetishizing.

398
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,620
Is that even a word?

399
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,240
It is now

400
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,100
cartoon character.

401
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,460
Lactating lasses.

402
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,540
Lactating lasses

403
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,560
and gob on me knobs.

404
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,720
Gob on me knobs.

405
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:07,960


406
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,340
Spring is here.

407
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,800
Of course

408
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,740
you know

409
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,800
variety is the

410
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,320
spice of squirt.

411
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,600
But I mean damn

412
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,060
if you spend all your time

413
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,940
in your house

414
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,140
watching videotapes

415
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,460
of whatever it is.

416
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,620
But you gotta go out

417
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,260
and get you some

418
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,280
or you will wind up

419
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,160
trying to draw

420
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,100
a happy face

421
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,040
with pipe bombs

422
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,300
on the map of the United States.

423
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,440
And that's not gonna

424
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,800
get you any

425
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,860
unless you're into

426
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,820
federal prisoners.

427
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,960
But yeah you can

428
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,060
get off on anything.

429
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,960
Golf balls.

430
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,820
Planes flying into buildings.

431
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,920
Ooh now.

432
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,140
I don't know if anybody

433
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,360
popped a chubby on that.

434
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:40,760
Well.

435
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,500
Not in this country.

436
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,160
With this next song.

437
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:43,900
Who what?

438
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,860
Is this filking?

439
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,420
Uh friends

440
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,520
and the only thing

441
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,400
sicker

442
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,560
than what the

443
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,400
networks

444
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,240
did

445
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,240
with it

446
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,260
is this

447
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,300
very very

448
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,100
strange

449
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,080
homage

450
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,160
or whatever

451
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,320
by

452
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,680
Chris

453
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,220
Corden.

454
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,400


455
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,880
I put my hand in my pocket.

456
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,640
What do I feel?

457
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,600
110 stories

458
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,280
of concrete and steel.

459
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,520
I like too much.

460
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,680
That plane shaped pole

461
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,380
really gets me high.

462
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,380
But the big ball of fire

463
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,900
is the money shot.

464
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,280
I like too much.

465
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,820
I like too much.

466
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,200
The plane going in.

467
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,360
I like too much.

468
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,940
The plane shooting out.

469
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,960
People dive into the street.

470
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,740
While I play with my meat.

471
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,440
My steel melted and my tower is coming down.

472
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,080
I'll be right back.

473
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,360
You're listening to Cronin.

474
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,360


475
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,360


476
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,360


477
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,520
The New York skyline.

478
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,220
Will never be the same.

479
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,420
But the guys who flew those planes.

480
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,060
Have an amazing aim.

481
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,020
I like too much.

482
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,360
I like too much.

483
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,360


484
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,360


485
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,360


486
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,360


487
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,360


488
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,360


489
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,360


490
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:38,640
I like too much.

491
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,320
There must have been a reason.

492
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,900
But I don't understand.

493
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,260
Why they hit the pentagon.

494
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,380
Instead of Disneyland.

495
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,780
I like too much.

496
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,440
I like too much.

497
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,240
I like too much.

498
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,800
I like too much.

499
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,660
The plane going in.

500
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,780
I like too much.

501
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,280
The flame shooting out.

502
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,420
It's raining broken glass.

503
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,160
While I sit on my ass.

504
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,360
I like too much.

505
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,900
My steel melted and my tower is coming down.

506
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,980
I like too much.

507
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:48,980


508
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:48,980


509
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:48,980


510
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:48,980


511
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,720
I almost had enough.

512
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,520
Of watching planes explode.

513
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,240
Until they showed it in reverse.

514
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,620
And I had too much.

515
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,280
I like too much.

516
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,820
I like too much.

517
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,200
Now my hands all sticky.

518
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,240
And I cannot find a rag.

519
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,360
I guess I'll have to use a rag.

520
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:08,360


521
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,940
The American flag.

522
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,100
I like too much.

523
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,700
I like too much.

524
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,460
I like too much.

525
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,020
I like too much.

526
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,880
The plane going in.

527
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,000
I like too much.

528
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,600
The flame shooting out.

529
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,580
People died into the street.

530
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,140
While I play with my.

531
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,400
My steel melted.

532
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,100
And my tower is coming down.

533
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,480
I like too much.

534
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,400
I like too much.

535
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,440
I like too much.

536
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,440


537
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,440


538
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,440


539
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,440


540
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,140
I like too much.

541
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,260


542
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,260


543
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,260


544
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,260


545
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,260


546
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,020
I like too much.

547
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,260
The somewhere in《Date of the World》

548
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:05,780
The most famous book about you.

549
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,380
The 같n dinner.

550
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,500
and steamer where you take a poo on someone's

551
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
chest. Yes, yes. There's all kinds of

552
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,740
dirty Sanchez. It's the dirty Sanchez.

553
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,700
Which where you smear the

554
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,300
fecal matter covered finger on the

555
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,380
girl's upper lip and give her the Sanchez

556
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:18,720
mustache.

557
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,300
And then there's where you plug the wrong hole

558
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,460
and she turns around to get mad at you and you deck

559
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,860
her and that's called a donkey punch.

560
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,260
The donkey punch, yes, yes. Not many

561
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,160
repeat customers after the donkey punch.

562
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,460
Well, if you're paying for it, who cares?

563
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,760
Pick a different model next time.

564
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,720
Then you're liable to get...

565
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,040
Pick a different what? I said model, but I didn't

566
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,800
mean that in like a beauty model. I meant that like a

567
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,320
model of car. I thought you said mom.

568
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,100
So who's got the problem now?

569
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,600
A lot of moms,

570
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,940
especially in the spring, because they know

571
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,940
the winter's coming and they need to start hoarding

572
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,940
food for the babies.

573
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,340
Storing semen for the babies.

574
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,440
Oh, we

575
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,860

576
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,180
We won't go, we won't

I

583
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,880
will never let you go.

584
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,400
So don't

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,940
you let your mother know.

586
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,260
Sugar

587
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,880
Bush, I love

588
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,400

589
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,860

Promise me

595
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,020
And I'll

596
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,480
come along with you.

597
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,860
Oh, we never not gonna

598
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,960

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,840

605
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,180

607
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,300
merrily.

608
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,960
Sugar Bush, come

609
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,820

610
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,700
Oh, we never not gonna go

611
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,860

00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,460
go phone, cause mother

614
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,320
isn't home. Oh, chocolate,

615
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,020
you are so sweet.

616
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,580
Yes,

617
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,040
yes, you I'd like to eat.

618
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:21,920
If

619
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,100
I do, oh, what a treat.

620
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,420
Chocolate,

621
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,980
you are so

622
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,900
sweet. Oh,

623
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,040
Sugar Bush, I love

624
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,500
you so.

625
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,740
And I will never

626
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,780
let you go.

627
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,820
Now don't you let

628
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,880
my mother know.

629
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,080
Sugar Bush,

630
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,160
I love

631
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,980
you so.

632
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,220
Sugar Bush, I love you so.

633
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,980
If your

634
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,860
parents did it in the springtime, which this

635
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,340
is our salacious spring

636
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,920
sex spectacular. If they were doing it in the

637
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,940
early spring, which is the beginning of April, the end of March,

638
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,260
that means the resultant

639
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,440
baby by the bad,

640
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,600
planning committee, would probably

641
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,660
be coming around about late December

642
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,840
or early January.

643
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,560
Which means that's when Jesus' parents knocked

644
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,400
boots. If in fact Jesus' birthday

645
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,740
was in December, which we know it wasn't, so

646
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,580
totally disregard what I just said.

647
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,580
Well, you can't totally disregard that because they

648
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,580
say it's when they say it is now

649
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,700
because they're trying to get all those pagans

650
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,860
involved. Saturnalia, yes.

651
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,280
And the pagans knew how to bust nut.

652
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,640
Oh, did they? Seven day orgy?

653
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,600
That's what Christmas used to be. I know we've discussed

654
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,640
this before, but Christmas used to be a day.

655
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,500
It used to be a seven day orgy.

656
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,740
They could not get the pagans to give up

657
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,400
the nut busting, so they said, well,

658
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,580
you can still bust the nuts, but

659
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,660
you must bust them for Jesus.

660
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
Eat of my flesh.

661
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,420
That was in December, so it doesn't fit our

662
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,400
spring sex spectacular.

663
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,540
That's the best time to

664
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,680
have an orgy with a woman in her third

665
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,420
trimester, is during the Saturnalia

666
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,620
orgies. Well, as Sid Barrett said, I'll do

667
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,360
my loving in the winter time.

668
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,420
I think. Because of the third

669
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,440
trimester and the free breast milk.

670
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,060
The old baby kick from the inside.

671
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,500
Normal couple after 35 years of marriage, trying to make

672
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,440
their sex life interesting. Don't be such an

673
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,480
ass face. Come on, all I want to do is get close

674
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:11,680
to you.

675
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,680
I heard they built this city on rock and roll on the radio

676
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,480
today, and that's our song, and it kind of made me think that

677
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,420
maybe we've gotten old and terrible like Jefferson

678
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,240
Airplane when they became Starship.

679
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,540
I kind of have a headache. Alright, I'm going

680
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:23,980
to the titty bar.

681
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,640
Oh, we're sitting next to you.

682
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,360
We're sitting next to you.

683
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,160
We're sitting next to you.

684
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:44,640
We're sitting next to you.

685
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,640
We're sitting next to you.

686
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,380
We're sitting next to you.

687
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,860
We're sitting next to you.

688
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,100
We're sitting next to you.

689
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,140
We're sitting next to you.

690
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,380
We're sitting next to you.

691
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,560
We're sitting next to you.

692
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,940
And I close

693
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,480
my eyes, and I'm

694
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,560
in orgasm

695
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,220
way.

696
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,420
It's a street

697
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,000
around the corner,

698
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,620
it's called orgasm

699
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,240
Baby, I've been working at the termite farm for 40 cycles, Mama.

700
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,980
I gots to have it.

701
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,960
I'm tired.

702
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:39,800
But if we don't reproduce, we get recycled into food for the cyworm, baby.

703
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,500
You know that!

704
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,260
I just can't, Gary.

705
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,200
Why don't you try the ass mule?

706
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,480
Oh, that gort couldn't get off a bicycle.

707
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,880
How many times has this happened to you?

708
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,360
Looking for love in the mutual exchange of pleasurable juices only to end up squeezing

709
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,920
your essence into the waste chute.

710
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,380
Well, do it the way the free men did it, with roofies.

711
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,960
General Pharmaceuticals.

712
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,240
Brand roofies provide hours of unfettered access to all of your partner's Orify without

713
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,440
that bothersome rigor mortis or embarrassing necrosis.

714
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,400
Let's see how Gary does with a couple of General Pharmaceutical brand roofies.

715
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,900
How's that drink I fixed you, baby?

716
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,700
That's good, baby.

717
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,960
So you want to get to the humping?

718
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,840
Well, all right then.

719
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,180
General Pharmaceutical brand roofies.

720
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,560
Ask for them by name.

721
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:32,940
General Pharmaceuticals.

722
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
Now in new seizure-free formula.

723
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,200
General Pharmaceuticals is a division of Glorp Co.

724
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,420
So you spent a lot of money on your date.

725
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:44,280
Took her out to a lot of fancy restaurants, hoping to get into her pants.

726
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,280
Springtime rolls around.

727
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,160
She becomes amorous and is interested in the pheromones you've been extruding.

728
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,180
Waft.

729
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,740
They put pheromones in perfume.

730
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,380
They put pheromones in McDonald's hamburgers.

731
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,420
Wait, those are hormones.

732
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,560
Whoop whoop.

733
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,520
Hey, make a hormone.

734
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,660
Put sand in the hamburger.

735
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,240
Oh, a moan in pain, right.

736
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:03,860
Ugh.

737
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:21,060
Oh, baby there's something inside me That wants to be inside me

738
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:27,520
Oh, baby there's something besides me that I just can't resist

739
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,640
Oh, baby there's a soul in me that wants to be inside me

740
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:31,640


741
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:31,640


742
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:31,640


743
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,760
song in my heart

744
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,580
and the words just won't go away

745
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,260
Oh baby there's

746
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,020
so much more that

747
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,120
I pray

748
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,060
for

749
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,460
Oh

750
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,440
Oh

751
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,140
Oh

752
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,220
Oh

753
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,260
Oh

754
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:54,260


755
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
Oh

756
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,280
Oh

757
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,280


758
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,680
Oh

759
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,220
Break it

760
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:22,920
Break it

761
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,840
Wait baby there's a chip in my neck

762
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,560
that tells me where

763
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,440
I'm going

764
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,420
little

765
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,220
Oh baby, there's a spring in my step

766
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,160
Cause I'm here, and I'll be with you

767
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,860
Oh baby, don't you know

768
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,760
The words I say just must be true

769
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,340
Oh baby, what I'm trying to say is

770
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,820
I can't spell you out

771
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:28,320
I can't spell you out

772
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,060
Why would they do that?

773
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,740
Why wouldn't they just have the dad work for the daughter?

774
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,660
I have no idea

775
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,280
They couldn't get that hedonist, but they'll take a turkey baster and do it?

776
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,740
Well, you know, it's all fun until the inbreeding starts

777
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,700
They said recently there's a study that determined that first cousins could do it in relative safety

778
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,340
Man, I wish I'd known that

779
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,320
I got first cousins all over the place

780
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,640
But no, was I touching them?

781
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,780
No, not on this coast

782
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,000
Hell, I'd move

783
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,760
Metamist, not for her

784
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
I'm gonna have you be in this world

785
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,420
I'm gonna have you be in this world

786
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:58,420


787
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:28,420
I'm gonna have you be in this world

788
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:58,420
I'm gonna have you be in this world

789
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,680
I'm gonna have you be in this world

790
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:17,340
I'm gonna have you be in this world

791
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:21,460
Hey, little Miss Snowball

792
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,180
Well, now there's so much you and me can discover

793
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,200
And I think we should start

794
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:28,420
I think we should start

795
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:58,420
I think we should start

796
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:58,820
I think we should start

797
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,760
Wandering through a big plant orgy

798
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,360
A big vegetable gangbang

799
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,120
Stamen

800
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,420
Pistols

801
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,220
Plug the stamen

802
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,180
Plug the pistol

803
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,900
I wonder if plants have fetishes

804
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,100
Just Venus Fly

805
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:12,740
I don't know

806
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,100
Venus Flytrap from WKRP in Cincinnati

807
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,040
Was a man and not a plant

808
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,880
Yeah, those things aren't really teeth

809
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,820
They feel good

810
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,680
I like those afrocombs

811
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,020
That's my fetish

812
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:24,980
Afrocombs?

813
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,260
No

814
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,200

Don't stop doing it, don't stop doing it!

Non-stop sex dirt.

845

Non-stop sex dirt.

846
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,440

C.B. Sage

857
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,760
As you've probably well noticed,

858
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,280
many of the major control outfits of this world

859
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,480
use sex as their primary weapon against you,

860
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,360
making these ridiculous demands of you

861
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,860
to not have sex,

862
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,300
or wait many years between sex,

863
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,340
or only have sex when you want a baby.

864
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,460
That's insanity.

865
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,440
Wait till you're married,

866
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,560
but then these same people,

867
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,520
or the same agents of this organization,

868
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,700
or those organizations,

869
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,140
will assault little boys in confessionaries.

870
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,160
I think that's a valuable lesson

871
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,820
on what happens when you can't get off.

872
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,020
You gotta squirt.

873
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,000
I mean, it's just,

874
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,920
you gotta poop, you gotta pee, you gotta squirt.

875
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,080
That's just how it is, folks.

876
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,020
Yeah, what's the Maslow's hierarchy needs?

877
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,620
You need a treehouse,

878
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,160
and a big red fire engine.

879
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,560
And then something to park your Maserati in,

880
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,820
as Ted Nugent would say.

881
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,320
That's exactly what the Nuge would say.

882
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:24,840
Yes.

883
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,840
What would the Nuge do?

884
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,780
And the Barbie doll to ride a straddle your big stallion.

885
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:30,380
Yeah!

886
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,900

887
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,920

Full Cervix Sting!

889
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,420
and auto-erotic ass fixation

890
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,340
comes a ball-buster of a summer vid feature.

891
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,480

892

starring J.J. Coolsie as Ghetto Geppetto,

893
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,340
the robot mechanic who keeps Humpbot

894
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,740
equipped with all the latest erotic attachments

895
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,560

905
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,120
Industrial strength lubrication from concentrate.

Just add water and dive on in.

Available in 10-ounce and 20-ounce sizes.

908
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,260
And for those special occasions,

909
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,740
there's even a jumbo-sized economy two-gallon party pack.

910
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,760
Hydro Lube

911
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,740

913
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,300
can't get enough of your love, babe.

00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:40,900
Oh, babe.

915
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,800
Girl, I don't know how...

916
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,160
But a beauty of an egg boy,

917
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:48,560

921
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,520

923
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,380

Oh, you like that, don't you?

936
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,540
Yeah, take it. Take it.

937
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,020
He's back in the army.

938
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,800
Oh, yeah.

939
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,280
That's the stuff.

940
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,660
Okay, I'm getting my second wind here.

941
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,640
All right.

942
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,400

943
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,860
Oh, me like. Me like a lot.

944
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:40,020
Oh, you can't get love like that back in the States.

00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,120
Yes!

947
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,080
Cut it out.

948
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,260
Come on.

949
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,340
Cut it.

950
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,220
Cut it.

951
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,940
You've been listening to Bob's Slack Time Funhouse,

952
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,100
the Lentone Institute edition on 91.1 FM,

953
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,460
WRIK Atlanta, the voice of the students of Georgia Tech.

954
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,520
It is now that time.

955
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,680
The Church of the Subgenius has a new P.O. box.

956
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,540
No, it does not.

957
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,620
Yes, it does.

958
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,480
They moved the whole damn thing to Austin.

959
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,540
And I can't tell you what the damn P.O. box is because...

960
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,180
Is that where Jesus is?

961
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:27,720
Yeah.

962
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,280
They can't forward the address?

963
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,640
They're keeping the box.

964
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:31,980
In case.

965
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:32,500
They'd better.

966
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:36,180
Because the only P.O. box I know is 14030.

967
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:39,860
406 Dallas, Texas 75214.

968
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,340
Couldn't begin to tell you what the P.O. box in Austin is.

969
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,880
I wrote it on a Post-it note.

970
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,100
I put it in my wallet.

971
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,440
I took it out of my wallet.

972
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,960
I have no idea where it is.

973
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:56,180
So go to www.subgenius.com if you really need the new Subgenius P.O. box in Austin.

974
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:03,360
And be sure to visit us online again at www.lymphnodeinstitute.com.

975
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,420
That's L-Y-M-P-H-N-O-D-E.

976
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,560
E-I-N-S-T-I-T-U-T-E.

977
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,920
Another fine Lympnode production.

978
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:18,820
Contact us at P.O. box 670-541 Marietta, Georgia 30066-0126.

979
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:23,540
Or www.lymphnodeinstitute.com.

980
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,040
Listen to Bob's Slack Time Funhouse at WREK.org.

981
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,440
91.1 FM WREK Atlanta.

982
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,820
No, we don't talk about Bob a lot.

983
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,280
But we're more of the advanced Subgenius show.

984
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,300
We're entertainment.

985
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,680
We're entertainment for the Yetis.

986
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,520
I'm personally not interested in recruiting another single person.

987
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,580
Since X-Day could basically happen at any second or in a thousand years.

988
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,460
Just don't know.

989
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,180
So, I mean, there's only so many seats in those escape vessels.

990
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:56,980
And I'm not in the mood to be sitting next to some little Bobby who's, you know, just joined on six months ago.

991
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,080
Waving his card around.

992
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,520
Spewing the goddamn buzzwords.

993
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,020
I don't have time for it.

994
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,420
They won't make the escape vessels.

995
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,740
I don't think it's the card carrying that necessarily.

996
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,560
It dictates you'll get on the ship.

997
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,160
It's the DNA.

998
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:08,580
Hmm?

999
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,060
Yeah.

1000
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,560
If you got it, you got it.

1001
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:10,840
There we go.

1002
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:11,960
If you got it, you got it.

1003
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,660
It's very, what is that, the Calvinist view?

1004
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,200
Calvin and Hobbes?

1005
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,780
Those who will be on the escape vessel, their names are already written in the book of the Exist.

1006
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,140
So there's no need to really do anything different.

1007
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,540
You're either going or you're not.

1008
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,460
Well, we're not witnessing.

1009
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:30,880
But I just think that if you can make a couple of close-minded people open up their perception a little bit.

1010
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:31,240
Ah.

1011
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,840
Maybe open up those legs a little bit.

1012
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,740
Let us get some springtime sex action.

1013
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,760
Sex action?

1014
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,840
Who sings sex action?

1015
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:38,940
L.A. Guns.

1016
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,200
We should play sex action.

1017
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,160
Sex action.

1018
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,380
Have another tequila, baby.

1019
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,680
Just chill out.

1020
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:44,920
That's good.

1021
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,200
Sex action.

1022
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,080
Sex action.

1023
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,600
Sex action.

1024
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,340
Oh.

1025
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,580
Oh.

1026
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:07,120
Oh.

1027
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:15,720
Oh.

1028
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:28,540
Oh.

1029
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:33,860
Oh.

1030
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:35,340
Oh.

1031
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:35,380
Oh.

1032
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:35,600
Oh.

1033
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:35,640
Oh.

1034
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:35,700
Oh.

1035
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:36,960
Say that you

1036
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,120
Baby knows

1037
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,780
Wherever she goes

1038
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,480
She's like

1039
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,940
Say that you

1040
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,920
How's it baby

1041
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,720
I got the potion

1042
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,620
You're a cool operator

1043
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,640
Got the first in the potion

1044
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,760
Now we're all alone

1045
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,600
Doing all the talking

1046
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,180
She's got me on the back

1047
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,960
Let her figure through the walls

1048
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,800
We can talk about love

1049
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,080
Talk about love

1050
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,360
Here she comes

1051
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,620
Never get enough of her

1052
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,960
Sensations

1053
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,220
Baby knows

1054
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,840
Wherever she goes

1055
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,580
She's got

1056
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,920
Sensations

1057
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,040
Talk about love

1058
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,300
Talk about love

1059
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,560
Here she comes

1060
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,660
Never get enough of her

1061
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,200
Sensations

1062
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,920
Ask me that

1063
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,240
Who's next

1064
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,040
They say

1065
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,360
Sensations

1066
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,920
And it all

1067
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,860
Always fails

1068
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:05,840
Some

1069
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:07,900
Girl

1070
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,180
Girl she got a star

1071
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,620
Boy she got a fleece

1072
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,960
She's knocking them dead

1073
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,880
She got me down on my knees

1074
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,940
Now listen

1075
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,060
I'm a sex gun lover

1076
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,700
In the heat of the night

1077
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,460
Star of a cover

1078
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,260
I got you in my sight

1079
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,260
Talk about love

1080
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,900
Talk about love

1081
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,320
Talk about love

1082
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,760
And here she comes

1083
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,980
But never get another fat

1084
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,300
Sensations

1085
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,640
The baby knows

1086
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,340
Wherever she goes

1087
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:46,840
To be

1088
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,340
Sensations

1089
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,100
S-E-X

1090
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,880
I know whose next door

1091
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,220
Sensations

1092
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,460
The baby knows

1093
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,180
Wherever she goes

1094
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,300
T'know what it gets

1095
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,900
Sensations!

1096
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:03,900
S-E-X

1097
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:03,900

Now the leading...

1119
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:47,220
I thought that was delicious.

1120
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,720
I like the part where the sex happens.

1121
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,560
In the springtime, there's nothing I like more than hot.

1122
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,960
gooey sucks.
