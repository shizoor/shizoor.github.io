1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Nay, nay, I'm afraid not.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,620
Wish it was.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,740
Thanks, Robert.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,940
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,360
Robert, on the way over here, I was scanning the radio dials,

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,740
and I must say that, as far as I'm concerned, you had the best hour in Dallas.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,440
Thank you very much.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,920
For the next hour, sit quietly, and we will control all that you see and hear.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,960
Turn on the machine.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,840
This is Radio Yerevan.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,540
Wake up, puppet boy!

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:52,100
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,320
which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,940
There is...

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,020
There is absolutely no other possibility.

You are about to participate in a great adventure.

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,600
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

The Subgenius Hour of Sight.

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,420
What?

22
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,320
Welcome, potential initiates.

23
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,340
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

24
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,760
Gosh.

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,340
The practice of hallucinatory drugs was big back in then,

26
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,740
and they were hearing these messages that the Beatles were placing backwards.

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:14,960


28
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,820
What?

29
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,340
What?

30
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:18,700
What?

31
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,340
What?

32
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,760
What?

33
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:21,880
What?

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,000
What?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,520
What?

36
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,420
What?

37
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,420


38
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,500
What?

39
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:29,800
What?

40
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:29,820


41
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:29,820


42
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,240
Oh, yes, dear friends.

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,320
This is the Church of the Subgenius.

44
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,140
Hour of Slack number 51.

45
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,840
The long-awaited Subgenius anti-drug special.

46
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,440
Part one.

47
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,020
Take one.

48
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,880
This one's for Dr. X.

49
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,660
May he rest in peace.

50
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,560
Now, you're saying,

51
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,000
now, Reverend Stang, what is this?

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,460
The Subgenius anti-drug special?

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,160
What is it?

54
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,720
The Church of the Subgenius joining with the conspiracy

55
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,680
on its big fad of anti-drug mega-hype

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,160
and holier-than-thou witch-burning?

57
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,500
And I answer, nay, nay.

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,940
This is the anti-mega-hype we're hyping.

59
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,200
Not that we've ever condoned drug addiction.

60
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,780
Of course not, friends.

61
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,900
This is a church.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,120
The only drug you need is Bob, my friend.

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,140
Bob will get you high and keep you there.

64
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,700
No, we're just anti-certain drugs,

65
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,560
just like the conspiracy is.

66
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,480
They only hate the drugs that they're not on.

67
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,360
Death to pushers.

68
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,040
That's what Ronald and Nancy, if that really is her name,

69
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,500
Reagan, say.

70
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,660
Death to pushers.

71
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,180
Oh, yeah.

72
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,720
And yet, dear friends,

73
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,960
they continue to use the United States government

74
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,260
to support the tobacco industry

75
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,280
and the alcohol industry.

76
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,660
Oh, oh, but we're only against drugs, they say.

77
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,380
There's nothing wrong with being able to have

78
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,160
a little drinky-winky now and then, is there?

79
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,640
And one cigarette never killed anybody

80
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,660
unless it's lit right next to a leaky tank full of church air.

81
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,700
That's what we're doing.

82
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,720
That's what Ronald Reagan says.

83
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,380
Oh, death to marijuana pushers,

84
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,720
but subsidize the tobacco industry

85
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,740
and the liquor industry.

86
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,600
Oh, friends,

87
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,020
you know, lips that have touched the bottle

88
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,480
will never touch mine,

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,020
though I do partake occasionally

90
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,100
of the holy frop admixture

91
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,240
prescribed by my personal physician,

92
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,860
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

93
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,060
But like Bob himself said,

94
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,680
I frop that others may live.

95
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,660
And, friends, frop ain't one of those conspiracy street drugs.

96
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,000
Uh-uh, but we'll be talking about frop later,

97
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,960
maybe even next week.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,480
I know, I know y'all want to know what frop really is

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,280
and how to get you some,

100
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,100
but we're just going to have to listen.

101
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,420
You're going to have to listen real, real close

102
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,260
in stereo headphones tonight, friends,

103
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,560
if you even want to gain butt.

104
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,860
An inkling.

105
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,100
An inkling.

106
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,200
Drugs have become an escape

107
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,020
for a nation of ignored youth.

108
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,160
Many parents too busy to stop,

109
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,180
listen,

110
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,180
and love.

111
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,340
Yes.

112
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,540
Yes.

113
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,200
Yes.

114
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:56,720
Yes.

115
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,060
Yes.

116
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,160


117
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:57,380


118
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:57,460
Yes.

119
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,500
Yes.

120
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:57,600
Yes.

121
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:57,840
Yes.

122
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


123
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


124
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


125
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


126
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


127
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


128
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


129
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


130
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,280
Yes.

131
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:58,680


132
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,760
Yes.

133
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,300
Yes.

134
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:03,420
Yes.

135
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,900
Yes.

136
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,520
Yes.

137
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:07,960
Yes.

138
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,240
Yes.

139
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:15,620


140
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,580
Yes.

141
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:16,780
Yes.

142
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,720
Yes.

143
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,560
Yes.

144
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,160
Yes.

145
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,060
Yes.

146
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,060


147
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,260
Yes.

148
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,900
Yes.

149
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,120
Yes.

150
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,100
Yes.

151
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,720
Hi there, Mrs. Darvon.

152
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,940
Okay.

153
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,640
And so she found the answer to her question by herself.

154
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,340
Okay.

155
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,500
Bye.

156
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,460
Here comes Mrs. Darvon again in her nice soft dress.

157
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,600
Hi, Mr. Belliam.

158
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,900
Hi.

159
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,720
Well, today we're going to make sure that everybody feels okay.

160
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,600
That's right.

161
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,280
Yes.

162
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,960
They're eating Kool-Aid and pills.

163
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,940
Yeah, well, Mrs. Belliam, how well I'm sad today.

164
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,360
Pills.

165
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,960
Pills for the bad and pills for the good.

166
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,420
Pills for the young and misunderstood.

167
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,320
Pills.

168
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,300
Pills.

169
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,660
I'm talking about pills now.

170
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,380
Pills.

171
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,380
Well, pills in my hamper, pills in my socks.

172
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,380
Pills in my woods and pills on the rocks.

173
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,200
Yeah, pills.

174
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,560
Pills.

175
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:54,860
Pills.

176
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,940
I'm talking about pills.

177
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,800
Pills now.

178
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,460
Pills.

179
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,700
Pills.

180
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,740
Pills.

181
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:00,940
Pills.

182
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,360
Pills always tell me things to do.

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,620
Pills are better friends than you.

184
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,580
Yeah, pills.

185
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,680
Pills.

186
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:10,700
Pills.

187
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,160
I'm talking about pills now.

188
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,780
Pills.

189
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,660
My friends, the pills.

190
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,280
Oh, just give me some of them pills.

191
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,380
Oh, give me those pills, Bob.

192
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:20,940
Pills.

193
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,220
Here, have some pills.

194
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,840
Pills.

195
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,620
Pills.

196
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,680
And take some more of these pills in the morning.

197
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,980
More pills.

198
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,740
And that's just the sort of thing I was talking about exactly, gentlemen.

199
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,120
Ladies and gentlemen, hello to you in Dallas, Texas.

200
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:46,720
This is the secret Reverend Bleepo Abernathy speaking to you over the airwaves of your local radio station there,

201
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:55,040
courtesy of Stang and the Reverend Bucknaked, for which I'm glad to present this opportunity to myself to speak at this time.

202
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,700
First of all, I want to say that none of the pills are ever good enough, as you all know.

203
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:08,200
And as you're out there, you know, you cannot feel anything without some sort of pill.

204
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:15,300
Now, that pill could be, of course, you know, your average, you know, vitamin or dexatrim or something like that.

205
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Or it can be Jesus.

206
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,000
It's any kind of pill that you mention at all.

207
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,260
We don't want to get too specific here.

208
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,080
But let's just face it, friends.

209
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,520
You're all looking for a pill.

210
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,220
And I don't know.

211
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,940
I don't know.

212
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,820
We're not talking a quart of pills.

213
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,140
We're talking a bucket of pills.

214
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,260
Some people relate to half an old-fashioned bathtub full of pills.

215
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,880
Like, sometimes, I don't know how much quarts of pills go for in Dallas right now.

216
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,620
I think in New York, you can get about a half a handful of pills for what, like, a pint of pills might cost you in Austin or Chicago.

217
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
But we're in Dallas now, so we're talking quarts of pills.

218
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,660
But this is just...

219
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,860
Heliopters full of pills.

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,940
These are all legal.

221
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,760
They're not drugs.

222
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,680
These are herbs.

223
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,380
They've been smuggled in by Tibetan llamas, which have been working for Bob for centuries.

224
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,680
I heard they put them on the bellies of sea turtles at one point.

225
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,640
They'd fit them in the Atlantic.

226
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,280
They put them on...

227
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,320
A seven-year voyage.

228
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,500
They put them on your tongue.

229
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,500
They put them on...

230
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,120
They might put them on...

231
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,400
...mongooses.

232
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,000
They put them on your nose.

233
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,060
You can put them in your shoes.

234
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,780
And Bob makes the best pills ever once made.

235
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,400
Yeah!

236
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,340
Yeah!

237
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,760
Yeah!

238
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,500
You get them pills!

239
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,500


240
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,260
You get them pills!

241
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:27,860
Yeah!

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,740
And you feel...

243
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,560
You feel wise.

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,640
Your heart feels wise.

245
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,180
You're buying.

246
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,160
And you know that you're the only one, and the rest of them are wrong, and you're the

247
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,980
only one that's right.

248
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,680
And that's how you're supposed to feel, because you got the pills of Bob in you.

249
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,360
That's right.

250
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,960
Possess these children with the fire of thy holy way.

251
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,660
Fill them with the blood of your passion.

252
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:59,340
That will enable their weak spirits to move in pursuit of your holy work.

253
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,600
Our children are faced with the peer pressure of taking drugs and drinking alcohol.

254
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,520
It is readily available.

255
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,820
The effects are devastating.

256
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:16,840
And I walked into the family room, and the family was watching the TV set with their

257
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,520
back to me.

258
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,540
And then I started firing a rifle.

259
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,640
And I was like, I'm going to die.

260
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:23,640


261
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:23,640


262
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:23,640


263
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,380
And I was standing behind my dad.

264
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,720
And I shot him.

265
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,600
Through the head?

266
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,740
Yes.

267
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,000
And then right away?

268
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,740
Almost instantly, my mother.

269
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,060
This would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.

270
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,260
Can you spare some cutter, me brothers?

271
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,380
Go on!

272
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,620
Do me in your bed!

273
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:53,620


274
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:53,620


275
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:53,620


276
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,720
I'm a bastard, cowards!

277
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,260
We don't want to live anyway.

278
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,380
Not in a stinking world like this!

279
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,160
Oh?

280
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,720
And what's so stinking about it?

281
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,700
It's a stinking world because there's no law nor there anymore.

282
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,000
It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old.

283
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,340
Look at you, darling.

284
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,480
Oh, it's no world for an old man any longer.

285
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,540
What's talked about water is it at all?

286
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,880
Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth.

287
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:36,260
And there's not no attention paid to earthly law nor there no more.

288
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,220
Oh, oh, dear little lad.

289
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,460
I fought for thee and more.

290
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,220
In the U.S. today, one of every ten,

291
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,940
high school seniors uses marijuana daily.

292
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,720
Thirty-five percent of all students use drugs at least once a month.

293
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,800
It isn't all the illicit, illegitimate market that's the problem.

294
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,820
We have a panacea in America that is a pill to solve every problem.

295
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,880
The farmer, he got wild.

296
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,320
The bricklayer got plastered.

297
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,820
The mechanic, he got tanked.

298
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,720
And the construction worker got blasted.

299
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:43,580
And daddy beat up mommy and broke her collarbone for good luck.

300
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,040
And everybody's drunk.

301
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,960
And everybody's wasted.

302
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,360
And everybody's drinking on the job.

303
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,300
The garbage man got trashed.

304
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,400
The janitor got messy.

305
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,260
The taxi driver got smashed.

306
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,020
And the waitress, she got tipsy.

307
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,400
In Kansas City, New York City,

308
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,280
the great big city,

309
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,720
the itty bitty city now,

310
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,780
everybody's drunk.

311
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,860
And everybody's wasted.

312
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,340
And everybody's drinking on the job.

313
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,020
Well, there's a whole lot of places that I ain't been.

314
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,040
A whole lot of things that I ain't seen.

315
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,620
A whole lot of things I'll never be.

316
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,860
The generation that would change the world is still looking for its car keys.

317
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,040
Whoo!

318
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,300
The terrorists got bombed!

319
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,360
The president got hit!

320
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,100
Security was tight

321
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,840
Yeah, the Secret Service got lit

322
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:58,520
The FBI, CIA, DWI, USA

323
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,900
Everybody's drunk

324
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,800
And everybody's wasted

325
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,340
And everybody's stoned

326
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,520
And there's nothing that's gonna change it

327
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,660
Cause everybody's drunk

328
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,580
And everybody's wasted

329
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:26,020
And everybody's drinking on the job

330
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,900
Me, I'm just frothing on the job

331
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,540
And lucky to be doing that, friends

332
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:38,980
Yeah

333
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,140
Cause since they've had this crackdown on crack

334
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,680
They have succeeded in true conspiracy fashion

335
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,920
In making it so you can't get anything but crack

336
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,020
I wonder why that is

337
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,380
Actually, you can't even get crack in Dallas

338
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,600
You get plenty of cocaine

339
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,660
Oh yeah, cheaper never

340
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,260
Cause coke, like most of these other drugs

341
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,860
Lights up that little spot in your brain

342
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,320
That would normally be lit up by sand

343
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,180
I won't do it here

344
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,080
Cause your American business is still up there

345
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,280
Would you have figured it out with this mouthpiece?

346
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,280


347
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,740
The bébé moi

348
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:17,740


349
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,900
And Cap einige kuci

350
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,320
No, sorry, will you please transmitted?

351
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,320


352
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,480
that a mighty undiluted, unneagified squirt will flood that spot with,

353
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,200
with just the right juices from just the right glands.

354
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,120
But, but, since to read that good book takes days,

355
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,760
you've got to be in the right place at the right time for that song to have the effect.

356
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,540
If you're going to get it through sex, well, that takes at least five minutes,

357
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,840
and often you have to take them out to dinner.

358
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,840
But, my God, you can just go out and spend some money,

359
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,360
and in no time at all you can light up that little spot,

360
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,240
just as soon as you can get back in your car, baby.

361
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,080
Just as soon as you can get you a sample.

362
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,820
Fire that booger up, boy.

363
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,920
What else do you need?

364
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:29,300
Why would there be any need for noble feelings for all mankind,

365
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,760
or even any sense of human decency whatsoever?

366
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,700
Why would?

367
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:34,820
Why would?

368
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,220
Why would there be any need for anything but to light up that spot in that brain?

369
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,620
And when you get those headsets,

370
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,800
where you just tape a little pad to either side of your temple,

371
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,240
one in the front and one in the back on a shaved place on your head,

372
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,220
and you have that little control in your pocket with a battery in it,

373
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,240
as long as you've got you a $1.98 9-volt battery in that thing,

374
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,700
you can crank it up to 5, to the 5 marker on the dial,

375
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,360
and feel mighty damn good.

376
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,780
Turn it up to 10, and you'll never turn it off.

377
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,320
There'd better be somebody standing by.

378
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,840
It's anywhere past 6 on the infinite control with knob,

379
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,980
and you're not going to turn it off.

380
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,460
You're not going to, friend.

381
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,820
You might turn it off for a second, but it would hurt.

382
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,820
It would hurt to turn it down, even to turn it down.

383
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,020
And once you've felt that 10 setting,

384
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,860
you're not going to want to live with anything else.

385
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,820
You're going to be crying a year later,

386
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,360
for the 11 setting.

387
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,880
You're going to be begging.

388
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,520
Oh, you'll be reading all the catalogs,

389
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,000
waiting for that breakthrough that'll give you an 11 on that control.

390
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,360
Oh, yes siree.

391
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,520
You think they got a drug problem now?

392
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,860
You think there's a drug problem in the United States,

393
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,560
in the whole world now?

394
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,940
Oh, mark my words, ye sinners.

395
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,620
Wait until you get some electronics involved, baby.

396
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,980
You think those computer whizzes got rich quick.

397
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,740
Wait until they invade.

398
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,380
They're going to invent the head zapper.

399
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,560
Oh, it's my head, you'll say.

400
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,640
It's my head.

401
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,100
That's all you'll be able to say.

402
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,140
Every song will be the song,

403
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,640
It's my head.

404
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,220
That'll be the only awareness you need.

405
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,480
It's just between you, your head, and your control.

406
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,420
Your pleasure center stimulator control.

407
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,080
Oh, yeah.

408
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,760
Oh, yeah.

409
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,820
You'll be like a monkey in a cage,

410
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,960
sitting in a pool of his own saliva.

411
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,740
That's right.

412
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,720
Because once you feel number 10,

413
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,160
you ain't going to,

414
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,740
you can kiss what you now know as reality.

415
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,140
Goodbye, baby.

416
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,380
Yes, and after a while, even the 10 starts to feel like pain.

417
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,780
But you can't go looking for the 11 button,

418
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,120
because you can't get up.

419
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,000
You've been there too long, because you're dead.

420
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,880
You're a ghost that died while it was high.

421
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,740
Yep, yep.

422
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
If you die when you're high, my friend,

423
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,700
your spirit becomes a wandering shade.

424
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,860
Wandering, trying to score for eternity.

425
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,880
Or at least until a subgenius priest comes along

426
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,740
and sends it spanking back to where it originally came from.

427
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,380
My God, and here I am, running out of gas.

428
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,020
You're always going to run out sooner or later.

429
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,020
That's what you got to remember.

430
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,220
Too much, oh, yeah.

431
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,540
Too much is always better than not enough.

432
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,880
Till you run out.

433
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,540
And you will, friend.

434
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,300
You'll run out of that church air right when you least expect it.

435
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Right when you thought you had all the church air in the world.

436
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,940
Oh, yeah.

437
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,440
Oh, yeah.

438
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,160
Oh, I had all the church air in the world.

439
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,280
But, but, but, Negi has it now.

440
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,300
Oh, you'll scream, you'll cry, you'll wail and gnash your teeth,

441
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,820
and you'll wish you could die.

442
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,940
You'll wish you could die, but you can't.

443
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,660
You can't die, because your terror keeps you alive

444
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,300
and manufactures just enough church air for you not to die,

445
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,640
but just to keep needing more.

446
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:18,020
You're going to be ready for the finals in 1998, my friend.

447
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,940
Let there be slack.

448
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,680
You know I've seen a lot of people walking around

449
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,780
with tombstones in their eyes.

450
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,840
But the pussy don't care.

451
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,860
Oh, if you live or if you die.

452
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,400
God damn.

453
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,440
Mm-mm, the pussy.

454
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,920
God damn.

455
00:22:59,920 --> 00:22:59,920


456
00:22:59,920 --> 00:22:59,920


457
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,800
Oh, my boy, if it's drugs you want, the old doctor can help you out.

458
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,540
Right this way.

459
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,780
Get your hands off me.

460
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,660
I don't want to leave.

461
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,340
Then roll up your arm and bend over.

462
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,120
Do you want regular or premium?

463
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,680
Oh, this is ridiculous.

464
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,600
You guys are nothing but a pack of cards.

465
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,420
Drink me.

466
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,200
Drink me.

467
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,440
Drink to me only.

468
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,800
Must be some way out of this.

469
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,380
I'll change the air.

470
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,000
That's what I'll do.

471
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,360
Let's see.

472
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,520
What have I got left on the climate control?

473
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,900
Uh, dust storm?

474
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,840
No.

475
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,920
Tibetan wilderness?

476
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,980
Land of the pharaohs.

477
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,620
Land of the pharaohs.

478
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,540
That sounds great.

479
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,220
It's so very lonely.

480
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,280
You're 600 light years from home.

481
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,840
Before age extra.

482
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,460
Today they must trust you.

483
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,020
But they wouldn't.

484
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,740
Thanks, big boy.

485
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,300
My Southern Ocean, with my度에 .

486
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,300


487
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:24,580


488
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:24,580


489
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:24,580


490
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:30,500
And the water, and the water, and its meaning.

491
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,420
Mama! Papa!

492
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,460
Open up! Here's the police!

493
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:48,280
The madness is a journey to hell,

494
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:54,540
where the brain is ill and weak.

495
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,560
In ever-changing dimensions,

496
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,540
where the evil nights live.

497
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,560
Goddamn!

498
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,360
On the pusher!

499
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,480
...the world bank, and you still find the time to make the nicest peccary pie in all of Longbox.

500
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,740
Oh, Darlene, I remember when the least little problem used to put you right to sleep.

501
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:43,840
Oh, not anymore. Today's modern narrow-gogo women just pops these simple little...

502
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,940
...anger dreams.

503
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,180
Swell demonstration, eh Sarge?

504
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,900
It's routine.

505
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,520
Maybe. But if the chief ever caught me taking these pills, he'd snap my head off.

506
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,160
Here, try one of mine.

507
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:55,860
Oh yeah?

508
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,300
Yeah, the chief himself's been on these for a week, and he's a change.

509
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,840
And welcome, dear friends, to the...

510
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,840
...hour of slack on K-N-O-N. Praise Bob!

511
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,860
Good. Open your mouth, Chef.

512
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,400
No, I don't like pills.

513
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,620
It really does help take the trouble out of falling asleep.

514
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:29,280
The haunting reality is that any one of these addicts, prostitutes, or runaways could be your child.

515
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:36,440
There was me. That is Alex, and my three droogs.

516
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,020
And their enemy is the God-centered family.

517
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,480
An 18-year-old teenager named Diane, living here in Hollywood, took her life.

518
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,540
She was under the influence of LSD.

519
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,200
She had experimented with it as a result of peer pressure from her friends.

520
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,740
This young lady had everything in the world to live for.

521
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,760
She had just won a Grammy award.

522
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,920
She was signed for a television series.

523
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:12,420
Today, drugs and alcohol have replaced baseball and football as the national pastimes.

524
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,200
We are producing a country without a future.

525
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,420
Any punk will tell you there is no future.

526
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,860
They don't think about it.

527
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,320
They wallow in just now operating. They only have the present.

528
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,920
I can't hold my breath...

529
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,740
...any longer.

530
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,040
In front of the policeman?

531
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,300
The policeman has no choice but to go with him.

532
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,640
See what he has to say. I'll minister to him.

533
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,700
I've tasted the dew on the lips of sweet death herself.

534
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:00,280
You were right, Paul, when you said that someday we'd all live in the treetops.

535
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,880
Like apes.

536
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,420
Like monkeys.

537
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:05,420


538
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,420
Like rodents.

539
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,960
Like...

540
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,780
Vermin.

541
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,800
Like the squirrel that has found itself electrocuted.

542
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,440
On my electric fence, the one I use to keep Zandy inside and the dogs.

543
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,220
The squirrels can't take the voltage.

544
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,320
They fry. They...

545
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,220
They die convulsing.

546
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,980
They suffocate.

547
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,400
Because their lungs can't take it anymore.

548
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,060
They need another breath.

549
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,480
But yet, their brains are aware of the terror.

550
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,540
My little boy walked out one morning and he said,

551
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,600
Daddy, is the squirrel sleeping?

552
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,000
Is the squirrel sick?

553
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,000
I said, no!

554
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,840
My child, the squirrel's not sleeping. The squirrel's not sick.

555
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,620
The squirrel is dead.

556
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,700
The squirrel will not come back. The squirrel can't be fixed.

557
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,060
It turned into a skeleton.

558
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,020
A squirrel skeleton.

559
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,680
My son said,

560
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,220
Father, I want to be like that squirrel.

561
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,240
I, too, want to be a skeleton.

562
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,960
You can't arrest me, officer. I'm not drunk.

563
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,060
I might be half-ass drunk, though.

564
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,420
Eee!

565
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,540
абсолют

566
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,460
Half-ass drunk

567
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,340
Hell, you know who you are

568
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,920
when you're got a hangover

569
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,600
And it's all hungover back home?

570
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,800
Say to your girlfriend's car, have a ass drunk.

571
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,500
Just you and me.

572
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:15,280
Sergeant Carter haircut, Gomer Pyle hookup, living off a LSD.

573
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,920
Have a ass drunk.

574
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,700
And I'm feeling blue.

575
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,640
Well, a flood come in and it washed away my den.

576
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,720
And my water bill's still past due.

577
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,080
Have a ass drunk.

578
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,720
Called my boss.

579
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,540
I ain't feeling quite right.

580
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,560
Well, it can't be Monday cause I don't remember Sunday.

581
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,540
And my hands are sitting Saturday night.

582
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,080
Sweet love songs.

583
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,760
Have a ass drunk.

584
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,400
Hell, I'm drunk as shit.

585
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,560
Well, I used to have a job, but I'm sick of getting robbed.

586
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,620
So I finally just up and quit.

587
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,040
Mama had a fit.

588
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,840
Have a ass drunk.

589
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,760
You know, my head feels odd.

590
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,700
Well, baby needs food, but his daddy needs a lewd.

591
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Well, the baby better find himself a job.

592
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,140
Have a ass drunk.

593
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,860
Have a ass drunk.

594
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,320
Have a ass drunk.

595
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,100
And I'm having fun.

596
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,220
Stopped on a hill cause I had to take a pill.

597
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,260
But I couldn't quite find my tongue.

598
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,740
Have a ass drunk.

599
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,400
Hell, I can't see.

600
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,100
Well, they said the light was red.

601
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,160
Now a couple of folks.

602
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,620
Well, there was 22 mangled.

603
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,940
And there was one guy that was gimped up pretty good.

604
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,840
He had to sort of walk like this for the rest of his life.

605
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,240
And there was one guy.

606
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,140
It was pretty neat.

607
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,580
They had.

608
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,280
He was hurt pretty good, I guess.

609
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:25,220
They had like this machine that was like hooked up where he had this tube running up through his nose, you know.

610
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,300
And that was the only way he could breathe.

611
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,740
And well, there's this one dude.

612
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,340
It was like a blade.

613
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,520
It chopped straight down on his toe.

614
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,580
And last I heard, he still couldn't walk.

615
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,780
There's one guy.

616
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,460
Well, this is what's weird.

617
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:43,560
They found parts of him on front of the car and other parts of him on the back of the same car.

618
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,700
I mean, it sort of defies the mind, doesn't it?

619
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,700
How you could find pieces of the same person on the front and back of the same car.

620
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,640
I mean, I just don't understand.

621
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,960
They ought to run some kind of scientific test.

622
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,840
I don't even see how that could even happen.

623
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,600
And a couple folks dead.

624
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,260
Well, it sure looked green to me.

625
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,840
Half-ass drunk.

626
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,820
Hell, I wish I was.

627
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,180
Turned a brand new Trans Am into an old tin can.

628
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,220
Trying to outrun the fuzz.

629
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,360
Half-ass drunk.

630
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,220
I'm a victim of lies.

631
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,600
Well, there's nothing wrong with me.

632
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,080
Your honor, I can see.

633
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,240
Hell, I got you damned.

634
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,360
You dug your eyes.

635
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,660
Half-ass drunk.

636
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,460
Oh, woe is me.

637
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,180
He's been gone for so long.

638
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,700
He's been gone for so long.

639
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,660
He can never come home.

640
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,440
He is gone for one more fifteen days.

641
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,580
I could have been a sinner for my Culker.

642
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:32,580


643
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:32,580


644
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:32,580


645
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:32,580


646
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:32,580


647
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:32,580


648
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:32,580


649
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:32,580


650
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,860
I've been gone for more

651
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,840
Held up in an intensive care ward

652
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,700
Lying on the floor

653
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,860
I was gone for all those days

654
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,500
But I was not all alone

655
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:04,160
I made friends with a lot of people

656
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,440
In the danger zone

657
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,760
See my lonely life I'm for

658
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,980
I see it every day

659
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,480
See my lonely life I'm for

660
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:26,480


661
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,000
I see it every day

662
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,040
I'm for

663
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,040


664
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,160
I'm for

665
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,060
I'm for

666
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,440
I'm for

667
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,160
I'm for

668
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,160
I'm for

669
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,320
I'm for

670
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,320
I'm for

671
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,600
I'm for

672
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,720
I'm for

673
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,200
I'm for

674
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,380
Now imagine a world where heroin was legal

675
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:14,560
But possession of coffee was punishable by up to 50 years in jail

676
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,420
In other words friends think of a world where you could run down to the nearest convenience store

677
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:26,080
Just about any time of day or night and purchase any amount of liquid heroin you wanted

678
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,260
A whole bottle of heroin would be about three bucks.

679
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:37,420
Or you could go down to a heroin den and sit and shoot up with all your shooting buddies until about 2 a.m.

680
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,280
Then you'd get on the expressway and drive home.

681
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,940
Or, for that matter, folks, in the heroin world,

682
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,900
where imagine that the authority is making heroin so much a part of their business world

683
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:59,640
that nobody closed a big business deal without having a few shots of smack with the client.

684
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,180
When there'd be billboards all over the roads for the coolest brands of heroin

685
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,560
showing beautiful models, skin popping next to a waterfall.

686
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,340
And on TV, well, not only would there be all these ads showing your favorite sports heroes

687
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,760
shooting their favorite brand of heroin,

688
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,800
but in any party scene, any scene of any TV show,

689
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,020
where people were shown relaxing or having a good time,

690
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,000
well, they're always taking just a few little sniffs of smack.

691
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:36,640
Now, the leaders of a world like that would have to be pretty insane, right?

692
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,960
I mean, it'd be obvious that the leaders themselves were not only heroin users,

693
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,880
but stood to gain quite a bit from the whole population,

694
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,220
aside from a few anti-heroin fanatics leaning on this substance to relax.

695
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,900
But let's take it a step further, friends.

696
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,480
Imagine if these people made coffee illegal.

697
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,180
Because they said it was addicting, and it led to harder stuff like espresso.

698
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,120
But yet untold, millions of people had been drinking coffee for thousands of years

699
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,080
and no one had ever OD'd.

700
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,340
You drink it, and it sharpens you up a bit, and then later you crash a bit.

701
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:21,200
But it was so illegal that the smugglers are getting fantastically rich,

702
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,380
having contraband coffee beans flown up from South America.

703
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,280
And there'd be this whole subculture of bean heads,

704
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,260
people that were into coffee, partly as a rebellion against the establishment.

705
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,860
And the whole reason that coffee led to harder stuff like espresso or NyQuil

706
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:45,180
was because to buy coffee, you had to go to a coffee dealer's house,

707
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,720
a pusher's house, where you'd encounter people who were espresso users.

708
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,580
And on top of that, a one-ounce bag of coffee beans would cost like a hundred bucks

709
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,560
just for an ordinary Maxwell House grade.

710
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,840
And people would be arrested and spend their whole lives in jail,

711
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,520
maybe even be executed for using coffee, which is relatively harmless,

712
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,200
while this whole planet of junkies was going scot-free.

713
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,280
And President Reagan would be up there, you'd see him in the news at, you know,

714
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,460
partying with world leaders.

715
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,420
All of them snorting a bit of smack and shooting up.

716
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,540
Imagine what a horrible, topsy-turvy world that would be, friends,

717
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,420
where they made a powerful, central nervous system depressant

718
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,360
not only legal, but glamorous.

719
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,860
While an organically grown, harmless bean off of a bush

720
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:44,120
could wreck your life only because of the laws against it.

721
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:44,880
But...

722
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,600
But...

723
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,900
But that could never happen here.

724
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,920
No, not in this world, friends.

725
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,340
Nah.

726
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,160
Nay, nay.

727
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,720
Couldn't happen.

728
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,200
No way, baby.

729
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,600
We're an enlightened people here.

730
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,480
So just forget that little allegory, you know.

731
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,220
Let's not get depressing about it, friends.

732
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:09,880
Let's...

733
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,580
Let's just lean back with a good, stiff...

734
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,700
Drink...

735
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,440
And forget it.

736
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,200
Praise God.

737
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,360
The best thing you can do

738
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,980
Doctor Smokey

739
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,940
Nurse Smokey

740
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,440
Just a little bit of smokey

741
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,580
Judge is smokey

742
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,500
Even the lawyer too

743
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,940
So you've got to live a life, you say

744
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,860
Is that prop?

745
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,780
This is habit for opposite-y-lops, too.

746
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,880
You can smell it.

747
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,420
It doesn't smell like marijuana at all.

748
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,680
If you can hold it to the microphone,

749
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,280
it's got a very pungent odor.

750
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,040
I don't like this stuff.

751
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,900
It is free.

752
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,400
We have to smoke it.

753
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,980
It's one of the rules.

754
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,880
We're talking about a barrel of Havifrottem.

755
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,540
We're talking about a void,

756
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,800
a limitless void of Havifrottem.

757
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,560
We're talking about several alternate realities.

758
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,840
We're talking about your basic...

759
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,540
We're talking about putting it in your pipe and smoking it.

760
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,840
And another thing I want to tell you about tonight,

761
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,300
we've had some calamitous times in Malaysia.

762
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,320
You might have heard about all the rains we had.

763
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,700
Yes, dear friends, it was flooding over here,

764
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,940
but, oh, Bob, oh, good old Bob knew

765
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,500
that when it flooded in Malaysia,

766
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,080
you better build your houses on stilts.

767
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,260
So all our houses are built on stilts over here, dear friends.

768
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:01,940
Ha-ha.

769
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,160
We knew a long time ago that when those floodwaters came,

770
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,220
we'd better be sitting pretty, sitting high,

771
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,160
so nobody could come by.

772
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,280
And speaking of sitting high,

773
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,540
we need something over here in Malaysia.

774
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,560
Yes, our whole drug cabinet was washed away.

775
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,780
And after a flood, you know, we need some drugs.

776
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,820
We need some drugs that can help the people out here.

777
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,640
So what else...

778
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,760
Something really, really scary.

779
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,880
It was Mike Hills.

780
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,920
I wonder if that guy Bob took them.

781
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,660
I guess I better go down this dark river.

782
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,540
Yeah.

783
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,480
Oh, yeah, okay, what?

784
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,220
Oh, okay.

785
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,100
Where are we going?

786
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,880
Where are we going?

787
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,640
That guy took all my pills.

788
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,800
Okay, well, I still got my tape recorder and my camera.

789
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,160
You don't need those anymore.

790
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,320
You can give them to me.

791
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,420
Ha-ha.

792
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,160
Come on.

793
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,540
Whoa, look out!

794
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,220
Whoa!

795
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,120


796
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,140
Whoa!

797
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,860
Charlie's in Mama's mouth

798
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,540
Well, it's all right

799
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,920
The girl's got a very large mouth

800
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,940
But it's all right

801
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,780
Her teeth look okay

802
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,820
She must be crushing them quite a bit

803
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,140
Of course, her mouth is empty

804
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:42,500
She's got lips all around the hole

805
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:42,500


806
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:42,980
And there's the large

807
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,140
And we can only assume

808
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:51,580
As to how she's been using it

809
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,340
Charlie's in Mama's mouth

810
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,140
Well, it's all right

811
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,460
The girl's got a very large mouth

812
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,280
But it's all right

813
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,200
She's got lips all around the hole

814
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,220
Where she puts her food in

815
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,780
They call it the mouth

816
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,920
They call it the mouth

817
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,000
They call it the mouth

818
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,440
Which is as good a place as any

819
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,980
For the tongue to include in

820
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,360
That's why they call it the mouth

821
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,540
They call it the mouth

822
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,680
They call it the mouth

823
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,080
La-la-la, la-la-la-la

824
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,580
La-la-la, la-la-la-la

825
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,440
Kind of young, kind of wild

826
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,720
Charlie's enormous nose

827
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,660
Well, it's all right

828
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,920
The girl's got a very large nose

829
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,720
But it's all right

830
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,700
She once was okay

831
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,700
But she's been blowing it quite a bit

832
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,820
Of course, her twins are extra large

833
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,080
And we can only assume

834
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:10,460
As to how she's been choosing it

835
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,020
Charlie's enormous nose

836
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,820
Well, it's all right

837
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,180
The girl's got a very large nose

838
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,980
But it's all right

839
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,880
She's got stuff all around the hole

840
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,920
Where she puts her food in

841
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,240
They call it the mouth

842
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,380
They call it the mouth

843
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,520
They call it the mouth

844
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,780
And when it finally locks away

845
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,620
I guess you'll probably try the drug again

846
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,880
They used to call it the mouth

847
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,180
They call it the mouth

848
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,300
They call it the mouth

849
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,600
La-la-la, la-la-la-la

850
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,000
La-la-la, la-la-la-la

851
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,940
Kind of young, kind of dead

852
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,200
Charlie's disgusting brain

853
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,780
Well, it's all right

854
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,360
They call it the mouth

855
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:04,360


856
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:04,360


857
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,320
The girl's got a very dead brain

858
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,220
It won't come back

859
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,980
She used to convey

860
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,020
But then she took an extra hit

861
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:20,220
Of course, her friends are extra dumb

862
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,520
And they were terribly excited

863
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,120
While they watched her do it

864
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,220
Charlie's disgusting brain

865
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,960
Well, it's all right

866
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,320
The girl's got a very dead brain

867
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,140
It won't come back

868
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,040
She's got dirt all around the hole

869
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,900
Where they dump their boxes

870
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,360
They call it the grave

871
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,560
They call it the grave

872
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,780
They call it the grave

873
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,160
Which is as good a place as any

874
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,780
For a chump to repose in

875
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,960
That's why they call it the grave

876
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,080
They call it the grave

877
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,240
They call it the grave

878
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:18,460
They call it the grave

879
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,180
And all around

880
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,740
At the side of the grave

881
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,020
Stood Charlie's friends

882
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,280
Who could not save

883
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,620
This stupid girl

884
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,680
From the way she behaved

885
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,480
Hey!

886
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,360
But among the mourners

887
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,460
And the frowners

888
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,080
They cry away

889
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:43,560
Hey!

890
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,280
In the donors

891
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,940
In the donors

892
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:56,520
In the donors

893
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,920
In the donors

894
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,580
No, I ain't dying anymore

895
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:12,060
No, I ain't dying anymore

896
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,560
No, I ain't dying anymore

897
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,980
No, I ain't dying anymore

898
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,480
Although it doesn't exist

899
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,740
And they are shooting each other

900
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,080
Because of a new prize

901
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,800
Billions of dollars

902
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,900
In American money

903
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,940
the hard-earned or hard-stolen dollars of America's heroin addicts.

904
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,460
Hey, if you want any of this junk, go to it, boys.

905
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:45,500
But this young girl, 14 years of age, in the eighth grade,

906
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,640
recently took 50 pills to take her life.

907
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,220
She has slit her wrist and she's been into heavy drugs.

908
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,960
I've got super dynamic overdrive.

909
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,620
I'm operating in 10,000 revolutions.

910
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:04,420
My motor is being preserved because I'm operating in supernatural overdrive.

911
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,840
Are you certain you know what reality is?

912
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:15,160
No matter what I do to change it, normal I remain.

913
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,320
Normal can be just as bad as riding in a wheelchair.

914
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,280
Today, serious heresy.

915
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,840
This is a deviant state of consciousness.

916
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:40,020
Not so much deviant opinions as having a kind of experience

917
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,800
which is different from regular experience.

918
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,100
We are taught what experiences are permissible.

919
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:56,820
And therefore, if a person has so-called strange experiences

920
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,500
and endeavors to communicate,

921
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,160
he has to communicate these experiences to other people.

922
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,000
He is looked at in a very odd way and asked,

923
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,140
are you feeling all right?

924
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,740
Because people feel distinctly uncomfortable

925
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,280
when they realize that they're in the presence of someone

926
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,460
who's experiencing the world in a rather different way from themselves.

927
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:21,660
They call in question as to whether this person is indeed human.

928
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,600
They look like a human being, but because the state of experience is so different,

929
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:28,600


930
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,080
you wonder whether they really are.

931
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,320
And in rather the same way, in a very everyday kind of circumstance,

932
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,520
when you're sitting in a bar drinking, and you find you have a drunk next to you,

933
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,500
and he turns to you and says,

934
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,200
I say,

935
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,380
and you sort of move your stool a little way away from this man.

936
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,040
Because he's become in some way what we mean by non-human.

937
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,080
And you expect a high of about 65 degrees tomorrow,

938
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,340
increasingly cloudy skies once again, with some rain in the forecast.

939
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,060
All right, boys.

940
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,580
Bob's got you hooked.

941
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,560
Bob's got a monkey on your back.

942
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,380
Hey, you know that...

943
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,400
Bob's doing something spooky again, ain't he?

944
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,560
That's what you're listening to.

945
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:21,980
Yeah.

946
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,340
Yeah.

947
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,860
That's the kind of Bob that comes up out of the shadows.

948
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,780
That's the kind of Bob that follows you home.

949
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:37,040
That's the kind of Bob that calls you up in the middle of the night and hangs up and suites you.

950
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,120
Hey, Doug, let's kill Bob, you know.

951
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,640
Would you like some cappuccino?

952
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,580
Yeah, hell yeah.

953
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,420
I have an espresso machine in there.

954
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,020
Espresso.

955
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:50,960
I feel the need to express myself into a cup,

956
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,240
and then pour it back into the spot in which I once stood.

957
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,380
Pour it into my shoe,

958
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,580
and I will be reborn.

959
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,100
I'm born again.

960
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,860
A man of caffeine.

961
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,780
Y'all get your own whiskey,

962
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,000
get your little snort,

963
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:05,960
get your little reefer,

964
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:06,800
get your little...

965
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,640
Are you serious?

966
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,120
Plain people that's fixing to kill you

967
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,700
puts the drugs out here for you.

968
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:12,380
How many of y'all know that?

969
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:12,940
Let me see your hands.

970
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,700
Some of y'all got your hand up,

971
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,600
got reefer in your pocket.

972
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,680
And we sat in the Carova Milk Bar,

973
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,480
trying to make up our razzoo docs

974
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,840
what to do with the evening.

975
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,880
The Carova Milk Bar sold Milk Plus.

976
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,480
Milk Plus,

977
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,260
Vellaset,

978
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,660
or Synthemesk,

979
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,300
or Drencrum,

980
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,860
which is what we were drinking.

981
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,040
This would sharpen you up

982
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,960
and make you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence.

983
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,040
And they got your head so messed up,

984
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,460
everybody got their hide,

985
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,980
and don't like nobody else's.

986
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,480
Yeah, the whiskey drinkers have always looked down on the wine owners.

987
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:56,540
Reefer smokers now got a attitude about whiskey drinkers.

988
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,280
All at once the cocaine snarters think they're more sophisticated

989
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,080
than the reefer smokers.

990
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,700
And the coffee drinkers hate them all.

991
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,880
And yet there is more stomach cancer caused in America every day

992
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,920
from drinking coffee than lung cancer from smoking cigarette.

993
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,980
And after enough of us been riding it long enough,

994
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,540
Harvard University, where they old tricky self had finally come out now

995
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,520
and said,

996
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:31,560
cancer of the colon is caused more from drinking coffee than anything else.

997
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,340
And to show you how insignificant nothing they got you,

998
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,020
ain't nothing you can do about it but keep on drinking coffee.

999
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,640
It's my impression.

1000
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,800
I'm not talking about manslaughter.

1001
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,660
I'm not talking about

1002
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,660
Milk Plus,

1003
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,340
Vellaset,

1004
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,580
or Synthemesk.

1005
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,240
A lot of evangelical leaders seem to have forgotten that.

1006
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,600
Now we understand the drunk.

1007
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,780
We know what's the matter with him and it'll wear off.

1008
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,640
But when quite unaccountably a person gives a representation

1009
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,280
that he's suddenly got the feeling

1010
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,860
that he's living in backwards time,

1011
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,980
or that everybody seems to be separated from him by a huge sheet of glass,

1012
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,620
or that

1013
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,520
he's suddenly seeing everything in unbelievably vivid detail.

1014
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,680
Moving colors.

1015
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,020
You say,

1016
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,000
well that's not normal.

1017
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,320
Therefore there must be something wrong with you.

1018
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,160
We like you and should ignore you,

1019
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,700
but instead.

1020
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:41,520
Makes,

1021
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,240
oh god it hurts,

1022
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,480
my headaches come back.

1023
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,380
Ah,

1024
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:47,520
ah,

1025
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:49,660
ah,

1026
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:50,840
ah.

1027
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,680
If these headaches keep up,

1028
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,500
I'm gonna have to go to bed.

1029
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:55,720
Fuck.

1030
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,280
I'll go down in the medicine fish hole.

1031
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,140
I'll go in the medicine fish hole if I have to.

1032
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,000
Thanks for the kiss.

1033
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:04,980
Oh.

1034
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,880
Do you have any aspirin?

1035
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:09,400
Probably.

1036
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,520
Getting stoned on sunshine

1037
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,700
Getting high on air

1038
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,340
Getting to it naturally

1039
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,700
Really getting there

1040
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,820
Getting such a high on

1041
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,940
Loving what I do

1042
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,780
I'm so full of happiness

1043
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,960
Hooked on something new

1044
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,400
Life is such a trippy thing

1045
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,960
Hello birdies, hello spring

1046
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,720
Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering

1047
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,860
And I mean just what I sing

1048
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,460
Life is such a groovy thing

1049
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,180
Don't pity me

1050
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:13,560
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling

1051
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,800
My pot is filled with flowers

1052
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,460
My grass is bright and green

1053
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:33,760
My tea is brewing in my cup

1054
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,620
And still I make the scene

1055
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:40,660
So just don't try to change me

1056
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,080
I love the world I've found

1057
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,400
I've got to fly my own sweet way

1058
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,160
Don't you shoot me down

1059
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,920
Ha ha ha

1060
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,600
Life is such a trippy thing

1061
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,200
Hello birdies, hello spring

1062
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:04,060
Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering

1063
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,200
And I mean just what I sing

1064
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,900
Life is such a groovy thing

1065
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,560
Don't pity me

1066
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,000
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling

1067
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,020
A ding-a-ling

1068
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:20,880
A ding-a-ling

1069
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,260
A ding-a-ling

1070
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:21,560
A ding-a-ling

1071
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,900
A ding-a-ling

1072
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,340
A ding-a-ling

1073
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,380
A ding-a-ling

1074
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,300
Don't pity me

1075
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,820
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling

1076
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,360
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling

1077
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:34,640
A ding-a-ling

1078
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,660
A ding-a-ling

1079
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,420
A ding-a-ling

1080
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,420
A ding-a-ling

1081
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:37,520
A ding-a-ling

1082
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:37,520


1083
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:37,520


1084
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:37,520


1085
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:37,520


1086
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:37,520


1087
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:37,520


1088
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:37,880
Ding-a-ling

1089
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:38,800
O drink of that

1090
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,120
A ding-a-ling

1091
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,140
A ding-a-ling

1092
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:40,960
A ding-a-ling

1093
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:42,540
Or condescending

1094
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,020
It's just silly

1095
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,080
Ding-a-ling

1096
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,000
A ding-a-ling

1097
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,460
A ding-a-ling

1098
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:47,880
Schefff

1099
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:52,900
Haha

1100
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:58,820
Friends, that was definitely one of the stupidest songs ever created.

1101
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,560
That was Frank and Nancy Sinatra, believe it or not.

1102
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,980
And well, friends, this is the end of your hour of slack.

1103
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,780
Ron Lindsey is here with the Soul Oldies show.

1104
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,880
And for those of you who want to know what I was playing tonight,

1105
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,700
it was all on tape, so I wasn't cutting in and telling you.

1106
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:25,080
You're just going to have to write for information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1107
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:25,560
That's right.

1108
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:32,780
You, friend, are going to have to dare having your address on our mailing list.

1109
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:39,820
Do you know what sort of government agencies get hold of our mailing list,

1110
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,280
whether we know it or not?

1111
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:41,620
Eh?

1112
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,660
I don't either.

1113
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,220
But anyway, you need to write to Bob, friends.

1114
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,600
Write to Bob at the Church of the Subgenius,

1115
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,600
and here comes that P.O. Box number.

1116
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:59,560
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1117
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:07,840
This is KNON 90.9, the voice of the people and other things.

1118
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,720
In Dallas, Fort Worth, Texas.

1119
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:13,020
Huh!

1120
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,260
There can be no such thing as a safe pleasure drug.

1121
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,300
Even if it had no harmful physical side effects,

1122
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,480
it still would have, it would still be overused

1123
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,440
by some people who cannot get pleasure in other ways.

1124
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,240
That's what's so sad.

1125
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,220
Oh, I know smoking cigarettes causes cancer, but I can't stop.

1126
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,100
But if them same folks told you smoking cigarettes in your automobile

1127
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,100
would corrode your engine, it would be no more smoking in the car.

1128
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:01,820
Now that's kind of sad.

1129
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:09,160
Because they've manipulated us to the extent that these educational

1130
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,580
institutions ain't nothing but tricks.

1131
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:11,720
Why?

1132
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,540
Well, I didn't tell you this before, but he's an egg salad addict.

1133
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,680
You mean he's hooked on drugs?

1134
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:20,680


1135
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:20,680


1136
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:20,680


1137
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:20,680


1138
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:20,680


1139
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:20,680


1140
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:20,680


1141
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,680
He's hooked.

1142
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,940
He's got a chicken on his back.

1143
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,640
Yeah, well, too bad for him.

1144
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1145
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:32,660
As far back as educated men have recorded their history,

1146
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,240
veils have been lowered to disclose a vast new reality,

1147
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,300
rinse in the fabric of man's awareness.

1148
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,500
And somewhere in the endless search of the curious mind

1149
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,840
lies the next vision, the next key to his infinite capacity.

1150
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:59,100
There's reason to believe that incessant stimulation of the reward

1151
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:05,320
or pleasure centers of the brain will lead to a resetting of the pleasure threshold

1152
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:11,320
so that ordinary enjoyable things no longer stimulate that area,

1153
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,840
or if they do, they aren't effective, and one can't enjoy ordinary life

1154
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,700
so that all one has left are the chemicals.

1155
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,660
If we keep using drugs, we're going to die.

1156
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,020
If we keep using drugs the way we are, we're going to go down the chemical dumper.

1157
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,820
Well, you look puzzled, Peter.

1158
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,300
Oh, then you're still plain Peter Wayne.

1159
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,740
But don't worry.

1160
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,300
You'll all be crystal clear as soon as you cross over.

1161
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,600
Consciousness expanding.

1162
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:43,520
Properly induced CE will give a subject full awareness of capabilities never known before.

1163
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:46,280
What?

1164
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:46,820
What?

1165
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,640
The doses have been somewhat...

1166
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,400
...sort of for me the last time or two.

1167
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:02,320
If you can hear me now, you'd better listen to my warning.

1168
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,040
Warning, warning...

1169
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:11,780
Well, I went on down to my girlfriend's shack to see how they did hang.

1170
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:16,600
When I got there, her cupboard was bare.

1171
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,440
I couldn't ignite a thing.

1172
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:24,460
There was no shard, no bone, no twig.

1173
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,480
I brought my comic book collection.

1174
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,560
Was about this big, yeah.

1175
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:29,420
Well, from...

1176
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:29,480
Well, from...
