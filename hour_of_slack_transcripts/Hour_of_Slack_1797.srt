1
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,620
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

2
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,440
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

3
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,700
Somehow, Bob's naked!

4
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,940
No trouble.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,340
Just get set and get going.

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:38,880
Amen.

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,580
According, everything's going fine.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,400
No trouble.

9
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,900
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,660
Bob?

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,780
Bob?

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,100
Bob?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,880
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,320
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,600
What about slack?

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,720
That's your key phrase.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

18
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:24,860
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Power of Slack.

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,420
Sponsored by the church.

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,700
Oh, the subgenius.

21
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:36,200
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,640
of the Church of the Subgenius, with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,300
Subgenius.

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,280
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:55,800
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack and saint of

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,120
sales.

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,380
One planet.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,640
Insert a thumb under the upper lip.

29
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:17,560
Oh, yes, dear friends, this show, Hour of Slack number 1,797, is in actuality Hour of Slack number 5 from the year of 1985.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,020
Has this ever happened to you?

31
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,620
I should have been there, Ted.

32
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,480
It was great.

33
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,740
There was free booze, great music.

34
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,820
One of the best parties I ever went to.

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,420
Where were you that night?

36
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,620
Oh, I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,580
I guess I should have gone, huh?

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,220
Didn't you feel stupid?

39
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,160
Didn't you wish you could go back to that night, that party?

40
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,620
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.

41
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,920
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

42
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,520
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time, slow time, and make time run backwards.

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,700
But most importantly, you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,720
How you do it.

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:56,720


46
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:56,720


47
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,500
Yes, well, just ask this man here, an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,060
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.

49
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:04,860
Blango.

50
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,120
My dog was dead.

51
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,060
Was I sad till I met Bob.

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,420
Bob showed me how I could go back, get the registration number for the car, do a slip job on the brakes,

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,060
and wouldn't you know it, that truck went off into a ditch and burst into flames just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger.

54
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,860
Ain't that right, fella?

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,560
Yes, just imagine the horrible things that could be undone tomorrow

56
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,720
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time.

57
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,440
Bob's School of Time Control, today.

58
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,840
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.

59
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,140
Just right.

60
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,200
Bob's School of Time Control, the universe.

61
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,700
Bob's School of Time Control, Division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

62
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,100
Bob's School of Time Control, Division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

63
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,000
All right, Kelly.

64
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,160
Clear launch area.

65
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,020
Okay, launch area's clear.

66
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,620
All right, look at those.

67
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,340
Central control processor on.

68
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,420
Thank you.

69
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,120
Airlocks closed.

70
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,580
My airlock's closed.

71
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,280
Recon vessels well. This is base control.

72
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,420
Commence free departure, Jackson E. Linton.

73
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,340
The show is starting up.

74
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,840
Life support systems functional.

75
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,400
You want to turn on the radio show, Bogey?

76
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,220
Oh, we're already broadcasting.

77
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,960
Primary and secondary circuit tests commencing now.

78
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,540
Ah, yes, dear friends.

79
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,120
Nice green lights across the board.

80
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,820
Yes, the show is warming up.

81
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,420
Yes, and you can see your radio light up.

82
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,960
And if you look inside the speakers real close, you may be able to see the picture.

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,380
Free departure check sequence completed.

84
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,140
Thank you.

85
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,520
Awaiting navigation.

86
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,360
Additional input interface will be submitted.

87
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,620
Okay, here we go.

88
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,300
Open phone lines tonight, please.

89
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,220
Phone lines are open.

90
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,020
All right.

91
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,840
Energize the caller, please.

92
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,080
Ah, yes, dear friends.

93
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,440
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

94
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,920
Praise Bob.

95
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,980
Praise Bob.

96
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,300
And we'll be orbiting your area for the next hour.

97
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:05,000
We'll be carrying the message, the seed word of the faith of Bob, the faith in Bob, FIB, we call it.

98
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,760
Can you keep up the FIB, friend?

99
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,340
You want to dump the main shunts?

100
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,020
Thank you.

101
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,000
All right.

102
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,040
The show is right up on the green lines, doctor.

103
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,700
The show is fully on the line.

104
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,440
We will be landing on another show.

105
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,720
We will be docking with another show tonight.

106
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,360
Pardon me.

107
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,860
You can't land on another show.

108
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,280
We've caused a nuclear explosion.

109
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,940
We'll be docking with show four from San Francisco tonight.

110
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,860
And hold onto your seats.

111
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,280
Oh, my God.

112
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,040
Oh, my God.

113
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,220
Oh, my God.

114
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,640
Dump him.

115
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,520
Dump him.

116
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,320
No matter how much you shake and dance, the last few drops go down your pants.

117
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,740
Hit me.

118
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:54,840


119
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,760
Hit me.

120
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:55,880
Hit me.

121
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,380
Hit me.

122
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:00,860
Hit me.

123
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,720
The world is getting rougher day by day

124
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,500
If you think it's gonna get any better, just keep dreaming away

125
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,220
You've got to hold your head up high all day and night

126
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,580
Cause you're probably the only weapon you need to settle up a fight

127
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,000
No matter how much you shake and dance

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,460
The last few drops go down your pants

129
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,900
No matter how much you scream and shout

130
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,360
Ain't nobody gonna try to help you on out

131
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,900
No matter how much you piss and moan

132
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,700
Ain't nobody gonna try to help you on out

133
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:56,700


134
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
Ain't nobody gonna go and leave you alone

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,820
No matter how much you whack your head

136
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,140
You're better off living than being dead

137
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,180
Society pushes harder on you every day

138
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,180
You've got to get what you make and you'll hear them say

139
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,140
You get what you take and eat it too, you know

140
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,700
You get what you take and eat it too, you know

141
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:26,700


142
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,040
There ain't enough to go around and it's starting to show

143
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,240
The planet's getting fuller all the time

144
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,000
The man in your brain just like the grape turning to wine

145
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,280
We've got to destroy the forces that are still in your sack

146
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,780
Scare all them mothers, give them one big heart attack

147
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,600
We've got to regain control of our destiny

148
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,880
Cause they want to take it away from you and me

149
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,820
But we've got to stop on the spot and the most ourselves

150
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,960
Cause that just keeps them confused and they think that's swell

151
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,940
Stand up for your rights and soon you'll win them back

152
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,880
Or else they'll barbecue you while you're lying there on your back

153
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,380
I mean, no matter how much you shake and dance

154
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,700
The last few drops go down your pants

155
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,160
No matter how much you scream and shout

156
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,660
Ain't nobody gonna try to help you on out

157
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,260
No matter how much you piss and moan

158
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,420
Ain't nobody gonna go and leave you alone

159
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,220
No matter how much you whack your head

160
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,500
You're better off living than being dead

161
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,420
Hear me, hear me

162
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,200
Ow!

163
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,380
Ugh!

164
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:45,900
Ugh!

165
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,800
Ow!

166
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,140
Ugh!

167
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:50,840
Ugh!

168
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,240
No matter!

169
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,780
Why does it matter?

170
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,160
It don't matter!

171
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,700
It don't matter!

172
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,220
It don't matter what you do!

173
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,340
Don't matter what you do!

174
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,700
The man's looking at you!

175
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,320
He don't see your face!

176
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,980
The man he was you and dad know!

177
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,120
It don't matter!

178
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,700
It don't matter!

179
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,100
It don't matter!

180
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:18,940
It don't matter!

181
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,180
You don't shatter my heart!

182
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,900
I don't like to stop!

183
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,280
Stand up for your rights and soon you'll win them back

184
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,240
Yeah, I don't care.

185
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,320
I don't care.

186
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,580
Kids, get into the station.

187
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,040
This is the children's mission, Doctor.

188
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,600
Yes, this is the children's hour for the Church of the Subgenius.

189
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,540
Kids, for Bob.

190
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,720
Say, kids.

191
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,380
Tevis, come over here.

192
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,940
Tell us what you think about Bob, Tevis.

193
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:41,960
Nothing.

194
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,280
A wise answer.

195
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,520
There is wisdom.

196
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:46,940
Subgenius.

197
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,640
I know about him, about spaceships.

198
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,820
You know about spaceships and Bob.

199
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,320
And that's all you need to know, friends.

200
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,020
Praise Bob.

201
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,180
And the spaceships.

202
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,560
Ah, thank you.

203
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,720
And the spaceships.

204
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,140
And the spaceships.

205
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,140


206
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,140


207
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,140


208
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,800
But you went on and on and on.

209
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,320
Now they're beginning to ask themselves, maybe, I'm next.

210
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,000
Where will it lead to?

211
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,840
Nowhere.

212
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,280
I'd like to take up a copy of the book of the subgenius.

213
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,140
The book of the subgenius is right here on lovely McGraw Hill.

214
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,180
And I assume that must be Bob right there on the front.

215
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,300
Could very well be, Brian.

216
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,440
With the pipe in his mouth.

217
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,020
It's certainly a marvelous and comfortable experience.

218
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,380
We'll be back.

219
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,420
The publisher.

220
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,780
Did not see that my purpose was to write a moral lesson.

221
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,520
The punishment that befell a mortal man who dared to emulate God.

222
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,860
Well, whatever your purpose may have been, my dear,

223
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,880
I take great relish in savoring each separate horror.

224
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,340
This book isn't full of subliminal messages.

225
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,060
The messages are right out front as far as I can see.

226
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,700
Both, actually.

227
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,140
Both, yeah.

228
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,640
It has both.

229
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,920
They were subpsychic messages, too.

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,620
And in fact, the book actually, now most of your listeners will not believe this,

231
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,400
but it's a book that I'm going to read to you.

232
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


233
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


234
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


235
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


236
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:33,680
But the book carries a power shell that actually protects anything that it's being carried in your car,

237
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,440
your bathroom, especially your bathroom, and, well, your whole house.

238
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:44,680
The conspiracy can't touch it because there's power, power in that book.

239
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,240
Power.

240
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,660
And they're afraid of it.

241
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:54,400
In fact, in one respect, that's tough on sales because the love of Bob that's manifested in this book

242
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,120
can.

243
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,400
Can.

244
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:55,400


245
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:55,400


246
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,400
Injure normals and humans.

247
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,240
You mind?

248
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:58,840
Mangled.

249
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,420
I'm a door.

250
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,140
I can't believe it.

251
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,460
That's right.

252
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,120
Each one of the Bobs in the book sees.

253
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,600
Did you know that every picture of Bob has the power to view you?

254
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,380
Has the power to look at you and look into your very soul?

255
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:09,980
Gee, I don't know.

256
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,320
Every picture of Bob is not just an image, not just a meaningless, mindless graffito.

257
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,460
Those dots are alive.

258
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,200
No, I just.

259
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,780
Look at you.

260
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,260
Each of those dots pulses with unfathomable radiant energy.

261
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,100
Each of those Bobs next to those toilets all over the U.S.

262
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,160
Don't listen to him.

263
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,780
Don't listen to him.

264
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,820
You know, yes, you can find help.

265
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,980
You can be deprogrammed.

266
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,300
You can find out the truth.

267
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,260
Beat me every day.

268
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,740
It's a hell of an empty.

269
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,920
I know you know that.

270
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,580
They force you to sleep on boards.

271
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,140
You must devise.

272
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,060
They starve you.

273
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,780
You must devise.

274
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,600
What's going on?

275
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,620
It's all right.

276
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,440
They stay in the house.

277
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,780
Some geniuses came in.

278
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,800
They took all my furniture.

279
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,280
Sold it to buy me this neck brace that I can't take off now.

280
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,260
They said it was a living being.

281
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:02,540


282
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,340
What the hell?

283
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:05,480


284
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:06,800
Ah.

285
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,220
Ah.

286
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,280
Ah.

287
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:09,800
Ah.

288
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:10,640
Ah.

289
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,040


290
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,320
Ah.

291
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,400
Ah.

292
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:12,420


293
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:12,660


294
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:12,660


295
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:12,660


296
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:12,680


297
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:12,760
Ah.

298
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:12,760


299
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,120
Ah.

300
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,540
Ah.

301
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,720
Ah.

302
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,040
Ahhhhh.

303
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,380
Ahh.

304
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,500
Oh.

305
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,620
You've got a lot of people out there listening right now,

306
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:40,860
so don't know you too well.

307
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,280
They might know the best way out ofuro before.

308
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,520
But don't show off and force me on to something that you haven't done yet.

309
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:49,520


310
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,980
systems on 11 different galactic quadrants all tuned in at this very moment.

311
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,920
We've been known to work one sidereal day for every Earth Day and you know they're slightly

312
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,780
longer so...

313
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,880
Yes, here's part of our guest...

314
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,080
Yes, this is our...

315
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,000
This is the guest yeast for the evening.

316
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,040
He's a nice little job from Antares 4 and a half.

317
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:19,980
We picked up his signal last week and were able to tune him in and this is all he does.

318
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:27,460
He sits in his little trans-dimensional box and broadcasts this message to all of us.

319
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,780
And he is an illegal alien friend.

320
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,760
Real illegal and a real alien.

321
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,340
Ah yes, dear friends.

322
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,020
Welcome back to Antares 4.

323
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,560
Welcome back to the show.

324
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,600
The subgenius divival our friends.

325
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,300
Yes, and don't you...

326
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,640
This is Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

327
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,800
And Reverend Ivan Stang.

328
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,460
We're sitting here to bring you the word of dogs.

329
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,020
And don't you feel divived now?

330
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,260
Don't be afraid, it's just a little radio show.

331
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,100
Sometimes it gets scary.

332
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,140
Yeah, it's scary friends.

333
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,340
It's a scary show.

334
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,420
It could get scarier depending on what...

335
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,000
Whatever...

336
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,700
Whatever parakeet mixes we drop in.

337
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,340
That's right.

338
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,420
But remember one thing.

339
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,040
It doesn't matter what life cycle you belong to.

340
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,940
And whether your basic metabolism is carbon, silicon, or plasma.

341
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,120
We're broadcasting to you because this is the first intergalactic church of dogs.

342
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,100
Yes, friends.

343
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,760
This is the church for every form of life that knows how to snicker.

344
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,720
Yes, indeed.

345
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,560
Every life form that can enjoy and appreciate slack, dear friends.

346
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,920
Yes, and the mysteries.

347
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,760
Those who appreciate the mysteries.

348
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,160
Ah, the mysteries.

349
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,680
Yes.

350
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,580
That sweet, sweet burning mystery of slack.

351
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:59,800
Yes, and when finally they learn the answer to the mystery of why on that great day...

352
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,840
That one day the sound of the slack goes rippling.

353
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,620
And this is what it sounds like, friends.

354
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,540
Yes, listen to that slack rippling like...

355
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,020
Oh, isn't that a lovely sound?

356
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,020
Oh, yes.

357
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,040
Receive the splendor of that slack sound, friends.

358
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,960
Ah, yes.

359
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:28,040
Ah, doesn't it drip through your frontal lobes or depending upon your metabolism, of course, sometimes your back lobes.

360
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,320
Sometimes it just runs down their spine and dribbles out.

361
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,800
Sometimes it just dribbles through their cells and oozes through the pores.

362
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,960
Oh, yes.

363
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,560
But we know that somewhere out there you're listening to the sound of slack.

364
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,560
We can't give you too much of this air slack because...

365
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,420
Nay, nay.

366
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,220
No, no.

367
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,320
We can't let you get all hooked.

368
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,420
You'd just be sitting by your radios from now on.

369
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,200
You wouldn't be able to do anything.

370
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,940
Wait until next week when the subgenius hour of slack comes back.

371
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,040
Ah, but...

372
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,880
So that you can soak up some more of the healing power that can be mysteriously broadcast.

373
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,980
That's right.

374
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:09,540
So put your appendage, your pseudopod, your flipper, your hand, your manipulator, your chink, your...

375
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:09,540


376
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,240
Your mandible, whatever you got, friends.

377
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:20,820
It doesn't matter if it's a scaly, horny carapace or a squamous druid mollusk-like mucus-secreting skin.

378
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:32,780
Just place your little sensory appendage upon your transmitter receiver unit and you will receive the benefit of this slack, this air slack.

379
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,920
And when finally you discover the mystery, the answer to the mystery of the slack, why?

380
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:50,740
On that day, you will be killed and re-killed and re-killed again in the scalding and scathing acid love of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

381
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,140
Hallelujah.

382
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:51,860
Praise Bob.

383
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,380
Hallelujah.

384
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,820
E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I.

385
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,240
Ah, yes, friends.

386
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,460
Well, well, Dr. Stang, I think perhaps we ought to turn the slack generator down a little bit.

387
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,780
Let these poor...

388
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,780
Just soothe them out with it.

389
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,060
Don't drop them off sudden now.

390
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,480
Just there you are.

391
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,220
Yes, friends.

392
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,100
Just a rug.

393
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,060
A rug of slack underneath.

394
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,040
That little tiny layer that separates you from the hard, cold floor of reality.

395
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,980
Well, we'd love to get you hooked, but we wouldn't be able to supply it.

396
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,600
That's right.

397
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,520
It would be like Dawn of the Dead all over again.

398
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:30,320
Shambling zombies for Bob trying to get some more of that great stuff that they...

399
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,760
That beautiful, that beautiful essence, that vital secretion of the heart-soul of Dobbs,

400
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,460
that one thing that he possesses.

401
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,600
And that is more than any other entity in the universe.

402
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,660
And, friends, we're talking about slack.

403
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,000
And if you have...

404
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Don't you wish you had it?

405
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,480
Don't you wish you had that sound with you all the time?

406
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,980
Don't you like to wrap yourself up in that slack, that big, warm, fuzzy, wooly slack,

407
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,220
and just snuggle into it and say, ah...

408
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:05,380
If you had just one Bob pill, like this one in this little vial...

409
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:05,700
This one in the salt-free...

410
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,180
And we have one, listeners.

411
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,120
We have one.

412
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,280
And this one pill...

413
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:16,640
Would be enough to impart into you the essence of the stark fist of removal.

414
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,680
You would become Vishnu the Destroyer, friends.

415
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,420
That's right.

416
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,620
You would dance upon the helix of the ever-changing quantum universe, shifting your eigenstade.

417
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,720
Dogs have always been my friend.

418
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,140
We love shoes.

419
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,140


420
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,140


421
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,140


422
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,480
And we've had...

423
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,800
Many dogs during these years.

424
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,260
Now we have you.

425
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,920
Well, thank you, poor Beth.

426
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,260
If I'munkt due to have to do this in...

427
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,560
We've had.

428
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:08,560


429
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:08,580
Yes.

430
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,520
Best for the last.

431
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,660
He is the friendliest and the smartest.

432
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,260
And the most constant and the most attentive of all the dogs that I've known.

433
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,840
Best for the last.

434
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,080
He is the friendliest.

435
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,320
He is a wanderer and adventurer too.

436
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,980
He is the friendliest and the smartest.

437
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,600
And the smartest.

438
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:16,160
And the most constant and the most attentive of all the dogs that I've known.

439
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,640
The man told her he didn't belong to anyone in Johnson City.

440
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:45,360
That he must have just wandered in.

441
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:58,200
He just jumped out of someone's car.

442
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,220
Or we have always thought maybe he was with a circus.

443
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,360
But that's all this dog flew.

444
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,360


445
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,360


446
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,360


447
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,360


448
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,360


449
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,360


450
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,480
In my mind there is no one who but my darling dog.

451
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,840
Ricky has been here ever since.

452
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,720
I liked the world that if the owner ever ask about him to direct him here.

453
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,020
But I'm glad that the owner never missed him.

454
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,000
Because I surely would if he left me.

455
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:42,620
Me.

456
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:52,220
If you don't get some flea powder and bath, he wants to go in the car.

457
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,200
You want to go on a ride? You want to go see the cattle? You want to go see him?

458
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:56,780
Do you?

459
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,600
You want to come home?

460
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,040
You don't get it.

461
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,060
You want to go on a ride? You want to go see the cattle? You want to go see him?

462
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,340
Do you?

463
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,820
You want to go go see the family? You want to go see the family?

464
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,000
Do you?

465
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,680
You don't get it.

466
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:18,900
You want to go see the baby?

467
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
You don't get it.

468
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,600
Thank you.

469
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,760
Thank you.

470
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,240
Thank you.

471
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,600
Again, we're going to have to switch Ives and Stott.

472
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,880
What's wrong with this microphone?

473
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,480
There. Thank you.

474
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:52,380
Hey, that new church air is just great.

475
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,940
The new screen excitement you've been waiting for.

476
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,500
Rated PG.

477
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,540
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

478
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,000
Your doorbell rings.

479
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,520
And there's a chaplain standing quietly.

480
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,560
He tells you...

481
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,640
We're splashing liberation right around the world.

482
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,380
And we'll die to do it.

483
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,380
That's amazing.

484
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,940
Before making any additional statements about my subject,

485
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,420
I'd like to make it clear that

486
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,000
in any reference I make to the church

487
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,940
on today's broadcast,

488
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,240
I'll be speaking in broad

489
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,000
and certainly not specific

490
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,520
terms.

491
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,400
That is, I will be referring primarily

492
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,300
to the institutionalized church.

493
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,460
Everyone uses...

494
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,420
Now to continue with the tape recording.

495
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,140
We're going to see...

496
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,780
Get ready.

497
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,520
What I'm talking to you about today

498
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,260
is the most up-to-date thing

499
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,500
that I could talk to you about.

500
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
We're living in the closing moments

501
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,400
of this dispensation.

502
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
So, housewives, take this tip

503
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,940
from the growers of Idaho potatoes,

504
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,760
whose potatoes make delicious French flies.

505
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,640
And as we watched,

506
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,120
my friend very suddenly

507
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,680
and violently

508
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,280
vomited.

509
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,360
Who's going to listen to that?

510
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,000
And when they do, how are they going to feel?

511
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,680
Well, I don't have to think about that.

512
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,060
You do.

513
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,880
Wherever you are.

514
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,960
Wish you were a genius

515
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,240
but feel like only a sub-genius?

516
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,820
Have a kisser Darth Vader's mom would expunge?

517
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,360
Tired of gorge-clogging crypto-wimpism?

518
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,180
I have a solution.

519
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,840
Stay tuned in the weeks to come

520
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,700
for exciting lectures such as

521
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,480
Drink Your Way to Happiness

522
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,740
and a special tour of the Roy Rogers Museum

523
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,100
wherein Bob will prove the trigger has moved again.

524
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,380
All this and more on your favorite soundtrack

525
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,760
for a crumbling society,

526
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,780
Food Fights of the Gods.

527
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,120
All good.

528
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Great things are happening.

529
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,900
God is showing people things.

530
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,620
Many of you are hearing verses.

531
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,480
You're tormented.

532
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,920
Your mind is tormented.

533
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,640
You're fainting.

534
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,260
Some of you husbands and wives.

535
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,980
You mumble, grumble, complain,

536
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:14,840
frostbite.

537
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,800
You demon powers has tried to destroy

538
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,120
your marriage, your home.

539
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,800
So you need to come.

540
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,840
If you can't, man,

541
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,680
you ought to get these tapes anyhow

542
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,200
on Demonology.

543
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,100
Tape 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

544
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,980
And they're on right on up

545
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,920
till we get through.

546
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,980
And we'll be offering the tape on

547
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,300
Christmas.

548
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,920
You can be demon possessed

549
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,300
at the end of the program.

550
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,700
But we're going to take you

551
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,320
into that service right now.

552
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,440
We're going to take you

553
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,060
into that service in progress

554
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,840
where we are sharing on the subject

555
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,760
can a Christian be demon possessed.

556
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,200
Hundreds of New Yorkers

557
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,460
at a religious revival

558
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,360
chanting the name of a modern day prophet,

559
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,040
Bob.

560
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,440
Bob's teachings are the foundation

561
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,520
of a church that does little more

562
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,080
than perish.

563
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,480
It's a community called

564
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,340
St. American consumerism.

565
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,940
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.

566
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,980
Tom Vitale has this report.

567
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,380
You will pay to know what you really think.

568
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,340
But if you give us money,

569
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,240
we will tell you what to think.

570
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,220
And not only have you paid to know

571
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,000
what you really think,

572
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,060
for once you will get value for your dollars.

573
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,960
Americans will buy anything

574
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,080
and they're getting sold short.

575
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,060
That's the most important thing.

576
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,200
That's the message of the Church of the Subgenius

577
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
as delivered by the Pope of all New York,

578
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,300
David Meyer at a recent revival.

579
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,660
Meyer also instructed the enthusiastic crowd

580
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,140
in how to get slack,

581
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,960
how to get right with Bob,

582
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,040
and how to pull the wool over your own eyes.

583
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,800
For they shall see God.

584
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,400
It's still true.

585
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,440
God still speaks in special ways

586
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,600
to each of us today.

587
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,060
But my feelings toward him

588
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,080
are still so brittle and sour.

589
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,400
I don't care.

590
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:02,860
I don't care.

591
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:02,960
I don't care.

592
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,280
I don't care.

593
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't care.

594
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,680
I don't care.

595
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,000
I don't care.

596
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,360
I don't care.

597
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,680
I don't care anymore.

598
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,840
I'm tired.

599
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,560
I'm tired.

600
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:09,960
I'm tired.

601
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,440
I'm tired.

602
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,880
I can't tolerate it.

603
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,020
I can't live with it.

604
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,520
I can't.

605
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,120
Praise God.

606
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,640
And that's how I became a subgenius.

607
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,840
Children, the great Saint Lenny Bruce said,

608
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,980
American society cripples you

609
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,260
and arrests you for limping.

610
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,120
Here in the Church of the Subgenius we say,

611
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,480
cast off those crutches

612
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,640
and crawl with pride.

613
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:32,840
And I'm proud.

614
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,960
You can crawl again.

615
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,460
You can crawl again, children.

616
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,580
And this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

617
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,120
We've been playing media barrage tapes on these shows,

618
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,380
which are edited primarily by Puzzling Evidence

619
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,940
in Oakland, California,

620
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,800
Dr. Byron Werner in Los Angeles, California,

621
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,240
and me, Reverend Ivan Stang.

622
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,160
Of course, what I mainly do is just take the stuff

623
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,700
that people send in and rip them off to the max.

624
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,280
And now this side of the show is about to end, listener,

625
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,020
and you're going to have to flip this show over

626
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,580
in order to hear the rest of it.

627
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,880
Praise God.

628
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,780
Now, if you're tied up and can't get to the radio to do that,

629
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,560
why, let's just hope that you've got auto-reverse as we...

630
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,540
Welcome back, friends, to the Hour of Slack Radio Ministry

631
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,680
on K-N-O-N, the non-station...

632
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,660
This is for admirable people.

633
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,740
Let it out, let it out.

634
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,420
Aren't you worried? Don't you want to get out of here?

635
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,160
I'm never going to be grabbed on a mix of doctors.

636
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,780
Okay, Fred, Fred Pudge?

637
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,780
Yes, we dare you. Try it.

638
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,320
Okay, we're going to try it right now, Doc. Here we go.

639
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,880
Bob hung up on us. He is dead.

640
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:46,740
It's true.

641
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,600
Good morning, caller. What happened?

642
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,540
We have an unimaginable mission match.

643
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,860
Could it have been an automatic mechanical shutdown?

644
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,720
No, we're not going to cover anything.

645
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,620
Poor girl. She's in a bubbling vat of jokes.

646
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,440
I have to hear your question, but we're going to throw a tarp over it

647
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:57,760
and protect it from the elements.

648
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,520
Yeah, we might throw a tarp over it.

649
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,520
That's all we'll cover. This young lady has the jokes.

650
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:02,880
All day, yeah.

651
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,420
He's soaking in the jokes we're going to use.

652
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,080
If you come down to the station right now, we'll cover you up with something soft and warm, too.

653
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,280
We're going to have to reverse the charge.

654
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,880
I don't like it. I'm in the dark.

655
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,240
You've been in the dark a long time, Doc.

656
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,340
I do like it. I want to go home.

657
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,420
This is the most miserable thing I've ever seen. It's joyous.

658
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,100
It's too late. You joined the Church of the Subgenius.

659
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,360
That's too bad, boys.

660
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,040
Now you know what subgenius hell is really like, yes?

661
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,200
Live it, laugh it, and die.

662
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,020
I bet you can't say sembrunibus.

663
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,020


664
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,500
We can listen to that. They're in hell.

665
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,520
We can view their dead souls in hell and they're still put to death during the show.

666
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:44,500
These demons follow. It's endless. You can't hang up on them.

667
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,420
Or if you do, they just call mine again.

668
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,100
The endless show.

669
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,320
Bit. Blivit bit.

670
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,300
Blivit, blavit, and blavit.

671
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,660
I bet you can't say sembrunibus.

672
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,340
You can blub it or you can blivit.

673
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,500
I can't blab such a thing.

674
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,820
I can't blab such a thing.

675
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,980
You'll have to listen very, very carefully.

676
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:11,880
I have your son in a brown paper bag and if you don't do what I say, you'll be dragged into midst me.

677
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,300
You create problems that you can't possibly be able to come to terms with.

678
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,360
If my demands are not met, I will kill a policeman.

679
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,060
A nun or a funny thing.

680
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,840
There's the little head and it's the little head coffin.

681
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,600
That's right. And one neck bone.

682
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,860
And one neck bone.

683
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,600
Moving to the large pit to be buried with the rebar.

684
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:44,740
I think that they run the show but little do they know that they have put so much of their energy into the show that the show is now a great shambling entity within itself.

685
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,040
The hideous show.

686
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:55,220
And they are mere organs within this great hideous, drooling, rugo squamous sesquipedalian show.

687
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,600
No kidding.

688
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,960
And our listeners of our show must suffer the same way.

689
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,700
Because it's their show that's our show.

690
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,260
That's right.

691
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,900
You can't keep track of it.

692
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,740
But it's following you all the time.

693
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,620
Go ahead. Try to turn it off.

694
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,660
We'll keep hearing it.

695
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,020
The endless show.

696
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,300
The show of shows.

697
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,460
Yes. Hell on earth.

698
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,460
Oh yeah, you think, well it's funny. I'm on radio personality.

699
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,480
I'm just going to have me a show.

700
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,160
Yee-haw. Yes sir, ee-bob.

701
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:39,480
And then you've been on that show and you've been on that show and you look at your calendar watch one day and you realize that the last half an hour has taken a little over 143 years.

702
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:46,340
And you begin to wonder, you begin to wonder what is the deal with this Bob Dobbs character?

703
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,620
And what is this time control?

704
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,460
And these subgenius characters on their radio shows.

705
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,580
What's this Dobbs drone signal they constantly signal?

706
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,280
What do they speak of?

707
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,220
Yes, what is the Dobbs drone signal?

708
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:07,800
The thing that locks into their very innermost self and draws out that which it desires.

709
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,260
Ah yes, dear friends.

710
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,660
Makes that gland grow.

711
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,940
And it's too late now.

712
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:21,360
Even if you unplug your radio, why, even when you can't hear the show, the show can hear you.

713
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,800
This is the show that listens back, friends.

714
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,640
Face it.

715
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,020
1984 happened a year ago.

716
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,180
We were doing the implementing of the big I's.

717
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,900
The I of taxis, dear friends.

718
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,600
Remember the I of every year here in Texas.

719
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,120
The I of taxis.

720
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,820
It watches.

721
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,180
Yeah, yeah.

722
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,900
Ever been kicked in the taxis, my friends?

723
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,600
Yes.

724
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Anybody ever got you around Yirya Blancas lately?

725
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,160
No.

726
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,620
What kind of a show do you think?

727
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,300
I don't know what you think this is.

728
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,680
Just your average little rock and roll music show.

729
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,840
Your average comedy talk show.

730
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,280
Your average satire and social comment and parody show.

731
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,720
It's a squeaky show is what it is.

732
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,940
That's right, dear friends.

733
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,660
It's the dead sub-genius in the middle of the road hour.

734
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,640
The dead sub-genius in the middle of the road hour.

735
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,320
I could forget all that stuff now.

736
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,260
It wasn't important anymore.

737
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:28,960
That's better.

738
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,480
That's what I would say.

739
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:30,700
Huh?

740
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,920
I feel better.

741
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,560
Mom, mom!

742
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,940
And there is power when on the church of the sub-genius radio show,

743
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,120
the doctors of the air operate without warning.

744
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,800
Yes.

745
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,040
Here they come.

746
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,600
Warning. We will operate soon.

747
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,200
Warning.

748
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,620
Warning.

749
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,120
Warning.

750
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,980
We must warn.

751
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,820
It doesn't have to be true.

752
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,740
Well, here we are again.

753
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,140
It just doesn't have to be true.

754
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,440
We're always here.

755
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,960
Your final instructions?

756
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,700
I may sound like a Bible-beater yelling up a revival at a river crossing camp meeting,

757
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,920
but that don't change the truth none.

758
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

759
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:09,180
I want to see if one person, one single person,

760
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,940
will have the courage of their convictions and come down here and open up to Bob

761
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,740
and give them, give me their wallet.

762
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,400
I don't just want your money.

763
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,580
Don't just want your credit cards.

764
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,440
We want your library cards, your voter registration.

765
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,120
Give it all up now.

766
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:25,940
Okay?

767
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,560
One person, that's all we need.

768
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,160
Actually, Bob doesn't care.

769
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,860
Bob is the richest man on earth.

770
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,580
He doesn't care if you spend money.

771
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:33,800
Bob could give, frankly.

772
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,300
All he wants is souls.

773
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,880
He wants you to have slack.

774
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,160
He wants you to fight the conspiracy.

775
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,480
And it is going to take some fighting because they are everywhere.

776
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,360
Powerful charity.

777
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,180
The conspiracy is everywhere.

778
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:52,960
The television shows you watch, the rock and roll songs that they play over and over and over and over again.

779
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,420
Of course.

780
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,340
This station excluded.

781
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:54,680
What is that they are doing that for?

782
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,140
President's company excluded.

783
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,000
But J.R. Bob Dobbs is here to spread abnormality.

784
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,640
Yes, the seed of Bob is your abnormality potential.

785
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,060
We're not talking about this consumer abnormality.

786
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,440
No, sir.

787
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,440
We're not looking for a hip audience.

788
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,340
Please, get me behind the hip.

789
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,240
We're not looking for a sophisticated audience.

790
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,880
Oh, certainly not.

791
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,300
We're looking for an audience that is willing to believe everything.

792
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:22,640
An audience that cannot escape because only then does it stop being an audience and participate in the isness of Bob.

793
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,580
The last thing that we want is a vast stadium full of geeks, 80,000 strong, waiting for us to come on stage and entertain them.

794
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,100
We want them to found their own church.

795
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,100
Get on the streets and entertain themselves.

796
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,720
Bob preaches short duration personal saviors.

797
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,400
You should skip from one personal savior to the next.

798
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,400
It could be a wine bottle.

799
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,140
We live in a consumer society, ladies and gentlemen.

800
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,460
Planned obsolescence.

801
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,540
Things wear out fast.

802
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,340
Not our fault.

803
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,960
That's the way it is and we understand.

804
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,880
Because Bob came.

805
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,440
Bob doesn't care about your sins.

806
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,960
Bob won't die for your sins because Bob's not the son of God.

807
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,440
Bob won't die for your sins.

808
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,800
Bob won't forgive you for your sins.

809
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,100
All Bob cares about is that Bob will justify your sins.

810
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,300
He'll justify your sins and make them part of his plan.

811
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,160
The lights have gone down just slightly.

812
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,460
The Mister Science Lecture Series.

813
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,180
Volume 1, Number 1.

814
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,560
The Mutron.

815
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,700
Delivered by the Reverend Seth Deitch, First Church of Mister Science, Boston.

816
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:44,700
Outside the realm of conspiracy science and in the clear light of the so-called forbidden sciences,

817
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,680
we will find we have a far greater chance of understanding the true nature of the universe.

818
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,280
What the conspiracy feeds us under the guise of the most advanced system of natural philosophy

819
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:04,540
is nothing but a complex sham, a decoy to hide from us the true fact of how much bigger and more complex

820
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,180
and nut-wrenchingly frightening a place the universe really is.

821
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:16,520
We are told about matter and energy and space and time as being either consistent realities governed by laws

822
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:22,360
or as foggy abstracts that have no particular being outside of that of being convenient,

823
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,860
linguistic aids to make the whole thing easier to swallow.

824
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,900
We at the Temporal Management Research Facility of the Church of Mister Science of the Subgenius

825
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:37,420
have through rigorous probing through mountains of existing material known works on the subject of time

826
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:43,280
and its methods of control, have discovered the key for blowing the whistle on the whole fraudulent twaddle

827
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,340
that is modern science.

828
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,240
This key is the Mutron.

829
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,540
The truth must now be told.

830
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,340
How it was covered up for some reason.

831
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,460
The fact that the Mutron was so long would make a story intriguing enough for a separate book,

832
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,680
but it's too involved to be told here.

833
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:03,280
The actual issue at hand is the Mutron and its pivotal role in the management of the true cosmos.

834
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:10,600
In order to properly understand the following, it must first be made clear what actually constitutes an elementary particle.

835
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:19,360
The first of these basic particles is the electron, which has no mass but possesses a charge that is commonly described as possibly infinite,

836
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,080
thus making it the fundamental unit of energy.

837
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:29,600
It and other related particles, i.e. positrons, photons, gravitons, etc., acting in concert,

838
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,700
make up the Iacotismic field which is responsible for holding everything that is anything together.

839
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,900
The second is the much rarer infinite mass particle, commonly called a black hole.

840
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:49,040
These particles, like the electrons, occupy no space, but the influence of a single particle can be felt at a much greater distance.

841
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,320
They often have event horizons many miles wide.

842
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,800
Beyond which not even light can escape.

843
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,320
The third fundamental particle is the Mutron.

844
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:10,500
The Mutron carries with it an infinite temporal capacity that makes it alter the rate and intensity and general quality of the passage through time of anything it touches.

845
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,580
The Mutron is very likely the rarest particle in this universe.

846
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:22,280
As far as we know, there might well be only one of them, though there could be as many as a few dozen without generating a dangerous concentration.

847
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:32,580
The first segment of this report will deal with the general implications of the Mutron in regards to existing ideas on the workings of the universe.

848
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:41,660
The second will concern the incredible potentialities of using the potent forces of the Mutron in time control research and in practical time control.

849
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,500
Section A. Just how...

850
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,840
Big everything really is.

851
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,260
What we know is the universe can be in big numbers.

852
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:52,260


853
00:43:52,280 --> 00:44:03,700
The universe is provisioned as a giant atom with the black hole acting as the nucleus and the mutron or mutrons acting as the electron cloud with the electrons providing the energy for the mutron to drive us forward through time.

854
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:09,340
Just about everything else in the universe is just so much debris cluttering up the works of things.

855
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:14,060
The fact that there is one such atom more than suggests the existence of others.

856
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,840
Section B. The Mutron has a corresponding antiparticle known as the tachyon,

857
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,600
which travels through time in a direction which we perceive as backwards,

858
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,040
so that to someone who is not in the know it will appear to exceed the speed of light.

859
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:35,900
The simple fact of the matter is that tachyons are extra universal mutrons impinging on our universe at a different temporal angle.

860
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,800
These are the mutrons of atom universes that ours is in compound with.

861
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,620
After this the atomic metaphor breaks down.

862
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:57,260
No atom of mere matter divides itself into alternate cells almost constantly, but our universe does.

863
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:04,380
All the time the universe splits in order to express every alternative open to any phenomenon transpiring within,

864
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,920
no matter how small or seemingly insignificant.

865
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:12,120
This is the only way our minds can express the perception of the fifth dimension,

866
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,020
or more properly the second dimension of time.

867
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,320
So this introduces the concept of time viewed as a plane,

868
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,220
rather than a line.

869
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,600
But there is another dimension of space,

870
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,840
so is the case with time, there is also a corresponding up-down time.

871
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,340
This is the direction in which our mental eyes exist.

872
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,340
In this direction we find alternate time tracks similar to the sidewise ones,

873
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:41,360
with the difference being that theirs is oriented in the direction opposed to temporal gravity,

874
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:47,960
so that elements of those other selves are constantly falling into our awareness from above.

875
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,820
The mutron passes through all these spaces with equal ease,

876
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:58,320
and is modulated by them much like the photon is modulated by bouncing off or passing through matter.

877
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:06,460
Thus information of a very subtle and distorted nature is conveyed to us from our other universes on the mutron express.

878
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,480
We call this information Gnosis,

879
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:15,640
and its influence has been felt by mankind time and again for as long back as we have records,

880
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,500
and no doubt back to our very genesis and before.

881
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:25,180
The earliest known mutron impact on Earth occurred in the era of the dawn of life.

882
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,720
The primordial sea teamed with the most primitive of bacteria.

883
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,180
Their genetic material was a simple molecule shaped like a lumpy ladder.

884
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,340
It was very chemically stable.

885
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:42,540
The mutron passed through Earth and spewed out a wake that left each and every molecule of DNA twisted beyond recognition.

886
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,900
In this state its stability was ruined,

887
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,300
and any force or random glitch that Mother Nature had to do

888
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,660
or had to offer changed it somehow.

889
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,320
Thus evolution had begun.

890
00:46:54,180 --> 00:47:00,020
Another notable mutron impact occurred about 60 million years ago at the end of the age of the dinosaurs.

891
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,420
The particle struck and its wake left the intelligence of the dinosaurs increased a million fold.

892
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,120
They promptly sat down, figured out how to teleport,

893
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,820
and promptly took off on around the universe vacation.

894
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,360
Presumably they will someday return.

895
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,300
Another notable mutron impact occurred in the era of the dawn of life.

896
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,860
The first mutron impact, only about 5 million years ago,

897
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,960
was responsible for the division of the human and yeti races.

898
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,920
The vast majority of these events, however, affect individual beings or objects.

899
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,540
One such example is Great Britain's Stonehenge Monument,

900
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,000
which was not man-made as is popularly presumed,

901
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,660
but is merely the material evidence of a rather minor mutron splash.

902
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,040
Certain great sages of the past and present have actually had mutrons pass directly through their crania.

903
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:55,980
A partial listing of these select people will give an idea of the effects that may be expected of such an encounter.

904
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,620
Gautama Buddha, the prophet Enoch,

905
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,540
Ankh-Natan, Leonardo, William Beckford, Alastair Fowley,

906
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,060
Marcel Duchamp, R. Buckminster Fuller, Antonio Gaudi, Arnold Palmer, the list goes on.

907
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:15,500
It's interesting to note that J.R. Bob Dobbs is the only known human being through whom a mutron has passed twice.

908
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,900
After going through the back of his head,

909
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,280
it was reflected by the mystery of the mutron.

910
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,700
The mystery of the universe is the most important thing in the history of the universe.

911
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:22,760
The mystery of the universe is the most important thing in the history of the universe.

912
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,640
In the light of this particular view, one might ask,

913
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,620
what about the Big Bang and all that stuff?

914
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,960
Well, it seems that matter does not play a very big role in the actual nuts and bolts operation of the universe.

915
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:40,440
In fact, we find that it is the case in about half the universe's sample that there is no matter at all.

916
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,400
Section B. What we must do about all this.

917
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,280
It is well known that the electron can be pressed into service for all kinds of purposes.

918
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:49,820
It is well known that the electron can be pressed into service for all kinds of purposes.

919
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,260
It might be less well known that alien civilizations of a level only slightly more advanced than ours

920
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:00,800
routinely use the enormous power made available by tapping into the gravity fluxes of quantum black holes.

921
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,120
It is also possible to use the time potentials of the mutron to our own great advantage.

922
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,280
The mutron is not subject to the same methods of coercion that we use to bend normal subatomic particles to our will.

923
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,880
They are oblivious to matter and energy alike.

924
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,220
They are oblivious to matter and energy alike.

925
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:22,260
But the thought, because of its intimate relationship with time, does have some small effect.

926
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:26,520
Mutrons are attracted to areas of concentrated slackful enlightenment.

927
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:36,360
A mutron container accelerator could be charged with a mutron if enough slackful minds concentrated their energies around a scoop entrance to the mutron accelerator.

928
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:44,580
Once contained therein, it would take relatively little effort on the part of these minds to maintain it in a circular path.

929
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,200
Once contained therein, it would take relatively little effort on the part of these minds to maintain it in a circular path.

930
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,580
The size of the accelerator needed is the size of the accelerator.

931
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:55,380
It is a property of the mutron that it will only travel in the most gentle of curves.

932
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,800
The minimum diameter of a circle to be traveled by a mutron is approximately 1000 miles.

933
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:07,700
Fortunately, we have easy access to an extraterrestrial body more than three times that size.

934
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,000
Earth's moon.

935
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:16,240
The accelerator can be built in a ring completely circumnavigating the lunar sphere about 100 feet below its surface.

936
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,500
Because of the mental effort that would run it, it would be known as the psychotron.

937
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,720
The psychotron would be a valuable tool in the use of practical time control.

938
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:33,960
By accelerating the mutron in one direction or another, the entire moon could be induced to follow it in whatever temporal direction it might be directed.

939
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,940
Forward, backward, sideways or up-down.

940
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,180
Having this ability opens amazing possibilities.

941
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:46,220
It is my proposal that this device be constructed for use in a major project to concentrate the energy of the moon.

942
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:46,220


943
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,020
It is a very important tool in the development of the universe.

944
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,400
The single most radiant personality among modern men is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

945
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,740
There are other alternate Bob's existing in other alternate time tracks.

946
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:04,460
Not all of them are as prominent as our Bob, but still are privy to the same great gnosis.

947
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,560
Others are already the rulers of their respective Earths.

948
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,100
All though, are truly Bob.

949
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,200
Imagine if we could travel to those alternative time streams

950
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,280
and convince all of those Bob's to return to our world.

951
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,900
This is exactly what I am suggesting.

952
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,720
The formation of the Congress of Bob's.

953
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,300
Yes my friends, this is our mission.

954
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,020
Those who wish to donate to the psychotron project

955
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:35,000
will be given a free ride to the alternate world of their choice once the project is complete.

956
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,520
Thank you.

957
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,000
Ready to shout out to all the members of the overlap team.

958
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,540
The project ấyلس unosu Exportas

959
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,060
It is going to large open to let automobiles to come out of their

960
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,120
downtown greatest Michigan.

961
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:15,180
I hope you are doing a great job and simple of you to get the piece of concrete go to

962
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:15,180


963
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:15,700
production.

964
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,460
No, the audience is not far away.

965
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,400
The Master Control Show

966
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,680
here in the Master Control Program

967
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,640
is controlling the show.

968
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,780
And this show will be the show

969
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,160
that you'll probably never hear.

970
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,580
And this show will go off

971
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,360
to another subgenius show

972
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,560
in another land.

973
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,260
And that will be a third show

974
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,800
layered upon this show.

975
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,980
And after that show,

976
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,980
it will go on and continue

977
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,560
spreading like a virus,

978
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,820
layer upon layer upon layer

979
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,120
fading in and out from one another

980
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,720
like hideous...

981
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,740
Well, here we are again.

982
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,560
It just doesn't have to be yesterday.

983
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,060
Your final instructions?

984
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:12,860
That's right.

985
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,180
And if you are a nice listener,

986
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:14,820
we're going to read

987
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,980
the whole phone book to you.

988
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,820
Everyone's in the phone book.

989
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,700
That's right.

990
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,140
Remember something I mentioned this morning.

991
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:20,980
We're over the air.

992
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,300
Behold, the bowels of the heavens

993
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,800
shall be opened to smite

994
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,260
and trump the earth with strangeness.

995
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:26,700
You, look.

996
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,920
It's the colon of the earth.

997
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,700
Let's pretend like we have a contest going.

998
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,300
We'll just call people in the phone book

999
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,220
and say, you won.

1000
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,860
A little bit farther up the colon.

1001
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,580
Yes, there it is.

1002
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,560
Lips flapping in the wind.

1003
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,520
It doesn't have to be today.

1004
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,540
Like hideous...

1005
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,380
Words of reincarnation.

1006
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,860
Words of reincarnation.

1007
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,680
In a hell spirit world

1008
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,180
that you don't even know about

1009
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,540
because you're too ignorant.

1010
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,180
Ignorant because you're just a listener.

1011
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:51,720
That's all.

1012
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,900
Just a mere listener.

1013
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,400
You're all the pathetic fools.

1014
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,500
The earth fools.

1015
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,660
Oh, ye stiff-legged,

1016
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,200
ye, ye pathetic,

1017
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,680
third-dimensional creatures.

1018
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,140
If you could but know,

1019
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,460
could but dream for an instant

1020
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,220
of that which could await you,

1021
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,820
were you good enough?

1022
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,700
You'll be a listener, just like me, caller.

1023
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:15,980
To...

1024
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,000
Friends.

1025
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,060
Oh, yes, that little Jerry Jeff.

1026
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,060
There's no escape.

1027
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,140
I guess we should carry it again.

1028
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:26,120
Literally no escape from the show that never ends.

1029
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,340
Oh, wasn't there some rock and roll song

1030
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,180
about the show that never ends?

1031
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,160
The tape machine and the...

1032
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,340
The bulk eraser.

1033
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,600
The Jerry Jeff creature.

1034
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,780
Is it a deadly caller?

1035
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,540
Call subgenial security staff

1036
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,200
on your priority code channels

1037
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:39,640
and make any...

1038
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,720
This message will not repeat.

1039
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,100
Thank you for your attention.

1040
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,020
Please, make a note of it.

1041
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,520
I got a joke.

1042
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,540
How did Jerry Jeff caller

1043
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,460
get the chicken fried steak out of his armpits?

1044
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,740
The trick of picking chicken

1045
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,020
is picking what chicken to pick.

1046
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,420
Baaah!

1047
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,000
You can't get it out of your armpits

1048
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,340
once it's put in the way he does it.

1049
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,200
Arms for defense?

1050
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,380
Those arms are the pits.

1051
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:56,240
Yes.

1052
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,040
Keep on arming.

1053
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:57,940
Well, Jerry Jeff...

1054
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,440
We armed the...

1055
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,740
Oh, you'll wind up in the pits, yes.

1056
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:00,320
We need to do right now.

1057
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,380
The basic message of today's military environment.

1058
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,620
It's quiet out there.

1059
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,440
We're gonna take you to a piece of tough rib eye steak

1060
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,280
and we're gonna pound you to the...

1061
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,280
He's a flibberty gibbet

1062
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,700
and a hick Dominica Honda Sock-de-loo rib ticker.

1063
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,780
Step two, yes, right.

1064
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,520
Let's call it a necessary, completely unauthorized,

1065
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,080
and overextended military operation

1066
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,620
in a completely virgin environment.

1067
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,980
The zickering of a thicket of gigantic crickets.

1068
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,200
Yes, the thickering of the...

1069
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,220
I'll just turn that down.

1070
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,640
We don't want any of that stuff happening here.

1071
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,740
In the swamp bongs the gongs of a throng of frogs

1072
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,600
while a knee-deep sheep bleats in a slippery stream

1073
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,880
where slimy snakes whisper sinful secrets.

1074
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,080
Let's go back to the knee-deep sheep dip, okay?

1075
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,840
The knee-deep sheep dip dipped deep down below

1076
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,480
the steep and chilly waters

1077
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,400
of the deep stream, floats on the surface

1078
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,160
like the ancient Egyptians floated on the current

1079
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,760
of their belief, for they thought they would never die,

1080
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,980
but be reborn as gargling sarcophagi,

1081
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,780
horrible mummies to march across the earth

1082
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,900
and wreak and spew vengeance.

1083
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,000
Give me the pyroflagellator.

1084
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,260
All of the little tiny dead deities

1085
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,380
march down the side of the subgenius church

1086
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,880
and now it ends at night.

1087
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,240
Within the great pyramid,

1088
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,900
the secret chamber of the subgenius...

1089
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:09,920
My God!

1090
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,340
... always enters the...

1091
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,960
What light and steam come from the special effects department

1092
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,240
located below the pyramid?

1093
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,060
... here inside the heart of the mighty structure,

1094
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,140
puzzling evidence broadcasts

1095
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,540
from the inner chamber of the great pyramid.

1096
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,900
Yeah, I'll teach you all how to talk on the radio.

1097
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:24,460
Come on down.

1098
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,680
Yes, these giant pyramids are actually radio stations

1099
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,400
of a primitive nature, which broadcast by the strange...

1100
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,180
I'll play rock and roll until everybody falls apart.

1101
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,820
I'll copy that old Procter & Bergman movie.

1102
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,260
Then they would show the strange films

1103
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,980
to the walls of the...

1104
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:38,900
Come on, let's watch a J-man.

1105
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,020
... old Peter Preece.

1106
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:43,000
... mummified kitty cats in their canopic jars

1107
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
would ever view these great epics.

1108
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,140
Oh, why did they have to keep Paul Kitty's brain

1109
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,360
out through her nostrils?

1110
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,260
The cat, as well as the diggy dog,

1111
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,700
was a mysterious and powerful god

1112
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,100
that had to be placated.

1113
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,500
What a powerful god.

1114
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,680
Let's play rock and roll.

1115
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,840
They would have chopped Kitty's nostrils

1116
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,120
out through her brain with a little machine they've invented.

1117
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,260
Yes, they drew your brain out through your nostrils

1118
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,180
with silver hooks.

1119
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,640
This I learned at the house of my father,

1120
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,360
the brain extractor by the Nile.

1121
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,960
But I haven't finished with that brain.

1122
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,340
That is all right, Senhuay.

1123
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,480
You may have the brain of the next traveler

1124
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,440
who passes by.

1125
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,620
Ah, my son, there are many brains for us to work on.

1126
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,200
For the land of Egypt is mighty and rich,

1127
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,480
and the Nile Belt is...

1128
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,820
Brain after brain was passed

1129
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,340
from one listener to another,

1130
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,800
and they would call the show and fight the show.

1131
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,960
Suddenly they saw a little brat in the bulrushes

1132
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,360
in a basket.

1133
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,840
I see you down there, little caller.

1134
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,820
Remember the cat park?

1135
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,100
How can so many people be without one brain?

1136
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,940
I have only one brain to divide amongst all these.

1137
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,860
And so little Senhuay learned of head launching

1138
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,660
and how it was done by the mighty river.

1139
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,520
A Vic Morrow and, uh...

1140
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,740
Ah, the holy Vic Morrow.

1141
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,460
The only true head launching done here in California.

1142
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,340
By a professional crew.

1143
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,540
And filmed the right way.

1144
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,500
Not this false Arnold Palmer garbage.

1145
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,100
No, Arnold Schwarzenegger would have made it worse.

1146
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,520
But we can't talk about that because it would leave the state

1147
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,640
of the nation live, open to libel and slander.

1148
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,120
That's our lawyer now!

1149
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,260
Oh my God, he heard us!

1150
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,180
That guy's gonna sue us about the bleeding handle...

1151
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,660
Subliminal message.

1152
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,960
Station KXCI in Tucson, Arizona.

1153
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,320
Station KABF in Little Rock, Arkansas.

1154
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,160
As Hal falls back on reading the list of stations

1155
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,980
that don't play any of this stuff ever again.

1156
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,220
They don't anymore either.

1157
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,380
We wonder exactly what it all means.

1158
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,160
But he calls it all the time.

1159
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,220
Ladies and gentlemen,

1160
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,360
what kind of band is this?

1161
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,820
What kind of song is this?

1162
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,380
What do they know of life?

1163
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,580
First, we've just gained virtually all of the subgenius funds

1164
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,880
and absconded and lived in luxury for many years thereafter.

1165
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,800
Hi, little caller.

1166
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,780
And now it's showtime.

1167
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,080
Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

1168
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,280
The show that dare not even exist.

1169
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,180
And the sun comes up over northern central California.

1170
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,640
And we wonder why we're awake.

1171
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,740
It's only five.

1172
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,040
It's four on Friday afternoon.

1173
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,700
We're finishing the last tape of the show now.

1174
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,180
In 24 hours, people will hear this show on the radio.

1175
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,600
And they'll think it's loud.

1176
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,660
And they'll call up and pretend.

1177
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,960
That's those shows still going?

1178
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,400
Oh yeah, that show's still running endlessly,

1179
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,000
mindlessly,

1180
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,780
reasonlessly,

1181
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,640
like most lives nowadays.

1182
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,880
No guidance, no center.

1183
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,500
Yes, yes.

1184
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,620
Hear that sound, dear friends?

1185
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,380
Do you hear that low, mournful sound?

1186
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,380
That's the sound of a normal soul floating off,

1187
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:05,480
unhinged, and its anchor raised,

1188
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:13,960
leaving its body and floating off to join the other normal souls

1189
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,820
in the great syrup where they're all stirred together

1190
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,000
to be reborn again, all exactly alike.

1191
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:40,820
And here, high atop the inner First Bank building in Dallas, Texas,

1192
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:45,980
we broadcast this news of the final truth,

1193
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:50,260
the ultimate punchline of the end of the universe to you,

1194
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,340
the mere listener.

1195
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,160
Ah, yes.

1196
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,340
The show comes in for a landing once again.

1197
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,280
Hyper jump.

1198
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,980
Okay, can you take it from here?

1199
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,080
Because run the older computer on seven.

1200
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,500
I've got to go over there again.

1201
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,240
Oh, you're gonna play with the beast again, eh?

1202
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,420
No, the beast's been programmed.

1203
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,740
It's doing the squid run right now,

1204
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,820
but I have to get some more of that froth, Doctor.

1205
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,760
Oh, oh wait, there's...

1206
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,140
Good Lord!

1207
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,980
You have...

1208
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,000
You, Doctor, have consumed an entire bathtub

1209
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,900
full of the sacred Tibetan herb,

1210
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,300
I have a froth zip you off.

1211
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,480
Wait, wait a minute, listen.

1212
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:32,520
Listen.

1213
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,220
It's Recon Metal 12.

1214
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,040
Report to Launch Base D.

1215
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,300
Launch Base D.

1216
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:38,820
Hey, we've got to...

1217
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,280
Well, hold on.

1218
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:43,020
We'll be back after this message.

1219
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:50,700
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1220
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,440
And so we find our time running out again, as I say,

1221
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,720
the same way every show, it all ends the same way.

1222
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,500
And I would recommend reading Per Scripture 16, 14, 17, 18,

1223
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,040
and you can write for information

1224
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,660
on how to receive these precious subgenius tapes,

1225
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,900
because, friends, we need blankets and contraceptives

1226
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,100
for those boys and girls in the home for slackless children.

1227
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,840
Your contributions also keep those we hate starving to death.

1228
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,800
I command you to spill your gift seed pledge

1229
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,900
of 100 pounds of dollar bills in my lap,

1230
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:31,380
as this will buy modeling clay and transformer toys

1231
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,160
for those poor children's dogs.

1232
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,980
We'll bless you for planting this seed, Faith.

1233
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,200
Ah, yes, amen.

1234
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:41,660
And now our announcer will give you our mailing address.

1235
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:59,300
That's the Church of the Subgenius P.O. Box 807 Glenrose, TX 76043.

This is Reverend Ivan Stanks.

1239
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,100
I conscribed the Church of the Subgenius.

1240
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,080
This time with Dr. G. Gordon Gordon from the Brazilian Clench.

1241
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,020
Pope of all South America.

1242
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,800
Praise Bob, my friends, and let there be swag.

1243
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:33,040
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1244
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,740
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1245
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:50,180
Drinking Budweiser.

1246
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:54,080
Watching Bob on TV.

1247
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:59,220
Oh, swallowing redneck.

1248
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,680
The day my coon dog died

1249
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,640
Reading the pamphlet

1250
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,760
Over and over again

1251
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:18,320
I was drinking Budweiser

1252
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,880
And Bob was on TV
