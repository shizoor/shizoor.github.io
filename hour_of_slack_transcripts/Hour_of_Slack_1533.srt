1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Okay, they're watching. The audience is listening or something, recording. Everything's going fine. No problem.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,680
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea.

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:21,440
Flash, the Church of the Subgenius Festival in Wisteria, Ohio, is now raging in its third day.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,300
Is it the third day or the fourth day?

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Well, it's...

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,140
It depends on how you look at it.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:32,040
According to the conspiracy calendar, this is only the beginning of the third day.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,040
But radio-wise, this is day number five.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,180
We've done four previous shows.

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,020
The fifth day of these award-winning subgenius podcasts.

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,920
And we're joined this time by Reverend Fox from Orlando, the Orlando Clench.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,280
Yes, you can tell us what it's like down there.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,480
They made money.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,620
They did the revival.

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,460
They did the revival last Saturday.

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,420
And it was the first profitable revival in a century.

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,440
Well, you can't do it right the first time.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,600
What did you do wrong?

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,520
Pretty much everything.

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,280
If you just kind of let everything just go and just let Bob slide into the bright holes,

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,540
then the revival just kind of fills with that natural slack cheese.

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,400
Ew.

23
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,000
And it's, you know...

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,920
Aren't you sorry you asked?

25
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,120
That slack cheese.

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,100
That slack cheese.

27
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,080
But there is no stigma to this slack cheese.

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,260
No, it's quite well on a sandwich.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,420
We've been ingesting slack cheese sandwiches for the past several days up at a...

30
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,420
Let's table the controversial subject of sandwiches for the moment.

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,040
And now we seem to...

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,120
Bob came to a shrieking halt along with the show in its golf cart.

33
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,720
We should do one of these shows on a golf cart traveling around.

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,300
Yeah, we ought to.

35
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:55,600
That's...

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:55,600


37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,220
That sounds like just the thing.

38
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,660
And how come they get the cart and we have to trudge our foot?

39
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,640
Well, because this isn't Burning Man, that's why.

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,940
Why, I ought to...

41
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,180
Burning Man, there's...

42
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,640
You can ride around on a truck doing a television show.

43
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,400
Yeah.

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,520
Remember on the mobile living room?

45
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,680
Yes, yes, we've done that.

46
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,420
Chuck, what's his name, sets up an entire...

47
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,040
Chuck Serino.

48
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,180
Yeah, he sets up a whole TV studio.

49
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,920
Well, those aren't government drones above Wisteria.

50
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,560
I'm pretty sure that's all private television stations.

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,600
Getting ready...

52
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,720
Everybody for their new fall lineup.

53
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,220
Secret Lives of Subgeniuses on NBC.

54
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,720
Everybody line up and fall.

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,360
Well, if you can tell the things in the sky looking at you are machines,

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,420
those are the ones you don't have to worry about.

57
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,060
A friend of mine recently informed me that when you see, quote,

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,420
hawks flying around overhead,

59
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,820
especially when you're driving to some little activist meeting,

60
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,520
that's Obama's spies.

61
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,380
Those are...

62
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,200
They're actually drones.

63
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,360
He just noticed hawks.

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,900
They look like they are devilishly realistic robots that look like birds.

65
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,740
Obama's army of hawks and vultures.

66
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,720
This friend...

67
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,400
An owl.

68
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,440
...was not kidding.

69
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,500
No, of course not.

70
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:18,240
She really felt that she was being followed around by Obama drone hawks, fake hawks.

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,400
And she had some way of telling them apart.

72
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,060
Oh, that was...

73
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,260
Real hawks only travel in pairs.

74
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,620
Not true.

75
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,440
There were three.

76
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,780
Of course it's true.

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,460
I read it on my Facebook feed.

78
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,200
It's like I have my own Alex Jones buddy.

79
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,700
Well...

80
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,480
She's real nice.

81
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,980
Who knows what's up there these days?

82
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,060
But a lot of people never looked at the skies

83
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,340
until they felt a certain sensation of being watched.

84
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,800
And then, of course...

85
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,620
They just want the attention.

86
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,740
That's what Facebook is all about.

87
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,460
They wish someone...

88
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,680
Why did they need the NSA?

89
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,500
There's Facebook.

90
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,120
Everybody's bragging.

91
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,700
about their every sin and treasonous act.

92
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,440
And shaming everyone who is possibly worthy of contumely.

93
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,880
Yeah, vying for Big Brother's attention, or Big Sister's attention.

94
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
Or tattletailing Little Sister.

95
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,060
Right, yeah.

96
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,660
I'm going to tell Big Brother what you did, Little Sister.

97
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,780
Yes, it's electronically possible now,

98
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,900
but fortunately one is able to put up informative posts

99
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,360
and take down all the ones that are less so.

100
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,700
There sure are a lot of people quoting Orwell now

101
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,420
who I'm pretty sure never read any Orwell.

102
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,200
Quoting?

103
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,880
Well, what you hear all the time is,

104
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,220
it's already 1984.

105
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,680
It's like, no, if it was 1984,

106
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,120
you wouldn't know what the phrase 1984 stands for.

107
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,760
That book wouldn't even be discussed.

108
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,100
All of that would have been buried.

109
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,420
Put down the memory hole a long time ago.

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,800
Stop snoring, sleeper.

111
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,480
Double plus ungood.

112
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,940
You can tell a real conspiracy dupe

113
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,360
by their overuse of the fact that

114
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,760
Orwell was a very bad of them.

115
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,340
Right.

116
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,040
How about Orwell's Shooting an Elephant?

117
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,300
That's an unforgettable essay.

118
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,400
Don't be so sure about that,

119
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,820
because I don't remember it.

120
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,820
Oh, really?

121
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,340
Yes.

122
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,620
You remember it, though, right, Susie?

123
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,140
Yes, I do.

124
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,260
He shot an elephant.

125
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,660
In his pajamas.

126
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,360
And what it was doing in his pajamas,

127
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,060
you'll never know.

128
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,520
But seriously, stop me if you've heard that one before.

129
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,000
Too late.

130
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,400
No, George Orwell...

131
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,500
The aristocrats!

132
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,760
...did write an essay called Shooting an Elephant.

133
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,780
Yes, I think it's called Shooting an Elephant.

134
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,060
You can Google it on your little...

135
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:38,920
Google.

136
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,780
Yeah, right, exactly.

137
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,760
Just reach in your pants and tickle your Google,

138
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,840
and it'll tell you everything.

139
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,240
And if Eric Weir had been a Canadian,

140
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,680
it would have been Shooting a Beaver.

141
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,400
Susie, you can't be on the radio show without a microphone,

142
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,440
and to use...

143
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,600
Because we only have three,

144
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,300
you either have to...

145
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,060
Take the breath, man,

146
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,980
and lay in next...

147
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,660
Get close to Dr. Howe.

148
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,960
She can share mine like two straws in the drugstore.

149
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,280
There's a...

150
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,780
Yeah, we've got lots of chairs.

151
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,740
...straw store.

152
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,100
Look, I'll turn up mic number two real loud,

153
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,440
and you guys can just both be halfway into it, okay?

154
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,120
Well, I see someone plastered a Monster High sticker

155
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,600
on this microphone.

156
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,400
That means it's mine.

157
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,960
Yes, I've been...

158
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,040
I've had a great time.

159
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,960
I got the sticker book of Monster High,

160
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,760
the tiny stickers,

161
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,580
and so if you see any implement or money,

162
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,080
wallets, Dobbs heads laying around

163
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,220
with this MH logo, the glam skull,

164
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,720
or these silly-looking teenage monster girls,

165
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,240
that's mine!

166
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,100
But those are sexy dames, Reverend Stang.

167
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,020
Aren't you...

168
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,020
Don't you think those Monster High girls

169
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,320
have something to offer in that...

170
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,080
Why do you think I've got them plastered on me?

171
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,240
You do have them on everything.

172
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,100
They're monsters, they're girls.

173
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,080
Yeah, it's...

174
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,100
Stang in love.

175
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,180
We did this already.

176
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:55,600
We did this already, though.

177
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,320
A couple of...

178
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,180
And poor Abnorm Nihil hates the Monster High.

179
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,740
Why?

180
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,840
Well, it's...

181
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,040
Because he hasn't seen any of the cartoons yet.

182
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,660
That's the only...

183
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,960
Well, of course, when those girls...

184
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,700
Hasn't bothered to check out...

185
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,260
...graduate from Monster High,

186
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,020
they'll get to go to Monster College.

187
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,140
Monster Sorority.

188
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,380
Why are they trying to ruin necrophilia

189
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,500
by making it cute?

190
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,200
You think they're obnoxious now.

191
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,800
Everything has to be cute to sell,

192
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,280
as Disney proved a long time ago,

193
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,780
but even the resurrected dead

194
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,460
are just cute teenagers

195
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,360
in the...

196
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,240
In Monster High.

197
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,180
Now, look, you guys...

198
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,620
I'm still digging up corpses to violate them

199
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,280
because it's just...

200
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,680
I object to the cutesifying of necrophilia.

201
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,140
It's wrong.

202
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,660
This is not working.

203
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,220
When you use the mic,

204
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,240
you go like this,

205
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,420
and when Susie does it,

206
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,540
she goes like this.

207
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,200
Well, I'm accustomed to holding it right here,

208
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,420
right against my lip.

209
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,920
Well, she's a radio professional.

210
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,900
That's different,

211
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,940
and she gives it

212
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,980
just a little breathing space.

213
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,860
If I get it too close,

214
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,800
the whole thing's in.

215
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,280
Of course, I'm here to pop the mics.

216
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,840
Well, we'll just have to try to deal with it,

217
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,680
make do, as it were.

218
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,420
Anyway...

219
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,160
Well, she's cheating.

220
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,960
She said she wasn't going to do any of this stuff,

221
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,020
and now she's doing it.

222
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,540
Take your shirt off!

223
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,440
No, no, that was just...

224
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,900
Okay.

225
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,980
There we go.

226
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,720
See? There you go.

227
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,940
But we just ruined the illusion

228
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,120
that we're all nude,

229
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,180
that we've been trying to...

230
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,920
She'd give you the shirt,

231
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,320
and she'd wear it off her back.

232
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,140
...foist over onto the actual radio audience.

233
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,960
Yes, it's true.

234
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,980
She absolutely just revealed herself.

235
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,240
Oh, no.

236
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,100
We've got to get rid of those things.

237
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,180
Those are a bad habit.

238
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,800
They are.

239
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,940
For you new people,

240
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,660
these got overused the last two days really bad.

241
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,980
For a shock radio,

242
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,240
there's not enough of them.

243
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,720
Oh, the crazy, wacky drive-time radio.

244
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,740
Well, we don't have to do it.

245
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,840
We're number one in Detroit.

246
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,540
And at Wisteria.

247
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,840
You know,

248
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,460
all the time.

249
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,480
We're on every channel.

250
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,440
Your best option at Wisteria.

251
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,420
Whatever happened to Kill Bob Radio?

252
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,160
DJ Shaver isn't coming, is he?

253
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,080
They killed it dead.

254
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,660
There you go.

255
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,720
You've got to pick your name,

256
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,460
your radio station carefully, friends.

257
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,220
Kill Bob Station, K-I-L-L.

258
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,760
Used to be,

259
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,900
whatever DJ Shaver is here,

260
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,660
we had...

261
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,960
Well, it might still happen.

262
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,120
You could listen to the same horrible crap

263
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,380
in your car while camping.

264
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,260
I never understood the point of that myself.

265
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:27,700
But then,

266
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,680
most of you don't have to look at my boss's face

267
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,560
all day long, every day.

268
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,560
I love Bob.

269
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,140
Yes, they do.

270
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,260
You get a little tired of hearing

271
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,580
Take Me Off to Space

272
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,760
over and over again.

273
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,880
It's like working in a supermarket

274
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,020
and hearing the same Muzak tunes all day.

275
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,980
Or the beeping of the machinery.

276
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,120
Or some, at Walgreens,

277
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,520
some set-up, stand-up sales display

278
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,360
that plays the music.

279
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,940
The same electronic jingle

280
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,400
over and over again.

281
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,620
You wonder why they have such strained

282
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,940
expressions on their faces.

283
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,500
And think of the poor parakeets

284
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,260
and parrots that have to live around

285
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,020
sounds like that.

286
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,660
Princess, we met a bird

287
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,540
that perfectly mimicked

288
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,800
an elevator door opening and closing.

289
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,780
All right.

290
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,140
Because it had been stationed

291
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,560
next to an elevator for its early life

292
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,180
and now it sits in a store

293
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,840
making elevator sounds.

294
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,920
Now I have to tell a perfectly true

295
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,300
parrot story.

296
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,040
Since you've brought up the parrot meme.

297
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,900
And this is all true.

298
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,220
In fact, I won't even tell all of it

299
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,440
because it takes forever and ever to tell.

300
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,440
But my sister used to have a parrot.

301
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,740
Now wake up, Stang.

302
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,160
Named Chumlee.

303
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,520
It was found in New York.

304
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,780
It had been mugged.

305
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,720
It was found wandering in an alley.

306
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,120
Actually, there's no point

307
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,100
to telling this part of the story.

308
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,880
But what part there is to tell

309
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,520
is that it lived a long and happy life.

310
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,980
And Chumlee,

311
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,180
many parrots have a special phrase

312
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,020
that they say.

313
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,520
And usually they say small things.

314
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,120
But Chumlee had a long sentence

315
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,280
which was,

316
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,540
Help, I'm trapped in a parrot's body.

317
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,560
Only to say it,

318
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,080
he had to work himself up into hysteria

319
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,300
to get all the syllables out.

320
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,660
So this parrot was constantly

321
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,060
squawking and shrieking,

322
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,160
Help, I'm trapped.

323
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,080
Help, I'm trapped.

324
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,500
I'm trapped.

325
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,060
Help, I'm trapped in a parrot's body.

326
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,640
A parrot's body.

327
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,660
And so on until you threw the cover

328
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,260
over the cage.

329
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,040
Well, this parrot,

330
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,460
finally died of his wounds.

331
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,240
And my sister needed another parrot.

332
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,160
So she went and looked

333
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,080
all over the state of New York for it.

334
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,580
And she wanted an Amazon blue front,

335
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,680
which is what the late Chumlee was like.

336
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,740
Looked sort of like a giant parakeet.

337
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,540
Like a parakeet, but big.

338
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,280
But she couldn't find

339
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,340
a blue-fronted Amazon.

340
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,800
And finally,

341
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,620
near her own house,

342
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,420
there was a trailer park

343
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,020
where she found a parrot.

344
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,460
Which was a blue-fronted Amazon

345
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,600
and was quite good.

346
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,900
A female, unlike Chumlee.

347
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,020
But this parrot did not talk.

348
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,280
However, its life in the trailer park

349
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,180
had been interesting

350
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,900
because it could imitate

351
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,320
a crying, unattended baby

352
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,840
that was never picked up,

353
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,800
that lay screaming in its cradle.

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,280
And you would swear

355
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,700
that that baby was in the room gasping.

356
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,440
You could hear every detail.

357
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,460
It was a superb imitation.

358
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,240
And you would think,

359
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,560
Oh my God, someone do something

360
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,380
about that baby.

361
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,520
And then immediately afterwards,

362
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,960
there's no baby.

363
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,920
You can just relax.

364
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,520
It's just the bird.

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,560
My sister played a recording

366
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,800
of a laughing baby

367
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,840
over and over again.

368
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,620
So the bird would take that up.

369
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,340
But it never did

370
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,260
because a parrot picks up

371
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,100
what is passionately uttered.

372
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,920
This parrot, Gracie,

373
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,960
also did, in perfect fidelity,

374
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,840
a visit from the police.

375
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,520
First you'd hear the sirens coming

376
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,120
and then the car scrunching

377
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,820
on the gravel

378
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,760
and the bang, bang, bang

379
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,280
on the door

380
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,080
and the police radio.

381
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,140
People screaming

382
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,880
and running around.

383
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,000
And it took about 20 minutes

384
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,680
to do all that.

385
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,940
Well, finally, recently,

386
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,840
just last year,

387
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,260
Gracie also died.

388
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,580
And this was sad.

389
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,740
My sister also has dogs

390
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,400
and all sorts of animals out there,

391
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,120
a menagerie.

392
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,120
And she had a new puppy.

393
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,340
And Gracie had a heart attack.

394
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,120
Parrots do.

395
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,300
And so they put her

396
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,440
in the parrot carrier

397
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,120
to take her to the veteran.

398
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,240
And just as they did,

399
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,460
she did her last sound effect,

400
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,480
which she'd been working on,

401
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,320
which was the barking

402
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,120
of the new puppy.

403
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,740
And then expired on the spot.

404
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,840
Well, that is sad.

405
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,280
But here's the reason

406
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,560
I'm telling this whole story.

407
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,280
My sister couldn't stand

408
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,880
looking at the empty parrot cage

409
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,780
and decided to get another parrot.

410
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,880
Immediately, she heard

411
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,540
about an Amazon Bluefront

412
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,660
in a parrot store nearby.

413
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,080
I mean, a pet store.

414
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,000
So she went there

415
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,840
and the store was open,

416
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,200
but it was empty.

417
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,180
So she went in

418
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,140
and the guy seemed

419
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,500
incredibly glad

420
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,120
to see her.

421
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,320
And offered her

422
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
an incredible deal

423
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,180
on this expensive parrot.

424
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,460
And she was about

425
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,400
to go home with it.

426
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,060
Then she thought,

427
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,060
wait a minute,

428
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,080
something is wrong.

429
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,560
And they said,

430
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,720
yes, all right, okay.

431
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,760
We have to tell you,

432
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,380
this parrot is a disaster for us.

433
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,240
And we would practically pay you

434
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,680
if you would take it out.

435
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
Because somebody taught it

436
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,760
a long time ago

437
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,360
to scream,

438
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,860
fuck you,

439
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,460
at the top of its voice.

440
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,720
And it shared a roost

441
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,620
with another parrot.

442
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,120
And they would say,

443
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,480
and swing back and forth.

444
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,980
And soon they were both screaming,

445
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,220
fuck you,

446
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,880
as they swung back and forth.

447
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,580
Then all the birds

448
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,460
in the store

449
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,020
were taking it up.

450
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,480
And these old ladies

451
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,200
would come in

452
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
to buy a little budgie

453
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,640
or something

454
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,580
and they'd be horrified.

455
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,280
And they would rush

456
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,180
out of the store.

457
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,380
And the store was losing

458
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,160
its business.

459
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,900
And just as the guy

460
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,640
was telling this,

461
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,600
because he had to say,

462
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,200
fuck you,

463
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,740
all the birds in the store

464
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,780
did take up.

465
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,120
And there was a huge clash,

466
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,020
clatter of birds

467
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,560
screaming,

468
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,480
fuck you,

469
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,240
in a really angry way

470
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,180
at the top of their voices.

471
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,620
Because the parrot

472
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,380
will pick up

473
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,080
what is passionately uttered

474
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,280
and make that

475
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,160
its special work.

476
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,940
So she didn't get that parrot.

477
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,080
And I think she's got another one.

478
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:10,960
Why not?

479
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,640
That would be a selling point.

480
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,200
I would have to have that parrot.

481
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,920
It may still be available

482
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,700
if that store is still open.

483
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,760
I'd have to move next door

484
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,220
to a store

485
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,060
There's a YouTube,

486
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,840
a really sad YouTube,

487
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,480
video of a bird

488
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,060
that repeats

489
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,180
this abusive family argument.

490
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,540
Because there's passion.

491
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,300
Did you see that one, Susie?

492
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,300
It's really sad.

493
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:34,800
Yeah, it's,

494
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,700
you can't really

495
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,920
make out the words.

496
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,000
It's like you're hearing

497
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,220
a fight in another room.

498
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,280
Yes, they don't do the words.

499
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,100
They do the emotion.

500
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,540
This horrible, bitchy woman

501
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,440
goes on and on

502
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,400
and on and on and on.

503
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,620
Like the visit from the police.

504
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,360
And then at the very end

505
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,980
you hear this

506
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,660
beaten down male voice

507
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,340
kind of going

508
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,080
Yes, dear.

509
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,800
Oh.

510
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,580
I had a sister

511
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,720
with a talking bird

512
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,020
and I made a parrot

513
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,580
and parakeet training tape

514
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,100
in 1980

515
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,300
that had phrases on it

516
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:04,580
like,

517
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,080
I can think.

518
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,100
I have a brain.

519
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,100
Help me escape.

520
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,960
They make me say things.

521
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,500
They make me do things.

522
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,200
They keep me in this cage.

523
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,540
Please help me.

524
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,480
I can think.

525
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,360
I have a mind.

526
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,720
They make me say things.

527
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,600
And a guy,

528
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,680
G. Gordon Gordon

529
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,100
had a brain.

530
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,340
I sent that tape

531
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:23,960
to both of them

532
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,220
but they probably

533
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,220
neither one of them

534
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,020
even tried it.

535
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,100
So I'm glad to hear

536
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,440
that somebody else

537
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,820
taught the bird

538
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,520
to do that.

539
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,220
To the one that was

540
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,080
you know,

541
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,100
begging you

542
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,920
to help it escape.

543
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,240
What do you do

544
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,100
if you're left alone

545
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,280
with a bird like that

546
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,200
and it's like

547
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,020
the Turing test.

548
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,080
How do you know

549
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,320
that it's just been trained

550
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,240
to act intelligent?

551
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,500
And for that matter

552
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,520
how do any of us

553
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,540
know each other

554
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,560
as it's just been

555
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,080
trained to do that?

556
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,160
The audience don't know

557
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,360
that I'm just a bird

558
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,920
right now.

559
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,200
It does take away

560
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,980
these tropes

561
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980
and what are we left with

562
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,000
without our tics

563
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,760
and responses

564
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,880
and tics and nats.

565
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,500
Exactly.

566
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,920
Well,

567
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,680
I had seen

568
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,080
an Attenborough program

569
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,840
where liar birds

570
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,260
were reciting

571
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:13,520
or not,

572
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,380
they were singing

573
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,660
the sounds of chainsaws.

574
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,820
Liar birds?

575
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,240
Yeah.

576
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,960
They ain't got a truth

577
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,840
a bit about them.

578
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,640
A truth a bit about them.

579
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,160
They ain't got.

580
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,380
The interesting thing

581
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,340
about the parrots

582
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,160
is that they often

583
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,980
use the words

584
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,860
grammatically

585
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,660
as they should be used.

586
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,640
They are using them

587
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,180
to communicate.

588
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,600
Like they'd say

589
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,660
hello and goodbye.

590
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
They never say goodbye

591
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,540
when you appear

592
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,900
or hello when you leave.

593
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,940
And Chumley would say

594
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,760
I'm hungry

595
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,840
and want to be fed.

596
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,040
Or he would also say

597
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,780
you want a bite?

598
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,700
Which meant that

599
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,980
he wanted a bite.

600
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,320
Right.

601
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,820
Yeah, my wife does that.

602
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,400
Would you like dinner now?

603
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,840
That means she's hungry.

604
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,440
Rawr!

605
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,200
As long as you're hungry,

606
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:01,900
it's okay.

607
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,140
Well, but maybe

608
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,040
we could use parrots

609
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,480
as a recruiting thing.

610
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,720
The avian brain

611
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,820
is more complex

612
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,420
than it was thought to be

613
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
just 20 years ago.

614
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,780
The people I know

615
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,020
that have owned crows

616
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,240
claim that they're as smart

617
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,480
as a four-year-old child.

618
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,420
Oh, corvids are super smart.

619
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,220
My four-year-old brain kid

620
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,940
plays Minecraft.

621
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,080
I don't know.

622
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,080


623
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,080


624
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,080


625
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,080


626
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,260
He plays Minecraft

627
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,960
and creates cow launchers with it.

628
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,540
I haven't seen a parrot do that.

629
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,240
Well, you've got to let him

630
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,780
out of the cage more often

631
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,380
and they enjoy those excursions.

632
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,160
Well, we don't let the kid

633
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,740
out of the cage.

634
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,440
I need more laptops for crows.

635
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,900
More money into

636
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,140
crow laptop development.

637
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,260
It's interesting

638
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,120
when the parrot

639
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,400
is out of the cage

640
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,060
and walks

641
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,160
rather than flying

642
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,960
as it walks

643
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,080
with its nails

644
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,240
clicking on the floor.

645
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,760
It sways from side to side

646
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,240
and it sub-vocalizes

647
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
like Popeye.

648
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,340
You can't hear

649
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:51,980
what it's saying

650
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,360
but...

651
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,860
Muttering frustratedly.

652
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,180
Doing that sort of thing.

653
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,020
It's a hilarious sight to see.

654
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,040
They get drunk

655
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,380
and act like drunk people.

656
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,520
Well, alcohol affects them

657
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,620
the same way as us.

658
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,120
Gordon would hold a beer

659
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,680
up to his big parrot,

660
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,580
Jasper,

661
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,300
and Jasper would lap it up

662
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,000
and half of it

663
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,740
would run out

664
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,800
the hole in its beak.

665
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,440
Their beaks aren't designed

666
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,700
to swill beer.

667
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,300
Right.

668
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,100
So he'd dribble beer out

669
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,060
but he'd get enough beer

670
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,860
that it would make

671
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,120
him belligerent.

672
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,120
He would stagger around.

673
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,380
His wings were clipped

674
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,000
so he couldn't fly

675
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,640
but he would stagger

676
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,720
drunkenly

677
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,020
like a cartoon character

678
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,220
and he'd climb up trees

679
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,620
and bully other birds.

680
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,420
Pick on them.

681
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,300
Oh, that's ugly.

682
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,360
Yeah, he was like

683
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,660
a nasty drunk,

684
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,660
Jasper was.

685
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,620
And you should have seen

686
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,060
Gordon.

687
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,060
Jesus Christ.

688
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,300
It describes a lot of people

689
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,960
walking around here last night

690
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,200
stalking with their wings up.

691
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,700
Oh, I had to.

692
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,200
Drunkenly.

693
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,900
Princess Wee and I,

694
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,820
oh, I was going to play

695
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,520
a piece from that.

696
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,420
Princess Wee and I

697
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,960
were up a little too late

698
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,560
last night

699
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,220
because unexpectedly

700
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,660
the rockers started jamming

701
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,100
and there was

702
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,680
some really good guitar playing

703
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,800
by the son of Sinfaltimus

704
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,460
and Hazel of the Windmills

705
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,820
and such

706
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,880
and the drumming was good.

707
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,540
And then there was

708
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,360
Ward Furr

709
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,560
playing bass

710
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,320
and I believe

711
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,580
he's never played bass.

712
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,940
So he was supplying

713
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,380
the doctor element.

714
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,360
But when we heard that,

715
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,980
Princess Wee and I

716
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,960
heard that and thought,

717
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,240
oh, that's doctor music.

718
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,420
It quit being a normal jam.

719
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,880
This is really special.

720
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,000
And we started singing

721
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,740
the Doctors for God theme.

722
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,580
And no one else

723
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,140
could hear us.

724
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,880
This all happened last night?

725
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,740
That's why, yeah,

726
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,540
this was last night,

727
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,280
but one in the morning.

728
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,460
Dancing to that CD player.

729
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:48,820
Everybody,

730
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,840
we weren't,

731
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,500
there were no

732
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,760
vocal mics up there.

733
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,220
Princess Wee,

734
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,960
I'm just going to play

735
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,260
about two minutes of it.

736
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,840
Very well.

737
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,060
No, really,

738
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,800
this is the

739
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,660
Six Fisted Tales of Connie,

740
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,400
which is every jam band

741
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,000
that forms at X Day,

742
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,320
plus Pooh Water Towel,

743
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,500
which is the unusual pairing

744
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,620
of Princess Wee

745
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,440
and me singing.

746
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,740
I don't usually do that.

747
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,260
This is our third song

748
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,820
by Pooh Water Towel.

749
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,440
Let's hope this plays.

750
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,480
Yeah, I don't know.

751
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,480


752
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,480


753
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,480


754
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,480


755
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,480


756
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,780
Yes, after this big intro.

757
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,800
The Doctors,

758
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,700
the Doctors for God.

759
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,480
People will sing it.

760
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,960
For what?

761
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,600
Doctors,

762
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,240
the Doctors for God.

763
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,840
The Doctors for God.

764
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,100
Kind of a catchy one.

765
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,900
The Doctors for God.

766
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,700
The Doctors,

767
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,720
Doctors for God.

768
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,280
We're doctors,

769
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,380
doctors for God.

770
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,540
We're doctors.

771
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,240
We were doctors

772
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,480
for God.

773
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,480


774
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,480


775
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,800
We're Bob.

776
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,840
We were doctors.

777
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,480
I tell you, doctors.

778
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,780
We're Bob.

779
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,140
We are doctors.

780
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,560
Doctors.

781
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,140
We're Bob.

782
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,660
We are doctors.

783
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,340
We are doctors.

784
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,800
We are doctors.

785
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,480
I tell you, we're Bob.

786
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,040
We're doctors.

787
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,320
Yes, friends.

788
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,460
Next day is officially Robert.

789
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,480
I mean Bob.

790
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:20,240
And the music has attracted some very large-feigned face-fucking bats,

791
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,920
which I've been getting pelted with.

792
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,360
They could have had their way with me just in the middle of that song.

793
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,060
I had my mouth open so much.

794
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,120
They have widespread wings like fruit bats,

795
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,180
but they have the bodies of, well, other bats.

796
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,680
And they go right through the face.

797
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:45,160
The other thing on that CD is Wee Ma Ma and Princess Wee

798
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,660
doing their rude song duet.

799
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,340
Last night.

800
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,980
You probably have a better copy.

801
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,620
Did everyone catch that one?

802
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,540
That was a remarkable moment.

803
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,520
That's family bonding on.

804
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,020
Yeah, to quote my mother-in-law.

805
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,660
Not bad for 80-fucking-7, huh?

806
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,840
I couldn't believe it.

807
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,000
This morning she said,

808
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,220
Now, did I embarrass you?

809
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,660
I said, no, but I may have been acting like I was embarrassed to be in character.

810
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,500
Mortified.

811
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,580
How could you use that language in front of my audience, the subgeniuses?

812
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,400
They've never heard things like that, Mrs. Queen Mom.

813
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,420
So we'll go back to the monster music in the background.

814
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,000
Yes.

815
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,580
Monster high.

816
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,580
Oh, you seem relieved.

817
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,840
It's just monster movie music.

818
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,160
Okay, that's fine.

819
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,660
That's par for the course.

820
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,980
Just have to skip ahead.

821
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:45,460
As you know, the official academic productions of composers are zilch zero, goose egg zero, nothing, nada.

822
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,720
But the music that was composed for monster movies contains them.

823
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,640
Most impressive composing and orchestration of all 20th century music.

824
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,240
The true sublime is approached by these musical offerings.

825
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:12,680
And recently, a series of recordings played by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra has made many of these beloved classics of yesteryear spring to life.

826
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,060
Like the complete soundtrack of Castle of Frankenstein.

827
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,420
I have a house of Frankenstein.

828
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,900
Well, where do people get classical?

829
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,220
Well, I think it's in the music.

830
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,200
It's not that type music anymore.

831
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,060
Orchestral descriptive music outside of movies.

832
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,780
There's not that much going on.

833
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,900
From a weak classical music radio station.

834
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,900
Real classical music now is unlistenable doctor crap.

835
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,240
With a pulsating disco signal right next to it that completely overwhelms it.

836
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:44,340
Yes, the wimpy university classical music station that only plays for three hours out of every day.

837
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,780
The same guitar music by Julian Bream.

838
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,200
And that's...

839
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,920
That's about it for radio.

840
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,300
Because these are not the best times for radio.

841
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,300
But maybe we're going to light a fire under regulation media.

842
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:06,100
And start a new revolutionary type of entertainment.

843
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,360
Dr. Howell, that's called podcasting.

844
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,180
Oh, I do that too.

845
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,980
I know all about that.

846
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,580
Yes.

847
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,660
Everyone has been leaving them pogs out.

848
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,680
Well, I'm casting them.

849
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,200
In case they...

850
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,020
They grow.

851
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:31,000
Like certain seed-bearing capsules or fruiting bodies which catch on your trousers and then release themselves miles away.

852
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,880
Hey, Susie, take this mic over here.

853
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:33,440
You have...

854
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,460
Okay.

855
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,800
How did Sarah Palin get here?

856
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,740
My goodness.

857
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,280
The fox is leaving...

858
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,080
I can see Russia from...

859
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,660
Oh, well.

860
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,440
Well, there she goes.

861
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,400
That was inspirational.

862
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:47,620
And...

863
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,200
Sarah Palin never said she could see Russia from...

864
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,480
I read that five times a day on the internet.

865
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,860
I just have a very bad habit.

866
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,500
Hair-sailing.

867
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,600
Of skipping right to the comments.

868
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,900
Just skip the whole article.

869
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,940
Just read the comments.

870
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,100
But she did say she could see Russia.

871
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,880
I mean, the whole idea is she can deal with Russia because Russia.

872
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,520
I can see Russia.

873
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,460
It's right over there.

874
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,040
When I'm not killing wolves from a helicopter with a high-powered rifle, I can see Russia just fine.

875
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,500
And...

876
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,520
And they can see her.

877
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,840
Oh, she has remote viewing powers.

878
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,920
That must be it.

879
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,860
A lot of people believe in remote viewing.

880
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,920
Because the Russians thought there might be remote viewing.

881
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,580
The CIA tried to find out about remote viewing.

882
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:43,280
And thus we have that amazing movie, The Men Who Stare at Goats, being based on a true damn story.

883
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,300
It's kind of a boring movie, though.

884
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,860
Guys just staring at goats all through the movie.

885
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,480
But it's authentic.

886
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,480
No, you're thinking of the Andy Warhol.

887
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:49,480


888
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,020
Andy Warhol version.

889
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,880
There's also the...

890
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,820
Goat, it was called, yeah.

891
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,100
It's called Goat?

892
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:56,880
Yeah.

893
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,580
No, Men Who Stare at Goats was a nice, funny Hollywood version.

894
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,420
Then the Andy Warhol factory version is called Goat.

895
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,000
Yeah.

896
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,800
Or was that the Bales brothers?

897
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,940
The audience stares at a movie of a goat for 24 hours.

898
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,220
Well, they can be interesting.

899
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,760
That was big in New York in the early 60s.

900
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,040
In fact, they can be loathsome.

901
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,660
It was better than Ass, surprisingly.

902
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,660
A goat will always fool you.

903
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,120
A goat can fool you in terrible ways.

904
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,940
La, la, la, la.

905
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,660
Now, I've been doing some bird experiments.

906
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,240
I've been doing experiments with chickens lately.

907
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,460
Yes?

908
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,340
Just what are those?

909
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:35,740
Yes.

910
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,140
I've been...

911
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,040
A couple of hens were entrusted to my care.

912
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,820
And I've been carrying out experiments with them for the past month or so.

913
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,280
And they've already...

914
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,940
Their learning capacity...

915
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:49,860
It's incredible.

916
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,260
They've already taught me to do several tricks.

917
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,560
And they provide eggs?

918
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,520
Oh, yeah.

919
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:55,860
Yeah.

920
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,120
I'm doing ass-to-mouth with chickens.

921
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,160
Well, that's certainly...

922
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,280
Did you just say you're doing ass-to-mouth with chickens?

923
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:04,620
No.

924
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,440
It's just my hearing.

925
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:05,700
Dang.

926
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,180
You're on the...

927
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:06,520
ATM.

928
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,220
I'm doing ATM with chickens now.

929
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,600
My hearing is getting so bad.

930
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,540
I feed them and they feed me.

931
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,800
It's pretty good.

932
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,920
It's a pretty choice.

933
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,180
I've never had an animal...

934
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,800
That gave me parts of its body to eat.

935
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,520
Well...

936
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:22,980
Willingly.

937
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,560
The trick of picking chicken is picking what chicken to pick.

938
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,040
Which is good because I couldn't just cut off one leg on them because they'd just be...

939
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,960
You know, old Bessie's down to only one limb now.

940
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:38,820
Wow.

941
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Every ex-day that loses money, old Bessie has to lose another limb.

942
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,280
That's why, if you're listening to this radio program,

943
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,460
you need to contribute to the program.

944
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,160
You need to contribute to the Subgenius Foundation.

945
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,420
The old Bessie Fund.

946
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,400
To save old Bessie.

947
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,220
She's crawling...

948
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,260
She's pulling herself along using one forelimb.

949
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,320
The most pathetic thing imaginable.

950
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,060
She's really heavy.

951
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,560
Yeah, it's horrible to watch.

952
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,720
Rolling along on that improvised platform with the squeaking wheels.

953
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,740
Frankly, we're tired of the sight of her.

954
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,120
Your money can help.

955
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,920
Yeah, and yeah, that's one more limb and...

956
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,260
I don't know what, she won't be able to move herself at all.

957
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,220
Then we'll have to hire some Croatians to push her.

958
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,400
Wow.

959
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:19,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

960
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,900
We can't just keep her up here all the time.

961
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,040
And let a goat pull her.

962
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,680
Oh, that's good.

963
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,760
Yeah, let a goat do it.

964
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,640
The one thing that the Church of the Subgenius does have is goats.

965
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,240
They're all in Texas, but there's 40 or 50 of them.

966
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,380
And if the econocataclysm comes before ex-day, God forbid,

967
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:44,060
everybody run to Stang Ranch in Stangsville, Stang County, Texas.

968
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:44,900
I'm serious.

969
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,640
There's enough goats there to keep us all alive for about a month.

970
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,260
Yeah.

971
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:49,960
But we have to be...

972
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:56,560
And we have to, but we'll have to band together to fend off the cannibal rednecks surrounding Stang Ranch.

973
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,300
To band together.

974
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,120
We have to be better cannibal rednecks than they are, basically.

975
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,580
Facing the terrors of nature.

976
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:01,600
Oh, that sounds easy.

977
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,560
Uh, yeah.

978
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,520
Unfortunately, the only one who knows what he's doing is my brother.

979
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,900
All these movies have attacks by radioactive rednecks as part of the apocalypse.

980
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,560
You've got to expect this wave is coming of the desperate Pobuckers who didn't prepare,

981
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,920
as you did, like the ants in the fable.

982
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:27,980
And so, like a legion of maddened grasshoppers, they are upon you.

983
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:34,420
But now that we're so close to ex-day, we can reveal some of these awesome facts.

984
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,160
If you were just paying attention, you heard about the subgenius goat army,

985
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:44,020
which is ready to be unleashed on an unsuspecting state of...

986
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,160
Whoever expects an army of goats.

987
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,240
The war goat.

988
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,860
That movie is...

989
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,360
It's loosely based on this.

990
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,320
People laugh, but, you know, they've weaponized dolphins and stuff.

991
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:56,820
Yeah.

992
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,080
Goats can live on just about anything.

993
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,080
Mm-hmm.

994
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,420
And, uh, if you...

995
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,020
What's that video game where the goat simulator...

996
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,500
Good God, man.

997
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,400
Goats can do incredible, amazing things.

998
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,120
It's not the goat stimulator?

999
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,500
You made I play that whole thing the wrong way?

1000
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,400
Well, you're not supposed to know about the goat stimulator.

1001
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,540
There is such a thing as the...

1002
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,720
We never got out of the barn.

1003
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,360
It's not all punishment.

1004
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,840
There's...

1005
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,820
There's the pleasure principle involved, also.

1006
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:27,920
I have a photograph of my niece suckling a little baby goat.

1007
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,860
She's actually taking it out of a bottle.

1008
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,040
I was just about to ask.

1009
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,540
But it appears to be sucking on the pipe of the Dobbshead shirt she's wearing.

1010
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,340
Oh, good Lord.

1011
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,180
Well, uh...

1012
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,320
It's the cutest little picture of a goat sucking on Bob's pie.

1013
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,680
Do these goats get milked with any regularity?

1014
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,840
That's kind of personal.

1015
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,140
By the kids.

1016
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,140
Oh.

1017
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,420
And the baby goats.

1018
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,000
Okay.

1019
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,900
But not by humans.

1020
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,120
All my nieces and nephews and the baby goats.

1021
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,460
Yes.

1022
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,140
Humans who milk goats can encounter a nasty surprise.

1023
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,520
My fam...

1024
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,920
It's not like we slaughter these goats and eat them ourselves.

1025
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,160
We sell them and I don't know what happens.

1026
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,580
You make them commit suicide and then...

1027
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,200
Yeah, we play that music I just played long enough.

1028
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,180
The goats kill themselves.

1029
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,800
I can't hear it.

1030
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:14,980
Huh?

1031
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,780
I hear no music staying.

1032
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,060
Oh, now I do.

1033
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,060


1034
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,780
Okay, well, there you go.

1035
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,460
I'm keeping it down low.

1036
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,800
But will the audience hear it in the future or will they just think that there's a radio

1037
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,900
playing in the next room?

1038
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,000
If I can hear it through these headphones, anybody can hear it.

1039
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,760
Perhaps your headphones are differently calibrated than the headphones that the rest of us are

1040
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,020
wearing.

1041
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,500
The blue ones are the most powerful headphones, but I am the weak link in this tree.

1042
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,100
Well, I tell you, you need a little bit more audible background music.

1043
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,260
I'm guessing.

1044
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,020
I'm guessing what you guys are saying, okay?

1045
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,840
You said something about open the door and let the door down.

1046
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:58,620
No, I said turn the music up a little bit louder so we can hear what the musical theme is.

1047
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,060
You said something about we get some beer for the giant meme.

1048
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,440
That's not a bad idea.

1049
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,840
You sound like Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1050
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,420
Either that or I'm losing my hearing.

1051
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,560
I'm not kidding you.

1052
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,920
It's getting to be like the world is a mad list.

1053
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,920
He's a little hard of hearing.

1054
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,440
Like Professor Calculus.

1055
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,040
I hear the words, but I misinterpret them.

1056
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,900
I hear the words are different.

1057
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,880
I make out like every fourth word.

1058
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,840
You can put together just about any damn thing you want.

1059
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,260
Where do you think Church of the Subgenius came from?

1060
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,720
Word association or nerd association or both?

1061
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,520
Nerd association.

1062
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:41,800
There was one day when we picked up one of those, Philo and I picked up one of those

1063
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,180
giant dictionaries, the really huge ones, and just started flipping through it.

1064
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,320
I started at random and looking for words.

1065
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,520
There's one, epopt.

1066
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,800
That means like a liter or a, okay, that's perfect.

1067
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,900
It means one who is anointed.

1068
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,560
An epopt is anointed and thus is the head of something.

1069
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,700
And uh...

1070
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,020
Did you just say you have a lump?

1071
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,180
Yeah.

1072
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,880
We read in the 23rd Psalm, thou anointest my head with oil.

1073
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,300
And they used to do that.

1074
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,720
The oil they would pour on the people's heads.

1075
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,840
Actually, it contained cannabis extract.

1076
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:25,040
The oil that was poured on King David's head in ancient Israel.

1077
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:33,880
Now recent developments have had people who are in the religious right also performing

1078
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,600
this ceremony.

1079
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,160
They're so devout that they have their head anointed with oil, but they're not going to

1080
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,320
have any marijuana-infused oil poured on their heads.

1081
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,700
And so John Ashcroft, former attorney general, said, John Ashcroft, former attorney general,

1082
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:45,700


1083
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:45,700


1084
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:50,360
of the United States, had his head anointed with Crisco.

1085
00:35:50,940 --> 00:36:00,600
Pure trans fat was poured on the head of the kneeling, blubbering attorney general designate

1086
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,580
of the United States.

1087
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,620
So that's how he doesn't get it stuck up there.

1088
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,180
But, you know, people used to cook with that stuff all the time.

1089
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,680
Now they understand it's bad for the body.

1090
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:15,680


1091
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:15,680


1092
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:15,900
It's bad for you.

1093
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,200
It's really bad for you.

1094
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,480
You've heard John Ashcroft sing, right?

1095
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,040
Yes, he was a singer.

1096
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:28,680
Yeah, with Jim Jeffords, Senator Larry Craig, the restroom king, and Trent Lott.

1097
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,780
The singing senators.

1098
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,840
The singing senators.

1099
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,120
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1100
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,900
Oh, yes, it was terrible.

1101
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,620
Barbershop type stuff?

1102
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,760
Well, songs of various kinds.

1103
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,500
Religious songs?

1104
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,320
Pop songs?

1105
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,120
Beat songs?

1106
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:43,820
You know what?

1107
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,460
We're in the digital age.

1108
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:45,680
We're in the digital age.

1109
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:45,680


1110
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:45,680


1111
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:45,680


1112
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:45,680


1113
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:45,680


1114
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:52,220
So Google singing senators and a torrent of unseemly noise will affront your ears.

1115
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,880
I saw a picture of them covering a live performance where they're all grooving and it's the most

1116
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,100
egregious mincing and nobody is mincing and apparently living together.

1117
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,780
Are they snapping their fingers as they sing?

1118
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,580
Trent Lott looks like he's got both heels together and his knees bow-legged.

1119
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,560
These right fingers turn out to have a...

1120
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:09,900
Sort of like Gilbert Shelton drew them.

1121
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,740
Many of them have a musical or a Terpsichorean influence.

1122
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:21,700
After all, didn't the Hammer, Tom DeLay, go on Dancing with the Stars and start swirling

1123
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:21,720
around it?

1124
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,660
Right-wing ragers.

1125
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,080
Yes, it was frightful.

1126
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,140
Horrible.

1127
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,800
How come none of us have been on Dancing with the Stars?

1128
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,400
Oh, we're not stars.

1129
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,640
Well, we've got two left feet but...

1130
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,580
Because they're too smart.

1131
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,140
Dancing with...

1132
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,960
Stumbling with the subgeniuses.

1133
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,680
We're subgeniuses.

1134
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,500
The new reality show.

1135
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,220
Hey, guess what?

1136
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,700
I had the opportunity to blow off another reality show just before X Day.

1137
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,720
And what happened?

1138
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,040
I got an email from somebody.

1139
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,760
It seemed kind of like a form letter.

1140
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,900
It was, I'm blah, blah, blah with MTV's Real TV.

1141
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,200
And we're casting for a show about people who started their own religion.

1142
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,880
And...

1143
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,200
Dear blah, blah, blah.

1144
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:08,940
You will be proud to know that the Subgenius Foundation actually has a history of not

1145
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,640
even talking to reality TV people.

1146
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,720
I did write back to the Sky News.

1147
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:21,120
And I said, you may want to look at our website a little closer because...

1148
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,620
If you dweebs knew even the slightest thing about the Church of the Subgenius, you'd know

1149
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,320
that there's this thing called X Day.

1150
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:27,540
You would not.

1151
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:34,620
And this is the one time of year when they cannot be contacted to appear on MTV or...

1152
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,000
Well, I've been...

1153
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,660
We've had brushes with snarky TV shows even before reality TV.

1154
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:47,520
You and me both have had people come in and film us being subgeniuses.

1155
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,160
And then they...

1156
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,680
Yes.

1157
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,700
It just makes everybody look stupid.

1158
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,560
Them and us.

1159
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,360
The way they put it together.

1160
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,660
And they have the hot lights on us too from their silly movie.

1161
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,260
There was that time you asked me if I'd show my tits we could get a Howard Stern booking.

1162
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,760
I'm glad that fell through.

1163
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,980
We couldn't even get booked at Howard Johnson's.

1164
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,440
Well, you know, actually I was going to be...

1165
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,960
I was in New York and Bleepo Abernathy was Howard Stern's engineer for years.

1166
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,640
In fact, occasionally you'd see him.

1167
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,560
You'd hear Stern and Robin complaining about Bill's patchouli oil.

1168
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,520
Bill was Bleepo.

1169
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,880
Anyway, Bill had it to...

1170
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,960
He goes, Stang, I think I can get you into Howard's show this afternoon.

1171
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,260
And then he called me back when we were on the way and said, forget it.

1172
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,100
Some guy's jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge and Howard's talking him out of it.

1173
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,960
Janer again.

1174
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,920
Janer got it again.

1175
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,780
No, we...

1176
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,360
Yes.

1177
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,580
We dodged that bullet.

1178
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,160
And...

1179
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,820
There have been a couple of times when out at Starwood somebody was casting, we're looking

1180
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,900
for a show, we're going to have a show about a witch and a druid and an idiot all living

1181
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,300
together.

1182
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,560
Jesus.

1183
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,280
So we've really tried to steer clear.

1184
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,800
Typical subgenius men.

1185
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,780
I did tell...

1186
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,480
I told the guy, I said, if you want to...

1187
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,940
You're interested in doing something in depth on subgenius, it's an amazing story.

1188
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,660
We do some wild stuff and we've also got lots of footage from years and years of it.

1189
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,640
But...

1190
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,580
I don't think we're what you're looking for.

1191
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,380
Because what they're probably looking for is, yep, I started this white supremacist religion

1192
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,220
just yesterday.

1193
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,740
We're going to build a whole city in Antarctica.

1194
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,540
You know, that's what they're looking for.

1195
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,460
What about the Unarius Society?

1196
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,300
They could contact the remnants of the Unarians.

1197
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,140
Yeah, they're still going strong.

1198
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,020
I'm so surprised.

1199
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,320
And they are spectacular too.

1200
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,480
Even without Ruth Norman.

1201
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,660
Even without Ruth Norman.

1202
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,940
Ruth Norman was the backbone.

1203
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,900
She cast a large shadow.

1204
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,620
I imagine Tyrannosaurus.

1205
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:41,620


1206
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,880
Tyrannosaurus, the evil overlord, is also dead.

1207
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,040
How do you get those suits that they wear, those space outfits that the Unarian society

1208
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:49,660
wears?

1209
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,200
Disco satin.

1210
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,820
We should make our own version.

1211
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,000
There's a lot of disco satin.

1212
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,040
Yard sales, I thought.

1213
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,320
Someone in black is calling us out.

1214
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:04,300
Yeah, I think these guys were looking for the Unarians and the Breatharians and...

1215
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,460
They were looking for people who didn't know they were a joke.

1216
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:07,940
Right.

1217
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,540
To make a joke out of them.

1218
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:13,800
I actually said to the guy, we're making fun of people who don't even know that we're making fun at all.

1219
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,380
And that makes enemies.

1220
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,480
And it's not good television.

1221
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,860
Honestly, it goes over people's heads.

1222
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,020
And often it goes over the host's head.

1223
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,100
And Maury Povich, which we played at the very beginning of this, he was actually pretty cool about it.

1224
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,940
That was one of the few good ones.

1225
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,060
Sure, he's seen them come and go.

1226
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,680
Yeah.

1227
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,760
Down in the blackness of the void.

1228
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:41,540
And the very, very first TV thing about us, it was on Showtime What's Up America.

1229
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:48,100
That shot at the first subgenius convention in Dallas in 1981, I think.

1230
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,280
That one was good, but the director was a subgenius.

1231
00:41:52,820 --> 00:42:01,520
He was a born-again subgenius, Reverend Larry Silkus, who has a story in Three-Fisted Tales of Bob and co-wrote Ghosts of Mars.

1232
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,060
John Carpenter's least one.

1233
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,260
Wonderful movie.

1234
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,560
Yeah, I didn't see that one.

1235
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,760
The music is great.

1236
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:16,640
In fact, there's a YouTube of creating the music for Ghosts of Mars.

1237
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,960
It's much better than the movie Ghosts of Mars.

1238
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,100
The music kicks ass.

1239
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,420
Well, maybe you need to see the director's cut version.

1240
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,760
I'm not interested in circumcision one way or the other, Dr. Howell.

1241
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,080
I'm not going to get one.

1242
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,720
You keep trying to talk me into it.

1243
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,620
I'm not going to do it.

1244
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,700
Do they forget that they're on Mars?

1245
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:36,720
It's going to take too long.

1246
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,180
There's that many dicks.

1247
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:37,800
Can you imagine?

1248
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,640
Yes, well, but while one is healing, the other one can be peeling.

1249
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,180
Well, if they're circus-sized, they're huge.

1250
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,380
If you take those Mexican sex pills, yes, they...

1251
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,500
Spanish fly.

1252
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,160
Irritates your urethra.

1253
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,420
That's such old technology, Stang.

1254
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,380
Today, they have that entirely...

1255
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,300
Yeah, but they just use the bar pills now.

1256
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,360
So does a bottle brush.

1257
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,460
More of that kind of pill, Bob.

1258
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,600
By the way, does anybody have any of those Bob pills?

1259
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,420
I have one.

1260
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,580
I'll take a Bob suppository.

1261
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,860
At that Bob suppository building?

1262
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,760
You can fit those in?

1263
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,800
They're huge.

1264
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,400
And the hooks just...

1265
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,400
Why does he make them that way?

1266
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,000
Horse pills.

1267
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,220
Because it feels so good when they stop.

1268
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,600
But they can't come out once you push it in.

1269
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,600
You have to wait for it to dissolve and then work.

1270
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,200
You have to make each hook out individually.

1271
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,000
Well, that kind of teaches you how you're going to have to behave

1272
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,540
when the bats come over the horizon.

1273
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,800
This is a rough trip, Bob.

1274
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,340
You can't just yank the face-raping bat off.

1275
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,040
You've got to, like, lie there until the bat takes its pleasure.

1276
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,100
And then you better have that antidote pudding.

1277
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:52,280
It's only polite.

1278
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,240
Quick.

1279
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,240
Don't carry it.

1280
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,640
Your antidote pudding, a glass jar,

1281
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,480
because chances are you'll get all butterfingered

1282
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,620
and drop it and smash just at the moment you need the pudding.

1283
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:03,960
Yeah.

1284
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:03,960


1285
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,440
Yeah.

1286
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,580
Yeah.

1287
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:04,620
Yeah.

1288
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:04,740
Yeah.

1289
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:04,740


1290
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:04,740


1291
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:04,740


1292
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:04,740


1293
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:04,740


1294
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:04,740


1295
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:04,740


1296
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:04,740


1297
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:04,740


1298
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:04,740


1299
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:04,740


1300
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,520
You'll be down on your knees trying to lap up

1301
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,560
face-fucking bat sperm antidote pudding

1302
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,140
while the bat's still trying to finish his job on your face.

1303
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,940
Kids, you know, learn from the professionals.

1304
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,320
Don't just go out into this half-assed, half-cocked.

1305
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,480
That's how they end up after using a prairie squid without de-beaking.

1306
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,820
But I don't have to tell you guys this.

1307
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,520
I've got a tramp stamp on my upper palate just for the bat.

1308
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,300
You all do have the decoder pen, so you already knew about this.

1309
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:33,500
Yeah.

1310
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,820
San Jose license plate, eh, Susie?

1311
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:36,920
Mm-hmm.

1312
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:45,200
You know, for the subgenius, the word conspiracy has multiple applications.

1313
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,340
It's a conspiracy.

1314
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,700
When capitalized as THE conspiracy,

1315
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,640
it refers to cultural pressure to conform to the consumer norm,

1316
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,920
to act, look, and think in a normal way,

1317
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,480
and the growing tendency for human experience to become commoditized,

1318
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:09,300
so that what was our free birthright of unmediated direct experience

1319
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,820
can now be neatly packaged and sold back to us for a profit.

1320
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,140
In subgenius pamphlet number one,

1321
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,440
the word is introduced as the acronym,

1322
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,880
conspiracy,

1323
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:28,560
cliques of normals secretly planning insidious rituals aimed at controlling you.

1324
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,260
Conspiracy.

1325
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,220
As Revelation X explains,

1326
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,480
and I'm not going to read it, but it's a conspiracy,

1327
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,580
and where is Revelation X?

1328
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,320
I don't see it for sale on our table.

1329
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,420
Out of print.

1330
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,720
Oh, out of print.

1331
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,880
Well, you can still find it on the internet.

1332
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,600
How much is it there, I wonder?

1333
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,180
Some days it's 35 cents, and some days it's $1,000.

1334
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,260
Well, you really have to-

1335
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,320
Those Amazon programs kind of bounce up and down.

1336
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,000
They're doing it on purpose.

1337
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,420
I'm not kidding.

1338
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,300
Yes, I've seen my own books sometimes zoom to a huge amount

1339
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,140
and then drop to a pathetic amount.

1340
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,440
That's when I buy them.

1341
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,580
As Revelation X explains,

1342
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,260
our current global crises are no accident,

1343
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,220
and all conspiracies are inextricably interwoven,

1344
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,420
all twined and tangled together.

1345
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,140
You see, it's not just one little conspiracy,

1346
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,180
like the JFK conspiracy,

1347
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:29,360
or the no longer having the cool product that only you liked at the store conspiracy.

1348
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,120
They're all the same conspiracy.

1349
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:32,120


1350
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:32,120


1351
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:36,720
But attached in an orthogonal way,

1352
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,060
not easily apparent to any but a trained subgenius observer.

1353
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,600
And those all died from observing.

1354
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,580
From looking too much into the abyss,

1355
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,060
because the abyss looks right back and radiates their innards.

1356
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,100
They don't talk about how good looking the abyss is,

1357
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,760
but that's why they get stuck in there.

1358
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,140
It's fascinating.

1359
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,660
Why are you leaning closer?

1360
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,780
They're so close, they fall in.

1361
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,180
It's worth looking at.

1362
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:08,760
It draws you in or out, depending on your point of view.

1363
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,720
Not to be confused with that movie, The Abyss.

1364
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,900
No, that was different.

1365
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:14,400
Or a new abyss.

1366
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,340
Although that has a great line about the conspiracy.

1367
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,280
No, to you, everything's a conspiracy, hippie.

1368
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,400
Hippie?

1369
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,260
Everything is.

1370
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:28,760
Yeah, every 80s sci-fi movie had to have one stoner character who was right.

1371
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,060
Like The Thing had the hippie.

1372
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,140
Yeah, Palmer in The Thing.

1373
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,540
Who was named Palmer, who went on and on about aliens.

1374
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:35,740
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

1375
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,200
And in fact, it turned out to be true.

1376
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,440
But these characters never seem to fare well in these movies.

1377
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,780
To satisfy some atavistic audience desire to see hippies crushed and humiliated,

1378
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:48,980
it always happens.

1379
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,520
Oh, the black guy always gets killed too.

1380
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,520
Toke on this, hippie.

1381
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,480
Blam.

1382
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,020
But his name was Hippie in that particular movie.

1383
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,360
Yeah, in that movie, his name was actually Hippie.

1384
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,840
It was H-I-P-P-Y.

1385
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,480
Y, too.

1386
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,900
And only an idiot writes it that way.

1387
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:05,720
It's like Batwoman.

1388
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,700
Thank you for saying so.

1389
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,640
It is so.

1390
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,320
Thank you ever so much.

1391
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,460
That's how they spell the Batwoman title.

1392
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,140
She was a hippie vampire.

1393
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,540
Eleventy Meow called me an idiot for spelling it P-I-E.

1394
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,900
Who said you were an idiot for that?

1395
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,040
The stupidest idiot that was ever said it's $35.

1396
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,960
Well, but it's correct.

1397
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,640
Because when you spell it with a Y, it simply means that your pelvis is too wide.

1398
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,280
That is not what we're talking about.

1399
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:30,540
Right.

1400
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,060
And it's a great plumper model who goes by that name.

1401
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,700
Well, no doubt the Silbrick A in her case is well deserved.

1402
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,900
BBW seeks BBC.

1403
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:43,740
That's all it is on the internet now, BBWs and BBCs.

1404
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,560
Wow.

1405
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,600
Look it up, kids.

1406
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,580
Everyone loves British television.

1407
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,340
You'll find it hard to turn away.

1408
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:58,780
I got into a discussion as to the relative merits of X-Hamster versus Red Tube and Aloha Tube.

1409
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,100
Those are free.

1410
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,100
They're free giant faucets of pornography.

1411
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,500
They're free.

1412
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,960
It's like they're...

1413
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,240
What's the slogan?

1414
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,900
No ads, no bullshit, just porn all the time.

1415
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,320
And how does a hamster figure into this?

1416
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,020
How does a hamster figure into it?

1417
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,120
They never found the hamster.

1418
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:17,940
Well, it's X-Hamster.

1419
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,200
Oh, a former hamster?

1420
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,600
They've never been able to get him out.

1421
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:20,860
Yeah.

1422
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,440
They're still up in there.

1423
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,600
This is supposed to be entertaining?

1424
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,180
Aloha Tube is another one.

1425
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,080
But yeah, you can watch Pobuckers in their trailer courts having fun.

1426
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,160
Sex with each other.

1427
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,700
I try not to think about that.

1428
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,520
No, it's hilarious.

1429
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,460
It's great.

1430
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:39,000
I can't drive through the rural parts of the country anymore without thinking, did I see

1431
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,240
them doing a three-way in that trailer court on X-Hamster last week?

1432
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,000
If that trailer's a rocket.

1433
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,660
Porn has ruined porn for me.

1434
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,000
Not everybody seems to enjoy watching amateur pornography.

1435
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,760
I'm not talking about the professional stuff.

1436
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,360
That's fake.

1437
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,440
They need a cameraman.

1438
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,300
They can't use their hands because one hand is holding the camera.

1439
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:04,580
Right.

1440
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:05,860
That's terrible.

1441
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,640
You want the pornography that's filmed like a selfie.

1442
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,100
No, you don't because it's-

1443
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:11,240
I do.

1444
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,580
Oh, all right.

1445
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,700
Yeah, don't get very- I want the amateur stuff.

1446
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,660
I want the real thing.

1447
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,320
The ones with the ugly people.

1448
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,420
The real people.

1449
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,720
The for real down home.

1450
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,840
Bulldaggers, cocksuckers, motherfuckers.

1451
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,680
Well, look at it this way-

1452
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,800
The subgenius porno.

1453
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:34,020
You want to see famous performers or famous subgeniuses and so forth, but with such unrelenting

1454
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,600
close-ups, it might be anyone.

1455
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,300
It might be somebody from a gas station.

1456
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,880
That's what I'm looking for.

1457
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,360
The real thing.

1458
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,900
You know, remember I was on a kick of looking at microbes through a microscope for about

1459
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,060
three years.

1460
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:48,320
That's right.

1461
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,280
What happened to that anyway?

1462
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:49,940
Some difference.

1463
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:50,400
I just switched from a microscope to-

1464
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,940
Have you retired your microscope?

1465
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,900
You no longer-

1466
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,780
... tend to nonstop-

1467
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,220
... view the sex lives of animals-

1468
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:56,700
Same thing.

1469
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,560
... in a drop of water.

1470
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,980
You could watch these hideous squamous creatures having sex-

1471
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,880
Now you're talking.

1472
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,540
... and they'd simply divide.

1473
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,200
Yeah.

1474
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:04,640
Or you could watch a microbe.

1475
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,600
But on the internet, you can likewise watch hideous squamous things having sex.

1476
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,020
They happen to be human beings.

1477
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:20,140
But it's almost as interesting in an anthropological way as looking at the animalcules was.

1478
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:26,680
Have you ever looked for and found dinosaur sex or pterodactyl sex?

1479
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,920
Only with sports cars.

1480
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,300
Yes.

1481
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:30,580
Yes, I have.

1482
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:37,440
The performers wear the costumes and in the pterodactyl sex when the guy flaps his wings

1483
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,280
all during it-

1484
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,160
Oh no, I haven't seen that.

1485
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,420
I can't masturbate.

1486
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:43,840
They're-

1487
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,540
With the tiny arms, yes.

1488
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,560
So they have the-

1489
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,380
Yeah, poor Tyrannosaurus Rex.

1490
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:49,760
Yeah.

1491
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,100
It makes them angry and fierce.

1492
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,260
That's why he's so ferocious.

1493
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,660
You can tell they used to beat off all the time and they're still beating off.

1494
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:56,660


1495
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:56,660


1496
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:56,660


1497
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:56,660


1498
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:56,660


1499
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:56,660


1500
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:56,660


1501
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:56,680
But they can't beat off the guy, so they're not doing that anymore.

1502
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:56,680


1503
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:56,680


1504
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:56,680


1505
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:56,680


1506
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:56,680


1507
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:56,680


1508
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:56,680


1509
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:56,680


1510
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,920
If you can't get them and God punish them by giving them those little stubby arms that

1511
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,940
wouldn't reach your hoses.

1512
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,460
Their arms have a different function.

1513
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,580
And their arms contain the-

1514
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,260
To a Christian, that's proof of the Lord.

1515
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,580
The finger, the forefinger and the thumb.

1516
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,420
This is the Tyrannosaurus's arm.

1517
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,360
The first digit is digit number one.

1518
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,660
The second, number two.

1519
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:18,840
And the reptiles lose during the evolutionary process the other three fingers.

1520
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,060
They're not pronated like this.

1521
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,780
They're more like this, so they catch like this.

1522
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,260
So they're clearly good for something.

1523
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,580
They're like that, though.

1524
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,560
They could hold one of those beer glasses.

1525
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,680
They could hold something, and it's been estimated that they have the powerful strength of a muscular man,

1526
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,000
which is not much for a dinosaur, but we're talking about tiny little arms in the front.

1527
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,140
They put toes on them, and he could hold a beer glass.

1528
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,760
They had to feed each other hits.

1529
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,140
With his toes.

1530
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,820
Another reason why birds can't be dinosaurs is because...

1531
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,080
Why reach the joint like that?

1532
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,820
Bird arms lose the fingers from the other side,

1533
00:52:54,940 --> 00:53:02,560
and embryologically it's not possible for a feature once lost to be completely regrown genetically,

1534
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,200
something which is known as Dallow's principle.

1535
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:11,400
So with the avian hand, you lose this finger first, then this finger,

1536
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:15,540
and the bird wing is based on the remaining finger.

1537
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:19,680
So that's the bird because these two fell off?

1538
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:20,920
Well, you could put it that way.

1539
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,000
That's another thing a Tyrannosaurus couldn't do.

1540
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,820
No, a Tyrannosaurus couldn't do that.

1541
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,900
Could not flip you off.

1542
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,560
No, not flip you off.

1543
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,660
It would be doing the equivalent of that.

1544
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,080
Doing the Lindy Hop, which was large and earth-shaking.

1545
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,280
Pity the poor two-fingered Tyrannosaurus.

1546
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,180
Two beans has the solution.

1547
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,380
How it happened.

1548
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,460
It's the wrong finger going up, but that's the best he can do.

1549
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,720
So you see...

1550
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:58,420
So the world of science brings us so many open doors and windows and toilet lids...

1551
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,460
For people to throw their garbage through.

1552
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:05,400
...for the subgenius radio's ministry hour of slack, which is coming up on the end of an hour.

1553
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,040
Yay!

1554
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,800
Thank goodness in about five minutes.

1555
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,040
That's right.

1556
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,680
All that means is I've pushed off...

1557
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,280
One hour closer to the end of the world.

1558
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,040
I know it's going to come this year.

1559
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,260
This hour flew by, and we hardly began.

1560
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,640
When there were so many wonderful things we could have told you,

1561
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:24,340
if we hadn't frittered it all away, talking of inconsequential subjects.

1562
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,040
But if you'll stay tuned...

1563
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,040
We're going to tell great truths.

1564
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,240
Yeah, we'll tell those all right.

1565
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:29,440
And great useful things.

1566
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,540
Yeah, we'll do that, yeah.

1567
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,500
You better make a note of it.

1568
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,000
Please, make a note of it.

1569
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,220
Because we'll probably get distracted by some old monster movie.

1570
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,020
Like what you really need to put on that rash.

1571
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,580
Some weird fact of zoology.

1572
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,180
Some tangent.

1573
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,320
Or a comic book.

1574
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,040
Yeah.

1575
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,640
No wonder this church never gets quite as far as science.

1576
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:49,620


1577
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,560
And that's a good thing.

1578
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,800
They don't get distracted with the comic books.

1579
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,580
And monster movies.

1580
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,700
They just strictly focus on being fucked up idiots.

1581
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,980
Well, they have to be the originators...

1582
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,300
We're all half-assed, fucked up idiots.

1583
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,660
...of all their propaganda.

1584
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:09,440
And we gladly take what fits into our picture from anywhere we can get it.

1585
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,980
So we are better syncretists than Scientologists.

1586
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:18,380
Nor do we insist on our specific doctrine being accepted.

1587
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,620
Because, in fact, we are.

1588
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:27,260
And any thing, any old thing that any old subgenius proclaims is instantly immutable subgenius doctrine.

1589
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:33,740
But then there's also the sacred doctrine of erasability whereby the subgenius can later come back and go,

1590
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,520
No, I didn't say that.

1591
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,060
That was stupid.

1592
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,060
I'm gonna rub you out.

1593
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,180
I'm gonna rub you out.

1594
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,300
I'm gonna rub you out.

1595
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,680
No, we don't misspeak.

1596
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,860
We've got something in place that just eraditates it.

1597
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,100
Yeah.

1598
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,840
Speaking of sacred doctrine of erasability, and this will all come...

1599
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,200
...clear later.

1600
00:55:50,780 --> 00:56:00,440
For those who manage to be awake when the world ends at 7 a.m., which I can tell you right now is less than half of you that I'm looking at right now.

1601
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,260
You get a...

1602
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,620
You will get whether...

1603
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,980
No matter what happens, I've got a special prize for you.

1604
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:07,640
Oh.

1605
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:08,540
Mm-hmm.

1606
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,400
Well...

1607
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,400
Actually, we have several special prizes for the...

1608
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:11,820
They're so special.

1609
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:12,480
...those who make it.

1610
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,140
And we're trying to lure you down there.

1611
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,780
Although we had a pretty good turnout the last couple of times.

1612
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,340
That's right.

1613
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,360
The one thing...

1614
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:18,900
The one...

1615
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,360
I'm beginning to think...

1616
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,660
Actually, Dr. Dark noticed this.

1617
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,280
What is the one thing that has been in common every X-Day for 20...

1618
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,520
This will be the 20th time.

1619
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,280
Stang.

1620
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,180
Stang has been there apologizing.

1621
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:32,840
And Dr. Dark.

1622
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:33,680
Oh, yes.

1623
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,520
And Dr. Dark making puns.

1624
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,480
Dr. Dark and me are the only two people that have been at every single one.

1625
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:38,960
You've been...

1626
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,660
You've only missed one.

1627
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,040
I missed one.

1628
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,220
I missed 2004.

1629
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,180
Yeah.

1630
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:42,940
And...

1631
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,060
I'm only half a woman.

1632
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,620
Oh, now.

1633
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,060
Wow.

1634
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:48,760
You're at least five-eighths.

1635
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,580
Hey, it's a top hat.

1636
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,080
Everyone can enjoy that.

1637
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,400
Oh, five-eighths.

1638
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:53,580
Easy.

1639
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,840
I take a seven and five-eighths.

1640
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,260
Anyway, it's like maybe this year...

1641
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,320
Y'all would understand if Dr. Dark and I...

1642
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:08,740
It would be to help ensure the saucers coming if Dr. Dark and I just simply...

1643
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,360
Could you be the reason they're not coming?

1644
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,800
...slept in or laid in bed up at...

1645
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:17,420
He's in an RV and I'm renting a bed and breakfast.

1646
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:17,960
Oh, gee.

1647
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,040
Oh, gee.

1648
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,040


1649
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,040


1650
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,040


1651
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,040


1652
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,040


1653
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,040


1654
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,040


1655
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,040


1656
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,040


1657
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,040


1658
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,040


1659
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,400
Shameful, shameful, shameful.

1660
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,840
For a few slothful moments of slumber.

1661
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,240
I'd stay...

1662
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,820
I'd wake up for the saucers, of course.

1663
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,820
You would give up your birthright for a massive...

1664
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:30,240
But I'd set the alarm to go off at five till seven and I wouldn't have to drive down the

1665
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:30,240


1666
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,960
You'd give up your stateroom on the saucer for steerage just so you can snooze and slumber.

1667
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,140
No, no.

1668
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,240
I'm trying to guarantee that the saucers come by sacrificing.

1669
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,900
I so love...

1670
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,700
You know, I only have to get up that early once a year.

1671
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:44,020
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.

1672
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,040
But I'm trying to get out of even that.

1673
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,600
And it's...

1674
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:47,980
It's...

1675
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,040
It's...

1676
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:48,040


1677
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:48,040


1678
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:48,040


1679
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:48,260
It's...

1680
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,180
I'm doing it for you.

1681
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,120
But I know that...

1682
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,200
What sleazy, sinusoidal slumber.

1683
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,320
The one thing that they all want to see at 7 a.m. if it...

1684
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,340
They prefer to see saucers.

1685
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,820
But if they can't see saucers, they damn well better see Stang humiliated.

1686
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,260
Well, they might see stars.

1687
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,680
And let's hope that doesn't happen this time.

1688
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,100
Yes, no one wants that.

1689
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,320
I've gotten pretty good at it, though.

1690
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:09,980
I'm sad to say.

1691
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:15,360
No one wants to see Stang crawling and backsliding and trying to explain and...

1692
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,660
Take it out on that.

1693
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:16,940
Nobody likes that.

1694
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,020
That's why this dummy is here.

1695
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,980
That is the real goat.

1696
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,080
You want to know why a goat?

1697
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:27,600
We have to have one to draw off malefic thoughts of frustration, bitterness...

1698
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,440
Just as I need you here to get the mosquitos...

1699
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,940
Keep mosquitos off of me.

1700
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,140
Because you're so delicious, Dr. Brown.

1701
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:34,600
I know.

1702
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:38,520
I got everything that they need as part of their nutritious breakfast.

1703
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,640
They shun the blood of Stang.

1704
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:48,020
Now, this says, Stang keeps the subgenius concept of conspiracy free.

1705
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:53,820
And he's fresh with his satire on those conspiracy theorists that believe mass shootings like

1706
00:58:53,820 --> 00:59:01,760
Sandy Hook are part of an elaborate Obama-slash-Illuminati hoax to seize guns and invoke martial law for

1707
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,740
the New World Order.

1708
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:03,720
Comments?

1709
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:04,800
Yes.

1710
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,120
That's just a yes answer.

1711
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:13,040
Yeah, but, I mean, you're supposed to have comments on this new piece of provocation

1712
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,480
from the academic world.

1713
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:21,480
This so-called dissertation on the Church of the Subgenius here, entitled, Rhetorical

1714
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:28,040
The Church of the Subgenius, Kenneth Burke and Comic Symbolic Tinkering.

1715
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:29,960
Hey, it worked.

1716
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,300
Reverend Lee Cipher got his doctorate off of that thing.

1717
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,300
Well, you see...

1718
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:34,620
Doc!

1719
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,720
Turn your head and cough.

1720
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:38,420
Go figure.

1721
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,840
Hey, oh, I have a comment.

1722
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,080
We were ending the show.

1723
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:41,780
Oh.

1724
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,380
This is...

1725
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,380
This has been our Slack number 1500 blah, blah, blah, blah.

1726
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,420
And subgenius.com.

1727
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,680
And we can cut to the baby bear thing after that.

1728
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:50,620
And I'm gonna stop this.

1729
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:51,140
Stand by.

1730
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,320
Now that'll halt the little bastards.

1731
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,500
Oh, is this on?

1732
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,800
Two, one.

1733
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:55,860
It's on.

1734
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1735
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1736
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1737
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1738
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1739
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1740
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1741
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1742
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1743
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1744
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1745
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1746
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1747
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1748
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860


1749
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,860
