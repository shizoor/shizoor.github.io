Oh, yes, baby.
That was the Rudy Schwartz Project
with a song called Protect and Serve.
Baby, you are listening to the Hour of Slack,
triple X rated, number nine.
Actually, what that means is not that
we're going to have a show,





especially sexy or salacious material on the show.
I'm sorry.
But it's just that we get all these great cuts
that there's just no point in trying to use them
on the regular broadcast version of Hour of Slack
because when you cut the fucks and the shits,
there's nothing left.
It just doesn't work.
So these are the things that, for whatever reason,
we decided we could not use.
We decided we could not use
on normal American airwaves.
But I'm sure they'll end up there in yon anyway.
Friends, the intro was by Fernando Nandili-Murr.
And the next thing up would be by
the Reverend Bill T. Miller,
the King of Slack.
Are you a voyeur?
Do you like to watch?
Uh-huh.

Hi, Bob.
Oh, boy.
I tell you, I get such a hard time.
Oh, what are you going to do with it, Bob?
Tell me.
Why don't you fuck me with it?
Tell me how you like it if I came in your room right now.
Uh-huh.
What would you do to me?
Oh, baby.
If you came in my room right now,
I'd want you to put your fingers in my pussy.
Oh, boy.
Oh, yeah, Bob.
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.
Do you think you can find my sub-G spot, Bob?
I think so.

what they were told to do
pee in the special pot

he decided to found a charity for those who did not have a pot to piss in
never in the history of the future will a boy ever be born that did not have a pot to piss in
he probably didn't have a pot to piss in

he promised himself and he promised the world
pisspots for the poor were born that day
one of the greatest
charitable organizations ever created and founded by
the united nations

Look, sport, don't make me break you off something.
Do you know I believe a few caps on your ass will quieten you down, my dear boy.
Right, well, then there's nothing else for it.
Hey, you better not try, motherfucker.
Hey, step up, fool.
Get that motherfucker, man.
I say, before we do this thing up proper, I couldn't help noticing that it's 4.20.
Hey, yo.
It's 4.20.
Shut your pie hole.
Blimey, you're right at that.
And you do know what that means.
Oh, yeah.
4.20, that's the type of smoke.
4.20's down for this old school bloke.
Well, then, how about some hits from the bong, as it were?
Do what now?
Hits from the bong, old boy.
You see, a bong is a water pipe for smoking denk.
The denk is filtered through the water.
When you take a fat hit, the pressure drops in the holding chamber.
So the smoke gets to the bottom of the tank.
And the bong gets pulled through the water.
You think I don't know what a bong is?
I roll in that get low hood too, squire.
Let's take some fat green hits from that five-footer.
All right, governor.
Oh, what is that, eh?
Ah, yes.
Oh, yes. Lovely.
Ah.
Blimey.
That's the chronic, that is.
I know this is clogged, G.
Say, that pipe's bugged.
It's just hella clogged.
Let's roll a fat one.
Yo, don't hide the crop, because I got the easy wise.
Hey, yo, look out for that cherry, fool.
Oh, bloody hell.
You're gonna burn yourself.
What seems to be the trouble?
What, what?
Oh, bollocks.
I'll burn a hole in me brand new dickie.
Ah, don't trouble yourself about that.
You may have one of mine.
What?
I say, butter knife, roll us some fatties, Holmes.
Damn, fool.
I already rolled up some hella fat spirits.
Look at that, fool.
I got the most...
Ah.
Oh, bugger.
Beam me up, Scotty.
That's the dank, that is.
Tally-ho.
Oh, blimey, mate.
Damn, I fucked up.
Damn, I'm...
All this booyah has given me hella cotton mouth.
Yeah, it's worked up a right fine thirst in me as well.

Oh, yes.

Straight forties to the head, fool.
Ah, butter knife.
It's for us all.
It's all good.
Yeah.
Well, I suppose we must conclude our business, as it were.
Ah, damn.
Right, um, what were we on about?
You know, call me daft, but strangely enough, I can't seem to remember.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hey, hey, yo, they forgot what it was about the foster care.
That's fucked up.
Yeah, that's hella fucked up.
They forgot.
They forgot their shit.
Yeah.
That's fucked up.
Hey, yo, trip on this, governor.
You wanna go score a fat key, then, Charlie?
Indeed.
Let's go half on a bag of dank.
Then we could go down to the pub and bomb up on a Guinness, maybe throw a few darts like.
Oh, yeah, man, I'm all up in the Guinness.
Spot on.
You've read my mind, old bean.
Let's roll up on that place.
Damn, it's cold.
Well, once again, we out of here.
So, as always, let me leave you with a few words of pithy advice.
One.
While you were at your job working nine to five,
the Beastie Boys were at the garden cold-kicking it live.
And two.
Remember, to all my peoples in the pens, keep your head up, keeping it real out in the field, y'all.
And if you don't know...
And if you don't know...
Now you know.

Let's go, brother. We go.
Come on, food.
You're weakening on your ears.
Well, we've got a slide.
This bit's been played out.
See you around.
Peace out.
Cheerio.
Pip pip and all that.
아닙ist
Had shit in the hot tub at XD that year.
And it took many gallons to make it all clear.
Now the saucers have left me
I'm stranded right here
A tub-shitting moron
Is nothing to be
A tub-shitting moron
Is nothing to be
I shit in the tub
And made everyone sick
By trying just to fart once
And letting her rip
Now I'm stranded in brushwood
Left holding my dick
A tub-shitting moron
Is nothing to be
A tub-shitting moron

Is nothing to be
I used to play songs
With a gay rapist's band
But the exes, they came
And destroyed the whole land
Now I'm stuck in a world
Without slack, I can't stand
A tub-shitting moron
Is nothing to be
A tub-shitting moron
Is nothing to be
When they've tortured and burned you
Till your ass is red
The exes will stomp you
And rip off your head
Then they'll shit down your neck, son
And leave you for dead
A tub-shitting moron
Is nothing to be
A tub-shitting moron
Is nothing to be
You wish you were on
Planet X
When you were young
With the mob
The first you must learn
How to smile
Just like Bob
So you just sit there
In the brown water
And sob
A tub-shitting moron
Is nothing to be
A tub-shitting moron
Is nothing to be
If you wanna be an asshole
Then just follow me

John, there's no way
To put it into words
What I feel now
I will do anything you want
In one of the most important days of my life
I will do anything you want

Is the most powerful positions
Over and over put me down
In ways that I don't recall
Experiencing before
It will reverberate
All my adult ass media
I would do it right
All in all, I am deeply committed
To marriage between a man and his donkey
We're talking about me
Who cares?
I could get sexual movement
But ass reveal it all
Do it, people
This is my job
I can't wait any longer
Not just for marriage

As soon as that camera is off, he's gonna fuck that little guy.
The ghost in the darkness.
Here you come.
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?
Well, the thing about life is, it gets weird.
People are always talking to you about truth.
Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something.
And they got a supply in a closet.
But what you learn as you get older is there ain't no truth.
All there is, is bullshit.
Pardon my vulgarity here.
Layers of it.
One layer of bullshit on top of another.
And what you do in life, like when you get older, is
you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer.
And that's your bullshit, so to speak.
What's your felacity on life?
No, it's me.
Oh, who?
It sucks shit!
Heavy metal rules!
Heavy metal rules.
All that punk shit sucks.
It doesn't belong in this world.
It belongs on fucking Mars, man.
What the hell is punk shit?
And Madonna can go to hell as far as I'm concerned.
She's a dick.
I mean, seriously, heavy me-
Ow.
Ha ha.
Heavy metal.
Oh, fuck.
Heavy metal definitely rules.
Twisted Sister, Juice Priest, Darkin.
Ozzy, Scorpions, they all rule.
Yeah, she's tripping Jack Daniels.
It all rules.
All that shit rules.
This punk shit circle of shit and the dicks and all, that can go to hell.
I don't care.
You know, I don't really give a shit about that kind of punk fuck.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to do a song about Casner head pussy.
I'll never forget the first time we-
It's a long-winded explanation, too, so bear with us.
It's about Casner head pussy.
Now, Casner heads, well, Jayner will explain to you the song.
It has some- it's baby heads, the big wig, Casner heads, you know, like this.
It's like a store you go to.
Well, we'll do it for you and maybe you'll understand later.
I'll never forget the first time we played this song for Willie.
He'd been drinking whiskey and he liked to die after he heard it.
We said, �Hey, Willie, we wrote this song about Cosmic goom abortion tolerance levels
and we'd like to play it for you now.�
It's called Casner Head Pussy.
Y'all can sing along.
The words are Casner head, Casner head, Casner, Casner, Casner, Casner, Casner head, Casner.
Casner head, the Casner head.
Y'all ready, One, two, three.

Well, if you really want to get into a castor head pussy, you've got to have an anchor anchor.
An anchor ankle, which keeps you from being sucked into the other zone by the incredible suction force of a castor head pussy.
Oh, but I wouldn't expect you to know anything about that.
Oh, no, you wouldn't know about castor head pussies.
I forgot. Oh, you've never gotten into castor head pussy.
But actually, castor head pussy is a bastardization of baby head.
See, baby head is round like this, where castor head pussy is plain down.
It's like, castor head, castor head, castor head.
They shoot across the ground at 200 miles per hour.
All they do is they're going to sing their songs.
Castor head, castor head, castor head.
And that's what their song sounds like.
It only has those three words.
Castor head, castor head, castor head, castor head, head, castor head.
Castor, castor, castor head, castor head, castor head.
Oh, we can't get no castor head.
Castor head pussy.
Since they took away our little bitty windows.
Oh, we put them in a jar.
And we set them on the bar.
And when county law came, that's when we poured them down the drain.
One, two, three, four.
That's it.
Thank you.
Castor head pussy.
That was castor head pussy.
Thank you.
What really concerns me is heinous wounds.
Catastrophic attack.
We'll have disaster.
I fear heinous wounds.
I think we have a real good chance for heinous wounds.
I think there's a chance we may see our civil liberties abridged in a way we haven't seen since the Civil War and maybe further.
I relish heinous wounds.
Government is not reason.
It is not eloquent.
It is force.
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.
I know this will sound as if I'm equivocating.
But we were.
We were very eager.
The President had already made up his mind to go to heinous wounds.
Vision.
D-d-d-d-d-division.
Heinous wounds.
They're heinous wounds.
They're terrible wounds.
They're tragic wounds.
If you have sex in the springtime, you might just make a person.
The beginnings of a baby.
What happens is this.
Let's say the man and the woman are lying in bed together.
Because men lie to women in bed a lot.
This part often happens in bed.
Because a bed is so nice and comfortable.
The man loves the woman.
Or that's what he says.
So he gives her a kiss.
And she gives him a kiss.
And they hug each other very tight.
And after a while, the man's penis becomes stiff and hard.
And much bigger than it usually is.
It gets bigger because it has lots of work to do.
By this time, the man wants to get as close to the woman as he can.
Because he's feeling hurt.

And very loving to her.
Or that's what he says.
And to get really close.
The best thing he can do is lie on top of her.
And put his penis inside her.
Into her vagina.
This is a very nice feeling for both the man and the woman.
Or so she says.
He likes being inside her.
And she likes him being inside her.
Or that's what she says.
It's called making love.
Or whoopee.
Because it all starts with the man and the woman loving each other.
Unless it's an act of commerce.
It's a difficult feeling to describe.
But if you can imagine a gentle, tingly sort of tickle.
That starts in your stomach.
And spreads all over.
That will give you some idea of what it's like.
And as you know, when you're feeling tickly, you wriggle about a bit.
It's just the same here.
Except it's a special kind of wriggling.
It's easier to understand when you realize that the parts that tickle most.
Are the man's penis.
And the woman's vagina.
So most of the wriggling happens down there.
The man pushes his penis up and down inside the woman's vagina.
So that both the tickly parts are being rubbed against each other.
It's like scratching an itch.
But a lot nicer.
This usually starts slowly.
And gets quicker.
And quicker.
And quicker.
And quicker.
And quicker.
The tickling feeling gets stronger.
And stronger.
And stronger.
And stronger.
Oh, god.
Oh, yeah.
Now you may be thinking.
If it's so nice.
Why don't people do it all the time.
There are two reasons.
First, it's very tiring.
More than playing football or running or skipping or climbing trees or playing grab ass or almost anything.
Good as it is.
You just can't do it all day long.
And the second reason is that something really wonderful happens, which puts an end to the tickly feeling.
And at the same time starts the making of a baby.
When the man and the woman have been wriggling so hard you think they're both going to pop, they nearly do just that.
All the rubbing up and down that's been going on ends in a tremendous, big, lovely shiver for both of them.
Or one of them, if he's selfish.
Again, it's not so easy to tell you what this feels like.
But you know how it feels when you have a tickle in your nose for a long time, and then you have a really big sneeze?
And the mucus goes all over the back of the girl's head? It's a little like that.
At the same time, a spurt of quite thick, sticky stuff comes from the end of the man's penis.
And this goes into the woman's vagina. Or whatever.
Well, believe it or not, this sticky stuff is how you and I all started.
It's called semen. And in the semen are sperm.
And they make babies. The end.
And that's why your mother's a slut.
Uh, yes, dear friends.
Uh, that was the Lymph Node Institute from WREK's show.
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse. Sex instructions there.
And you can actually download all of the Bob's Slack Time Funhouse shows from WREK.org.
Before that, we heard the anus wounds cut by Norel Preff of NorelPreff.com.
And cast their head pussy by Doctors for Bob.
I think that may have been a live recording.
Either from a Dallas.
Or Arkansas show in the early 80s.
Cast their head pussy.
Um, and before that, uh,
with some movie quotes that Moolah Muthata sent to us.
And Don't Try This was by the Lamprey Systems.

Lucky she doesn't know I'm secretly Superman
If only you were a real he-man like Superman
Didn't Mr. White have a job for us today?
We had a job for me, Clark
He doesn't trust you because you're just a, you're just a art fag
But I've got seniority, Lois
Look, I've got a press pass here
Oh, seniority smartly
Superman, if he doesn't need a press pass
Because he can get anywhere he wants
He's a man of steel
If he owns it

He's a man of iron
Wow, what a run
He really knows how to
One of my headphones just went dead
It must be Lex Luthor
Excuse me, I'll just step into this stock room and take the inventory
At long last, they've got Lois Slade alone
If I capture her, I'm sure I can get Superman
All right, Luthor, unhand Lois
Where is Lois?
Anyway, I thought you said she was here
That one guy's Luthor, but he's even Luthor
Superman, you came here just to do this?
I got even Clark Kent's
Wait a minute, where is Clark Kent?
I had him in my secret compartment
Now I've got the drop on you, Luthor
Kent's working for me
If he only knew
Oh, Superman
You and your stupid little reporting tricks
Unfortunately, though, I've got the kryptonite ray
Have some of this
Must get the new red cape
Are you all right, Luthor?
Blacking out, can't take it
At long last, the man of steel
Groveling at my feet
Luthor, I'll kiss your fundament
Gotta keep him talking until I can get that red cape ray off
I'm sure you're willing to know
What my evil diabolical plan is for world domination
Yes, you always tell me before you attempt to snuff me
Well, it's something I can't resist, you see
You see, quite simply, it's this
First, I took over the world
Then I dominated
Faster, Luthor, faster
I've heard it all before
You cheap tin-pot mad scientists are all alike
I'm not a potty
You talk tough
But when it comes down to the real nitty-gritty
You're just a big cream puff with no moxie
You get me, Luthor?
Your dynamite ray or whatever it is isn't working
See, it's bouncing off my chest
Oh, I guess it isn't bouncing off my chest
I know what you're trying to do, Superman
You're trying to make me think like I'm not a man
Well, I'll show you
I'll turn off the kryptonite ray
And I'll beat you with my own bare hands
Here
That was your mistake, Luthor
Because my X-ray vision
My X-rated vision reveals that you are indeed a weenie
A weenie?

I'm not a male chauvinist
I'm not a male chauvinist
Jainer, wake up
You're having a dream
Oh, I'm not a feminist
I'm not a feminist
Oh, I'm sorry, sir
I'm not a feminist
It was all a little switcheroo
It wasn't Jainer dreaming at all
It was a feminist dreaming she was Jainer
And being dominated by a male chauvinist
That was being dominated by a female chauvinist
Now the whip's on the other foot
I'm sorry, Lois
I didn't mean to interrupt you while you were dreaming
But who is this Jainer anyway?
What's he got that I haven't got?
Well, actually, I think it's something along the lines of a long schlong
That's not anything we can say on the radio, Lois
But, you know, you can get away with anything
Well, he calls himself Superman
You're talking to a boy
Hell, I can't be stopped by kryptonite
Birth control pills or anything else
A boy?
You're talking about
Well, you must have seen me skinny dipping in cold water
I don't think you're talking to a boy now
Gosh, Miss Lane
Who is this crude character?
He's the man of steel with a rod of iron
But it looks like a hyperbole
A perclesian or something
Well, I'm not saying I'm well endowed or anything like that
What I am trying to say is my dick one time
Hitchhiked down to New Orleans
Got some, come back up here
Now, we can't be doing that on air
We can't be doing that
We can't talk about Richard Nixon
Ain't nobody worth losing show
We will not refer to the president Richard Nixon as dick
Richard Nixon is president
Don't you know that we're right before the gospel hour
And all those old ladies will get mighty offended
And so I guess we can't say anything about pussy
Oh, my God, turn him down
He's gonna get us to lose our broadcast license
If you listen carefully, you'll find he's gone
Oh, yes, dear friends
Hal and Papa Joe Mama on an old KPFA show
I think you can also hear Janer in the background
It takes Janer a long time to pick up on
That they've switched to Superman
And it's not Star Trek anymore

Got another caller here taking the bait
You're on the air
Uh, yes, I'm just listening to your show
This is Reverend Magosia
And I don't appreciate how you talk about Jesus Christ
And then one guy on there, he wants to talk about porn
If you're gonna talk about Jesus, then keep it all the way Jesus
Because there are children listening to this radio station
Well, what are they doing, what are those children doing up this line?
Jesus and his children
Aw
See, what's wrong with these people that hang out so quickly?
What about Christian pornography?
Yeah
Uh, my friend Sterno one time, uh, no, it was Legume, I think
Uh, uh, it posted something, uh, that was offensive to some Christian guy
On a porno news group
And this guy gets all upset with Legume for posting this artwork
And, uh, Legume goes, what the hell are you talking about?
You're Christians and you're regulars on this disgusting porno news group
And, oh, it turned into this whole defense of, well, just because we're Christians
That doesn't mean we can't be, you know, uh
Porn addicts
Dedicated masturbators, I mean, come on
It was, it was really, uh, boy, they got so mad at Legume
And they asked him for a picture of himself and he sent a picture of me
And the next thing I knew, my head had been added to all these, uh, gay porno pictures
That was supposed to be terribly insulting
That's when, that's when you know you've arrived as a celebrity
Yeah, I thought I was pretty proud of myself
Actually, I was proud of Dr. Legume, he did a great job of trolling those guys
You know what, that's, uh, that sounds like one for the books
I don't know which, uh, news group it was
I recently looked at a midget porno
Christian porn, probably
You know what, I just saw
This wasn't a Christian midget porno news group
But it was just, I guess, midgets of any religious belief
Or even atheist midgets
Engaged in hardcore sex photography
You know, just, uh, just the other night
I think it was Friday night
On, uh, on WVIZ
There was a show about the lives of little people
Oh, really?
They interviewed these people back in like 1981
And they came back and interviewed them, you know, 25 years later to see how they've turned out
It was, uh, really just like surreal
Just watching all these, uh, you know, these people
And, uh, I think it's midget school, but
Except midget is not an accurate term
It's not that it's politically incorrect
It's that it's inaccurate
Right, right, yeah, technically they're all dwarves of different types
Right, and, uh, and these couples
Like, you had dwarf couples that had dwarf children
And they talk about how, like, oh yeah, we've all got this kind of dwarfism
But, you know, except for this one kid in the family
You know, one of our kids has this kind of dwarfism instead
Right
Like, and, you know, this one couple talked about how they first, you know, got interested in each other
Because they had the same type of dwarfism that was really rare and, you know, these people would have their own kind of dwarfism

And they would have their houses modified to, you know, to be for somebody who's three feet tall
Right
And then they had their, their toddler children who were extremely adept at finding their way around the kitchen
Because at that point, you know, the kitchen is built for somebody that size
So they just have their normal sized kids go do everything for them
Right, yeah, there's lots of cases where they'll have normal sized kids
Yeah
I've, uh, there was a dwarf guy in my high school
He got, it was maddening to me because he got more than I ever did
Oh
He got some
I say
Yeah
A little bit of radio synesthesia there with host Dr. Sinister from WCSB.org in Cleveland
Before that, we heard the Nutcase Bush by NeuroPref, some Lemur cut-ups and other NeuroPref cut-ups
And now some more NeuroPref cut-ups
