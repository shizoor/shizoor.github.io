1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:07,660
This is KNOA 90.9 FM Dallas. I'm Robert Wisdom and you've been listening to the American Music Party.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,400
Well, have a happy birthday there, Robert.

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,660
Thank you.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,320
Where's that birthday party you're having?

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,700
Uh, Fort Davis.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,240
Well, now listen to this, friends.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,160
That's the show.

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,480
Hey, Mother, I gourmandize on the sacred veracruel front of the earth.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,660
Okay, now, show begins when bass show time reaches the main show time.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,100
In case of the bass show time or the stop show time.

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,480
And when the second show time reaches the...

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,420
Wait a minute, wait.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,260
That's this switch here.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,040
Okay, I think we're ready to go.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,780
Let's go!

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,480
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of...

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,440
What?

18
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,600
Every time you say, see, hear, or think,

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,680
Bob?

20
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,580
That's your key phrase.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,700
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

22
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,060
We are controlling transmission.

23
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,740
No trouble.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,220
Just get set and get going.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,860
Hey, hit me.

26
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,340
Recording.

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,580
Everything's going fine.

28
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,500
No trouble.

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,060
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,940
I want to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,020
Oh, so nice out here in the little studio.

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,160
But that's a very funny reading on the scope.

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,880
It's turbulent.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,840
It looks like a...

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,720
Anything wrong, Bobby?

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,920
It's spiral.

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,680
What is that?

38
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,800
You can identify.

39
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,160
It's a local control panel sending out the wrong image to the show here.

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,640
Can we correct it for long distance?

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,460
You've got to beef the energy up.

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,980
You see, the entire show deadline caught me napping.

43
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,880
All right, we'll read it on the e-scope here.

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,520
Perfect concentration.

45
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,300
No distractions.

46
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,880
No anxiety.

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,620
No fear.

48
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,580
Greetings, my friends.

49
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,260
We are all interested in the future,

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,920
for that is where you and I,

51
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,560
are going to spend the rest of our lives.

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,860
And remember, my friends,

53
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,160
future events such as these

54
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,800
will affect you in the future.

55
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,020
You are interested in the unknown,

56
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,400
the mysterious,

57
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,140
the unexplainable.

58
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,160
That is why you are here.

59
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,760
So in this violent city, Philadelphia,

60
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,680
full of derelicts and drugs,

61
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,540
just realize we're going to take it from you right there on home turf.

62
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,720
Which means that these tape recordings are making are for the sake of future history.

63
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,640
If any.

64
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,780
Future history, you said.

65
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,280
The world grows ever stranger,

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,620
and our traditional values seem to lose their meaning.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,320
Thousands of Americans have rushed into the arms of bizarre religious cults

68
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,700
to find a sense of spiritual security.

69
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,400
Perhaps the strangest of these cults is a little-known group called

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,200
The Church of the Subgenius.

71
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,520
It began in the heart of the Bible Belt in Dallas, Texas,

72
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,500
but its membership is spreading across the nation.

73
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,780
We at What's Up America,

74
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,440
though not given to making predictions,

75
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,540
feel that the Church of the Subgenius is surely the church of the future,

76
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,100
or at least what's left of it.

77
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,040
We want God! We want God! We want God!

78
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,380
That's right. Doug and his friends sell their particular book,

79
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,380


80
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,380


81
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,380


82
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,380


83
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,380


84
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,380


85
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,380


86
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,380


87
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,420
The Grand Comedy, in the form of pamphlets and magazines

88
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,740
to anyone who has a buck or two.

89
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,980
The faithful.

90
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,960
When you first look at it, some people go,

91
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,700
oh, I get it, this is a take-off on weird cults and conspiracies

92
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,300
and, and, uh, kooks in general.

93
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,820
Then they look a little bit deeper, and if they're really an attuned sort of person,

94
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,320
then they realize, oh, I get it, this really is a weird cult with cosmic wisdom and dogma,

95
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,160
but I've been reading all my life.

96
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,040
And that's when they're, uh, usually when they write their first check

97
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,920
to the Subgenius Foundation, that's when their luck begins to change,

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,840
their finances improve, and that kind of thing.

99
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,600
That's my friend and he's leading me somewhere

100
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,320
Oh, he is Bob, he is Bob

101
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,680
And where is Bob leading them?

102
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,660
Right now, it acts like it's gonna make me weird.

103
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,660
Doug's been standing out in the sun for long enough.

104
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,000
I think it would be a marvelous time for people to put their hands on the radio,

105
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,260
or if you have a stereo.

106
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,040
Ah, yes.

107
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,380
If you have a stereo, you could go out and put your hands on maybe one speaker.

108
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,640
Lay your hands down.

109
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,700
Let your old lady put it on another speaker, you know.

110
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,720
On that radio or that tape recorder if you're listening.

111
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,620
Because that's where the real edge comes from.

112
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,660
Really, really sit cross-legged.

113
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,440
Feel those little molecules coming right out from Bob.

114
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,180
You're all good!

115
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,720
It's almost out of jack time and there's only one Gary here.

116
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,060
Two Dougs.

117
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,720
Eighteen Bob's that everyone needs, right?

118
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,560
And the show with its own tuned-out generation.

119
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,700
Yes, they're here too.

120
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,060
What's going on here?

121
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,100
Well, we're tuning in on you right now.

122
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,820
And there, we're centered in...

123
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,060
Oh, okay, we're on lock.

124
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,920
Oh, okay, we're on lock.

125
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,040
Oh, okay, we're on lock.

126
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,640
Is there anything we can do?

127
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,860
There's got to be something we can do.

128
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,140
Now, someone figure out what we're supposed to do.

129
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,400
On an interview show...

130
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,220
Hey, I don't want to listen to a recording.

131
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,820
I want to talk to somebody who's doing an interview show.

132
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,900
Well, there once was a man

133
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,780
The world's greatest salesman

134
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,160
And he had devised a plan

135
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,680
To get the sackers from our feet

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,280
Oh, yeah, but now he's gone

137
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,900
A martyr for the cause

138
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,860
For the fallout

139
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,520
And he's coming again

140
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,880
Who knew that the first shot

141
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,760
Was gonna be the last shot

142
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,640
But he's got a hard drive in mind

143
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,240
The gas won't go through the night

144
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,720
And although he may be hurt

145
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,160
The universe will keep on squintin'

146
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,320
By the spiral, no

147
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,960
And he's coming again

148
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,260
Oh!

149
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:23,160


150
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,280
The land of the dead

151
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,720
By the tear of that happy day

152
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,440
We can only drink and say

153
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Far be far, no

154
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,420
And he's coming again

155
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,520
I know he can make it

156
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Without him we can't take it

157
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,060
We'll lose the patience of our minds

158
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,580
But still the big boys in the wind

159
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,480
Until the day that he goes back

160
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,260
It'll be a world without sack

161
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,280
Far be far, no

162
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,940
And he's coming again

163
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,180
Far be far, no

164
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,680
Far be far, no

165
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,580
Far be far, no

166
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,240
And he's coming again

167
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,500
If we don't want the answers upon us

168
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,980
Then we need far to be honest

169
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,340
Far be far, no

170
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,300
Far be far, no

171
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,080
Far be far, no

172
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,060
And he's coming again

173
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,100
Far be far, no

174
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,980
Far be far, no

175
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,020
Far be far, no

176
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,040
He's coming again

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,560
It's like Master Cleve in A Spurious Jive

178
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,620
You can win a date with this man

179
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,740
I'm gonna start all over again

180
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,340
I've got to start this damn show all over again

181
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,020
Hold on just a second

182
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,040
I can't leave this mobile stall

183
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,800
studio out here with the lights on.

184
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,860
As always, I'm always late to the station.

185
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,520
Late, late, late, late, late.

186
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:29,080
At least I've got this little portable thing so that we can start the show whether I'm in the studio or not.

187
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:37,480
And here we have the, here we are finally in the K&OM studios.

188
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,560
As you can see, oh, oh, the guard dog's trying to get out.

189
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,720
As you can see here, or would be able to see if the camera was working,

190
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,580
this huge bank of cassette and reel-to-reel decks that are brought in each night for the hour, slack,

191
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,140
by the zombies, by the very Will O'Dobbs.

192
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:10,400
But tonight I wanted to do a thing where I, a little how-to bit.

193
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,540
You know, a lot of people go, well, how do you do this out?

194
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
I mean, it's a one-hour slack thing, man.

195
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,480
And it's computers is basically what it is.

196
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:27,300
Not only is the show written pretty much by computer, of course, you know, there's some human interface there.

197
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:37,500
But it's also actually, believe it or not, recorded and acted by computer simulation of human voices, dear friends.

198
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,320
And we use this Beast 9000 computer here.

199
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,200
Excuse me, Will.

200
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:51,600
You can see with the, this booger has a 40,000K RAM and a 50,000K U.

201
00:11:53,660 --> 00:12:03,040
And essentially we just type in the script and fine-tune the machine until we get the desired lifelike effect of human speech.

202
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,820
And we can program in the voices of any subgenius ranter.

203
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,540
We've got about 25 people in the files with a, well, we've been doing this for six months.

204
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,240
And we've been doing this for so long that we've built up quite a library of human-like vocal utterances.

205
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,760
And I will show you all.

206
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,120
Oh, shoot.

207
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,620
We're going to have to, we're going to have to tune this guy out here.

208
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,560
Hold on just a second.

209
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:33,660
And I'll show you how, how we do a sample hour of slack show without having to fly in people from all over the country.

210
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,060
Let's see.

211
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,920
We've got the, first we type in the message.

212
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,260
Here on the computer.

213
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,100
I'll just, for an example here.

214
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,640
And then, I have to, hold on.

215
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,600
I'm going to hurt your ears as I move you to the back of the computer where you can hear the pre-processed sound.

216
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,300
This is what it sounds like before we actually add the human vocalizations.

217
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,020
This is the sole database and we are converting it onto online data.

218
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,120
Convert to subentry mode.

219
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,760
Transferred to the district memory computer.

220
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,160
And retrieve the line of radar by hardware.

221
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,040
These computers are .

222
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,580
So some experts still prefer to use the word mimic to human brain.

223
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,260
There.

224
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,200
There we go.

225
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,760
See.

226
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,860
See.

227
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,260
That part is easy.

228
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,540
That's the easy part.

229
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,100
But we don't have to do that.

230
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,500
What we can do next then is select this little portion here.

231
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,220
And call that one Doug.

232
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,120
That will be the puzzling evidence voice.

233
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,720
And this section here will be the howl voice.

234
00:13:53,780 --> 00:14:02,520
And now see we have these voices, digital samplings of these people's voices in a huge database of syllables.

235
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,340
The tricky part is to, let's see.

236
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,040
We add here the human emphasis simulator.

237
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,980
With a pleasant and informative vocal tone.

238
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,960
And that will take care of them.

239
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,580
See.

240
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,060
Now we add sound effects with fractalization.

241
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,100
And set the extemporaneous spin off mode on at 75% speed.

242
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,920
Use the general knowledge access file for.

243
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,860
Now this.

244
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,140
That is where we get the metaphorical bounce back we call it.

245
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,460
So the voices appear to actually be interacting with the sound effects before they say it.

246
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,720
And so let's.

247
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,200
Here turn it on.

248
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,960
Listen to this.

249
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,900
You heard what it sounded like at first.

250
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,880
Now here's the final version.

251
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,420
This is the show database.

252
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,880
And we're converting it onto online data.

253
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,060
Convote to sub-entry mode.

254
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,980
Then the database is transferred to the district memory by a general purpose computer.

255
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,560
Where we ask.

256
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,140
And retrieved along a radar sweep line by special purpose hardware.

257
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,700
These computers are the ones that can actually think.

258
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,380
Though some experts still prefer to use the word mimic.

259
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,580
The human brain.

260
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,760
I want a football in a tool chest in the summer.

261
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,660
That means this bird is in your brain.

262
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,240
Or.

263
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,820
Contrariwise.

264
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,260
That large brain is now inside a bird.

265
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,540
Some birds are little more than nature's flying birds.

266
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,040
And they have tiny brains.

267
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,580
Boing me.

268
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,780
Boing away.

269
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,780
Virtually nothing else exists in these organisms.

270
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,200
Except a large brain and a pair of wings.

271
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,540
To steer it about through its environment.

272
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,620
How fun.

273
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,320
Natural selection has reduced this creature to its present day grotesque appearance.

274
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,760
But a perfect example of adaptability and evolutionary speciation.

275
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,500
In the marvelous Darwinian tapestry.

276
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,120
We call about the politely possible.

277
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,560
.

278
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:13,560


279
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,200
.

280
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,400
.

281
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,800
.

282
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,020
.

283
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,020


284
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,020


285
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,100
.

286
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,200
.

287
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,820
.

288
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,160
.

289
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,200
.

290
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,220
.

291
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,240
.

292
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,900
here is the

293
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,860
Tricentennial Drag by Patrick

294
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,940
Vian. Thanks to

295
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,920
Doug Vinsel out there, our only

296
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,720
listener in Nebraska.

297
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,220
Tricentennial Drag by

298
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,220
Tricentennial Drag by

299
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,760
Tricentennial Drag by

300
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,420
Patrick Vian.

301
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,980
Well, that's

302
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,140
Life in America with the Tricentennial

303
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,880
Drag, Patrick

304
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,920
Vian, whoever that is.

305
00:18:51,240 --> 00:19:03,020
Yes, yes, yes. Sirens, emergency sirens and parades. Only cost five dollars per second to live in America.

306
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,760
What?

307
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:20,120
Well, we don't want to go that direction then. Let's, uh, the following tape.

308
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:28,840
Doctors for Wotan compilation album number two is copyright 1981 by the Subgenius Foundation.

309
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,580
This has been, closing in, tape number 137.

310
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,940
The Momentary Relief Facility Answering System.

311
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,060
A division of OPCO!

312
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,880
We have no other site.

313
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,020
Oh, anyway, so I do expect a full report on the power damage to Dallas and Houston as soon as possible, okay?

314
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,020
I'm trying to get this information to you now before it happens, because I think after it happens,

315
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:12,540
there's a good chance that the small yield stuff will erase all the tapes that we have in our collections, both of our collections.

316
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,840
So, uh, we're engaged in a kind of pointless history problem. Good.

317
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,420
And we can keep it going that way. That's just fine.

318
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:28,820
Um, beyond that, I think that all survivors of intelligence networks, uh, on this, this side of the field, uh, will be in good faith with us.

319
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,100
Testing the DoubleDug Alert System. Testing the DoubleDug Alert System.

320
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,120
We can help you out!

321
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,720
We can help you out!

322
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,360
We can help you out!

323
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,400
We can help you out!

324
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,400


325
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,400


326
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,660
We can help you out!

327
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:10,160
If you all ever wondered what a Doctors for Wotan album sounded like, that's what you're listening to.

328
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,040
Well, this is the end of Doctors for Wotan for tonight. We're glad you came tonight.

329
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,940
We really hope you enjoyed the show.

330
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,380
Come back next week and bring all your friends.

331
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:44,260
We're going to bring lots of money with you because we're going to have lots of drugs, and we're going to have lots of subgenius paraphernalia to sell you. We've got t-shirts, bumper stickers, buttons, everything you can think of. Anything you want to spend your money on, we've got it. It's got Bob's face on it. So send your money right now. And anything with Bob's face on it, we know you want because you want to put it to your collection. You know you want so much money someday, and you really want to add to everything. You've seen how the collectors out of the status might be having some money.

332
00:21:44,260 --> 00:22:01,820
And if you send your money now, we'll give you lifetime honorary overman status for only $1,000 today. So really, that's a bargain at half the price. And I want you to know, even if you don't have to pay $500, it'll be really good.

333
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:24,740
Just friends, Doctors for Wotan was the band that Philo and Doctors for Bob and I formed.

334
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:43,460
At first, we only used children's toy instruments. That was our rules for play. It later evolved, and after Philo left town, Doctors for Dinosaurs started up, which was Butt Naked's anti-music doctor band.

335
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,540
We were really mad when we first heard the resonance.

336
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:26,280
We were really mad when we first heard the resonance.

337
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,100
We were really mad when we first heard the resonance.

338
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,740
And I think we're being sold a bill, a big bill of goods.

339
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:14,240
I was then told by this man to play this music on a piano.

340
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:14,580
I was then told by this man to play this music on a piano.

341
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,740
And bring it to the attention of the people here on Earth.

342
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:32,800
I never before knew how to play the piano, and yet it seems that some strange force guides my fingers to play the music that I heard in the cabin.

343
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,540
And that's how a doctor band works.

344
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,020
What is it?

345
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,860
It's anti-music.

346
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,740
Really?

347
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,460
I end up at these Doctors for Wotan things.

348
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,080
God.

349
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,320
I hate this shit.

350
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,980
On an interview show...

351
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,700
Hey, I don't want to listen to a recording.

352
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,280
I want to talk to somebody who's still with onions on the show.

353
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,740
Who am I speaking?

354
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,000
Am I speaking to another TV recording, or am I speaking to the real McCormick?

355
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,600
Hello?

356
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,340
If you will ever be...

357
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,020
Hello?

358
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:14,040
Am I talking to a tape-recorded voice, or am I talking to a real flesh and blood?

359
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


360
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


361
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


362
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


363
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


364
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


365
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


366
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


367
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


368
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,480
Not breathing human beings.

369
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,060
Yes, you are talking to a recording of yourself.

370
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:18,840
Being human.

371
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,480
This is me?

372
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,300
Yes.

373
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:20,740
You are something you've never seen before.

374
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,340
We're all you.

375
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,820
I never sound like this.

376
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,100
This is me.

377
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,200
I am glorious fleets, but I'm using the puzzling evidence voice because it saves on batteries while I think with your brain.

378
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:39,460
Well, I've seen that so-called puzzling evidence before, and it may be puzzling where it comes from, but as far as I'm concerned, it's just a lot of the same hoopla that they've been feeding us all these years.

379
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,000
I agree.

380
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,300
The philosophy of the church is all about...

381
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,240
Somebody ought to do something about this business before I die.

382
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,240


383
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,240


384
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,240


385
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,240


386
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,660
It gets completely out of hand.

387
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,500
Well, you did something. You bought a radio.

388
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,020
Yes, I...

389
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,660
It's so hard to tell which is real and which is false here at the studio. I know.

390
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:00,280
Well, I... That kind of thing doesn't bother me. What I want to know is, when I talk to somebody, is he real when I'm talking to him?

391
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,000
Only when you're talking to him is he real. When he tries to answer, he becomes tape again.

392
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,060
You must be in the Twilight Zone, or the Listener Zone.

393
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,540
I'm just trying to get a better reception here, but, uh...

394
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,100
It's a little late for that, don't you think?

395
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:12,820
Yee.

396
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,980
Ah, well, that's a little bit better, but it's still nothing to write home about.

397
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,800
I've been trying to fix this TV machine for the past half hour, and I can't get a better reception.

398
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,720
I'm hoping you won't write home about this.

399
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,020
It's too late. The weather is already insane.

400
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,660
I understand. Electronic transmissions and the speed at which our world moves.

401
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,620
Well, I'm sorry to tell you, then, your home family has been destroyed, and now you're in trouble.

402
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,720
Yes, we had to intercept a message on the way there, and this was the only way.

403
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,800
Yes, well, I think...

404
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,920
I think it's about time that we discontinue this conversation.

405
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,660
I know what I'm being made a fool of, and I, for one, don't intend to stand for it one more time.

406
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,160
You just tuned me out. Me neither.

407
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,980
That's the way you're going to go about it.

408
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,620
Okay.

409
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,280
I suppose that's all that can be said.

410
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,140
And how many dinosaurs did he represent in those thoughts tonight?

411
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,940
Those who understand implicitly the confusion, the...

412
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,720
Yes!

413
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,080
The yes involved in this show.

414
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,660
Oh, my God.

415
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,420
Is this for real?

416
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,960
No, no, no. This is just a tape. Relax.

417
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,280
It is not the day before or the week between.

418
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,460
It's just the show.

419
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,900
Yes. Yes.

420
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,900
If we could get back to Bob, I think Bob is the more important...

421
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:35,260
I tend to forget that so many people are still unsaved and still don't even know who Bob Ross is.

422
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,180
Have never heard the first mention of the divine word of Bob.

423
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,020
All right. I guess I'll do the whole... the whole...

424
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,500
song and dance.

425
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:49,600
Bob was... was born... I guess we're not sure of his age.

426
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,280
He's as old as the mountains and yet as young as the hills.

427
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:53,720
He...

428
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,500
River deep and mountain high.

429
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:02,160
Yeah. Bob was born with a gift for sails, a mystic sails ability,

430
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:09,020
and has always had an intuitive grasp on that essence of relaxation we call slack.

431
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,280
He...

432
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,160
Oh, my God.

433
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,300
In 2006, Bob... Bob was a millionaire.

434
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,000
I had been... He sold condoms to these two high school students.

435
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:25,580
He... He was an alcoholic at the age of eight, lost everything, and then built it back up again.

436
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,280
He's... He's been in the shoes of the prisoner.

437
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,620
He's been in the shoes of the... the junkie, the drug addict, and the... and the politician.

438
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,260
The adulterer.

439
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,080
Yeah. He's...

440
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,420
Yeah.

441
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,920
He's definitely been in the shoes of the adulterer.

442
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,620
We're constantly being barraged by...

443
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,480
Oh, no.

444
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,820
People threatening to sue us, claiming that they're bastard sons of Bob.

445
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,420
This is...

446
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,880
Fraternity suits against the church, huh?

447
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,160
Right.

448
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,920
Well, against Bob, not against the church or the foundation, but against Bob, his holy self.

449
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,980
His holy bad self.

450
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,620
Yeah. There's a good Bob and there's a bad Bob.

451
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,960
That's an important thing to remember.

452
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:03,380
People mindlessly follow Bob at times without realizing that they're opening themselves up to forces

453
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,100
that they may not have con... you know, complete control over.

454
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,220
Um...

455
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,000
So...

456
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,660
Right in your own...

457
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,060
Yeah!

458
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,720
Right in your own home.

459
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,240
And now...

460
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,060
Now you can have...

461
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,220
Now you can have...

462
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,980
Now you can have this amazing new symphony.

463
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,480
You cannot! You cannot!

464
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,560
To create a mighty symphony of prosperity.

465
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,820
Oh, prosperity, dear friends.

466
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,060
That's, uh...

467
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,260
Oh, what is this?

468
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,760
I'll have to shut it off to check it.

469
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,980
A snake oil symphony by Daniel Stevens...

470
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,300
Steven Crafts.

471
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,940
Daniel Steven Crafts.

472
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,000
And I don't think you can get that one on record, either.

473
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,300
I think it's just a tape.

474
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,840
That, uh...

475
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,600
And I don't have the guy's address.

476
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,680
So sorry!

477
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,040
So terribly sorry!

478
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,920
Well, it seems that, uh...

479
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,900
We're supposed to read a PSA coming up here.

480
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,200
But...

481
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,400
First...

482
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,760
I have to find it.

483
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,520
And so...

484
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,160
Galactic Messiah.

A monopoly on the Essence is the prize sought by the competing great planetary kingdoms.

House Stang, a conspiracy of ruthless economistics which colonized the moons of Jupiter in the years of trouble,

00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:13,360
after causing the cataclysm which destroyed the Earth and sparked the Great Migrations.

492
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,620
No longer in control, but fighting desperately to regain their lost empire.

For...

00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,560
House Wellman, headquartered on the man-made planet of Ease,

495
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:27,440
but with most other worlds partially dependent upon their scientific and technological works.

496
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:34,520
This is a civilization of secretive technocrats who alone possess the profitable mechanics of time reversion.

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:57,160
all driven by a survival of the fittest philosophy which gives them absolutely no compunction about meeting out the, quote,

502
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,340
slaughter of justice.

503
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:06,820
Painful waking surgery performed by these priests can render anyone a mindless zombie in their power.

Venus is inhabited by this race of sensualist entities.

509
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:33,340
Once human, they now are mutated creatures consisting primarily of a brain, mouth, and sexual organs.

510

Their powers of psychic infiltration threatens the downfall of the other planetary worlds.

The drones of this Venusian master race pilot space-bending interplanetary craft called heads,

An unpredictable sect of athlete sorcerers, also called the Brothers of the Pipe,

00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,900
famed for their skills in the arts of love.

Mercury is inhabited by titanic creatures called Halorobites.

518
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:14,600
Mindless reptilian dragons that were once human fop priests in distant antiquity,

519
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,200
but after the migrations gradually self-mutated into the monstrous heat monsters of today.

520
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,440
Their internal metabolism, however, is such that they excrete the fop essence as a waste byproduct.

521
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,560
This is harvested at great risk by the Gabrogfranians,

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:48,140
this small but powerful clique of born criminals are lords over a huge armed force of female Amazons,

526
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,580
feared for their quasi-magic sexual abilities,

527
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,580
and also shunned for their legendary perversions.

528
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,200
Trevenists.

529
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,900
Descendants of the few remaining normal humans who managed to escape the Harvest,

530
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,120
a genocidal war shortly before the Great Cataclysm.

531
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:14,000
These are sinister devil-worshippers who use black magic and conjure up demons called Jizai.

532
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,880
The story concerns a strange young man called Ba-Dods,

533
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,080
born a lowly Trevenist, but later adopted by a band of Gabrogfranian warriors,

534
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,380
and later sold to the Paysai-Anarmat army.

535
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:33,860
Almost retarded in his innocence, he seems to possess a vague memory of limitless past lives.

536
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,340
This gives him a power of clairvoyance,

537
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:41,400
and a form of luck-shell which brings him to the attention of the competing great houses.

538
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,400
He becomes a pawn in their vicious conflicts,

539
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:51,320
until he discovers a power undreamed of by the evil ones who seek to control him.

540
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,140
Dear friend,

541
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,500
this power has been deoricised

542
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,900
at thisdeliberatefor stories in in return.

543
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,740
In the pect uno on 3,

544
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,020
Mr. insults to his court.

545
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,440
To Measure Y keerinist-

546
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,940
J. Eric Johnson Central Library, 1515 Young in Dallas,

547
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:45,240
will take place during regular library hours from January 12th through February 22nd, 1987.

548
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:55,740
The exhibit documents cases of censorship of books in libraries in the last 10 years.

549
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,780
Copies of the banned books will be available for everyone to page through at their leisure.

550
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:07,420
For more information, call 749-4100.

551
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:15,280
To see those banned books, dear friends, and see what was so ugly and scary and evil

552
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,300
that they had to be taken from the shelves so that people couldn't look at them.

553
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,580
Evil, evil books like Huckleberry Finn, Catcher in the Rye.

554
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,620
Oh, there's some nasty, nasty stuff in there that we better be afraid of

555
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,180
because Jesus might not like us reading it.

556
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,560
But how would we know Jesus isn't around anymore?

557
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,640
We'll have to just look deep into our hearts and...

558
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,060
Yes, I think I hear him coming.

559
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,300
Jesus.

560
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,620
He's coming up from below.

561
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,540
He should be coming from above.

562
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,020
I don't understand.

563
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,280
This is...

564
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,020
With the key of imagination.

565
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,060
Now, 25 years later, join us for the Twilight Zone Silver Anniversary Special.

566
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:05,140
Also tonight, many merchants in Brooklyn suddenly find their goods piled up in the street

567
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,700
and explorers discover a tribe on the other side of the world

568
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,840
its members thought they were the only people on Earth.

569
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,480
John, we already have bacon for extra season.

570
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,780
First of all, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania has one of the key telephone centers in the Northeast.

571
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,160
You knock that out, you knock out all the telephones in the Northeast.

572
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,340
We've been having telephone blackouts all over the country for the last three months.

573
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,620
They're going totally unpublicized.

574
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,320
Hello?

575
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,880
Yes, we're having a little difficulty with this line.

576
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,080
One of our guests here made the suggestion.

577
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,020
I think he's being a little facetious, but I was wondering what you thought about it.

578
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,240
He said maybe the...

579
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,500
That's right.

580
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,040
You can stay with us for right now.

581
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,420
Now, Doctor, I think we should return to the basic finances of the church

582
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,200
and just who owns the church and what we can do with what's left of the church.

583
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,540
Right.

584
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,860
Well, Ivan's staying no longer owns the church.

585
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,440
Bob still has the foundation, but we've got papers on there.

586
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,240
All right.

587
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,900
Hold on here.

588
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,220
Hold on.

589
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,600
Wait a minute.

590
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,680
What we also can talk about, of course, is...

591
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,260
What we can do with the church now that what's left is still here and breathing.

592
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,020
Well, we can give it away or we can just let someone take the church.

593
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:13,400
See, what I think is people don't realize that the church takes two rooms to keep and grow in your house.

594
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,100
At least two.

595
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,660
And the maintenance involved takes up most of the week anyway.

596
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,600
And it does not run on unleaded.

597
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,080
I'm sorry.

598
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,640
So, by coming in and saying you want the church,

599
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,880
if you don't have at least two good-sized rooms in your house...

600
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,460
Yes, at least two good-sized rooms and a lot of money.

601
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,100
And a lot of...

602
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,160
And neighbors that don't mind Wotan showing up in the middle of the night.

603
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,500
Right.

604
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,060
And you need stamps and gummage.

605
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,560
Get the idea?

606
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,060
Or kill me!

607
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,980
Or kill me!

608
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,160
Now!

609
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:47,440
And the guy, he got to the point where the guy he was bothering pulled out a .32 and let him have it.

610
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:55,360
And at which point, the bullet hit him square in the chest and went through his lungs and came out his back.

611
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:01,080
But instead of falling on the ground, he walked back in the bar and ordered a drink.

612
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,480
Get the idea?

613
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,760
Or kill me!

614
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,060
Now!

615
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,080
Now!

616
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,920
Let's have a body count!

617
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,580
Let's have a body count!

618
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,020
None dead!

619
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,200
It's a miracle, friends!

620
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,120
It's a miracle!

621
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:16,460
Bob!

622
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,660
Praise Bob!

623
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,060
Praise Bob!

624
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,380
Praise Bob!

625
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,040
Praise Bob!

626
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,880
Praise Bob!

627
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,600
I'm having a baby!

628
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,540
She's having a kid baby!

629
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,260
They're sucking, there's dollar bills in their mouth!

630
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,280
They're puking up dollar bills, doctor!

631
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,760
Where are those dollar bills coming from, doctor?

632
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,720
What's going on?

633
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,980
My key won't fit!

634
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,960
I lost my key!

635
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,060
My car's flat!

636
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,360
My car's flat!

637
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,080
Well hello, cats and kitties out there in subgenius land.

638
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,020
This is the too cool fool coming to you from Oakland, California, saying,

639
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,120
I send all of my dollars to the churches of Venus in Dallas, Texas.

640
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,580
Why don't you do the same too?

641
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,500
Okay, bye!

642
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,420
Hi, hi and welcome to Jazz Hour.

643
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,060
Well today we've got a nice prize for you.

644
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,420
If you win, you get an executive grooming breakthrough of the decade.

645
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,180
You get Execunete.

646
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,160
The automated barber and ironing machine.

647
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,160


648
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,800
It's a box that uses new robot technology to make sure your hair is precisely parted

649
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,360
in the same place every morning.

650
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,740
No successful executive wants colleagues or competitors cracking,

651
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,940
hey, your hair looks funny today.

652
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,740
Clamps over your head without discomfort and without wires works in less than a minute.

653
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,820
Place the part exactly where you want it.

654
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:59,160
Electronic memory then repeats the part every time within .00001 millimeters of accuracy.

655
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,140
Not a novelty, not a novelty.

656
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,140


657
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,140
Not a toy, but a high precision machine developing in the world's leading barbers.

658
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,560
Storage box, double, double, double, double.

659
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:11,360
And don't forget the advanced engineering, the slew machine, the handsome set of executive

660
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,960
bagpipes.

661
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,880
Now we can show you here precision gas and space-age durable work.

662
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,860
Portable enough to stow under the airline seat.

663
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,460
Executive and exclusive.

664
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,840
The magic lung holds up to five minutes.

665
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,160
Freeze your hands for important paperwork.

666
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,440
Specified by Stuart, McDonald or Kimber.

667
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,820
Blue, blue, blue.

668
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:28,460
Yay!

669
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,500
I'm going to get a new job.

670
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:30,780
I'm going to get a new job.

671
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:30,780


672
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:30,780


673
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:30,780


674
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:30,780


675
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:30,780


676
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:45,400
Here's my flirting scene.

677
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:56,560
Keep walking forward and guess what you've said.

678
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,100
That gets you in there.

679
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,100


680
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,100


681
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,100


682
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,100


683
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,100


684
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,260
We're going to get to where the machine has to come in to go.

685
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:57,280
Got it?

686
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:57,340
deserves Wheels.

687
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,500
Oh my God.

688
00:41:59,500 --> 00:41:59,500


689
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,100
We're out of'em.

690
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,640
We are out of'em all.

691
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,060
Cause Bob told me to.

692
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,500
I do what you do.

693
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,440
Cause you want to.

694
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,700
I do what I do.

695
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,240
Cause Bob told me to.

696
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,020
No, I don't believe the not-tarses of brainwashing.

697
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,080
I've been labeled as a certain way.

698
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,060
I'll tell me to.

699
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,580
You do what you do.

700
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,220
Cause you want to.

701
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,820
Don't use such techniques as brainwashing.

702
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,840
Cause Bob told me to.

703
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,740
I've been labeled as a certain way.

704
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,500
Cause you want to.

705
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,200
I do what I do

706
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,000
Hey, Robert Tucker

707
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,640
Wake up, man

708
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,760
Wake up and send some money to the church, pal

709
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,740
I mean, come on, get it together

710
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,980
Actually, you gotta send money to KNON

711
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,500
That's the only people you have to send money to

712
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,180
But it's very important that you do that

713
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,320
Those of you who have not mailed in your pledges yet

714
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,800
You're excommunicated

715
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,080
Even if you're not a member yet

716
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,320
That's it

717
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,120
I'm gonna have to pull a damn Gene Scott thing here, I guess

718
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,260
Ugh, it's a mess

719
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:36,460
Dear friends, uh, I haven't gotten any more entries in the Win a Date with Cleve contest

720
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,240
Uh, you gals, this is for gals only

721
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,120
You do want a date with Cleve

722
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:48,960
Brother Cleve Duncan, that great, great, uh, hymn master and rapping subgenius saint

723
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,260
So, uh, tell us why in an essay of, uh, 25,000 words or less

724
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,420
Why you deserve the date with Cleve

725
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,040
Why you

726
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:05,220
Are better for Cleve than any other fellow, uh, yeti female

727
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:11,200
Uh, tell us why and send it in to P.O. Box 140306

728
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,760
That's right, I'm gonna say that again, dear friends

729
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,720
Send it to Bob, hour of slack, whatever

730
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,360
At P.O. Box 140306

731
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,060
Dallas, Texas

732
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,480
75214

733
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,140
Once again, that's Bob

734
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,300
P.O. Box 140306

735
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,200
Dallas, Texas 75214

736
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,560
And, uh, friends, uh, Dr. Sterno Keckhaver called me up the other night

737
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,420
About two hours after he'd had a vasectomy

738
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,840
A very difficult vasectomy, it seems

739
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:54,840
Because, uh, well, the doctor said his vas deferens was elusive

740
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,480
And, uh, I've heard the same thing from, uh, some of the other doctors

741
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,680
And, uh, some of the other subgenius males who've been fixed like this

742
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,840
And it makes us wonder, you know, somebody ought to do a study on this

743
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,360
A careful scientific study

744
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:13,580
Do we yetinsen, we descendants of the noble Himalayan yeti

745
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:19,820
Uh, is our vas deferens really that different from the humans?

746
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,360
Is this one way that we can, uh, say, check a body

747
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,180
To see whether it was, uh, of human or subgenius origin?

748
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,480
Uh-huh

749
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,580
Or we'll see

750
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,000
We shall certainly see

751
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,820
There's a vast difference, friends

752
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,640
A vast difference

753
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,660
Stamps and gummage, yes

754
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:45,660


755
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,360
Lots of stamps and gummage

756
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,220
Would you sign here, please?

757
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,600
Okay, sign here, please

758
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,020
I don't have any stamps and gummage

759
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:04,800
Wait a minute, wait a minute

760
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,220
Ah!

761
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,100
Thank you very much

762
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,140
The world is over now

763
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,920
You can return to your bed

764
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,240
Wow!

765
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,520
We're trying

766
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,280
Well

767
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,480
We're not trying hard enough

768
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,380
Well, it's certainly

769
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,280
Send us more money

770
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,600
Yeah, more money

771
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:19,960
More money

772
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,660
How much would you like?

773
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,440
Uh, uh, fifty thousand, would you say that would do it?

774
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,500
Uh, check it in the mail

775
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,700
All right, thank you

776
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,380
You're welcome

777
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,500
You can expect your

778
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:27,980
Go

779
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,340
They'll put on the automatic

780
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:29,480
They'll put on the automatic

781
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:29,480


782
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:29,480


783
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:29,480


784
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:29,480


785
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,620
Here, I'll put myself on

786
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,760
Yes, okay

787
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,080
Where's my thesaurus?

788
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,360
Ricky, Lizzy, Perry, and Bill

789
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,100
Here, Bob, here's your hat

790
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,020
Put this part on

791
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,260
Here we go

792
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,200
Here, here, here

793
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,140
Now get, get Mel's ride to the station down Shattuck Avenue

794
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,980
There we go

795
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:46,560
Roll the stop

796
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,660
Ain't got no spare

797
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:48,200
I think I've got too much to say

798
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,860
We haven't got a spare for this program

799
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,860
We don't have a jack for this program

800
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,860
We don't even have any

801
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,440
Look out for that car

802
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,460
I'm so floored for this, for this program

803
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,820
We're just gonna drive until this program

804
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,480
Just gonna go and go and go

805
00:46:59,480 --> 00:46:59,480


806
00:46:59,480 --> 00:46:59,480


807
00:46:59,480 --> 00:46:59,480


808
00:46:59,480 --> 00:46:59,480


809
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,320
Welcome

810
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:02,760
Bill Murbus, Building Jeder

811
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,620
I just want we see the bug which absolutely танčıyor

812
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:04,620


813
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:04,620


814
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:04,620


815
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,260
You've saved my life

816
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,480
You've saved my life

817
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:05,900
알

818
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,980
I'm so glad you're there

819
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:23,600
Nee less, yes journalist

820
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,400
Linux

821
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:26,220
Hey

822
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,440
Shakespeare

823
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:39,980
We're going to start up again here once more with the lecture on the difference between pinks and subgeni.

824
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:47,120
And yes, I'm proud to say that I'm a proudful bastard compared to most of these pink boys.

825
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,640
And so should you, the true mutants out there also be.

826
00:47:51,660 --> 00:48:00,080
What's ironic, friends, is that the ones who most appreciate slack, us, are actually the hardest workers.

827
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:08,640
And that sounds odd because, you know, your true subgenius is into slack, but we are always game to go the distance.

828
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,620
Whereas your pink boy, they only care about money and status.

829
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,580
And generally, believe it or not, are actually lazier than us.

830
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,620
In a sense.

831
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,220
In a certain way.

832
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,980
In the way that they're comfortable with bland work and bland relaxation.

833
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,220
Their range of feeling, dear friends, is limited.

834
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:35,980
And when they see either fun or anger unleashed at a subgenius level, it scares them to death.

835
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,220
That's why J.R. Bob Dobbs said, and I paraphrase,

836
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,300
act like a dumbass and they'll treat you like an equal.

837
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,620
They can't really understand slack, friends, because they also can't understand realness.

838
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:50,840
And so, they're not there to learn, they're there to learn.

839
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:50,840


840
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:56,840
The only time they're called upon to stretch their abilities is when they're forced to work with the subgenius.

841
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,560
Because the subgenius is always looking for ways to improve things.

842
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:11,280
Or, you know, to somehow cut through the trivial crap and add a bit of excitement if possible to anything in any way possible.

843
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,480
He is compelled, dear friends, to customize the world around him.

844
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,780
Now, pigs can't learn the way we can.

845
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,620
They actually work.

846
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,000
They want to be told what to do as a result.

847
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:28,220
But only by somebody with, quote, authority, unquote.

848
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,320
Meaning, in their case, somebody with more money or status than them.

849
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,460
Now, they're the ones that are compelled to measure IQs, but they really do so in monetary units

850
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:44,520
and not in the depth of meaning and fun and slack and great squirts like we do.

851
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:50,180
So, the idea of modifying the world around them is an alien concept to them.

852
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:54,600
Though they'll modify things according to the plan of a rich subgenius,

853
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:01,100
but they'll never take such a thing upon themselves because they fear responsibility.

854
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:05,280
Now, your subgenius will take the rap like a man,

855
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:12,240
but a pink will go to the trouble of joining a lynch mob just to avoid admitting that he might have goofed.

856
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:17,260
Now, where that becomes a bit dangerous is when the safety of the entire planet is threatened,

857
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,700
such as it is now.

858
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,600
They can't feel responsible.

859
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,460
They have no responsibility for their own actions, much less the planet.

860
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:30,540
So, they call us kooks if we dare to so much as cry out about how bad things really are.

861
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,740
Now, your pink boy believes in positive thinking.

862
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,120
Oh, positive thinking.

863
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,720
They don't want to ask questions.

864
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,080
They don't want to face the possible problems.

865
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,520
And they get really upset, dear friends, if you ask them to double-check something

866
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,420
because that implies that they might be doing something wrong.

867
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,600
They call us kooks.

868
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:50,960
They call us paranoid.

869
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,840
And when our dire predictions and unheeded warnings come true,

870
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,340
oh, they very conveniently forget you ever said it.

871
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,520
And when you ask them to speak a little louder,

872
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,180
well, that's when they kind of mumble a little more softly

873
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:09,580
because they live in fear, my friends, in ulcer-ridden fear of what others might think.

874
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,000
Now, subgeniuses are themselves into blowing things off.

875
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,700
Praise Bob.

876
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,280
But we do so before telling everybody we're going to do it.

877
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,000
With your pink,

878
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,600
well, they'll tell you they're going to do it.

879
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,840
They're going to do something first and then blow it off.

880
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,440
And I hope some of the video disco folks are listening.

881
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:31,820
Now, I'm aware that even couched in polite language like this,

882
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:35,480
what I'm saying may sound unbelievably nasty and arrogant.

883
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:40,800
Once again, I'll reiterate that a subgenius can be dumb, very dumb.

884
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:47,520
But the ways we apply what little brains we have is vastly more beneficial, friends,

885
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,540
than the jealous pursuits to which the terrifying,

886
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:58,240
horrified pink rabbit boy people apply their boundless intelligence and sophistication.

887
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,480
So your pinks are always good.

888
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,440
They're great at acting smart.

889
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:11,100
They can impeccably imitate styles that a subgenius would never bother with.

890
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:17,720
Pinkness especially lends itself to that grim, concerned, intellectual facade.

891
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,520
That's one of the easiest poses in the world.

892
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:20,520


893
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:20,520


894
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:20,540
And I'm sure you've all seen it.

895
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,000
You can't just be a poor old friend,

896
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:27,300
let your rude, humorless behavior imply that you're brilliant without ever actually doing

897
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,460
anything to prove it.

898
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:33,380
And this works for them because their fellow pinks fall for it so easily.

899
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,980
Now, subgeniuses can be what are called geniuses.

900
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,080
Albert Einstein was undoubtedly a subgenius.

901
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,580
He could barely tie his shoes till he was 10.

902
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,420
The guys who invented nuclear power,

903
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,960
and the nuclear weapons were subgeniuses.

904
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,600
But the ones who deployed them were pinks.

905
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,200
And you notice that those subs took the blame willingly.

906
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,200
They were the biggest opponents to the bomb once they found out what the pink bureaucrats,

907
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,380
politicians, and club owners had in mind for it.

908
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,580
How can I be so mean and vengeful, dear friends?

909
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:19,000
Well, it's my job to verbalize common subgenius feelings where possible.

910
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,500
And I'd rather pee on the floor than on the floor.

911
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:25,000
And I'd rather kick off a bunch of pink boys than let my less-confident fellow subs

912
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,820
go on feeling vaguely guilty because they have the fairness to be a little unsure

913
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,280
if maybe the pinks aren't right.

914
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:34,580
And I'm just reminding you, friends, they aren't.

915
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,820
There just happens to be more of them.

916
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:41,260
So the best way to look at them is as an unfortunate fact of life.

917
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,500
A force of nature like a drought.

918
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,220
You can't teach a pink boy to think.

919
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,720
My wife is a teacher,

920
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,400
and she's been trying to do that for years.

921
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,900
to her utter frustration.

922
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,900
Personally, I feel like they're better swayed

923
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,620
through entertainment.

924
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,380
Their lives are dedicated to imitating

925
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,140
the characters they see on TV.

926
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,560
We can only try to feed these poor creatures

927
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,640
new myths that will sink into their minds.

928
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,720
Not only is it a safer way to do it,

929
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,420
but it's more effective and profitable.

930
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:16,640
Incredible.

931
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,020
Pinks worship entertainers, dear friends.

932
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,440
Their status system is remarkably easy to manipulate

933
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,920
if you apply yourself to doing so.

934
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,380
The Subgenius Foundation, in the service of Bob, does this,

935
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,800
but only in a half-hearted way,

936
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,460
because it's a little distasteful,

937
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,440
because it's so easy, dear friends.

938
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:44,220
It's false slack, and that's seductive.

939
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:51,000
Their idea of professionalism is to stick to what they know works.

940
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,940
The subgenius idea of professionalism

941
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:58,300
is to see what else might work.

942
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,880
Bold surrealists we are, dear friends.

943
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,060
Bold surrealists.

944
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,680
It could be a classic, beautiful world of Bob,

945
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:13,140
pure slack and hedonistic pleasures for all of us.

946
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,380
Instead, it's a jumbled mess,

947
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,340
a pink,

948
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:16,560
punk,

949
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:17,800
poop.

950
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,340
Let there be slack.

951
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:37,180
And the music there is by D.K. Jones, essentially,

952
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,920
in the form of W.K.G.B.

953
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,560
that has been played on the radio,

954
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,240
and this is the first time that we've played it.

955
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:56,240


956
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:56,300
It's a piece of work.

957
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:56,340


958
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:56,340


959
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:56,340


960
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:56,340


961
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:56,340


962
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:56,340


963
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:56,340


964
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:56,340


965
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,080
By the baffling and the bizarre.

966
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:06,140
If so, you will tune in Thursdays at midnight until 2 a.m.

967
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,700
for Radio Soiree.

968
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,960
Allow me to introduce myself.

969
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,880
I am the Martian neon creature,

970
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,880
your masterful,

971
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,300
controlling,

972
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,600
for those two hours which you cannot escape.

973
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:31,040
Just the way I did when I tried my first smoke.

974
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,600
I thought I'd seen everything.

975
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,140
We're stuck up here. We ain't moving.

976
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,000
It only seems that way.

977
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,960
Matter of fact, we're traveling thousands of miles per hour.

978
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,360
Cut out your gyros.

979
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,580
Hey, but okay.

980
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,520
Go ahead, Oit.

981
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:49,540
Okay.

982
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:50,860
Okay.

983
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:51,920
Okay.

984
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,140
Okay.

985
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:54,160
Okay.

986
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,840
Go ahead, Oit.

987
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:55,380
Okay.

988
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:59,000
To keep all the world, congratulate you for your epic making achievement.

989
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,920
Oh, thank you.

990
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,780
Good afternoon, dear.

991
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,080
You're welcome.

992
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,480
And well be for a couple more days.

993
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,500
It's nighttime here.

994
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,840
This is great and wonderful news for the people of the earth.

995
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:10,700
All right.

996
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,100
That's a standing rule for everybody.

997
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,440
And no beer, no babes, no baseball.

998
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,940
Meanwhile, we go back to the ship and strip off everything we can.

999
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,080
What?

1000
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,320
Tell us that.

1001
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:21,900
We're stripped.

1002
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,920
Now, anybody, anything in his pockets?

1003
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,300
We're stripped.

1004
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:25,760
Absolutely.

1005
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,100
Got it.

1006
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,260
Are you all right?

1007
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,060
Whoa.

1008
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,800
That was, oh, thanks to Gary Waller for that little piece there.

1009
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:43,460
I'm from San Francisco, California, and we don't know how to kill presidents there.

1010
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,700
We sure do.

1011
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,860
We got to kill Bob.

1012
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,100
Those San Francisco guys.

1013
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,820
You think you have his corpse here?

1014
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,320
We think we have his corpse there.

1015
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,380
We have definite proof that we have Bob's corpse still within Berkeley City limits.

1016
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,680
I know you're used to Narnini, Nunu, Bob.

1017
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,780
We have different deities in California.

1018
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,740
We worship little green things.

1019
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,680
We worship the dead.

1020
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,800
We worship Panthers.

1021
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,820
We worship Destroyer Wolves.

1022
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:35,120
dot com or do stepsh 93 .

1023
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,360
We have a band that's keep on destroying our gathered discernment in conditions that

1024
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:37,360


1025
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:37,360


1026
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:37,360


1027
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:37,440
We have our own close reader whom we don't give a damn about.

1028
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,160
This album is gonna take eleven more of us to hell than what Oh!

1029
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,580
Don't be afraid to talk.

1030
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,720
If Bob Kim is the father of this song, it could be about the death of Bar and Brian

1031
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:43,720


1032
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:43,720


1033
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,380
I would go down with her under out of that crazy gear.

1034
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:44,420
Mark, else, is he the doc?

1035
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:44,680
It's one thing to bring bar cars down if it's not handled correctly.

1036
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:52,400
audience uh for instance uh you know is it really spoon bending and guitar bending or is it uh

1037
00:58:52,920 --> 00:59:00,180
is it a trick just simply a trick uh magician's trick props special effects

1038
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,800
well you know we really claim to have superhuman powers

1039
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,040
is

1040
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:24,560
see where we are here

1041
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,780
ah yes we're coming near the end of an hour one hour of slack

1042
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,340
oh yes the sex pistols here

1043
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:47,020
i guess that's sid vicious's version of my way

1044
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,920
more much more than this

1045
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,320
is

1046
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,620
regrets

1047
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,620
are better

1048
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,860
, more than this

1049
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:38,900
i had to dance

1050
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,840
and so it proved

1051
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,800
without exception

1052
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,420
on plenty's

1053
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,860
giant course

1054
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,160
is kibble's

1055
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:53,700
dip

1056
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,400
all on the high

1057
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,220
place

1058
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,340
and more

1059
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,420
much more than this

1060
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:04,640
and it's

1061
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,060
no

1062
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:05,780
more than this

1063
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,060
why

1064
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:08,660
why

1065
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,240
there were times

1066
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,560
of showing you

1067
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,100
when they was

1068
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:16,680
fucked

1069
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,200
for godless today

1070
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,760
or

1071
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,200
we know

1072
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,260
when they was down

1073
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,200
or shut it up

1074
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,680
or kick this

1075
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:31,140
dust

1076
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,900
or bite the wall

1077
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,780
or kick this dust

1078
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,140
and it's

1079
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:39,500
my

1080
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:41,800
way

1081
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,480
of love

1082
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,380
and been at night

1083
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:51,160
and had more thrill

1084
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,060
my tear of losing

1085
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,800
and now

1086
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,880
the tears have signed

1087
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,420
upon it all

1088
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:05,420
so i'm used

1089
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:05,780
to

1090
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:05,780


1091
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:05,780


1092
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:05,780


1093
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:05,780


1094
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:07,720
Praise Bob.

1095
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,200
Praise Bob.

1096
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,140
I just wanted to...

1097
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,240
No, you don't.

1098
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,980
Don't want to party?

1099
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,700
We're going to have a subgenius party.

1100
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:20,020
I found the spot this afternoon.

1101
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,620
It's a place the Flykillers rent.

1102
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,640
So tune in next week and hopefully we'll have a date.
