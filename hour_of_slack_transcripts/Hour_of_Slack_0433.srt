1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
Groovy. Dynamite. Heavy. Wow. Out of sight.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,240
These are the words of a drug user.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,020
Learn them. Know them. And listen for them at your home.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,720
Your child might be hooked on narcotics.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,980
And that's a bummer.

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,360
People often ask me if I have any...

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,040
Wait a minute.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,760
That's mine.

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,540
I think I need some water.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,600
I've got some water.

11
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,160
I was just hearing you think...

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,120
People often ask me if I have any words of advice for young people.

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,780
Words of advice for young people.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,940
Well, here are a few simple admonitions for young and old.

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,140
Never interfere in a boy and girl relationship.

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,460
Right.

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,620
Beware of whores who say they don't want money.

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,840
The hell they don't.

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,380
What they mean is they want more money.

20
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,360
Much more.

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,540
If you're doing business with a religious son of a bitch,

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,700
get it in writing.

23
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,040
His word isn't worth nothing with a good lord telling him how to put on a deal.

24
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,840
Words of advice for dumb people.

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,540
Words of advice for dumb people.

26
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,720
Avoid them.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,660
You all know the type.

28
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,840
Anything they have anything to do with,

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,120
no matter how good it sounds,

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,460
turns into a disaster.

31
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,000
Do not offer sympathy to the mentally ill.

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,980
Tell them firmly,

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,600
I am not paid to listen to this drivel.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,100
You are a terminal fool.

35
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,120
Words of advice for dumb people.

36
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,860
Words of advice for dumb people.

37
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,240
Words of advice for dumb people.

38
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,240


39
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,480
Words of advice for dumb people.

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,480
Words of advice for dumb people.

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,920
Now some of your mankind are the devil's bargain.

42
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,040
You get that far.

43
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,000
Any old soul is worth saving, at least to a priest.

44
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,000
But not every soul is worth buying.

45
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,020
So you can take the offer as a compliment.

46
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,020
They charge the easy ones first.

47
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,380
You know, like money, all the money there is.

48
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,140
Yeah, but who wants to be the richest guy in some cemetery?

49
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,080
Money won't buy, eh?

50
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,180
Not much left to spend it on, eh, Gramps?

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,660
Getting too old to cut the mustard.

52
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,140
I was a little drunk.

53
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,140


54
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,140


55
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,140


56
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,140


57
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,140


58
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,140


59
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,340
I was a young body grad.

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,740
Like three-card money, like pee under the shell.

61
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,500
Now you see it, now you don't.

62
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,780
Haven't you forgotten something, Gramps?

63
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,340
In order to feel something, you have to be there.

64
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,900
You have to be 18.

65
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,240
You're not 18, you are 17.

66
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,040
Old fool sold his soul for a strap.

67
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,140
Old fool sold his soul for a strap.

68
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,980
Well, I always try the easy ones first.

69
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,980
How about an honorable bargain?

70
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,840
You always wanted to be a doctor without your chance.

71
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,380
Why, you could become a great eater and benefit humanity.

72
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,760
What's wrong with that?

73
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,080
Just about everything.

74
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,600
There are no honorable bargains involving

75
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,620
exchange of qualitative merchandise like souls.

76
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,500
I want to say the merchandise like time and money.

77
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,260
So piss off, Satan, and don't take me for a dumber than I look.

78
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,660
As an old junk pusher told me, watch whose money you pick up.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,600
Words of advice for young people.

80
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,360
Words of advice for young people.

81
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,620
Words of advice for young people.

82
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,000
Words of advice for young people.

83
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,140
Words of advice for young people.

84
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,740
Words of advice for young people.

85
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,180
Words of advice for young people.

86
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,220
Words of advice for young people.

87
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,780
People often ask me if I have any words of advice for young people.

88
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,800
All too soon, the show ends and the show begins.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,140
The show begins another cycle of shows.

90
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,000
We want you to never forget, that's right, these awful shows.

91
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,420
The terrible wasted lives that you've spent.

92
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,900
The collective years of listening.

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,140
To this rotten show.

94
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:21,800
Yes.

95
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,380
And you don't even get it.

96
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,860
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

97
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,800
On a friendly basis.

98
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,040
This show is our only method of communicating with you Earth people.

99
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,160
In hope that in the storm of Babel, you will understand the basic reality of our method.

100
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,600
And apprehend that we are not simply a comedy group or a humorous exercise,

101
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,140
but actually the emissaries of a distant civilization,

102
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,140
which only wishes to be.

103
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:55,480
And wishes to confer its own understanding upon the citizens of your rather backward planet.

104
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,840
We thank you for listening.

153
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,820
BUCKET OF PILLS!

154
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,160
John got a bucket. John's got a bucket. John got a bucket of pills!

155
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,160
John got a bucket. John's got a bucket. John's got a bucket of pills!

156
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,500
You see right here, ladies and gentlemens, the ultimate spectacle of decadence!

157
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,200
This is an actual bucket!

158
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,760
A bucket of pills, of course less than a gallon.

159
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,180
and still a misdemeanor in Arkansas.

160
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,980
But we have a bucket, a certified bucket of pills.

161
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,080
Live heroes, saints, and SOPs.

162
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,520
This is more maniacal than the turtle watching,

163
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,420
more horrible than the guitar scenes.

164
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,420
This is a certified Dr. Bob bucket of pills.

165
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,320
Partake.

166
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,100
These aren't any ordinary street drugs.

167
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,580
These are Bob pills.

168
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,920
These receive the essence of Bob's brain.

169
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,880
We know we receive a responsibility for brain damage.

170
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,480
We also possesses.

171
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,880
We've got, we've got, uh, we have words.

172
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,060
So no responsibility for brain damage.

173
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,580
The effects of these pills.

174
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,740
No, no, no.

175
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,200
Our powers, uh, ours, uh, ours.

176
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,440
Some of these pills contain the true slack of Bob.

177
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,900
Some of them contain the nerve of wax.

178
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,780
So, and some of them contain nothing but your,

179
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,620
but your, if I believe it, if you believe it,

180
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,840
we all need to end up.

181
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,240
Hey!

182
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,000
Hey!

183
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,740
More pills, Bob.

184
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,440
We've got bucket, bucket.

185
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,480
This is the most illegal thing.

186
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,440
Ain't funny to say.

187
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,620
Yeah, yeah.

188
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,480
Come on, man.

189
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,220
You've never seen anything like a bucket of pills.

190
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,160
Doctors for Bob.

191
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,200
These are the same pills that have been produced

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,400
to leave in 25 states by these wonderful,

193
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,680
wonderful doctors for Bob.

194
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,940
Except for our guns to the bucket of pills.

195
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,340
They only cost $2 extra.

196
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,320
People here at the SLP,

197
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,280
go straight with the clue.

198
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,520
Bucket of pills, bucket of pills.

199
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,560
You won't believe.

200
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,340
Ask your waitress for a codeine injection

201
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,480
after the show.

202
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,400
Bucket of pills.

203
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,740
Not responsible for loss of brain cells,

204
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,600
loss of psychic abilities,

205
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,840
astral projections,

206
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,000
other psychic phenomena,

207
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,460
ESP, dream phenomena,

208
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,180
loss of limbs, self-mutilation, suicide.

209
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,780
Hard to believe this took place on a dance floor

210
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,000
without someone trying to stop it.

211
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,740
Well, police report says by the time they got there,

212
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,880
it turned into quite a brawl.

213
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,920
You tell a kid, a vulnerable kid,

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,940
over and over again that life isn't worth living,

215
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,060
that violence is its own reward,

216
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,200
and you add to it the kind of intensity

217
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,560
that this music has,

218
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,700
and you just might convince her.

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,660
Yeah, fine.

220
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,340
I mean, sometimes I see these kids on the street,

221
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,640
I never give them a second thought.

222
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,960
I thought they were another silly fad,

223
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,120
something that would be blown away

224
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,020
by the next wind.

225
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,620
I never thought it went deeper than that.

226
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,820
Silly fad, huh?

227
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,440
You've got to see it with your own eyes

228
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,460
to believe it quits.

229
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,380
I've seen children come off that dance floor

230
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,500
with crushed ribs and bloody faces,

231
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,120
like soldiers fighting some kind of insane war.

232
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,540
What could persuade a kid to act like that?

233
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,680
Maybe the greatest persuader there is.

234
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,020
At first, I thought,

235
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,720
she'll go out of it like a phase.

236
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,740
So I put up with the makeup and the crazy clothes.

237
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,080
I even put up with the lies for a while.

238
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,200
And then the self-mutilation began.

239
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,340
People think I'm crazy

240
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,480
because there are space beings in my bedroom,

241
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,440
but it's true.

242
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,940
Central Services

243
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,640
We do the work, you do the pleasure

244
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,940
Pleasure

245
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,760
Pleasure

246
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:02,760


247
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,120
Pleasure

248
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,400
Pleasure

249
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,180
Pleasure

250
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,400
Pleasure

251
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,140
Pleasure

252
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,640
Pleasure

253
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:13,900
Pleasure

254
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,140
Pleasure

255
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,120
Pleasure

256
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,260
And good evening to you all tonight.

257
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,100
On the Hour of Slack,

258
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,360
which is the program to which you are now listening,

259
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,420
we heard first,

260
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,960
words of advice for young people

261
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,220
by good old William S. Burroughs,

262
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,320
a kid show host,

263
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,780
and the disposable heroes of hypocrisy,

264
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,040
and a wee bit of the KPFA show show.

265
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,420
Johnny's got a bucket of pills by Doctors of Bob,

266
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,900
which was then followed by Quincy,

267
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,420
trying to figure out Doctors for Bob.

268
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,860
Believe me, better men than you have tried, Quincy.

269
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,620
Realer men, too.

270
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,420
And then we heard Debbie,

271
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,200
the space lesbian,

272
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,000
who probably should have won that beauty contest.

273
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,720
And now,

274
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,600
how about a brand new mix version tape we got

275
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,060
from the Kings of Feedback.

276
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,840
This is utterly new.

277
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,300
And this is

278
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,020
Kill, Kill Bob.

279
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
Repeat, quit your job,

280
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,880
slacker!

281
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,860
You have been driven to the brink of insanity

282
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,640
by the conspiracy!

283
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,680
Bob is your only hope!

284
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,160
You're a lot closer than you even think!

285
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,740
Bob is the way!

286
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,160
Bob is the path!

287
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,180
Believe or die!

288
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,500
No!

289
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,480
Bob is not the answer!

290
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,740
And neither is anything else!

291
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,780
Bob!

292
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,740
Screw Bob!

293
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,300
What does he know?

294
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,460
Don't believe anything Bob knows you!

295
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,120
Blasphemy!

296
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,200
He's the best of the undone, Bob!

297
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,640
That's right!

298
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,920
Bob is a loser!

299
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,500
Bob is the offer on my slack!

300
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,320
Bob is a big boy!

301
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,120
Bob is a big boy!

302
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,380
Bob just takes it all for himself!

303
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,820
He gets all the women!

304
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,140
He gets all the rock!

305
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,520
He gets all the slack!

306
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,600
Bob!

307
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,060
Kill Bob!

308
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,200
Kill Bob!

309
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,620
Kill Bob!

310
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,160
Kill Bob!

311
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:27,420


312
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:27,920
Kill Bob!

313
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,060
Kill Bob!

314
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,620
Kill Bob!

315
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,020
Bob is a conspiracy patsy!

316
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,420
Bob faked his own crucifixion

317
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,380
so he could be resurrected

318
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,220
and become your personal savior!

319
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,100
Bob is in the back of his limo right now

320
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,460
getting ahead from your girlfriend!

321
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,420
Grab your favorite doll,

322
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,880
come and whack his head off!

323
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,780
Whack it!

324
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,060
And place it in the trophy case

325
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,480
right next to the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer!

326
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,000
That's right Bob!

327
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,560
He's a sinner just like you!

328
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,060
The second coming to Bob will be a slaughter!

329
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,540
With the Bob's problem,

330
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,380
they are Bob!

331
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,320
Bob's got bleeding the fuck!

332
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,380
Bob!

333
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,680
Kill Bob!

334
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,500
Kill Bob!

335
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,780
Kill Bob!

336
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,520
Kill Bob!

337
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,160
Kill Bob!

338
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,320
Kill Bob!

339
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,780
Kill Bob!

340
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,120
Kill Bob!

341
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,560
Kill Bob!

342
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:16,340


343
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,160
Forgive me Bob!

344
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,360
Oh Bob!

345
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,860
I have sinned against you!

346
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,900
I was possessed by the anti-Bob!

347
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,880
Please forgive me!

348
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,360
Please!

349
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,740
Please Bob!

350
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:32,980
Please Bob!

351
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,400
Please Bob!

352
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,640
Please Bob!

353
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,560
Please Bob!

354
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,760
Please Bob!

355
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,020
If they would love him,

356
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,380
much to do buddy,

357
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,880
we would never have any problems.

358
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,460
Kirby will be are our friend,

359
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:02,920
and he tries to save us in the fall!

360
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,580
Oh he will.

361
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,960
Let's all have a little more to say to Ben!

362
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,260
The one who stronger!

363
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,900
The flying license player!

364
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,540
He's the best!

365
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,360
Yes he is!

366
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,780
here again any other stories take some samples yeah i used to be king of the right hand man

367
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,600
that was before your time

368
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:45,980
yes before our slaughter oh it's time for rocket away and that's just what we're doing as we near

369
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,180
the station and now we'll be talking with the mother module for a few minutes and as they say

370
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,060
doing the buffo and then perhaps returning to the street to wake up harmless tree people with

371
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,440
the falls and laughter and the rich human neither shall we flinch nor shall we falter

372
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,240
our sincerest laughter with some pain is fraught

373
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,800
bob will be right back the hell he will

374
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,820
we have him out here tied to the sisyphean wheel of syphilis

375
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:34,460
and domestic social change the sound you hear is a rabbit baboon attempting to escape from

376
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:41,020
his enclosure sooner or later he will get out and this show will take a radical change

377
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,880
uh

378
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,780
solidified

379
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:02,780


380
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,200
come on

381
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,700
I love you.

382
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,060
Out of my visa, she's so divine

383
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,040
Helps me stealing pop caps, waste all the time

384
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,960
Frozen eyes, all the way from back

385
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,200
My trip of fools is ready for her

386
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,060
Primer, Picarucha, Chevy 39

387
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,500
Going to El Monte, you believe the stadium

388
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,160
Think of my visa, she's so divine

389
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,100
Helps me stealing pop caps, waste all the time

390
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,720
Frozen eyes, all the way from back

391
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,180
My trip of fools is ready for her

392
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,960
Won't you please hear my plea

393
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,480
Primer, Picarucha, Chevy 39

394
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,840
Going to El Monte, you believe the stadium

395
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,540
Think of my visa, she's so divine

396
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,140
Helps me stealing pop caps, waste all the time

397
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,180
Frozen eyes, all the way from back

398
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,540
My trip of fools is ready for her

399
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,920
Primer, Picarucha, Chevy 39

400
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,460
Going to El Monte, you believe the stadium

401
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,640
Think of my visa, she's so divine

402
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,340
Frozen eyes, all the way from back

403
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,720
My trip of fools is ready for her

404
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,580
Primer, Picarucha, Chevy 39

405
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,020
Going to El Monte, you believe the stadium

406
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,340
Think of my visa, she's so divine

407
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:50,540
Frozen eyes, all the way from back

408
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,600
My trip of fools is ready for her

409
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:00,620
Frozen eyes, all the way from back

410
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,480
My trip of fools is ready for her

411
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,720
Frozen eyes, all the way from back

412
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,380
My trip of fools is ready for her

413
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,640
Frozen eyes, all the way from back

414
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,240
Frozen eyes, all the way from back

415
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,400
Frozen eyes, all the way from back

416
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,500
Okay, well, here lately, we haven't heard all that much, really, have we?

417
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:37,900
Kings of Feedback, Kill Bob, if you want to contact those fine fellows.

418
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,840
One six one seven, Lick OBE, just find those on your telephone.

419
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:50,080
Let's see, five, four, two, hmm.

420
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,160
And then a little bit of KPFA, Dr. Howell and Puzzev doing the Bufo.

421
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,160
And then just then some mothers and their dogs, breath.

422
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,960
We got some mail from David Koresh last week.

423
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,720
Bet you didn't.

424
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,380
Right here.

425
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:16,040
David Koresh, return address, mail drop 66623, witness protection plan, Washington, D.C.

426
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,080
And we got, there's a couple of...

427
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,600
Yeah.

428
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,960
Letters in here, one of which is just a copy of one he sent to someone else.

429
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,980
They're only identified by their first name, but I think I know who it is.

430
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,360
I don't know.

431
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,960
I'll probably read both of them, but let me just read this first one.

432
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,820
Let's see.

433
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,160
Dear Janet, look at that.

434
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,160
Dear Janet, writes Dave Koresh, dear Janet, I am calm and serene because I have Jesus

435
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,860
in my heart.

436
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,580
He died for my sins and for yours, Janet.

437
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,580
The earthlings nailed him to an anvil.

438
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:49,840
Oh!

439
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,300
One of you should look for my safety.

440
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:50,300


441
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,780
He was dumb.

442
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,940
amount of passive vomit and love had raised an age-old March in black.

443
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,060
So much so that the parameters of r slack and then black sixty creating more of the

444
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,220
same numbers add up.

445
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,740
That's what it is about, I believe.

446
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:11,740


447
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:11,800
I'd rather be my own lady.

448
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,440
Why don't come home tonight, leaving me alone tonight?

449
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,300
Oh, improve my memory?

450
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:19,560
Why think about those boys and girls over me, Janet?

451
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:19,560


452
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,040
God sent Earth a humble, celibate, pacifist holy man.

453
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,740
The government killed him.

454
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,140
It is clear what this planet wants, saith the Lord, so now you got me,

455
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,700
an obnoxious a-hole who likes little girls and machine guns. Deal with it.

456
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,380
Anyway, one of my disciples just got his Class 3 FFL yesterday,

457
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,200
and as a lawyer, you must know that there is no federal jurisdiction over age of consent.

458
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,480
These so-called jokes that, if you want to pick up one of Dave's girlfriends,

459
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,500
friends you'd better have a dustbuster, sicken me, as they are intended to do, I guess.

460
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,880
Surely even your own warped psychology does not accuse them of wrongdoing.

461
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:03,140
Why persist in this dangerous game of chicken by implying that you'd be willing to kill people I love just to get at me?

462
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,660
Even the five families never did that.

463
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,680
Go home, Janet. Take Higgins and the Bureau of A-holes, Turkeys, and F-ups with you.

464
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,240
ATF. Read the Bible. Read the Constitution. Read Lolita.

465
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,900
The joke's on you, Janet.

466
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,460
You can do it.

467
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,580
You can't kill us, even if you burn the ranch to the ground with fission, fusion, fission, or fams.

468
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,100
Sentence never dies.

469
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,380
God bless you. Leave us alone.

470
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,320
Signed, your brother in Christ, Dave Koresh.

471
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:39,360
Speaking of Christ, uh, Christ, you know, just between you and me,

472
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,160
this subgenius stuff's just not really working out right now.

473
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,160
Uh, financially, you know, it's, uh, we're, we're,

474
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,680
we're utterly, utterly broke. It's, it's pathetic.

475
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,960
Didn't do all that hot on the pledge drive last week, uh, either.

476
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,280
So, you know, we're, we're floundering, and we're searching also.

477
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:06,980
So, part of tonight's show is going to be, uh, some experiments, perhaps,

478
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:14,120
and looking for maybe something that might bring in some bucks since, you know, you don't seem to love Bob enough.

479
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,740
Maybe you'll like some of this other stuff we have planned tonight.

480
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,860
So, bear with us and let us know which of this is more to your liking.

481
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,560
This, this one, this one might work. Stay tuned. Thanks.

482
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,540
I'd like to pass on

483
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,780
the feeling of great joy I found in Ack and Carr

484
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,440
for those who have ears too.

485
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:47,920
Here.

486
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,460
For I too have had

487
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,980
A longing deep inside

488
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,580
Never knowing where to hide

489
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,140
For one day up, the next day down

490
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,340
No longer am I tied to this earth round

491
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,620
Its troubles or woe

492
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,800
I have no fear of death no more

493
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,520
Since on the path of

494
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,720
Ack

495
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,360
I've been led

496
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,160
Greater is he that

497
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,200
Ruleth his own spirit

498
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,800
Than taketh a city for inward rulership

499
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,400
Is the mastery of the masters

500
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,780
This too can be yours

501
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,640
For those at the grassroots

502
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,840
And those in doubt

503
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,100
Who just don't understand

504
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,920
Let your ears hear these few words

505
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,700
Give me a word

506
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:47,960
And I'll give you a signal

507
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,560
No thought of where you are

508
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,260
For the master is always with you

509
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,920
For in soul you can be free

510
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,520
And you parents that would allow this filth to be in your home

511
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,780
You ought to be taken out somewhere and horsewhipped

512
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,460
You hear me?

513
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,280
And I mean it, my friend.

514
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,860
Glory!

515
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:17,700
They're having sex, the sex instruction courses in our public schools.

516
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,480
Of the winter hog.

517
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,100
He can't know his earth let's get me whoa

518
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,680
If you won't recognize him

519
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:43,380
E Wade

520
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:43,380


521
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:43,580
Ya like me

522
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:43,640
Ci gleam

523
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,500
My back is scale

524
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:46,500


525
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,000
Your has not gone away

526
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,380
Is stopped

527
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:47,640
Most all amongst the earth

528
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:47,680
Touched love

529
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,900
chair somewhere and get mad at the devil and mad at the world and mad at Sam

530
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,120
and realize that we need to do something.

531
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,160
We sit back and let the devil run over us.

532
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,880
Young people, it's a ring of fire.

533
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,560
Let me close.

534
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,020
You say, preacher, way down deep in here, no one knows about it.

535
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,400
I don't say it.

536
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,860
I talk the opposite direction.

537
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,960
A young man wrote a letter the other day that was high on dope and said,

538
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:30,820
please, mom and dad, please, preacher, please, society, don't listen to what I say.

539
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,740
Don't listen to me when I say I want dope or I want sex or I want to burn or I want to kill, destroy.

540
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,160
Don't listen to me.

541
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,380
I don't know what I'm saying.

542
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,720
Way down deep inside.

543
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,040
I long for that which is pure and holy.

544
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:02,680
But the devil is making our young people believe today you can't live it.

545
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,260
You can't live it.

546
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,560
It's too hard.

547
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,500
Too hard.

548
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,440
Let me tell you, and I want to burst that balloon.

549
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,740
It's easier to live for God than it is for the devil.

550
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:21,380
Detroit, Michigan, the other night I watched a girl on television, 14 years old,

551
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,000
infested and infected in brown badol.

552
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,800
They asked her, are you going to quit?

553
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,380
She said no.

554
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,500
Why?

555
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,740
I can't.

556
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,120
I try to.

557
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,880
And the pains start right here.

558
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,260
The pain.

559
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,260
And they spread until I'm climbing the wall.

560
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,860
I'm going to kill my mother for a fix.

561
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,500
If you think that's a good time, you're a fool.

562
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:02,220
Oh, my friend, I only hope you realize at this prediction what we face in the future.

563
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,980
The days will grow long.

564
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,040
The nights will grow shorter.

565
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:15,520
And I predict that truly nothing will change because the precepts of America, of God, of home,

566
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,120
mother and honor will stay.

567
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,200
And we will always know within our hearts, no matter what the atheistic cry from the

568
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,260
hilltops may be, that prayer changes things.

569
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,360
I'd like to pass on

570
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,500
The feeling of returning from the neck and cargo

571
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,440
For those who have is to hear

572
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,020
For we to have had

573
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,460
For all for real

574
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:45,840
The year we make off As we roll back in time

575
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:45,840


576
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,720
I'm never knowing where to hide

577
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,100
For one day up, the next day down

578
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:57,420
No longer are we tied to this earth world

579
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,280
This trouble's a war

580
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,560
It's on the path of air

581
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,440
Greater is he that willeth his own spirit

582
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,660
And taketh a city for a new ownership

583
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,420
Is the mastery of the masters

584
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,860
This too can be yours

585
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,440
For those at the grassroots

586
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,600
Those in doubt

587
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,840
Who just don't understand

588
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,660
Let your ears hear these few words

589
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,020
Give no thought of where you are

590
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,200
For the master is always with you

591
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,360
For in this world

592
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,520
You can be free

593
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,780
You can be free

594
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,240
And now, Crosley Bendix,

595
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,520
Cultural Reviewer and Director of Stylistic Premonitions

596
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,540
for the Universal Media Network.

597
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,620
With today's Arts Review.

598
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,640
Today's discussion revolves, nay, spins

599
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,200
around the subject of technology and the arts.

600
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,180
Watch that voice.

601
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,000
The modern artist.

602
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,880
I'm having some problem here with the...

603
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,960
The...

604
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,500
The...

605
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,220
The...

606
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:44,420
The...

607
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:44,420


608
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:44,420


609
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:44,500
The...

610
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,800
The modern artist is indeed in a unique position

611
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,560
relative to the history of art.

612
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,660
The development of technical techniques based on...

613
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,160
The...

614
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,040
The...

615
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,100
The...

616
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,420
The...

617
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,420


618
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,420


619
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,420


620
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,420


621
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,420


622
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,420


623
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,420


624
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,420


625
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,420


626
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,420


627
00:31:59,420 --> 00:31:59,420


628
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,680
To express the essence of our age...

629
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,740
The...

630
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:03,920
The...

631
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,140
The...

632
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,720
The...

633
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:04,960
The...

634
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,020
The...

635
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,280
Essence of our age.

636
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,900
An age of complex specialization

637
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,700
and the rapid obsolescence of...

638
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:24,480
The impulse will always crash toward the magnet of curiosity.

639
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,580
Development of a new silicon-controlled rectifier

640
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,820
may be more interesting than the invention of a new color.

641
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,880
I've lost my place here. There seems to be some problem with the...

642
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,360
There. That should make sense.

643
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,420
To collaborate with technicians produces a new...

644
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:07,640
Modern artist is highly educated and is no longer intimidated by technological processes...

645
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,080
...but is still an expert in the field of digital technology.

646
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,140
Hey. There. I'm back. I'm back. Excuse me.

647
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,480
Embracing a hardware approach to creation...

648
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,780
Oh for heaven's sake. What?

649
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,280
It's a...

650
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,020
It's a...

651
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,060
It's a...

652
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,100
It's a...

653
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,000
It's a...

654
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,680
It's a...

655
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,520
It's a...

656
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,220
It's a...

657
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,380
It's a...

658
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:44,500
It's a...

659
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,740
I find it difficult to keep my...

660
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,420
Not now...

661
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:02,120
Interacting with electrical processes in particular creates new forms of startling...

662
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,160
Stop! Stop! Stop!

663
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,760
Is that...

664
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,780
Is that...

665
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,880
Correct here? Correct?

666
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,340
No.

667
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,400


668
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,400


669
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,380
I don't know if you're paying attention.

670
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:16,380


671
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:16,380


672
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,220
I'm trying to get back on track.

673
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:34,820
Uh, the new appeal by the technology for artists is undoubtedly...

674
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,540
I have that a little high there.

675
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,340
Unλαodably based...

676
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,720
on a fascination with the implications,

677
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:51,840
or rather the implied mystique of immortality.

678
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,020
The faith in process.

679
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:53,120
As new materials and techniques emerge from scientific discoveries,

680
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,320
the artist equally embraces...

681
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,920
I think I went over that, didn't I, before?

682
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,540
We'll try this.

683
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,020
Ah, that sounds better.

684
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,960
Ah, let's see, where was I?

685
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,120
Ah, recent electrocutions notwithstanding...

686
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,260
All new directions are open.

687
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,040
Now watch this.

688
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,380
Why am I only...

689
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,380
Ah, that's better.

690
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:34,460
All new directions are opened up by unsuspecting scientists...

691
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,980
Ah, that sounds better.

692
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,440
...held out in abstract alphabets of tools and wires.

693
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,220
Color... color coding.

694
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,400
Color coding.

695
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,560
Color coding.

696
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,700
Color coding is perhaps the most misunderstood.

697
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,820
Ah!

698
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,220
Ah!

699
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,700
Ah!

700
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:35,980


701
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,160
Ah!

702
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,600
Ah!

703
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,280
Ah!

704
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,380
Ah!

705
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:37,580
Ah!

706
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:37,960
Ah!

707
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,040
Ah!

708
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:38,480
Ah!

709
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:38,860
Ah!

710
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:38,860


711
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:38,860


712
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:38,860


713
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:38,860


714
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:38,920
Ah!

715
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:38,960


716
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:38,960


717
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:38,960


718
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:38,960


719
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,200
Ah!

720
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:39,820
Ah!

721
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,880
Ah!

722
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,600
Oh...

723
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,440
Ah!

724
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,480
H의hg!

725
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,420
These new means of production mean that

726
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,140
an artist must now carry the manual of poorly translated instructions.

727
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,500
H의hg!

728
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,360
Hıhg!

729
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:52,660
Hıhg!

730
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,040
Hıhg!

731
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,320
Ah!

732
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,500
Ah!

733
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,280
Ah!

734
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,400
I'm going to have to go out and watch.

735
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,520
I'm going to have to go out and watch.

736
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,680
Produces a dialogue of informed static.

737
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,320
Produces a dialogue of informed static.

738
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:46,820
If, if, if, if we, the affidavit followers of the artistic process,

739
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,800
are to absorb these new techniques into our aesthetic vocabulary,

740
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,160
we are to absorb these new techniques into our aesthetic vocabulary.

741
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:07,440
We are to absorb these new techniques into our aesthetic vocabulary.

742
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,820
Jumping the gap of scientific uncertainty

743
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:38,940
to push our senses into the new test tubes of consciousness.

744
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,180
Thank you.

745
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,480
Thank you.

746
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:57,960
Thank you.

747
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,200
You've been listening to cultural reviewer and social critic,

748
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,740
Crosley Bendix.

749
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,040
Yes, you have now.

750
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,260
On the whole, these people are acting in good faith.

751
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,580
In good faith and in the public interest.

752
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:28,940
That's right.

753
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:36,300
And now I'd like to read the other piece of mail we received from Mr. Koresh.

754
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,980
But first...

755
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,700
First epistle to the Hebrews.

756
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,920
Greetings in Jesus' name.

757
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,460
The other day, a little boy from our compound here at Mount Carmel

758
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,100
was talking to one of his Jewish friends about how Christ was crucified for our sins.

759
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,760
Upon learning that Jesus himself was a Jew,

760
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,180
his friend's eyes widened,

761
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,540
he was stunned and surprised and he exclaimed,

762
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,320
well, where the F was Mossad?

763
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,460
Dropkick me, Jesus, through the ring,

764
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,940
singularity of the charged and rotating black hole.

765
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,300
It is clear that we have made it safely across the event horizon,

766
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,040
and only a matter of time before we trans-sit that

767
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,340
glorious infinitive matter-squisher into the heavenly universe

768
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,040
as minus infinity becomes positive infinity at one to zero.

769
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,740
I've thought much about what our fat friend said

770
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,880
when he was out at our ranch with that Pamela woman,

771
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,920
and these are my thoughts.

772
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,420
Maybe we have Nazi skinheads,

773
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,880
not because we have failed to teach the evils of Hitler,

774
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,360
but because we have succeeded.

775
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,820
Think for a moment about the word evil itself.

776
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,460
First notice that it's live spelled backwards,

777
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,400
which is maybe unfortunate.

778
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,840
Also think for a moment about what rough synonyms come to mind

779
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,860
when you think of evil.

780
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,040
My mind comes up with dark forces, mysterious powers, forbidden knowledge,

781
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,360
okay, usually an adjective followed by a noun.

782
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,700
What are the nouns?

783
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,440
Force, power, knowledge,

784
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,720
all words which are normally thought of as good or desirable things.

785
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,140
What are the adjectives?

786
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,400
Dark, mysterious, evil.

787
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,060
Serious, and forbidden.

788
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,180
All of which have a certain tang of naughtiness about them,

789
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,440
which will obviously prove attractive to a certain subset of the population

790
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,260
who are, or at least who consider themselves to be,

791
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,680
rebels of one sort or another.

792
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,080
The word and concept of stupid has none of these problems.

793
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,060
Almost everybody, young or old,

794
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,040
from communist to fascist to capitalist to rabbi to atheist,

795
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,800
agrees that being stupid is a bad thing,

796
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,300
obviously not to be emulated.

797
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,300
As you know, I am not a Jew,

798
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,580
so there is a certain sense in which I can never know about the Holocaust,

799
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,480
the way you can,

800
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,160
just as a man born blind can never know the color red the way we can.

801
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,000
And I'm going to say something which you may find horrible, shocking, and frightening.

802
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,060
You are, however, going to have to acknowledge that it is true,

803
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,880
and you may find that it is heuristically useful in preventing anti-Semitism,

804
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,080
both in word and deed.

805
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,220
So I will say it.

806
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,860
If Hitler wasn't absolutely effing stupid,

807
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,380
he'd have deferred the Holocaust until after he'd won the war.

808
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,420
If you're willing to abandon morality,

809
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,220
to arouse the hatred of millions,

810
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,080
and to ignore long-term consequences,

811
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,560
all of which Hitler was,

812
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,620
then slavery can be extremely useful in the short run,

813
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,020
especially when it involves some of the best and brightest people in your country.

814
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,060
Sorry, but there's no better way to put it.

815
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,940
Anybody who kills a useful slave for no reason,

816
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,200
and in the middle of a war yet,

817
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,520
is obviously evil,

818
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,900
but is also incredibly effing stupid.

819
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,280
Moreover, Hitler must have been either,

820
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,540
one, unaware of what Einstein and his fellows were capable of,

821
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,900
or two, aware but willing to terrify them into emigrating.

822
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,120
Either way, incredibly effing stupid.

823
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,040
We may speak of the horrible, monstrous evil of someone

824
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,660
who would put six million innocents to death for political purposes,

825
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,400
and for us that may be a sufficiently damning indictment,

826
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,660
but there are some who might secretly, infinitesimally,

827
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,340
admire a maniac whose vision permits him to lightly take countless lives in achieving it.

828
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,180
But they will not admire a man who lost a war because he was stupid.

829
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,740
So we return again to the topic of transfer functions,

830
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,100
the best argument for convincing someone you may very well not be the best argument

831
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,640
for convincing someone else.

832
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,340
Read that again.

833
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,720
The best argument for convincing you may very well not be the best argument

834
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,900
for convincing someone else.

835
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,280
This does not mean that you should speak false things,

836
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,380
only that you should carefully choose which true things to say.

837
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,380
Your brother in Christ, David Koresh.

838
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,720
Koresh always a favorite here at the Hour of Slack, as you can tell.

839
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,880
And now, on a lighter note, I hope,

840
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,440
you'll be able to see the next episode of the show.

841
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:24,700
Thank you.

842
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,240
Thank you.

843
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:25,400
Thank you.

844
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,100
Good afternoon, everybody.

845
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,600
This is station W.O.R.D.,

846
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,960
broadcasting from the great stadium of life.

847
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,240
We have for you a play-by-play description of the greatest

848
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,580
and most important of all gridiron classics,

849
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,860
the game of life.

850
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,940
Our game here will be underway in just a few moments.

851
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,900
And while we await the opening whistle,

852
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,900
we'd like to point out some interesting sidelights

853
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,020
surrounding this momentous occasion.

854
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,760
The weather is ideal in the stadium,

855
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,700
even though it really makes little difference,

856
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,900
since a game as important as this one must be played

857
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,980
regardless of conditions.

858
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,140
There's a tremendous crowd on hand today.

859
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,720
The stands are literally packed with a great cloud of witnesses,

860
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,700
as the writer of Hebrews points out.

861
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,240
Down on the field, we can see that both teams are completing

862
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,120
the pregame workouts.

863
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,760
To our right are the players representing Christianity.

864
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,780
And this Christian team,

865
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,700
by the way, has the finest of all coaches.

866
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,160
Noted for his unerring wisdom,

867
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,660
this great mentor, Jesus Christ,

868
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,500
is the model of perfection in the coaching realm.

869
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,020
However, as we look down to our left,

870
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,120
we see another great squad and a very cunning and clever coach.

871
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,740
This is the team coached by Satan,

872
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,200
the forces of evil.

873
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,500
And believe you me, Satan and his men will be tough to handle.

874
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,740
There's a great wave of anticipation and expectancy

875
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,880
in the crowd as the two teams prepare for the game.

876
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,980
And as you know, the referee for this game of life

877
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:58,360
is God himself, the perfect, just, and all-seeing referee.

878
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,160
And the rules of the game, the instructions as to how

879
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,240
it should be played, are found in God's book, the Bible.

880
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,900
The coaches have given their respective players

881
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,120
their last-minute instructions, Jesus Christ telling his players,

882
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,420
go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

883
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,840
Christ has now come off the field,

884
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,020
and it's all up to the players whom he's just left

885
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,880
with that last-minute instruction.

886
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,440
And the last-minute challenge ringing in their ears.

887
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,940
The outcome of this spectacle is all the more important

888
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,560
to these alumni who are here because of the fact that

889
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,520
the entire hope of Christianity in this, the game of life,

890
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,960
depends upon the ball-carrying ability of average Christian.

891
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,300
This places a heavy responsibility on average Christian,

892
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,620
and that's the reason the eyes of the crowd

893
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,880
will be upon him today.

894
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,440
Both teams are lined up now for the opening kickoff.

895
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,000
The goals of the two teams are exactly opposite,

896
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,240
that of Christianity being the goal of heaven,

897
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,620
while the forces of evil will head toward their goal, hell.

898
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,580
And now it's going to be Satan's team kicking off to Christianity.

899
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,100
And there's the referee's whistle as the game is underway.

900
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,440
It's criticism kicking a high end-over-end kick.

901
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,840
It's taken on the goal line by average Christian.

902
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,760
He starts up the field as forces of evil players move in on him.

903
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,020
He appears a bit uncertain, but he gets across the 15.

904
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,100
Now he cuts to his right and picks up some interference.

905
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,200
It's prayer and humility.

906
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,780
Average Christian is still going up the far sideline,

907
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,500
past the 30 with prayer and humility out in front, clearing the way.

908
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,860
There's one of Satan's men trying to get in.

909
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,440
He's trying to crash through.

910
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,920
And average Christian sidesteps beautifully at the 40,

911
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,120
getting away from temptation.

912
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,280
Now he runs with added confidence.

913
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,520
He crosses the midfield stripe and makes his way toward this side of the field.

914
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,520
But he left his interference on the other side.

915
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,680
And now he's by himself down to the 45.

916
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,420
He sidesteps nicely, getting away from hypocrisy,

917
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,200
and goes to the 43, doing a nice job in the broken field.

918
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,780
But there's a player coming up from behind.

919
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,360
He's gaining.

920
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,920
He dives and makes the tackle beautifully at the 40-yard line

921
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,700
in forces of evil territory.

922
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,880
Average Christian appeared confident that he was on his way to score.

923
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,660
But temptation sneaked in for the tackle.

924
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:02,220
And over on the far sidelines, we can see Satan pacing up and down the sidelines,

925
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,740
getting reserves ready for action.

926
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,780
Here's Christianity back to the line of scrimmage.

927
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,480
And the ball is snapped this time to Average Christian,

928
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,340
who drives off his own right tackle, finds a hole,

929
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,740
and blasts through to the 32

930
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:15,440
before the big opposing lineman, Procrastination, brings him to the ground.

931
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,760
The tackle who opened that hole for Average Christian

932
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,440
was the very capable and important lineman, Church Attendance.

933
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,140
He had a hole there big enough to drive the proverbial truck through.

934
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,320
And Average Christian drove through nicely

935
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,160
until hit hard by Procrastination in the opponent's secondary.

936
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,860
Second down two now as Christianity is out of the huddle once again.

937
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,880
The forces of evil set up their defense.

938
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:38,860
And here's the play.

939
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,720
It's Average Christian trying the middle of the line.

940
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,100
He stopped cold after a pickup of about a yard.

941
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,560
It was carelessness on the tackle

942
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,660
as good intentions failed to open a hole

943
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,200
in the line.

944
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,000
In fact, good intentions was in the way himself on that one.

945
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,700
Well, it's third down and a yard,

946
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,500
and the Christianity team is calling for a timeout.

947
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,940
Just what Christianity will do to stop Procrastination,

948
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,440
hypocrisy, temptation, and the other forces of evil remains to be seen.

949
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,560
We've noted in observing some of the onlookers

950
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,160
that there are several famous and successful veterans

951
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,080
of this big game in the stands today.

952
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,500
They are famous alumni who are on hand to pull

953
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:18,820
the ball to the right of the line.

954
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,300
They are the most popular men trying to follow in their footsteps.

955
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,400
Among them are such notables as Moses, Gideon, Peter, Paul,

956
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,740
and many, many others.

957
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,720
It's time to go back to play now at the Stadium of Life.

958
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,580
Christianity out of the huddle and up to the line of scrimmage.

959
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,700
And here's the pass from center.

960
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,080
Again it goes to Average Christian.

961
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,300
Average Christian is coming around his own left end

962
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,760
looking for a chance to cut downfield.

963
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,260
Now he's getting some interference and makes his cut.

964
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,540
It's prayer out there again.

965
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,300
And there's Faith throwing a beautiful block

966
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,040
and Faithfulness comes in to add interference to the 25

967
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,480
as Average Christian running nicely cuts to his right

968
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,460
leaving his interference.

969
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,880
He's to the 23 by himself heading goalward.

970
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,660
But a couple of tacklers are trying desperately

971
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,540
to catch him from behind as he gets across the 20.

972
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,120
He'll have to hurry and he's hit and follows the ball

973
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,600
at the 15-yard line.

974
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,180
And the ball is recovered by forces of evil.

975
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,820
And Average Christian fans is hurt on the play.

976
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,280
He doesn't get up.

977
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,580
Average Christian remains on the ground.

978
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:18,760


979
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,520
This boy Temptation can certainly get in on plays

980
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,420
when least expected.

981
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,220
He and Little Sins just came from out of nowhere

982
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,280
to bring about the downfall of Average Christian.

983
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,900
And now the coach for Christianity, Jesus Christ,

984
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,720
has come onto the field and is talking to his ball carrier,

985
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,080
Average Christian.

986
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,740
Let's take a look.

987
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,560
And it looks like Average Christian,

988
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,180
Average Christian is going to stay in the ball game.

989
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,440
Let's pick up the band music on the far side of the field.

990
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,280
The preacher got up.

991
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,640
Man, he's a loser.

992
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,580
He looked like good golly and had a northern accent

993
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:09,680
and he couldn't talk right.

994
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,120
And he cut through.

995
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,460
Nothing serious.

996
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,400
Man, I've been to church.

997
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,440
People act like they had sense.

998
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,320
This guy gets up and on and on and on.

999
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,260
But, man, I could tell you word for word everything he said.

1000
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,880
And I thought he was really cute.

1001
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,340
And he had this dark suit on and this slick back hairdo

1002
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,220
and this northern accent.

1003
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:32,320
And he was talking so fast that I didn't want to listen,

1004
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,600
but I had to listen because I didn't want to miss anything.

1005
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,600
It was so unique.

1006
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,680
I'd never heard anybody with an approach like this.

1007
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,600
He went on like this, you know, like this.

1008
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:39,760
Hey!

1009
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,240
Hey!

1010
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,900
I love you.

1011
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,940
I love you.

1012
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,980
I love you.

1013
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:31,660
I love you.

1014
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,000
I love you.

1015
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,320
I love you.

1016
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,800
Let's try to catch up here, shall we?

1017
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,960
Whee! Back there.

1018
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,220
Shri Darwin Gross singing about

1019
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,540
Ekinhar and

1020
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,020
the Master.

1021
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,020
The Master

1022
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:15,980
likes you.

1023
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,340
I'm sorry, I must work on my Torgo, but not in public.

1024
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,120
Swaggart.

1025
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,280
Swaggart has the one constant in the universe.

1026
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:31,060
When does the statute of limitations on kicking that man kick in?

1027
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,060
Never, I hope.

1028
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,560
And then Criswell Predicted.

1029
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,340
Who's playing him in the Ed Wood movie?

1030
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,160
That's what I want to know.

1031
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,800
And then Mort Eckenhar.

1032
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,920
I'll keep playing that and playing it.

1033
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:43,920


1034
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,640
Crosley Bendix.

1035
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,680
Speaking on the subject of technology, courtesy of Negative Land.

1036
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:55,720
That's pretty.

1037
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:57,660
Koresh.

1038
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,540
A little epistle I was reading.

1039
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,040
The Game of Life.

1040
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,480
Now the liner notes say that was done by a guy named...

1041
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:10,180
The liner notes of this tape, I should say, say it was done by a guy named Gerald McCracken.

1042
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,440
I happen to know that was actually done by a guy named Phil McCracken.

1043
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:13,820
That's it.

1044
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,840
Total, total mistake.

1045
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,440
And according to the liner notes, apparently,

1046
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:25,040
forces of evil won the game by default after average Christian tested positive for steroids in a post-game screening.

1047
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,900
I guess that's it.

1048
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,580
Apart from telling you that if you have any questions about anything...

1049
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,620
I'm usually trying to narrow that down, but I mean anything.

1050
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:43,080
Write to Post Office Box 140306.

1051
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,740
In Dallas, Texas.

1052
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:46,420
75214.

1053
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,580
For those of you who hear that every week and never write it down.

1054
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,820
Post Office Box 140306.

1055
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,200
Right here in Dallas, Texas.

1056
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:58,540
75214.

1057
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,940
I've been your host tonight.

1058
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,880
The Will of Dobbs.

1059
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,860
Thanks very much for listening.

1060
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,240
We really appreciate it.

1061
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,900
People in Dallas, please send your pledges in.

1062
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,580
And be here at this time next week.

1063
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:12,860
Next week.

1064
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,000
Next week.

1065
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,060
Next week.

1066
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,060


1067
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,060


1068
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,060


1069
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:13,900
The show will be over.

1070
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,780
So be here an hour sooner than this next week.

1071
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:23,180
And we'll have for you another subgenius hour of slack.

1072
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,720
And I've got time to give that address one more time.

1073
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:29,400
Post Office Box 140306.

1074
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,120
In Dallas, Texas.

1075
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,740
Just send a self-address stamped on below.

1076
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,040
You'll get a lot, but you'll get more if you, you know, send something else.

1077
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,080
Thanks a lot.

1078
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,480
Stay tuned for that which must follow.

1079
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:43,380
Bye-bye.

1080
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,380
And we'll see you next week.

1081
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:58,380


1082
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:58,380


1083
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:58,380


1084
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:58,380


1085
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:58,380


1086
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:58,380


1087
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:58,380

1096
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:07,180

00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,500
Hog in the synagogue, oink, oink, oink

1103
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,860
Pork in the synagogue, smock, smock, smock

1104
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,640
Ain't supposed to eat no bacon

1105
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,680
Loving in the church house, hee, hee, hee

1106
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,800
Laughing in the church house, haw, haw, haw

1107
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,040
Dancing in the church house, I don't see dough

1108
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,840
Ain't supposed to get no hee, hee, hee

1109
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,740
We don't smoke dough, we don't smoke dough

1110
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,240
How do we cope, how do we cope

1111
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,940
Well, we don't eat meat and we don't drink booze

1112
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,980
We don't make out in the church house pews

1113
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,000
We don't laugh and dance and we pay our dues

1114
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And we don't smoke dough, just say no

1115
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,460
It ain't me, it ain't me

1116
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,780
I ain't no Santa, so

1117
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,880
If you have taken the green acid, you have just been poisoned

1118
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,120
You've stripped the record

1119
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,280
I drift into the sewers

1120
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:21,960
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

1121
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,600
Which reaches from the inner mind to

1122
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,700
The subgenius

1123
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,040
Power of what?

1124
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,260
You ask me

1125
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,520
What to say

1126
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,860
With our eyes and our antenna

1127
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:45,260
Hoo hoo, hoo hoo, hoo hoo, hoo hoo

1128
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,820
What to say

1129
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,660
With our mouths and our nostrils

1130
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,880
Hoo hoo, hoo hoo, hoo ha ha

1131
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,040
Over the river and through the woods

1132
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,460
And off the edge of the world

1133
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:09,300
There are black flickerings at the corner of my eye

1134
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,100
Of that I have no idea

1135
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:10,540
Of no doubt

1136
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,420
Just when I turn my head in hopes of getting a really good look at them

1137
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,320
That are gone

1138
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,360
I pretended that I did not notice them

1139
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,180
And started reciting the Lord's Prayer under my breath

1140
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,940
They hate that

1141
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,940
And they usually don't hang around to hear me finish

1142
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,040
I went home on the bus contemplating my next move

1143
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,120
I hate city buses

1144
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,260
I hate the smelly old women with their faded shifts

1145
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,480
Hairy dwarfs with glassy lips

1146
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,540
Freaking clowns with handles of ancient shopping bags

1147
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,660
They're looking because of my hair and clothes

1148
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,080
They're looking because of my hair and clothes They're looking because of my hair and clothes

1149
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,560
With a complexion like an�che

1150
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,020
They're too found

1151
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:42,120
You?

1152
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,020
Why you licking my 최

1153
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:44,800
There are no formalities

1154
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:44,800


1155
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,400
But I'm just like a Feels

1156
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:47,400


1157
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,620
No slack on this shame

1158
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,040
Heh heh heh heh

1159
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,060
Nay, nay, nay.

1160
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,440
No slack at all.

1161
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,260
And then Hal's going to do that thing about getting in the glass coffin and the cement collapses.

1162
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:03,960
Yeah, that's one of my most celebrated escapes from reality.

1163
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:04,620
That's really neat.

1164
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:15,100
I, a godzillion times, I have wondered why I ever braved the ice of the Chattachoochee River

1165
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:19,040
as the giant sauromorph clumped up to the ice.

1166
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,820
Down, boy. Down. Downwind, boy.

1167
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:29,060
What does it all mean, folks? What does it all mean?

1168
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:35,380
If we could give you an accounting of that, I think you'd be with us in spirit and in mind.

1169
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,760
And a healthy body, too.

1170
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,660
You have all that news there that's in the file.

1171
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:47,540
Feel free to dive into the deep pile of that carpet and experience that bowl of cranberry sauce,

1172
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,020
which is the birthright of every American.

1173
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:56,920
And it may give you small comfort to play this album when we have snow in California

1174
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:07,500
and snow in Florida and, of course, torrential rains in New York, Birmingham, Erie, Chicago, Detroit,

1175
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,000
and even Minneapolis and Wichita.

1176
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:17,520
We will all suffer, for we are under the hand of the violence of Mother Nature.

1177
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,880
And in closing, I would like to say,

1178
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:29,660
oh, my friend, when all else is lost, remember the wonderful future still remains.

1179
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:35,920
Now, when you see me on the street, come up and speak to me,

1180
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,520
for that is the only way that you and I can ever win our war against our loneliness.

1181
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,180
I'll be lonely without you.

1182
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,160
And may all your shattered dreams be mended by morning.

1183
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,020
And may success...

1184
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,800
overtake you...

1185
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:52,840
overnight.

1186
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:55,760
Good night, my dearest friend.

1187
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,400
And God bless you.
