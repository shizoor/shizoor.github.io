00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
It's time for Bob. Say Bob, why the big smile this afternoon? What's so special

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:16,120
about today? Well there's nothing special. The Self Genius Power of Slack. Now we're rolling Bob.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:27,260
Oh yes dear friends, this is your prayer partner Reverend Ivan Stang. Okay I'm recording this on

4
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:35,340
July 4th. Tomorrow is X-Day. If you don't hear from me after this that means I was ruptured up

5
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,680
onto the escape vessels of the sex goddesses on July 5th and I will have better things to do

6
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:52,920
than the hour of slack. If so, so long and thanks for all the fish. Meanwhile I have a lot to do in

7
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,240
preparation so here are the outtakes for today.

8
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,800
From last week's show. From PR News in Washington I'm in need of extra attention

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:10,020
after a brief illness and I'm so broad that I need to be braced. Joe Georgfine explains.

10
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,740
He says 45 babies. He says 25 babies. He says 15 of the babies came with the babies and will stay

11
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:26,980
with the babies until PR News. 19.7 percent and 49 percent or 13.7 percent or at least 100

12
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:34,340
55 percent. All right. 5.6 million point nine percent. All right but at least 21 percent. At

13
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:44,540
least 143 million point five percent. But PR News officials are watching it closely. The Dow was

14
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:51,440
1337. Credit monitoring company Equiftec jumped after disclosure of PR News Washington.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:16,660
I'm going to have to go and do my stretches now with some monster movie on the TV and I'll probably

16
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:27,160
run sort of pseudo run run in place on a wee foot board that that is very sensitive to your

17
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:33,780
your body movements on it through your feet. And so I may run be running all over Woohoo Island

18
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:41,180
while listening to rock music and and doing spaz dancing for my other exercise. I have to do this

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,180
every day for the rest of my life if I want to do anything for the rest of my life. Thank y'all.

20
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:13,300
The evil that has fallen upon us is much more ancient and pitch black.

21
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:26,720
It has several characteristics that are important to know. This is a cult of death. It lives and

22
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,240
feeds on the evil of the dead. It is a cult of death. It is a cult of death. It is a cult of

23
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:44,900
death. It is a cult of death. It is a cult of the most terrible death agonies. When people were

24
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:54,700
killed slowly, torturers were enjoying themselves in front of other people. That's what the priests

25
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,320
of this cult do.

26
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:11,600
This cult came out of the ancient swampy forest, which practiced the cult of severe torment of victims and cannibalism.

27
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:26,660
This cult is poisonous. It's invisible. At the level of very visible vapors, it creeps into the souls of people.

28
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:36,860
This cult is poisonous. It's invisible. At the level of very visible vapors, it creeps into the souls of people.

29
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:54,140
A characteristic feature of this cult is that it does not care who's suffering it enjoys. It rejoices in its own deaths too, no less than others.

30
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,580
A characteristic feature of this cult is that it does not care who's suffering it enjoys. It rejoices in its own deaths too, no less than others.

31
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:54,580


32
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,220
And its absolutely cannibalistic attitudes are the cause of its suffering even though, Gordon and I have been and know no other, as a hand that can make us bleed with our friends.

33
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,220


34
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,000
towards its own soldiers.

35
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,520
That was Onan Counterbite and some Russian.

36
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:24,700
That is, Onan made that on his phone, I think.

37
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:35,780
And, well, this is the first time I've sat down at Tarzan's radio station in at least a month.

38
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,840
In fact, I had to pull the dust cover off of all this stuff.

39
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,340
It's set up in my living room on a fairly small table, actually.

40
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,860
It doesn't take up much room anymore.

41
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,100
And, but it's...

42
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,060
This is a dry land.

43
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,620
This is a dry, dry land.

44
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:06,740
The Subgenius Foundation is located in Glen Rose, Texas, in north-central Texas,

45
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,060
about an hour southwest of Fort Worth.

46
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,560
It's, it is very rural.

47
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,600
It's, the Metroplex has not enveloped it yet.

48
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:24,500
And it's farmland, and it hasn't rained in many,

49
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,100
many weeks.

50
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,100
And there's no promise of it.

51
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:36,040
And we're having such a dreadful heat wave that's so unusual for June that I went out

52
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,920
and bought, I did end times preparations that I probably should have done long before.

53
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,380
The list came from when we went through the freeze here.

54
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,660
The whole Texas power grid came down.

55
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,660
And I made a list of stuff that I should have.

56
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,660
And then I didn't.

57
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,640
I didn't do anything about it.

58
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,740
And then, because I'm a subgenius, but then I did something about it because we were,

59
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,680
it looked like we were going to have another freeze.

60
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,320
I got a generator and some portable heaters.

61
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:17,700
Now I have, I've added a portable air conditioner because we have a 93-year-old in hospice in

62
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,800
the big downstairs bedroom with caregivers coming and going.

63
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,640
So this is a weird thing.

64
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:24,640


65
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,040
It's a weird kind of cult headquarters.

66
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:33,360
It's part hospital, part workshop, part house, part barnyard.

67
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,120
Very much a barnyard.

68
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,840
The livestock are all domesticated pet type animals, but they're huge.

85
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,160
I said, holy dog, a World War passed through my brain

86
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,280
He said, nurse, get your pie, the boy's insane

87
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,740
I grabbed my arm, I said, ouch

88
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,900
I landed on the psychiatric couch

89
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,660
He said, tell me about it

90
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,080
Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast

91
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,140
It was all over by a quarter past

92
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,940
I was down in the sewer with some little lover

93
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,100
When I peeked out from a manhole cover

94
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,220
Wondering who turned the lights on us

95
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,040
Well, I got up and I walked around

96
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,200
Up and down the lonesome town

97
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,620
Well, I got up and I walked around

98
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,740
I stood wondering which way to go

99
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,840
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter

100
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,560
And walked on down the road

101
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,740
It was a normal day

102
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,160
Well, I rung me fallout shelter bell

103
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,340
And I leaned my head and I gave a yell

104
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,980
Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man

105
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,620
Shotgun fired, no airbrushes

106
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:54,780
I'm a drunk and I'm a drunk

107
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:54,960
No way around

108
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,240
I don't blame him too much though he didn't know me

109
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,920
Down in the corner by the hot dog stand

110
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,180
I seen a man

111
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,900
I said, howdy friend

112
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,480
Guess it's just us two

113
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,520
He screamed a bit and away he flew

114
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,320
I thought I was a communist

115
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,220
I thought I was a communist

116
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:24,600
I thought I was a communist

117
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:24,600


118
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,720
Well, this bought me a girl before she could leave

119
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,620
I said, let's go play Adam and Eve

120
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,400
I took her by the hand and my heart was thumping

121
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,860
She said, hey man, you crazy or something

122
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,960
You seen what happened last time they started

123
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,840
Well, I seen your Cadillac window uptown

124
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,780
There was nobody around

125
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,700
I got into the driver's seat

126
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,840
And I said, hey man, you crazy or something

127
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,640
I drove down 42nd Street in my Cadillac

128
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,780
Good car to drive after a war

129
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,620
Well, I remember seeing some ads

130
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,940
So I turned on my car and I'll ride

131
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,080
But I didn't pay the con head bell

132
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,820
Said the radio host

133
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,000
The radio didn't work so well

134
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,920
Turned on my record player

135
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,440
It was Rockaday Johnny singing

136
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,020
Tell your ma, tell your pa

137
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,620
Our loves are gonna grow

138
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,140
I was feeling kind of lonesome in my car

139
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,940
I was feeling kind of lonesome in blue

140
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,680
I needed somebody to talk to

141
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,220
So I called up the operator at time

142
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,240
Just to hear a voice of some kind

143
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,660
When you hear the beep

144
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,520
It will be three o'clock

145
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,080
She said that for over an hour

146
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,180
And I hung up

147
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,100
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then

148
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,860
Saying, hey, I've been having the same old dreams

149
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,920
But mine was a little different, you see

150
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,840
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me

151
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,080
I didn't see you around

152
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,320
I didn't see you around

153
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,400
I didn't see you around

154
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,120
I didn't see you around

155
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,640
I didn't see you around

156
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:15,640


157
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:15,640


158
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:15,640


159
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,380
Well, now time passed

160
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,780
And now it seems everybody's having them dreams

161
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,260
Everybody sees itself walking around

162
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,460
There's no one else

163
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,480
Half the people can be part right all of the time

164
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,920
Some of the people can be all right part of the time

165
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,060

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,040


177
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,040


178
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,040


179
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,040


180
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,380
Dobbs Town Mirror.

181
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,400
Let's see.

182
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,740
This music in the background

183
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,860
is from the

184
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,720
Trailer Park Boys Greasy Money

185
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,920
phone game.

186
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,480
And it'll just run like this

187
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,140
as long as I have my phone on,

188
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:25,660
apparently.

189
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,920
Imagine a word

190
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,620
that has never been spoken,

191
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,460
written, seen, or heard.

192
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,580
Now imagine a word that

193
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,360
one and only one person

194
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,620
has spoken, written, seen, or heard.

195
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,420
Between the two,

196
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,520
that word exists more in the

197
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,620
later and not at all in the

198
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,460
former. What exists only

199
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,580
for you is yours to rehearse,

200
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,520
review, polish, cherish, treasure,

201
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,360
abandon, rewrite, forget,

202
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,560
etc. Your delights

203
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,400
and your miseries, not

204
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,560
some other person. Just you

205
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,520
know what just you knows.

206
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,140
Some

207
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,500
tiny thing is ready

208
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,600
to fly away.

209
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,100
Are people around you making

210
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,260
trouble for no good reason at all?

211
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,800
Set off a

212
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,640
NMP bomb.

213
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,800
Not my problem.

214
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,180
And run. They'll keep

215
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,180
making trouble without you, and

216
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,180
they aren't listening to you tell them that life

217
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,840
has enough troubles on its own without

218
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,040
inventing new ones.

219
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,080
If

220
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,220
you would dance to the tune of

221
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,140
slack, you have to pay the

222
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,800
piper.

223
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,080


224
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,880
Adventure, romance, fast

225
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,080
luck you'll attract.

226
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,540
No more cause to be a

227
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,460
griper.

228
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,020
And friends, homeopathic

229
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,680
remote cupping services

230
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,740
are also available from the

231
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,480
Dobbs Town Mirror.

232
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,580
Seen at

233
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,880
Dobbs.Town.

234
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,980
And you know, friends,

235
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,240
on the scale of intergalactic

236
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,120
travel, flying saucers are seen

237
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,260
near nuclear reactors.

238
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,340
As much and as little as they're seen

239
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,760
near anything else.

240
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,340
But on the scale of finding yourself willing

241
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,440
or otherwise being lifted up into

242
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,460
a flying saucer,

243
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,360
intergalactic scales hardly matter.

244
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,360
It's all a

245
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,200
matter of perspective.

246
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,180
J.R. Bob

247
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,140
Dobbs will walk with you up the

248
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,440
999 steps of wisdom

249
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,220
and then down the

250
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,360
1,000 steps

251
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,100
of forgetting.

252
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,300
There are songs, or perhaps

253
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,660
films, or perhaps comic books, or perhaps

254
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,580
meh, that come into

255
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,300
your life not as entertainment

256
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,060
but as permission,

257
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,940
as instructions.

258
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,220
Go with it, all the way, man.

259
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,920
You're right, they're wrong.

260
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,520
And if they cannot take a joke, let them

261
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,560
mount up upon themselves.

262
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,360
I may not in each moment

263
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,660
have slack, but I am a person

264
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,100
who in each moment prefers

265
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,240
to have slack. And not every

266
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,160
one can say that.

267
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,280
Some people prefer to not have slack.

268
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,220
Some people prefer

269
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,080
compulsive displays

270
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,960
of happiness or

271
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,060
complaining without the enjoyment

272
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,200
of complaining. Slack is

273
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,080
not always happiness, nor is slack

274
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,980
always refraining from complaining.

275
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
But slack

276
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,140
is never a preference for

277
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,840
no slack.

278
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,340
I can derive slack from any circumstance

279
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,920
when I call upon

280
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,580
my subgenius philosophy.

281
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Prefer slack.

282
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,220
Okay, and those are all

283
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,120
from the Dobstown Mirror,

284
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,420
which you can get from

285
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,440
Uncle Dr. Onan Canobite

286
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,120
at

287
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,980
Post Office Box 3,

288
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,140
Columbus,

289
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,800
Indiana,

290
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,400
47202.

291
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Okay, friends,

292
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,780
you know, July 5th,

293
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,860
the end of the world,

294
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,180
is Tuesday.

295
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,500
At the time I'm recording this,

296
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,840
on Friday, July 1st.

297
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,400
X-Day is July 5th,

298
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,640
1998, but from

299
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,780
24 previous X-Day drills,

300
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,860
we now know that we don't really know

301
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,880
when now is.

302
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,240
So temporarily, we might call this one

303
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,060
DIY Day.

304
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,740
It takes place

305
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,080
wherever you are. If you decide

306
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,800
to host a local drill

307
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,300
in the form of a big party,

308
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,760
with all your subgenius friends and loved ones,

309
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,280
great! We'll help you publicize it

310
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,320
if you want it public.

311
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,400
We've stumbled upon a discovery

312
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,020
in the forbidden sciences that has blown our minds

313
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,780
in ways they've formerly never been fellated.

314
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,660
We're gassed to the point of flabber.

315
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,680
What's the letter in mathematics

316
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,580
that commonly indicates a variable?

317
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,960
X!

318
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,620
Maybe it's called X-Day because it's the variable.

319
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,060
We know from prophecy that the media will,

320
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,440
refer to the advent of the angelic host as X-Day.

321
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,360
But now that we're less certain about the planet

322
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,020
and the year, this day of judgment is now...

323
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,280
a variable.

324
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,080
The world ends on July 5th, 1998 at 7am,

325
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,800
but we obviously don't know when that might be.

326
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,560
It might be today!

327
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,200
Well, maybe tomorrow, but...

328
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,080
soon.

329
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,000
This year we're going to hedge our bets and

330
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,260
hold the X-Day party where you are,

331
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,160
and when you want it.

332
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,020
And you,

333
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,420
and you,

334
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:37,820
and you!

335
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,420
Yes, X-Day in place for 2022.

336
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,460
So-called 2022.

337
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,620
If the saucers get to you first,

338
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,880
remember the rest of us.

339
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,160
Just make sure you're synced up.

340
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,720
Do send in that last 50 bucks.

341
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,440
Re-up your membership and enter to win big,

342
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,060
big, big prizes yet to be announced.

343
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,860
Throw an insane party,

344
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,340
put a big X on your forehead,

345
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,780
and hang out at the courthouse.

346
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,000
Take a photo of the weirdest thing you could do.

347
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,120
And post it to the subgenius metaverse.

348
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,220
No matter how it pans out,

349
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,280
the Church of the Subgenius offers the best apocalypse.

350
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,580
And that's On Encounter Byte at P.O. Box 3,

351
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,440
Columbus, Indiana, 47202.

352
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,600
Actually, I don't know of any big parties that have been announced exactly.

353
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,000
I wanted to do one here in the middle of the year.

354
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,000


355
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,000


356
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,000


357
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,000


358
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:44,460
We've had big parties here, but this isn't the time.

359
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,080
And I can't go anywhere.

360
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:54,840
Because I'm looking after the farm, you might say.

361
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,740
The old ladies.

362
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,540
And Texas is in an emergency, sort of, any minute now.

363
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,640
So here we sit, brokenhearted.

364
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,360
Paid a dime, and we'll party anyway.

365
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,540
There may be something on Zoom.

366
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,260
I don't know.

367
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,060
I really don't.

368
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,640
There was an X Day party a couple of weeks ago called The Real X Day

369
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,040
in New York State at some lodge near a lake.

370
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,600
And it had Dr. Hal, and it had a whole lot of bands.

371
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,260
But I'm not sure what else it had.

372
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:42,720
On the streaming video that was kind of on and off, actually, I did not see an audience.

373
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,400
There was an audience, but in every case, it was the next band waiting to go on.

374
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,780
Isn't that weird?

375
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,420
So, and so now this.

376
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,560
Ladies and gentlemen.

377
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,800
This is your title.

378
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,580
Tonight, Sadat rumbles along a bushy-haired man in a loud mud-splattered sports jacket.

379
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,240
Yeah.

380
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:12,920
Huh?

381
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,620
Hmm?

382
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,320
Oh.

383
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,000
Who?

384
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:16,880
Oh.

385
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:17,740
Oh.

386
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,780
Yeah.

387
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,200
Meanwhile, in the nearby large city.

388
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,440
Two years, Sadat.

389
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,700
Getting there, mud-splattered, can you take on those flip-floppy places?

390
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,460
All right, sir.

391
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,340
Where is Sadat?

392
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,380
Where is Sadat?

393
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,140
Where?

394
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,180
Well, yes and no.

395
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,960
This gun says you don't.

396
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,820
Well, I'm not sure.

397
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,300
Good evening.

398
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,900
No, sir.

399
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,720
Okay.

400
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,240
We're showgirls.

401
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:51,800
Oh.

402
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,700
Go ahead.

403
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,300
What for?

404
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,860
According to the latest FBI uniform crime report,

405
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,360
more than 12,000 people met death at that time.

406
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,480
Some, including you, were killed in the hands of killers during 1951.

407
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,180
If I can help?

408
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,400
Excuse me.

409
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,380
Can you hear me?

410
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,020
Well, I have the canoe, piece of pie, and the kisser.

411
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,340
All right, sir.

412
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,960
For the gunman.

413
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,060
Tonight, the music was accidental.

414
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,320
What's that?

415
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,140
Well.

416
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,260
I got, uh.

417
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,340
What's that?

418
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,340

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:26,460


451
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:26,460


452

00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,200
Thank you.

455
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,360
Thank you.

456
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,500
Well, the Swingin' Love Corpses didn't break up

457
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,480
because of one band member going crazy

458
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,520
and becoming an egomaniac or anything.

459
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,520
It was because your job moved you, right?

460
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,700
That's right.

461
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,820
My job moved me,

462
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,360
but the Swingin' Love Corps

463
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,760
did never break up.

464
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,000
It actually still exists.

465
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,200
Still, to this day,

466
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,760
there's a Wednesday night practice

467
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,600
that happens most of the time.

468
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,240
Oh, yeah.

469
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,980
On Zoom, right?

470
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,940
It was on Zoom during COVID.

471
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,760
We managed to be on Zoom quite a bit.

472
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,040
But the practice is in St. Louis.

473
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,780
It's held by the local guys there.

474
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,220
Once in a while, I will join on Zoom or on the phone.

475
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
But, yeah, it's evolved.

476
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,800
Originally, it was a drinking and smoking club

477
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,260
that evolved into a band.

478
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,380
And now it's a band that has evolved back

479
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,320
into a drinking and smoking club

480
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,580
and barbecuing, more barbecuing.

481
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,660
Right, more barbecuing than guitar playing and singing.

482
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,040
Yeah.

483
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,740
Lots of comparison.

484
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,180
Lots of barbecue styles and things

485
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,840
rather than guitar styles.

486
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,700
Right.

487
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,820
So, sauce, recipes, things like that.

488
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,620
Much, much more important now.

489
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,920
Well, yeah.

490
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,680
Yeah, that's one of the reasons it's, you know,

491
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,540
why I...

492
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,440
Back in the day,

493
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,500
when I was an angry young man,

494
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,880
a dour slack was a good outlet.

495
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,000
I was still working for the pinkest,

496
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,260
the bosses in the Dallas business film industry.

497
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,380
Yeah.

498
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,540
And it was frustrating, and I had much hate.

499
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,940
It was...

500
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,560
Now I'm an old man,

501
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,380
and I'm so much more concerned with what's for dinner.

502
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,860
Right, right.

503
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,500
I don't care who somebody else...

504
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,560
I don't care who somebody else votes for

505
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,680
or who their favorite band is or any of that.

506
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,060
I'm more concerned with what is for dinner.

507
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,020
Yeah.

508
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,640
And is there enough for me?

509
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,100
Yeah.

510
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:26,820
Well...

511
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,780
Are you shorting me again?

512
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,680
Where's my share?

513
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,820
Yeah, so I think that the audience

514
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,220
is beginning to prepare themselves

515
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,840
for what's coming down the line here.

516
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,760
Yeah, but the numbers are all messed up.

517
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,280
I was thinking, well, yeah,

518
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,060
at the end of eight more shows,

519
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,600
it'll be 2,000 shows, but it's not.

520
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,620
We're on eight...

521
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:55,760
We're on eight...

522
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:55,760


523
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,300
1989, not 1989.

524
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,120
Well, why don't we just add, you know,

525
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,940
add a special number of fake shows in.

526
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,420
Virtual, non-existent shows.

527
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,560
Virtual shows that existed temporarily in people's minds,

528
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,020
and now they're just...

529
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,500
Yeah.

530
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,760
...only exist as part of a numbering scheme...

531
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,080
Right.

532
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,760
...to get you to 1998 faster.

533
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,600
Right.

534
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,660
Like, maybe you only need one show.

535
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,220
What's the difference there?

536
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,840
Let's see here.

537
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,560
1889.

538
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,240
Yeah.

539
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,600
So I missed that.

540
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,640
Plus 1998.

541
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,840
So then you need like 109, 109 or something like that.

542
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,840
Yeah, that's a lot.

543
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,720
That's too many.

544
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,180
I don't want to do another 100 shows.

545
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,520
I'll be dead.

546
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,920
I'll be dead before I do it.

547
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,640
That's two years.

548
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,360
I think you should, like, cram 109 shows into one show.

549
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,120
How dare we, Gary?

550
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,800
Make it like a two-hour show.

551
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,180
Well, I could do it like Byron Werner

552
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,620
and...

553
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,700
In Rural War Room,

554
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,180
where you play 100 shows all at the same time.

555
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,040
Right.

556
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,980
That's what I'm thinking.

557
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,020
You do 100 shows all at the same time.

558
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,380
That way it gets your numbering scheme,

559
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,940
and your last show will then be 1998.

560
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,440
Yeah.

561
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,520
You go from like 1888, 1889, 1998.

562
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:17,960
Yeah.

563
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,940
I wonder how many...

564
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,140
And people will say,

565
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,180
how did you do that?

566
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,120
You say, well, I put 109 shows into that last show.

567
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:24,980
Right.

568
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,600
Right.

569
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,500
All at once.

570
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,680
Running simultaneously.

571
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,160
Every now and then,

572
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,000
two or three of them would both have Bill Cates

573
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,400
or Bleepo Abernathy going,

574
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,140
the hour of slack.

575
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,400
Yeah.

576
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,660
Now, you know,

577
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,520
I actually have a copy of a...

578
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,640
where somebody took all...

579
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,600
Maybe it was only six of them back then.

580
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,880
They had all of the Star Wars movies

581
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,360
running simultaneously.

582
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,720
Overlaid on each other

583
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,300
with the soundtracks.

584
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,860
It's the craziest thing.

585
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,480
You can't watch it for too long.

586
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,360
I don't think you could.

587
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,360
You might make somebody do it, you know,

588
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,180
if you needed to.

589
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,260
So they had like 10 movies running

590
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,300
all layered at like 10% opacity.

591
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,660
Yeah.

592
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,280
And they start at the same time

593
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,580
in such a way that you find out

594
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,280
that whenever the scroll happens,

595
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,280
it happens exactly at the same point

596
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,460
in time in the opening sequence, you know?

597
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,620
So you got all these scrolls

598
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,160
on top of each other and stuff.

599
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,340
It's pretty cool.

600
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,080
I'll see if I can find it

601
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,840
and send you a link.

602
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,160
Yeah, because we don't have enough stuff to watch.

603
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,480
We don't have enough stuff to do.

604
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,160
And I don't want you to get bored

605
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,880
just sitting around there not doing anything.

606
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,720
Yeah, just waiting for some show to watch.

607
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,680
Yeah.

608
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,040
I wish somebody would...

609
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,960
I wish somebody would just tell me

610
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,300
a good show to watch.

611
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,260
I get plenty of shows.

612
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:54,260


613
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:54,260


614
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:54,800
I get plenty of shows.

615
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,500
Even this one called Severance,

616
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,240
it's kind of...

617
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,580
I'm having to sort of make myself like it.

618
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,740
Oh, I love it.

619
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,380
I'm only on like the two and a half episodes in.

620
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,020
Well, I'm on the fifth one.

621
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,220
I'm on the fifth one.

622
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,660
I'm almost finished with the fifth episode.

623
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,000
So I'll give you a better opinion

624
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,540
after I finish this one.

625
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,300
Oh, I had a name for it.

626
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,320
I decided to call it

627
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,640
The Prisoner's Lunch Hour

628
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,240
because it's an uncanny,

629
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,740
like our production,

630
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,960
Bob's Lunch Hour.

631
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,020
Uh-huh.

632
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,900
And it's also like The Prisoner

633
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,280
in many ways.

634
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,000
Yeah, that's true.

635
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:33,560
Yeah.

636
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,780
I like the whole idea

637
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,180
of the severance concept.

638
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,940
That's what suckered me in.

639
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,040
You know, that you could actually

640
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,140
split your brain into two personalities

641
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,260
that could be separated completely

642
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,320
and didn't overlap.

643
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,660
And all you'd need is a special device

644
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,380
to shift from one to the other.

645
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,760
Well, of course,

646
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,680
the fun...

647
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,920
It's a metaphor in a way

648
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,340
because some people are almost that way.

649
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,240
You know, they're one person on the job

650
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,140
and they're another person

651
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,080
when they're off the job.

652
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,480
Yeah, I like that.

653
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,780
That's kind of a thing.

654
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,700
And it's sort of like

655
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,000
in that other person,

656
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,880
they don't...

657
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,580
That's kind of the way I was

658
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,740
when I was a wage slave.

659
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,800
I didn't let my two lives connect at all.

660
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:17,540
Right.

661
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,580
You wore the masks of insanity

662
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,400
to look normal.

663
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,260
I played my role

664
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,220
and did the things

665
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,760
that they expected me to do

666
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,660
and then I never socialized with them afterwards.

667
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,780
You know?

668
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,400
I never went and drank with them.

669
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,060
Princess, we worked for the county,

670
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,600
the weather control

671
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,720
in Cuyahoga County

672
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,400
for almost 30 years

673
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,600
pretending that she liked those people.

674
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,620
Yeah.

675
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,960
At no point did any of them know

676
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,220
that she was a folk singer.

677
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,140
But ran a hippie music festival.

678
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,140
Yeah.

679
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,280
Was actually a peace protester

680
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,800
a lot of the time back then.

681
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,720
Yeah.

682
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,280
And unfortunately,

683
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,220
I wised her up about human nature.

684
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,540
And she gave up on ending war

685
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,200
because that's what countries do, you know?

686
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:12,980
Yeah.

687
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,260
And yeah, she never...

688
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,980
Her co-workers never had any idea

689
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,940
of all the interesting things

690
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,240
she was doing.

691
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,540
She was doing outside work

692
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,960
because some of them would hate her for it.

693
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,040
A lot of them.

694
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,220
Most of them are really uninteresting people.

695
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:31,980
Right.

696
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,700
But yeah.

697
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,300
So, I mean,

698
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,560
something like that would be weird to them.

699
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,640
But the good thing about it is

700
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,700
they still pay her.

701
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,080
She retired in 2008 or something

702
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,740
and she still gets that pension.

703
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,600
Now me,

704
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,700
I'm going to have to be assembling

705
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,460
and mailing out subgenius membership packs

706
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,220
until I'm a fan.

707
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm a skeleton probably.

708
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,480
But you may not have to send out

709
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,880
any more hours of slack.

710
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,460
Right.

711
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,380
I'm not getting paid for hours of slack

712
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,220
hardly at all.

713
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,200
But you know,

714
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,460
it's important that people know

715
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,600
that all of those 1,898 hours of slack

716
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,460
are out there.

717
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,960
Out there in the ether.

718
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,800
Yeah.

719
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,440
Waiting to be heard

720
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,360
again and again and again and again.

721
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,700
And they...

722
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,200
All of them.

723
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,240
And being gleaned for their value.

724
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,900
For their Rudy Schwartz Project songs.

725
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,360
Yeah.

726
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,920
And Swinging Love Courts.

727
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,080
So,

728
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,660
this poor psycho skeletons guy gave up on me.

729
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,400
He sent me a letter going,

730
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:36,680
well,

731
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,520
I guess you're just not,

732
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,860
you're just retired now.

733
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,100
And that was a year ago.

734
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,040
I was like,

735
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,300
well,

736
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:41,980
sort of.

737
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,240
I was,

738
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,300
I'd moved to doing mostly reruns

739
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,960
just because I didn't have time.

740
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,740
I had some,

741
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,880
many other things

742
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,960
that we had to deal with,

743
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,400
you know.

744
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,660
And this,

745
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:50,880
well,

746
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,680
this was a guy

747
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:51,980
who was,

748
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,260
asking for a recording.

749
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:53,940
Is that what it was?

750
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,180
No,

751
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,340
the psycho skeletons.

752
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,700
He was a guy

753
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,740
that sent music.

754
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,920
He'd send me an MP3 every week

755
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,160
and they were quirky instrumentals,

756
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,600
mostly.

757
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,420
Very original.

758
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,580
He had his own style.

759
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
It wasn't like any other music,

760
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,140
really.

761
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,420
And it was,

762
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,720
some people really liked it.

763
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,000
And,

764
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,120
you know,

765
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,560
but,

766
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:14,980
yeah.

767
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:15,920
But,

768
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,200
I think he caught on early

769
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,680
that I was just getting burned out.

770
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,340
And that,

771
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:21,780
that's,

772
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,140
that's,

773
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:22,540
it's that.

774
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,840
That's exactly what it is.

775
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,280
Yeah.

776
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,320
You finally get burned out.

777
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,560
Even on,

778
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,520
not slack,

779
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,280
but the hour of slack.

780
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,140
Yeah.

781
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,840
Nobody can ever get burned out on slack.

782
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,400
If they do,

783
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,540
there's something wrong with them.

784
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,480
Yeah.

785
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,240
They're like,

786
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:37,660
you know,

787
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,840
they're weird.

788
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,020
They're pink.

789
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,200
They're pink.

790
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,380
No,

791
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,320
they're not weird.

792
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,120
I mean,

793
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,520
they don't,

794
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,860
it's not real slack.

795
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,300
It's false slack,

796
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:45,800
you know.

797
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,240
Yeah.

798
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Totally pink.

799
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,360
Yeah.

800
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,600
I will spew them

801
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,560
from my mouth.

802
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,880
Right.

803
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,460
My people are destroyed

804
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,860
for lack of knowledge.

805
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,120
Hosea 819.

806
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,480
They're like lukewarm,

807
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,340
they're lukewarm

808
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,400
in their faith.

809
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,120
They are lukewarm

810
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,880
in their faith.

811
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,320
And I,

812
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,540
so I spew them

813
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,820
from my mouth.

814
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,180
I,

815
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,080
not just that,

816
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,960
I vomit them.

817
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,640
I vomit them.

818
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,700
That's God talking,

819
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,020
right?

820
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,620
Yeah.

821
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,140
Jesus,

822
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:16,820
I think,

823
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,560
was attributed to him.

824
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,120
Of course,

825
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,780
we don't,

826
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,300
you know,

827
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,680
some other,

828
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,660
who knows who really said.

829
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,220
Some Roman copywriter.

830
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,580
Yeah.

831
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,660
Roman,

832
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,060
Greek,

833
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,420
Greek.

834
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,440
Well,

835
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,120
yeah,

836
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,860
but after,

837
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,460
yeah,

838
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,460
but it was the Romans

839
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,740
that decided to make it

840
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,660
an official religion

841
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,640
because it was the,

842
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:37,560
you know,

843
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,480
there's some people who say

844
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,960
that the reason they did that

845
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,720
was because it was

846
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,940
the perfect religion

847
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,160
for slaves

848
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,140
and losers

849
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,020
and poor people.

850
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,620
But did they?

851
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,880
But did they?

852
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,280
What,

853
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:47,660
the Romans?

854
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,160
Yeah,

855
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:48,660
they made,

856
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,300
after,

857
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,600
after throwing Christians

858
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,360
to the lions,

859
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,040
they eventually,

860
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,440
it was Constantine

861
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,840
or whoever,

862
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:54,900
made,

863
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,820
he decided everybody

864
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,000
was going to be Christians.

865
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,640
That was in 400.

866
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,460
Yeah,

867
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,520
that was a long time after,

868
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:00,900
I mean,

869
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,120
they,

870
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,780
they'd already had their ups

871
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,300
and downs,

872
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:03,720
like,

873
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,400
like America.

874
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,460
It was just one of the

875
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,160
mystery religions back then,

876
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,700
you know,

877
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,320
until somebody decided to say,

878
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:09,680
okay,

879
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:09,960
well,

880
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,740
we're going to make this one

881
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,040
official.

882
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,000
What was that guy's name again?

883
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,320
Well,

884
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,440
there's a whole bunch of them.

885
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,360
Jesus.

886
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,720
There was at least five

887
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:20,660
Jesuses.

888
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:20,980
Yeah,

889
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,300
right.

890
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,480
My dad,

891
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,140
right behind me on this bookshelf

892
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,540
is my,

893
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,160
my father's collection

894
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,440
of all the books

895
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,600
about how there was no,

896
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,900
really no historical Jesus.

897
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,700
I wish I could have,

898
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,060
I would have liked to,

899
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,540
you know,

900
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,440
talk to your dad

901
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,360
about all that stuff.

902
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,360
Well,

903
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,280
you know,

904
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,400
he,

905
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,400
he always liked you.

906
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,920
He always asked how you were doing.

907
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,880
Yeah.

908
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,540
He didn't call you Philo.

909
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,740
He called you Steve

910
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,180
for some reason.

911
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,580
I don't know why

912
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,120
people just call me Steve.

913
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:47,900
Yeah,

914
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,500
but he,

915
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,120
he was,

916
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,880
he always,

917
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,400
he always thought you were an okay guy.

918
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:52,820
But,

919
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,200
but you had,

920
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,060
had moved away

921
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,520
and,

922
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,380
you know.

923
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,500
Yeah.

924
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,260
Yeah.

925
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,340
Doc,

926
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,160
Doc Frop

927
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,820
hung out with my dad.

928
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,320
He was my lawyer.

929
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,720
That's right.

930
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:02,980
Yeah.

931
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,140
I wish he was still around.

932
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,460
He was good for you.

933
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,280
He was my lawyer.

934
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:07,960
Mm-hmm.

935
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,920
He didn't charge me anything.

936
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,080
Yep.

937
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,460
He showed up

938
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,800
with me in front of the judge

939
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,600
with his uniform on.

940
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,340
Looking official.

941
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:21,420
Looking official.

942
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,260
His Navy uniform or just?

943
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:23,580
I think,

944
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:23,680
no,

945
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,380
I think he just had a business suit on.

946
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,080
Yeah.

947
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,540
Yeah.

948
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,700
He just had a business suit.

949
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,120
My father walked into

950
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,120
the First World Subgenius Convention

951
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,520
with some of his buddies

952
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,600
direct from a Navy,

953
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,360
Naval Reserve meeting

954
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,380
of some kind.

955
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,540
And he was dressed

956
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,380
in full captain's outfit.

957
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,800
And his buddies were all,

958
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,240
you know,

959
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,000
had their officer outfits on.

960
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,680
And,

961
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,540
and the,

962
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,300
the younger subgeniuses

963
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,820
just about crapped their pants

964
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,420
because they thought they were cops.

965
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,280
You know?

966
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,600
And my dad had such a,

967
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,760
he was a gas for,

968
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,220
he was mainly freaking out his friends.

969
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,520
He wanted to show his friends

970
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,800
something really weird.

971
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,640
And, you know,

972
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,280
think about it.

973
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,240
Tentatively,

974
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,960
a convenience was there.

975
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,880
Yeah.

976
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,180
Okay.

977
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,540
That's enough weirdness

978
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,620
in one person.

979
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,500
Yeah.

980
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,120
That's a guy who doesn't have a haircut.

981
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,500
He's got mustaches

982
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,760
all over the top of his head.

983
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,400
Well,

984
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,480
he's since he's,

985
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,720
he tattooed a brain

986
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,080
all over the top of his head.

987
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,540
So now it's,

988
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,860
it would be mustaches

989
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,720
on top of brains.

990
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,880
That guy's actually

991
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,900
doing really well.

992
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,620
He was one of the ones

993
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,280
that you would think

994
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,120
would die young

995
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,060
because he did so much

996
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,240
dangerous art projects.

997
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,700
Yeah.

998
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,720
And like worked on,

999
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,300
you know,

1000
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,480
committed his body

1001
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,100
to science experiments

1002
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,640
and things.

1003
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,080
Yeah.

1004
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,420
Yeah.

1005
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,120
But he's,

1006
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,200
he lives in Pittsburgh now

1007
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,640
and he actually seemed like,

1008
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,400
like a whole lot of the old,

1009
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,500
the,

1010
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:49,820
the,

1011
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:49,980
the,

1012
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:49,980


1013
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:49,980


1014
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:49,980


1015
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,000
the core,

1016
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,460
core subgenius people

1017
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,980
mostly are still alive

1018
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,800
and doing pretty well.

1019
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:56,340
That's,

1020
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,000
that's great.

1021
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,540
A whole lot of them died,

1022
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,240
but they were newer ones,

1023
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:00,800
you know?

1024
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,900
Yeah.

1025
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,600
They didn't have,

1026
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,360
they weren't,

1027
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,220
they didn't undergo

1028
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,380
that sodomy ritual

1029
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:06,720
in,

1030
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,600
in Malaysia

1031
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,260
that the,

1032
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,340
us real beginner old guys did.

1033
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,260
Yeah.

1034
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:12,920
That was horrible.

1035
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:13,580
Yeah.

1036
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,000
But worth it.

1037
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,960
Having to do that

1038
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,840
to all those people.

1039
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,220
Balls and vice grips

1040
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,280
in Dobbs town.

1041
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,820
You're an overman now.

1042
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,160
That was this Doctors for Rotan hit.

1043
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,220
Yeah.

1044
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,920
Balls and vice grips in Dobbs town.

1045
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,580
You're an overman now.

1046
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,960
One of our five hits.

1047
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,760
Yeah.

1048
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,080
Yeah.

1049
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,840
Then there's the one about what you do with Moonies,

1050
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,440
but we can't sing that one on.

1051
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:45,660
No,

1052
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,820
you can't even sing that on,

1053
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,740
on the internet only.

1054
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:47,820
Yeah.

1055
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


1056
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


1057
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


1058
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


1059
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


1060
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


1061
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


1062
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


1063
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


1064
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


1065
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


1066
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


1067
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,440
It's a radio show.

1068
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,220
Well,

1069
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:50,560
you can,

1070
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,280
but let's let it,

1071
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,540
yes.

1072
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,760
Yeah.

1073
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,060
Yeah.

1074
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,640
What would you do with a Klondike bar?

1075
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,820
Is that how it goes?

1076
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,260
I think it's time that I should prop again.

1077
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,440
Well,

1078
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,160
we've actually,

1079
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,540
this recording is now 56 minutes long.

1080
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,320
So obviously this is going to end up being two shows.

1081
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:14,540
Wow.

1082
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,260
Yeah.

1083
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,660
Squeeze two shows out of 56 minutes.

1084
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:17,820
Yeah.

1085
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,420
That's awesome.

1086
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:18,420


1087
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,540
I did some other stuff before that.

1088
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,080
Oh yeah.

1089
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:22,460
That's right.

1090
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,500
I have to put in about X day into dead people.

1091
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,240
And well,

1092
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:27,920
you know,

1093
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,940
I've been posting shows little by little.

1094
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:37,160
I've been going back and posting my old puzzling evidence shows out there on a anchor.

1095
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,840
And of course they're on a whole,

1096
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,020
I got 200 of them.

1097
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,020
That's on Nick's cloud.

1098
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:42,580
Right.

1099
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,220
Puzzling evidence.

1100
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,360
And then I have been posting,

1101
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,180
I've got about 40.

1102
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:47,760
I'm going,

1103
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,440
I've gone to about 40 a year and I think I've got 40 so far on anchor.

1104
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,880
So for those people that want to listen to that old stuff,

1105
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,340
there is some there,

1106
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,280
but I'm like you,

1107
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,000
Reverend staying.

1108
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:03,720
I just don't.

1109
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,900
It's so hard.

1110
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,680
And I got so many other things to do.

1111
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:06,940
Right.

1112
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,400
You've got a greenhouse to build.

1113
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,620
I'm working in my greenhouse right now while we were talking,

1114
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,420
working on it.

1115
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:13,840
You know,

1116
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,340
I did,

1117
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,800
I did put up my shade,

1118
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,100
uh,

1119
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,040
tested my,

1120
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,020
my shade.

1121
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,720
Call that.

1122
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,800
That looked pretty good.

1123
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,320
Well,

1124
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,240
there's no wind.

1125
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:21,940
Uh,

1126
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,120
it's just hanging on some poles that are stuck into pots of plant pots,

1127
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,640
but it's fine as long as it,

1128
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,400
the wind doesn't pick up,

1129
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,000
but you know,

1130
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:33,760
maybe that's okay.

1131
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,160
I figured it's going to be lines,

1132
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:35,700
you know,

1133
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,920
stretch some guidelines across your yard,

1134
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:39,600
you know,

1135
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,960
like maybe you have to attach them to poles or something.

1136
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,740
And then maybe you could,

1137
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,440
you know,

1138
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,080
like just take some clothes off,

1139
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,020
clothespins or something.

1140
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,560
Oh yeah.

1141
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,040
That's an idea.

1142
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:48,640
Right.

1143
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:48,980
Yeah.

1144
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,600
Just two,

1145
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,220
two big wires that go across from something to something.

1146
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,080
Yeah.

1147
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,340
Hmm.

1148
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,880
And then just get you some little clamps of some kind.

1149
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:58,720
Yeah.

1150
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,580
I'm using twisty ties on the poles right now,

1151
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:02,600
but,

1152
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:02,960
uh,

1153
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,800
it looks pretty good.

1154
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,720
It's like a little cave.

1155
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,060
It's like a little,

1156
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,560
little weird cave full of almost edible plants.

1157
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:11,500
Yeah.

1158
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,520
And you're just trying to keep the sun from burning those things.

1159
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,600
I had one,

1160
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,660
I had one eggplant that finally had fruited and it had a little,

1161
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,160
you know,

1162
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,240
it looked like we were going to have an eggplant finally out of eight

1163
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:23,680
plants.

1164
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,520
And,

1165
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:24,760
uh,

1166
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,520
I found it today on the ground,

1167
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,760
half eaten by a dog.

1168
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,100
Well,

1169
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,020
that dog,

1170
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,100
I think it's Yeti.

1171
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,060
He harvests,

1172
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,180
he loves cucumbers and.

1173
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,580
He's a vegetarian dog.

1174
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,560
I guess.

1175
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,600
You know,

1176
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,420
they're omnivores.

1177
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,740
They like anything that they can eat that doesn't make them sick.

1178
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,460
Right.

1179
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:44,960
Right.

1180
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:45,720
And they,

1181
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,440
and they eat things that make them sick.

1182
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,620
They'll eat things that make them sick.

1183
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,140
It tastes good enough.

1184
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,540
They'll hold a frog,

1185
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,000
a toad in their mouth until they start foaming and doing that head shaking thing where God,

1186
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:57,920
why did I do that?

1187
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:58,920
Yeah.

1188
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,560
I knew it was going to taste horrible and make my mouth drool.

1189
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,080
Yeah.

1190
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,680
They're funny.

1191
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:06,960
They're funny.

1192
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,320
But yeah,

1193
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,400
it's like I got dogs that got to entertain.

1194
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:09,700
I,

1195
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,020
I kind of don't want to deal with those.

1196
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:11,240
Yeah.

1197
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:11,300
Those.

1198
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,360
The subgenius listeners,

1199
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,580
a nutless chimp or a one nutted chimp could do my thing.

1200
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:15,580


1201
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:15,580


1202
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:15,580


1203
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:15,580


1204
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:15,580


1205
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:15,720
I'm going to do my job.

1206
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,200
Let them do it.

1207
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:17,840
Yeah,

1208
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,640
I think they should.

1209
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,260
But I really think that the,

1210
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:20,940
you know,

1211
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,380
the subgenius is out there that everybody always wants something new and they forget

1212
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,560
about this rich,

1213
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:35,080
robust history that we can go back to anytime we want that are at the fingertips of everyone

1214
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:40,020
any time of the day or night for free for free.

1215
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:40,980
I actually,

1216
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,860
I actually pay,

1217
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,160
I actually pay 30 bucks a month to keep those things on that.

1218
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,460
I send server.

1219
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,700
You do 30 bucks a month.

1220
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:49,080
Yep.

1221
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,000
Whew.

1222
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,980
You know how much I pay for unlimited bandwidth and unlimited storage on my website?

1223
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,920
$155 a year.

1224
00:46:59,360 --> 00:46:59,900
Well,

1225
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:00,760
but this is,

1226
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,120
um,

1227
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:06,600
this is a place that's set up just for streaming and all that.

1228
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,260
And,

1229
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:07,460
uh,

1230
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,740
I don't know.

1231
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,800
I know.

1232
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,360
I used to pay a hundred and almost 200,

1233
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,640
but they lowered my price for some reason.

1234
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,300
Yeah.

1235
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,180
Now,

1236
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:16,900
now,

1237
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,240
okay.

1238
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,380
If I quit doing the show,

1239
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:18,900
will I,

1240
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,800
will I need to keep that server up?

1241
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,360
That's one thing to think about is where would you want to migrate that stuff that would

1242
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,160
be free,

1243
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,440
right?

1244
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:36,000
Cause you might want to have a plan that at some point that's going to go away,

1245
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,540
but you'd want to have it already somewhere else when that happens,

1246
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:39,840
you know,

1247
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,960
I could put it on subgenius.com,

1248
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:45,560
but I'd need to make an arrangement to get it.

1249
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,860
I'd need to get more storage space.

1250
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:47,460
It's full.

1251
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,380
It's not full of storage.

1252
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,720
It's full of too many files.

1253
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:51,580
200.

1254
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,500
Yeah.

1255
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:57,040
They had a limit of 200,000 pages and it,

1256
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:57,660
uh,

1257
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,500
it hit that.

1258
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,900
Believe it or not.

1259
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,720
Quite a while back.

1260
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,740
I found lots of stuff that I can go,

1261
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,740
go in and erase,

1262
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,140
uh,

1263
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:06,700
the,

1264
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,680
you know,

1265
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,720
out of date things.

1266
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,180
And,

1267
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:09,960
uh,

1268
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:10,460
yeah,

1269
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,780
I think it's like taking my old webpage down.

1270
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,440
I don't really need it up anymore.

1271
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,440
And I was just going to put quivering brain.com.

1272
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,420
Yeah.

1273
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:19,460
Well,

1274
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,320
I wasn't going to take the,

1275
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,200
I'm not going to take the site down.

1276
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,740
I'm just going to take the webpage.

1277
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:25,620
I don't,

1278
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,780
it doesn't make any differences.

1279
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,720
I could leave it up,

1280
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,160
but I mean,

1281
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,040
I'm not adding any new web pages to it or anything.

1282
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:31,800
Right.

1283
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:32,740
And,

1284
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,100
uh,

1285
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,920
but I do use the backend storage areas,

1286
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,520
you know,

1287
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,920
and anytime I want to share something,

1288
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,000
that's my personal cloud.

1289
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:41,860
Yeah.

1290
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,260
That's sub site used to be that for me,

1291
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:44,420
but,

1292
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,960
but like I say,

1293
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,380
it filled up and I just haven't gotten around to calling them up and going,

1294
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:48,760
Hey,

1295
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,680
how do I get around this file number thing?

1296
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,560
Cause I don't care.

1297
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,960
I just don't care.

1298
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:53,680
I don't care.

1299
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,140
Don't care.

1300
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:54,560
Don't care.

1301
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,640
I'm sick of it.

1302
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,880
Just have had enough of it.

1303
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:57,700
Yeah.

1304
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,800
I figure I'll keep that.

1305
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,900
I'll keep that as long as,

1306
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,640
you know,

1307
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,600
even though I don't really promote anything there.

1308
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,060
Well,

1309
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,720
David Bautner keeps the really old shows on his,

1310
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,360
you know,

1311
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,880
first 500 or,

1312
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,200
uh,

1313
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,280
no,

1314
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,760
all the way up to about 2000,

1315
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:17,460
I think.

1316
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:17,900
Oh no.

1317
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,560
What am I saying?

1318
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,040
Uh,

1319
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,300
the year 2000,

1320
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,080
I switched to digital,

1321
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,620
but he has all the old tape shows on his server.

1322
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,760
Of course,

1323
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,080
you know,

1324
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:29,740
he's,

1325
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,080
he's one of these days,

1326
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,700
it's going to dry up and go away.

1327
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,360
He'll suddenly die and not pay his bills.

1328
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,560
And which listener out there is,

1329
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,300
has got the complete collection.

1330
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,000
Hmm.

1331
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,280
Hmm.

1332
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,020
Hmm.

1333
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,180
Hmm.

1334
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,180


1335
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,180


1336
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,180


1337
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,180


1338
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,180


1339
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,180


1340
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,180


1341
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,180


1342
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,020
It would be interesting to know who has the complete collection.

1343
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:49,780
Cause you know,

1344
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,080
there are those completists out there.

1345
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,500
They're going to want to have every book,

1346
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,100
right?

1347
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:55,780
Every,

1348
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,080
every catalog permutation,

1349
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:58,860
every,

1350
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,380
every single stark fist,

1351
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,040
all that stuff.

1352
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,660
Somebody is going to want to have it.

1353
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,240
Those are the smartest people in the whole world.

1354
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,180
They are.

1355
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:14,180
Cause they've seen the future and they know that the future is subgenius.

1356
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:14,560
Yeah.

1357
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:20,220
The only way you're going to be able to get a can of peaches is if you can trade them

1358
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,680
of subgenius pamphlet times after the,

1359
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,960
a can of peaches and a gallon of gas for one subgenius pamphlet,

1360
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,080
your propane to keep your stove running your,

1361
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:33,780
your medicine,

1362
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,520
your insulin.

1363
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,040
Well,

1364
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:37,600
you know,

1365
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,000
some of us are stockpiling stuff like that.

1366
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,940
I just ordered water purification tablets.

1367
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,140
In bulk hearing aid batteries in bulk and all kinds of things that I thought,

1368
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,060
you know,

1369
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,500
supply chain problems,

1370
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,460
economic cataclysm that we used to joke about.

1371
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,780
Isn't so funny anymore.

1372
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,440
Some of us weren't joking about it for every staying.

1373
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:00,180
Well,

1374
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,160
I saw,

1375
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,380
we thought it was going to happen from a long time ago.

1376
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:05,620
Oh,

1377
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,080
I did too,

1378
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,860
but I didn't think I was going to live long enough to actually see it start up.

1379
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,160
I didn't want to,

1380
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:12,660
you know,

1381
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,240
I don't know.

1382
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,600
I don't want to read about the last gorilla.

1383
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,120
We should on the next show we should do,

1384
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,360
we should look at the dateline for dominance.

1385
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,140
Oh God,

1386
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:22,360
man,

1387
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,020
that's frightening.

1388
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,800
When you do that,

1389
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,840
we predicted everything.

1390
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,880
We should try to find,

1391
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,320
you know,

1392
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:32,220
like they do with Nostradamus now show that there's specific things.

1393
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,260
It might be a little bit different,

1394
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,020
but we should be able to,

1395
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,620
I'm going to do that.

1396
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,120
I'm going to get my one of those out and my look at it.

1397
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,360
And I'm going to try to find something for almost all of those things.

1398
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:42,700
Yeah.

1399
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,320
I,

1400
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:43,820
I,

1401
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:48,960
I did that proves that we were like profits.

1402
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:49,780
Yeah,

1403
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,640
but we had,

1404
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,080
we had,

1405
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,360
we said the dates wrong.

1406
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:55,240
We had all of that stuff happened before 1998,

1407
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,060
it ended at 1998.

1408
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:57,980
And,

1409
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,460
but it was all,

1410
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,920
it was all stuff that was coming.

1411
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,280
We just had the numbers wrong,

1412
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:04,620
wrong.

1413
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,580
There's stuff in there that that's happened now,

1414
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,600
like in the last couple of years.

1415
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:10,960
Yeah.

1416
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,040
I'm telling you,

1417
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,420
I did a couple of years ago,

1418
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:22,320
I did a show and a Starwood speech based on that fact of Dateline for dominance from 1983

1419
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,480
book,

1420
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:24,580
uh,

1421
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,340
showing stuff,

1422
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,960
uncannily what stuff that,

1423
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:29,080
yeah.

1424
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:32,860
And it was the stark fist originally before them.

1425
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,260
Yeah.

1426
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,880
That was like 1981 or 82.

1427
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,120
And,

1428
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:37,680
and,

1429
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,120
uh,

1430
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,880
we,

1431
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,300
we did add when we,

1432
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,860
when they reprinted the book,

1433
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,220
we added a few things.

1434
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,320
Yeah.

1435
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,960
For 1982 and 83 that made it seem even more accurate.

1436
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,540
Like that was in the first book,

1437
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:51,920
right?

1438
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:52,240
Yeah.

1439
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,040
Yeah.

1440
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:53,860
Yeah.

1441
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,100
Yeah.

1442
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:54,320
Uh,

1443
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:54,880
yeah.

1444
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,680
If you look at the McGraw Hill,

1445
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,220
the McGraw Hill version of Dateline for dominance,

1446
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:08,100
is it quite as accurate for the intervening years as the later book is that Simon Schuster,

1447
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:08,100


1448
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,120
the sister version that most people see now,

1449
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,480
I guess it's upstairs there.

1450
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,060
Oh man.

1451
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,000
That's a print on demand book now,

1452
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,420
but at least it's still in print.

1453
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:19,620
Yeah.

1454
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,180
The other ones aren't.

1455
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,420
That's another thing.

1456
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,480
If I quit doing the show,

1457
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,960
I can get those books reprinted.

1458
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,160
Yeah.

1459
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,580
Not just them,

1460
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,440
but there's probably a whole bunch of cheaters,

1461
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:36,140
Laverges out there that would love to have the subgenius and promoter on their book.

1462
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:36,900
Yeah.

1463
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,080
There was that guy,

1464
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,080


1465
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,080


1466
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,080


1467
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,080


1468
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,080


1469
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,080


1470
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,080


1471
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,080


1472
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,020
a Reverend Zeno fact he's,

1473
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,700
he's the,

1474
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,120
uh,

1475
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:41,580
on,

1476
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,780
on Dobbs dot town.

1477
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,620
He's been really prolific.

1478
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,260
Great.

1479
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:45,680
Yeah.

1480
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,700
Great flyers and things that would go in a membership pack.

1481
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,280
Actually,

1482
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,100
there's some new people that need to get,

1483
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:52,460
have,

1484
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:52,940
you know,

1485
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:53,700
have some of the,

1486
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,080
have some,

1487
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,480
some stuff promoted.

1488
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,520
That would be awesome.

1489
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,140
You know,

1490
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:57,400
yeah,

1491
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:57,620
that,

1492
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:57,960
that,

1493
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,120
that I can personally sell.

1494
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,500
And there's still the whole,

1495
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,340
um,

1496
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:03,980
you know,

1497
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,160
once a year special,

1498
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,700
our slack special.

1499
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:08,760
You know,

1500
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,800
the two hour.

1501
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,100
Yeah.

1502
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:14,360
The star wars Christmas special version of our slot.

1503
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,300
Right.

1504
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:15,760
Or,

1505
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,420
or whatever.

1506
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:17,760
Yeah.

1507
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,880
Whatever horrible thing that they did on TV to try to ride the coattails or something.

1508
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,060
And if they did it very poorly,

1509
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,940
only we'll do it right.

1510
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,960
This time.

1511
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,600
Yeah.

1512
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,180
It's like that.

1513
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,320
Save the universe.

1514
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,480
This time.

1515
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,480
That's right.

1516
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,060
Yeah.

1517
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,320
Well,

1518
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,200
I sure have enjoyed being here on the show with you.

1519
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:43,920
Reverend staying.

1520
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,540
Yeah.

1521
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,820
We're going to save the universe this time.

1522
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,120
I think.

1523
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:47,660
Yeah.

1524
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:48,800
It's,

1525
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,480
it's going to need saving this time.

1526
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:56,800
There's lots of stuff going on out there in the real world that we could probably ignore

1527
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,980
better than anyone and teach others the same thing,

1528
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,640
how to live in the horrible times and still have slack.

1529
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,160
Right.

1530
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,180
That's the key.

1531
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:09,820
Well,

1532
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,400
it's easy for you.

1533
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,620
It's not going to get better.

1534
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,560
It's a little easier for you and me to say on account of we,

1535
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:16,880
well,

1536
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,900
in your case,

1537
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,660
you carefully saved your resources and bought a wonderful,

1538
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,360
incredible farm where you can.

1539
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,400
I looked for a place that nobody wanted.

1540
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,000
I thought,

1541
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,000
where's the state that nobody wants to move to that they would say,

1542
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:32,740
what,

1543
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,460
what are you going to move there for?

1544
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,280
That's the state I'm going to move to.

1545
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,280
Which one is it now?

1546
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,100
And I went through that process.

1547
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:39,600
Well,

1548
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:39,720
see,

1549
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,700
I didn't have to do that because my parents did.

1550
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:42,920
And,

1551
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,140
uh,

1552
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:43,620
yeah.

1553
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,800
And then,

1554
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,560
then they died and my brother and sister didn't want to live in this maintenance nightmare.

1555
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,860
They had their own newer houses already.

1556
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:52,940
Yup.

1557
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:53,480
And,

1558
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:53,680
uh,

1559
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,200
so here they,

1560
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,400
they basically said,

1561
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:56,760
well,

1562
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:02,820
you can stay in that old rattletrap decaying mansion.

1563
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,660
It's not really a mansion.

1564
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,120
It's actually a four bedroom house,

1565
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,800
but the living room has a mansion.

1566
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,240
It looks kind of like a mansion.

1567
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,580
It's kind of like,

1568
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,840
it reminds me of,

1569
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,000
uh,

1570
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,740
do you remember that one that had,

1571
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:15,960
uh,

1572
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:16,920
gosh,

1573
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,040
what was the name of it?

1574
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,500
Had William Holden in it and Gloria Swanson.

1575
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,820
And she played an aging.

1576
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,560
Oh yeah.

1577
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:24,680
Uh,

1578
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,040
sunset.

1579
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,120
Right.

1580
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,620
That's a great movie.

1581
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,380
Yeah.

1582
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,520
In that closing scene,

1583
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,640
when she comes out to get her set up,

1584
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:35,640


1585
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:35,980
Mr.

1586
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:36,940
DeMille,

1587
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:37,520
you know,

1588
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:38,540
yeah.

1589
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,720
Frame is to frame.

1590
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,540
I think they're getting ready to take her off to jail.

1591
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,120
Right.

1592
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:45,720
Well,

1593
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,340
she had a spiral staircase.

1594
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,300
We have a,

1595
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,860
was that an auto perimeter movie?

1596
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,180
I don't know.

1597
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,780
I really liked auto perimeter movies.

1598
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,780
I think I'm going to go look,

1599
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,920
see who did that movie.

1600
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:58,540
Well,

1601
00:56:59,020 --> 00:56:59,420
anyway,

1602
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,460
I'm going to turn off this recording and,

1603
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,440
um,

1604
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,560
you know,

1605
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,620
then I have to listen back.

1606
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,000
I'll probably go,

1607
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:07,380
man,

1608
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,440
I thought we were just blithering.

1609
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,780
And this is actually pretty,

1610
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,160
pretty,

1611
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,040
this is pretty funny.

1612
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,240
If you're philo or staying.

1613
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,440
Yeah.

1614
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,360
And that's all people that like to listen to us.

1615
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,080
Yeah.

1616
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,980
So anyway,

1617
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,000
which is us.

1618
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:23,700
Yeah.

1619
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,020
Well,

1620
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,240
even I'm getting tired of listening to us,

1621
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:27,440
man.

1622
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:27,980
I'll tell you.

1623
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,200
All right.

1624
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:30,460
Well,

1625
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,320
it was fun.

1626
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:32,560
Okay,

1627
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:32,860
man.

1628
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,220
I'll say.

1629
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,600
You think it would take your mind off things if Blackstone showed us a trick.

1630
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:45,800
Well,

1631
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,880
how about a bit of hypnotism,

1632
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,160
Alan?

1633
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,320
Who's to be the victim?

1634
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:49,780
Uh,

1635
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:50,180
you are,

1636
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,700
right now.

1637
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,320
Look straight in my eyes,

1638
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,040
sideways.

1639
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,080
That's a sense.

1640
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,480
It isn't as easy as you think,

1641
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:57,860
Alan.

1642
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,580
It isn't?

1643
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,140
Ah,

1644
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,920
just watch.

1645
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:01,940
All right.

1646
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,260
What do I do now?

1647
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,240
And I'm not hypnotized.

1648
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,180
That's right, Alan.

1649
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,720
Then you give up?

1650
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:08,900
Certainly do.

1651
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,760
Well, just try to look into my eyes.

1652
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,280
One on top of the other.

1653
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,520
I wouldn't have a chance.

1654
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,440
Well, for once, you're right, Alan.

1655
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,160
I hope you like that trick, ladies and gentlemen.

1656
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,960
And until next time, goodbye.
