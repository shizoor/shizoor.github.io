1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,680
Oh why, oh why, did I ever have to love you?

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,140
I'd cry, I'd cry

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,080
I'm so blue, I'm so blue

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,460
If I'm not asking for too much

5
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,940
I keep the memories of your touch

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,520
Right now I want you to know

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,280
That I will always love you so

8
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,760
Oh yeah

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,580
Oh dear friend

10
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,460
Let's go to the Gigolo Club over in Yancey

11
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:01,920
They got a

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,840
So genius

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,320
Power of Slack

14
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,220
I say this calls for action and now

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,940
Nip it in the bud

16
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,880
Ah shut up

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,560
Okay

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,040
Friends this is Hour of Slack number 1040

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,240
But it's not really

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,560
Because it's really Hour of Slack number 136

21
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,420
This is a rerun from

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,580
From

23
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,060
From

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,060


25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,060


26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,060


27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,060


28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,060


29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,060


30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,060


31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,060


32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,060


33
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,160
I guess it would be either

34
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,000
Late 1987

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,400
Or more likely

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,900
Very early 1988

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,680
I think we were working on the book

38
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,360
Three-Fisted Tales of Bob

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,560
At that time

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,760
And the reason I'm running reruns

41
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Again now is because we're working

42
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,580
On another book

43
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,680
It's called

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,440
The Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack

45
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,660
The Bobliagraphon

46
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,160
From Thunder's Mouth Press

47
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,760
It won't be out until

48
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,180
August

49
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,680
But it has to be in

50
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,640
By May 15th

51
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,320
So yours truly Reverend Ivan Stang

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,160
Is going to be very very very busy

53
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,580
On this

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,340
Third Testament

55
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,720
And not on the Hour of Slack

56
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,720
Although we will keep pumping them out

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,380
Somehow

58
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,100
Praise Bob

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,560
Oh yes yeah

60
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,060
Three minutes and we're going to be up up and away

61
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,620
Off this dirt ball we call

62
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,720
The Earthquake!

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:26,960
We're

64
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:26,960


65
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,500
There'sä¿º

66
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,920
On my WAY

67
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,300
I

68
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,040
Think

69
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,560
Everybody's

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:38,720
Some

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:38,960
Has

72
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,460
Our

73
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,640
Wind

74
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,360
Out

75
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,360


76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,520
Or

77
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,380
So

78
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,000
This didn't look much like a movie to me.

79
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,880
This isn't what I wanted to start this show off with.

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,880
Oh, God, the show is ruined.

81
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,060
And so it was.

82
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,580
The show never returned to Earth.

83
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,760
Shot into the air by the antenna.

84
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,420
That you teach you for publishing lies about me in your technical journal.

85
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,740
Now I have my own name.

86
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,680
Jack!

87
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,860
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

88
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,120
I shall also prove that in space no one can hear you squeak.

89
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,120
No, must get show back from hell.

90
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,360
Not let hell keep...

91
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,400
Who came to understand these things as part of the season?

92
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,500
The great change of the earth.

93
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,960
I don't mind telling you I'm...

94
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,320
Must keep oxygen going for one more hour for an hour of slack.

95
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,580
It is.

96
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,360
It is.

97
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,320
The hour of slack.

98
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:10,240
The hour of slack.

99
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:24,180
The hour of slack.

100
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,680
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

101
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,300
A real nice guy.

102
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,440
With a little bit of nice inside.

103
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,020
In trouble.

104
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,880
He tried to hide from himself.

105
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,560
God said men couldn't face up to the end of the age

106
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,320
Everybody, all of us got a shadow

107
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,680
Who knows what lies in the hearts of men

108
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,240
We'll show you

109
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,380
We'll become what we do

110
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,160
Not what we pretend

111
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,360
Between the intention

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,220
And the expression

113
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,060
Between the emotion

114
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,000
And the response

115
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,820
Of the show

116
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,720
Sometimes I fail to follow through

117
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,900
On things that I want to do

118
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,360
Sometimes I fail to follow through

119
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,380
And other times

120
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,380
I find myself

121
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,320
Doing the very things I hate

122
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,700
Reverend Jimmy

123
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,540
And Tamey Bell

124
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,180
Big time pumpers with a story to sell

125
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,400
Wait a minute

126
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,060
Who's their fingers better than you?

127
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,840
Their attention

128
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,020
Listen up

129
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,040
Don't try to deny it

130
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,900
They're covering

131
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,360
The truth

132
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:52,600
Listen up

133
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,940
Everybody

134
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,540
All of us got a shadow

135
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,260
Yes, welcome dear friends

136
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,700
To the subgenius

137
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,360
Radio Mania

138
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,440
The voice of the church

139
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,100
Of the subgenius

140
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,760
And the specific voice

141
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
You're hearing right now

142
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,020
Is me, Reverend Ivan Stang

143
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,380
Here with Willa Dobbs

144
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,680
Who will take your calls

145
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,780
If you dare

146
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,560
At

147
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,360
And we've had a lot of

148
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,280
You know, since there's a new show before us

149
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,800
And so we got new listeners

150
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,660
And they're kind of asking questions

151
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,360
They ask, you know,

152
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,600
Just what is this so-called church

153
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,960
Of the subgenius?

154
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,320
Well, my friends

155
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,660
I want you to know

156
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,740
That the traitors

157
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,040
The cowards

158
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,420
The betrayers

159
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,580
Of the subgenius

160
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,820
Won't say so

161
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,760
But today

162
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,240
Two worlds are struggling for existence

163
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,760
The ideals of the subgenius national people

164
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,460
And the ideals of the intangible international

165
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,200
As exemplified by the

166
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,000
Conspiracy

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,120
It began at the moment

168
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,180
When the Peaks obtained citizenship

169
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,800
In American states

170
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,900
The political emancipation of the Peaks

171
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,180
Was the beginning of a madness

172
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,200
A people who are not part of our race

173
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,860
And blood

174
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,440
But for our race and blood

175
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,160
Unto themselves

176
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,880
They took root among the nations

177
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,140
And that blood called out to itself

178
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,880
And in time

179
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,880
The whole world became their nation

180
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,180
The nation of the subgenius

181
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,080
The Pink Boys

182
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,620
Little by little

183
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,720
The stock exchange

184
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,320
Began to run our national economy

185
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,600
This alien institution

186
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,760
Is almost entirely controlled

187
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,980
One way or the other

188
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,220
By the Pink Boys

189
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,580
In England and France, for instance

190
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,460
The Pink was able to hide himself

191
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,900
So well he was taken for an ordinary citizen

192
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,520
And for this reason

193
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,380
Anti-subgenius in these countries

194
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,780
Has no elemental force

195
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,020
And this is what has allowed

196
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,020
Slack to fall

197
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,820
Apart there

198
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,520
Only there

199
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,600
Only there

200
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,660
Could a form of government be set up

201
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,520
What genius

202
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,820
And individual energy

203
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,200
Could be dominated by a dead mass

204
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,320
And so it was child's play

205
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,280
For the Pink Boys to use this

206
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,900
To the interest of this invisible group

207
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,800
How long can this process

208
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,820
Of race betrayal go on?

209
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,100
It will not cease

210
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,600
Until from out of this chaotic mass

211
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,660
One man

212
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,660
One Bob

213
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,920
Suddenly rises up

214
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,180
And ceases leaving

215
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,420
The leadership

216
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,320
Joys with the other comrades

217
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,660
And fans the rage of the people

218
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,160
Into an all-consuming flame

219
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Of hate

220
00:09:59,680 --> 00:09:59,740
Hate

221
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,480
Against these exploiters

222
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,040
And criminals

223
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,480
Who have never founded a culture of their own

224
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,100
But have dragged hundreds of cultures

225
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,880
Down with them

226
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,560
The Pink spreads his conspiracy

227
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,920
Like a disease

228
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,940
The Pink controls the food traffic

229
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,220
And so brings about starvation

230
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:17,860
Why?

231
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,460
Why?

232
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,620
So the ferment

233
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,600
The suffering

234
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,900
The need for

235
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,740
Revolution

236
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,760
Will never end

237
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,920
Because in the world chaos

238
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,640
This talentless

239
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,180
Abominable race

240
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,160
Maintains its strange power over the world

241
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,040
The Pink Boy wants war

242
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,920
And causes war

243
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,620
He needs ignorance

244
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,380
And promotes ignorance

245
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,240
We shall fight them across the face of the entire world

246
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,040
We shall gather our strength

247
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,360
And strike them down

248
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,700
Subgenius

249
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,940
And mutants of every nation

250
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,960
Must join in the struggle against

251
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,120
The human rights

252
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,060
Of exploiters and oppressors of all peoples

253
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,540
I hope that that answers any questions about

254
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,580
What is the church of the subgenius

255
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,940
Oh yeah, but it's a nice church, you know

256
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,300
Wow!

257
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,300
The other shows get in the way though

258
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,840
And we can't tell the full truth

259
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,180
Not in this reality

260
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,920
Shall we look around and see

261
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,680
What's happening down in our control room today?

262
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,680
Sure

263
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,680
Here comes the collar simulation

264
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,840
Here comes the collar simulation

265
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,440
Now we can substitute equations of motion

266
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,040
Collar dynamics, moments of inertia

267
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,680
And brain simulation

268
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,840
And autopilot and stability control proposed

269
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,160
And brain simulation autopilot and stability control proposed

270
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,940
The color of the effects on the ground effects area.

271
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,000
Look, it's talking to us.

272
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,300
The caller sits up and talks.

273
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,260
Yes, just like real life.

274
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,640
Yes, doctor?

275
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,120
Just like a little bunny.

276
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,520
Now, this is supposedly a real question.

277
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,320
I've got diarrhea.

278
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,860
Look at his sloppy ears.

279
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,300
Too bad about his other hand.

280
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,540
He waited 18 years to say that on the radio.

281
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,880
Well, well, well, it's all an amazing...

282
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,440
Isn't it exciting?

283
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,200
This show allows the common people to do anything they want.

284
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,960
It's called glossolalia.

285
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,100
You should take out your tampions before you phone the show.

286
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,980
That's bears, doctors, not rabbits.

287
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,620
They're bears.

288
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,880
They'll never really get it together.

289
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,280
It's just a little teeny color.

290
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,020
Babes in the woods, where we're concerned.

291
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,660
My colleague is referring to the fact that the plug that the bear puts in his anus when he hibernates

292
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,560
so that the ants cannot get in, it is called a tampion.

293
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,720
Tampine.

294
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,560
Yes, it's a word not many people know.

295
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,080
Tampion of the people.

296
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,820
Shocking.

297
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,560
True.

298
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,640
But other news.

299
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,760
Back to normal.

300
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,640
Data bears model boys for the show.

301
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,160
A large slimy object proved to be Cary Grant's Rolodex,

302
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,760
which had been...

303
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,940
Previously stored by...

304
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,360
A warm, squishy place by Nancy Reagan.

305
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,940
...in the interior of a large bivalve.

306
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,980
Now we're doing a close-up on the dome structures.

307
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,820
...the scariest sovereign of the seas.

308
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,160
And here's the image processing of the HAL module.

309
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,240
Oh, hi.

310
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,160
Am I on TV?

311
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,080
Yes, of course.

312
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,560
Well, uh...

313
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,640
I'll show you his mission scenario now.

314
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,420
Oh, I know that.

315
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,660
You're not supposed to be looking at that.

316
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,580
Oh, sorry.

317
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,500
I'm putting the camera up to head level now.

318
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,320
We'll be queuing that night of shooting tape in just a moment.

319
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,600
Ah, yes.

320
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,120
Uh...

321
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,620
You'll be seeing that tape just in a moment now.

322
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,940
And now, using our computer interfaces...

323
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,920
It's coming up.

324
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,020
Uh, and...

325
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,480
We go into signal conversion mode.

326
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,460
Yes, our camera's...

327
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,140
AED, BD back to A.

328
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,200
We seem to have lost contact with our...

329
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,720
Using sound simulation to approximate tapes and records.

330
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,140
Uh, of course, we can also play the historic music that was present on this occasion.

331
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,020
Yes, we're all hoping to hear the music of the spheres here.

332
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,960
Good luck, HAL.

333
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,440
848.

334
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:45,860
That's different.

335
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,480
425.

336
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,460
That's 848.

337
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,740
Well, I don't know if I see anything.

338
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,140
That was...

339
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,160
Oh...

340
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,500
Unbuzzling evidence...

341
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,640
On the KPFA show in Berkeley.

342
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,700
Oh...

343
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,760
Mike...

344
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,360
Mike...

345
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,800
That's another subgenius show.

346
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,300
This is this subgenius show.

347
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,500
And they all kind of mix up together.

348
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,140
How much...

349
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,860
Is that dog hair...

350
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,740
In the window?

351
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,820
Oh, yes, dear friends.

352
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,140
And you see, it's all media.

353
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,660
It's a big mess of media.

354
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:28,060
And see, then there was a five-minute religious radio program, uh, without recourse to nuclear weapons.

355
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,260
And then a sitcom in which a white couple, Dan and Joni Clifton, are annoyed by Mr. and Mrs. Waugh.

356
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:41,800
The Pakistani couple have moved in next door, whose overwhelming curry cooking smells and, and, uh, gives rise to a number of sardonic reports.

357
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,920
And then a public service commercial informing the public that Soviet spies are rife in the technical centers.

358
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,120
Best not speak to anyone you haven't known.

359
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,920
You see, friends, it's all just radio, media.

360
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,380
It saturates the public.

361
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,060
It's the grid.

362
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,760
It's the grid, according to Jon Shirley here in, uh, Eclipse, Penumbra.

363
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,700
It's a worldwide grid with information in wave after wave.

364
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,800
Each wave hitting all the local receiving centers, the cities more or less simultaneously.

365
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,840
There's more of the grid's information as superficial as each unit of information is, coming faster than ever before.

366
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,100
And it doesn't matter if it's a local radio station or a local radio station.

367
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,100


368
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,100


369
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,100


370
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,100


371
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,100


372
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,100


373
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,100


374
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,260
It doesn't matter if it's a lie or not, because it's all information.

375
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,960
And people receive the information simultaneously, and they soak it up passively.

376
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,680
Go ahead, listener.

377
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,400
Soak up.

378
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,840
Soak up, Bob.

379
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,940
Because if the government claims there's a new strain of AIDS that you can only get from talking to commies,

380
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:45,900
then 80% of the people hooked into the grid will believe the communist AIDS story implicitly, instantly.

381
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,680
And everyone they run into has heard the same thing.

382
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,760
So they all got it at once.

383
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,660
And it seems to confirm itself by its very instantaneous prevalence.

384
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,880
Much like the hour of slack.

385
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,320
And since little real substance exists in this hypothetical broadcast we're doing right now,

386
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,200
there's nothing much to stimulate questioning.

387
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:10,000
There's simply the basic bull-dada storyline and testimony from a few experts the government keeps on tap

388
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,580
for when it needs their tailor-made quotes to give the appearance of credibility.

389
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,580
Or maybe a flash of a chart to give us an impression that some serious study's been done.

390
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,120
And bang!

391
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,420
Nobody believes it!

392
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,320
You do, pal!

393
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:29,840
And it becomes true for the public as kind of a consensus reality develops from the instantaneousness and ubiquity of the story.

394
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:36,400
And that sort of thing makes the grid, our little grid here at K-N-O-N, a powerful tool for shaping society.

395
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,780
...travel into bloody pulp with sickly powers of darkness.

396
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,120
So remember, as we wander through this charnel house,

397
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,000
this abattoir we call life,

398
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,700
that even though the future promises nothing,

399
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,560
destruction looms ahead,

400
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,380
and the end of all joys, old age, raffles...

401
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,240
My little brother claimed the devil rode on his back,

402
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,620
and this is why he was always up to no good.

403
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,000
I command you to throw dirt bombs at cars!

404
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,400
Yes, master.

405
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,600
His main activities were playing with matches...

406
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,660
...and running down the alley with no pants on.

407
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:43,180
Tarzan, Tarzan in the air, Tarzan lost his underwear, Tarzan say, me no care.

408
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,980
Pretty soon he was considered a bad element,

409
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,080
and you were automatically grounded if your mother caught you playing with him.

410
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,080
If we play with you, mom said she'd cream us!

411
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,820
Yeah!

412
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,060
Like I care! Big deal, you sissies!

413
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,460
Throughout the days of his childhood, he remained fearless and a born hell raiser.

414
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,000
The only thing he was scared of was looking at Alfred E. Newman's face.

415
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,220
Gah!

416
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,960
Eventually, like anyone else, he turned sick.

417
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,140
In 1916, this shed a whole new light on things.

418
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,560
Like a car, which he took off in.

419
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,960
Come back with my car, you lousy kid!

420
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,160
I remember one time I told my brother that the music of Jimi Hendrix was ungentle.

421
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,680
At that time, he was high on grass.

422
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,080
Shut up! And get out of my room!

423
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,720
He was a real hit with girls, but not with their mothers.

424
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,540
Often, he was making out.

425
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,580
Since I was older, I warned him of unwanted pregnancy.

426
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:54,980
Bye!

427
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,560
You're gonna get in trouble!

428
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,140
Shut up and get out of my room!

429
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,500
He went through what you might call a rebellious period,

430
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,080
which included criminal acts, the world of drugs,

431
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,320
music of the electric guitar, and a 1965 Mustang convertible.

432
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,780
Outwardly, he seemed happy, but I knew better.

433
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,220
The night of his high school graduation,

434
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,640
he took LSD and wandered naked through a fountain expressing himself.

435
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,140
I'm alive! I'm alive!

436
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,640
On the way to the police station,

437
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,720
I was trying to explain to our mom the concept of doing your own thing,

438
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,760
to provide understanding toward my brother's actions.

439
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,820
However, she was not in the right space at the time.

440
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,620
You sacrifice your whole life for them,

441
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,060
and this is what you get in return.

442
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,180
Ingrate! Bum!

443
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,240
I encouraged my brother to expand his intellectual horizons.

444
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,660
He, however, had his own ideas and went to work in a tire store.

445
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,460
Eventually, he got a red Corvette.

446
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,040
He is so materialistic, and it worries me.

447
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,700
I mean, haven't you ever asked yourself,

448
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,560
who am I?

449
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,060
What are my goals in life?

450
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,680
Move in, will ya?

451
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,220
I'm trying to watch Gomer.

452
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,160
music of the electric guitar

453
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
music of the electric guitar

454
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,580
music of the electric guitar

455
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,260
If you'll turn the machine on.

456
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,280
music of the electric guitar

457
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,800
Are we getting through?

458
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,140
music of the electric guitar

459
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,160
Is anything happening?

460
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
music of the electric guitar

461
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,600
music of the electric guitar

462
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,180
I mean, will they...

463
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,140
will you turn the right knobs?

464
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
I mean, we're on the air.

465
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,320
music of the electric guitar

466
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,680
Is that good?

467
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,380
music of the electric guitar

468
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
Oh, you say we're getting there.

469
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,820
Oh, fine.

470
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:07,860
music of the electric guitar

471
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,380
music of the electric guitar

472
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:09,520
music of the electric guitar

473
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,860
Please, be patient.

474
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,280
I mean, that's very difficult to contact outer space.

475
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,400
Oh, now they're coming through.

476
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,080
music of the electric guitar

477
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,080


478
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,080


479
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,380
Here they are.

480
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,900
music of the electric guitar

481
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,160
music of the electric guitar

482
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,240
music of the electric guitar

483
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,960
music of the electric guitar

484
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,480
music of the electric guitar

485
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
music of the electric guitar

486
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,780
music of the electric guitar

487
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:34,800
music of the electric guitar

488
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,500
many, many women here on Earth,

489
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,920
they're beautiful, actually.

490
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,220
They're different from men.

491
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:52,000
In fact, women are extremely important to us here on Earth.

492
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,780
I hope that that answers your question.

493
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,200
But is there anything else that you'd like to know?

494
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,320
Well, I told you about the women.

495
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,460
I mean, you know, you're repeating the same question.

496
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,100
Maybe you don't have anything like that where you are.

497
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,080
By the way, how are things where you are?

498
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,040
I see.

499
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,180
Well, I'm sorry I brought that up.

500
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,140
Is there anything else that you'd like to know?

501
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,200
Oh, well, temperature here is very, very nice right now, actually.

502
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,320
Before the time of year.

503
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,640
We like our weather.

504
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,060
We're very pleased with it.

505
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,620
It's been one of the warmest winters we've ever had.

506
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

507
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:04,780
I'm sorry.

508
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:04,780


509
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:04,780


510
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:04,780


511
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:04,960
It's been one of the warmest winters we've ever had.

512
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,640
I can hear that it's been so hot where you are.

513
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,280
Well, that's the way things are, you know.

514
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,200
Oh, by the way, I'm interested in knowing

515
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,260
if you have hydrogen bombs where you are.

516
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,400
Oh, I can tell by the way you said that.

517
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,440
Is there anything that you'd like to give to us?

518
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,120
As a message from outer space that would mean something.

519
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,060
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that you're so frightened of us.

520
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,680
There's no reason.

521
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,460
These are little attempts of science.

522
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,220
We have absolutely no intention to do anything.

523
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,340
We're just going to be a little bit more careful.

524
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:09,340


525
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:09,340


526
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:09,340


527
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:09,340


528
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,860
Ken Nourdain, dear friends.

529
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,000
Good old Ken Nourdain.

530
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,060
Ken, we want that story from you.

531
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,340
The following is another helpful tip brought to you by the voice of the people.

532
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,660
This tip is from the United States Department of Transportation.

533
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,240
On the proper way to wear your safety belts.

534
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,520
The correct position is over the shoulder,

535
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,700
across the chest,

536
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,780
low on the lats,

537
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,680
up under the abdomen.

538
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,540
To get rid of slack, pull the belt out at least five inches and let go.

539
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,920
Slack is automatically removed and the belt will fully retract

540
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,860
when the buckle is unlatched.

541
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,620
Periodically check the amount of slack in your belt and adjust if necessary.

542
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,200
Check your owner's manual for more information.

543
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,760
So buckle up, America.

544
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,060
When you start your engine, drive carefully.

545
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,280
This helpful tip has been brought to you by the voice of the people.

546
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,220
Where slack is taken up when you buckle that thing down tight.

547
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,960
The

548
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,800
first target was this planet Earth.

549
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,600
We will rejoin here to blend our frequencies.

550
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,540
But I have no experience with time and space.

551
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,240
I have lost my way.

552
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,900
I've been separated.

553
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,760
From the others.

554
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,780
We cannot find the other shows.

555
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,640
We must take me to them.

556
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,080
Help us find the other shows.

557
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,760
You must.

558
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,840
They are useless without me.

559
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,280
You must.

560
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,000
You must.

561
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,080
I have to find our own planet.

562
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,160
Mine is the lowest frequency in complex vibration.

563
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,040
The annihilating vibration.

564
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,760
Yes, the annihilating vibration.

565
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,160
The first of all, love the Earth and then the entire universe.

566
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,400
We wouldn't do it.

567
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,720
But you will, won't you?

568
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,060
Oh, friend.

569
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,200
You're a good friend.

570
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,280
I know that you will.

571
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,620
I know that you'll do it.

572
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,340
You'll help us find our respective vibrations.

573
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,520
We'll make you an offer you can't refuse.

574
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,800
Listen to that lovely, lovely music in the background.

575
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,280
More Zug's Rift.

576
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,020
Our beloved friend and comrade Zug's Rift.

577
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,700
Here to play a little bit of...

578
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,060
This is Zug's Rift.

579
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,500
A concerto.

580
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,720
Number seven in eight G.

581
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,400
Do you have any furniture you'd like to get rid of?

582
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,860
Clothes you don't wear?

583
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,520
Toys and clothes your children have outgrown?

584
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:22,300
The Calvary Arms Project can take it off your hands for you and distribute it to people

585
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,140
who can use it.

586
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,860
You may personally take it to Calvary Arms.

587
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,960
4900 East Bonney View.

588
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,120
Behind Holy Cross Church.

589
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,060
Or you may call them at...

590
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,740
To arrange for it to be picked up.

591
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,980
That's Calvary Arms at 371...

592
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,300
And they'll do it.

593
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:50,400
They'll take the furniture, toys, and clothes that you don't need and give them to those

594
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,740
who does need them.

595
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,340
So be kind and get with it.

596
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,320
Be like a religious person and...

597
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,820
And be nice.

598
00:27:59,820 --> 00:27:59,820


599
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,420
Well, that's what we think.

600
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,560
How about you?

601
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,140
Give us a call here.

602
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,140
No, you're on the air.

603
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,780
Well, where was that beast you attacked us at?

604
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,860
I was talking about the beast with a million eyes.

605
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,940
The beast that lurks in the dark outside of the angles of our mundane geometry.

606
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:35,660
Which hints at terrifying cracks and crevices in other anti-human universes which lead off

607
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:40,220
concatenating along the corridors of infinities of terror.

608
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,840
Wow, where'd it come from?

609
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,640
Well, right here.

610
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,800
It came from Woolworths.

611
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
It's 99 cents.

612
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,580
It's made of one piece polyestrene plastic.

613
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,960
One must perform the experiment itself to find out what happens.

614
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,340
But now the subgenius show is going to give away a little secret that's not going to

615
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:05,380
be discovered by anybody else for about 200 years, and that is that solar systems such

616
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:11,240
as our own create gravity wells in which Einsteinian forces are indeed dominant.

617
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:23,240
But outside these wells, all sorts of hyper-evangations of art, temporal simulacrum, may be encountered,

618
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:31,380
and in fact, frequently exist, in the eternal byways between the receding stars.

619
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,140
And what about the crab-like beings that fly on members wings from the outer planet

620
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:43,860
and our souls have to land in the New England hills and capture unwary souls to be eternal

621
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,000
travelers, captive in gleaming steel cylinders?

622
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,980
Only their brains travel between the stars.

623
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,640
And the stars clutched in the coiling tentacles of the beings known as the me-go.

624
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,280
It's terrifying.

625
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,900
That's true, but that's on the other side of the country from us.

626
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,020
We don't have to worry about that.

627
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:10,320
We don't have to worry about the cult of the yink, the evil serpent god, and the mysterious

628
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,320
anti-human bathshogi serpent men.

629
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,120
Hello, you're on the air.

630
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,440
Is it true what they're saying about the modern day broadcaster?

631
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,820
I don't know.

632
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:22,960
I don't know.

633
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:22,960


634
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,400
And how they are

635
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,620
baked into the earth.

636
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:50,960
I don't see the thing.

637
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:52,700
No.

638
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,760
Harmonic? What have they done to this? My daughter's herself the elf tape.

639
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,400
It's a starboard with a very special song just for you.

640
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:09,620
No, that's okay. Now, friends, see, we don't mind that you hear us having all sorts of little minor technical whip-arounds here on the Hour of Slack

641
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,840
because it's within our slack, baby.

642
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,120
Like that one Bobby said that one time.

643
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,280
Hey, man, I hate you, but I love you because it's like within your slack.

644
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,020
Let's see what happens on number two.

645
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,460
That's weird.

646
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,200
Well, okay, okay.

647
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,400
All right, fine, fine.

648
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,140
We won't play anything if that's the way this...

649
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,500
Man, the only professional tape I have in here that doesn't even work.

650
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,580
Ridiculous.

651
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,360
We'll clean all those...

652
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,800
Okay, but there is a show.

653
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,600
We're really in confusion down here, but there is a show.

654
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:50,680
Eve.

655
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,600
One of the code words.

656
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,760
You'll need to get back out of the show.

657
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,480
Just say, ew, and listen for this special signal,

658
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,500
which you'll hear later on in our program.

659
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:08,780
Dial us then and you'll win the free refrigerator and the expensive imported Cadillac converter kit,

660
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,700
which makes your car into a beautiful simulacrum of Oscar Mayer's original classic 1950s cultural weenie mobile.

661
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,040
Uh-oh, two-shot.

662
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,160
Hypo phony.

663
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,620
This is a fill-in shot we'll use at around 5.30.

664
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,580
Hey, don't give it all.

665
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,320
You know, sometimes the magician likes to keep the mechanics of his craft to himself.

666
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,580
Well, I guess so.

667
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,880
People are often interested in just how they do the show.

668
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,720
Why, you cynic, you exploit the marvelous mystical make-believe of the show,

669
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,500
exposing its secrets as the cheap stagecraft they are.

670
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,760
I join the audience in make-believing this is a show.

671
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,480
And yet, maybe there's some slight thing worthwhile.

672
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,560
Even so, even though you may reveal it to be...

673
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:46,600
That was the clue earlier.

674
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,800
See, I gave the time for...

675
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,880
All sham and gallifly...

676
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,540
The one moment of worthwhileness...

677
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,640
A simple thing.

678
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,680
But a good one.

679
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:52,780
A good thing.

680
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,460
Yes.

681
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,960
And you might say a right thing.

682
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,060
Easy to repair show.

683
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,480
Like a shaft of sunlight.

684
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,720
Uh, you know...

685
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,520
Screaming through the window.

686
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,320
And landing right on this little fella.

687
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,620
Right here on his posterior.

688
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,640
It's sunburning the little lad.

689
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,120
Look at that, uh...

690
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,260
Humiliating his pain.

691
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:12,720
Oh, no!

692
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,500
No!

693
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,460
It burned him to a cinder.

694
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,940
Too much solar radiation can do that.

695
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,480
Well, you know, mostly I think it's the, uh...

696
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,320
The sailors.

697
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,600
They're late, but they're supposed to show up now.

698
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,580
They're wheeling baby number two under the big lens now.

699
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,220
And the dogs are just so happy to tear it apart.

700
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,820
As well as the sawing competition in Woodwork, Connecticut.

701
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,960
Watch this.

702
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:39,880
Oh!

703
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,080
Oh!

704
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,340
Whoa!

705
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,440
I'll never tell.

706
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,400
I'll never tell.

707
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:45,840
Oh!

708
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,380
Whoa!

709
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,440
I won't tell.

710
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,100
I won't tell.

711
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,720
It's a show ball.

712
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,840
Uh...

713
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:50,920
Time.

714
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,020
For the change.

715
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,500
How do we?

716
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,340
Easy.

717
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:13,840
Easy.

718
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,240
You can tell.

719
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,040
By...

720
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:22,660


721
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:23,680
The...

722
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,980
Beached Pigs.

723
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,820
When is it time for the change, friends?

724
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,300
Well, you can tell by the Beached Pigs from Diffuser.

725
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,080
Yes.

726
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,860
A toast to the booty.

727
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,980
Heel down to that.

728
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,740
Or how else can you capture a boogie if you don't attack from the back?

729
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,340
To the rear.

730
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,540
March.

731
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,660
To the rear.

732
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


733
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


734
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


735
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


736
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


737
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


738
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


739
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


740
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


741
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


742
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


743
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


744
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


745
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


746
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


747
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


748
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


749
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


750
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,660


751
00:34:52,680 --> 00:35:22,680


752
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,400
We're five.

753
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,000


754
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,580
Jump.

755
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:27,780
Dun.

756
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,120
Dun.

757
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,300
Dun.

758
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:31,940
Dun.

759
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:52,680
Dun.

760
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,160
the boogie

761
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,200
here's a toast to the boogie

762
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,320
we'll fight for that

763
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,340
bottoms up

764
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,920
here's a toast to the boogie

765
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,940
we'll fight for that

766
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,080
bottoms up

767
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,660
and there's just a one

768
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,640
some people call me the fun

769
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,680
here's a toast to the boogie

770
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,080
and my name is the one

771
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,660
some people call me the fun

772
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,660
some people call me the fun

773
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:59,480
and then I find a break and beat it

774
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,320
a move that gives it all to one

775
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,960
I'm like a camera

776
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,160
double up in the bleed

777
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,700
I'm up to my hopes and my fears

778
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,780
I've got jam in my knees

779
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,240
and I'm ready to spread it

780
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,480
all the way to the left

781
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,380
and the front

782
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:22,660
and the back

783
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,180
I am sir no

784
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,400
Steve Boyd of Florida

785
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,800
please

786
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,580
and I will never thank

787
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,140
prepare to meet your end

788
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,980
sorry sir

789
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,420
for a tale

790
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,280
is nothing but a long

791
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,660
story

792
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,780
And this is the tale that I went in the end.

793
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,640
And I have pinned the tale on a donkey.

794
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,060
And you just went in the face of the mule forever, Star Child.

795
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,480
Oh, mule mow.

796
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,020
Oh, donkey pull, Star Child.

797
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:20,940
I come from Twinkly Down, Star Child.

798
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,860
And I have made a say in the world.

799
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,220
Oh, mule mow.

800
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,440
Oh, donkey pull.

801
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,600
I've learned no deportable.

802
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,300
Just never dance.

803
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,400
You'll have yourself, Star Child.

804
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,540
Where's your black cloth?

805
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,140
Where's your black cloth?

806
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,700
Where's my black cloth, Star Child?

807
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,200
Where's your black cloth?

808
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:55,900
Where's your black cloth?

809
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,880
Oh, mule mow.

810
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,900
Oh, donkey pull.

811
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,820
Oh, show.

812
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,800
It'd be show.

813
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,280
It'd be P-Funk.

814
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,520
And it'd be Rainmaker.

815
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:22,940
Yeah.

816
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:48,580
Boy, this

817
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,520
accent's so crazy.

818
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:50,660
Yeah.

819
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:50,940
Yeah.

820
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,980
The white people and the Anglos forgive the Romans and the Greeks forgive the Romans.

821
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,680
And the monsters forgive their creators.

822
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,180
Because that's where the subgeniuses come from, friends.

823
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,660
The other side of the world.

824
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
So watch out for them.

825
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,480
Georgia Street.

826
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,860
The other side of the world.

827
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,860
So around and around and around we go.

828
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,440
We are here, that's the law I know.

829
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,200
We might as well like it, that's the gospel, oh.

830
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,600
The other side of the world.

831
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,240
The other side of the world.

832
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,960
There's a young people falling in love.

833
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,600
There's a young people falling in love.

834
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,260
There's young people falling in love.

835
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,000
There's young people falling in love.

836
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,160
They love temperance.

837
00:41:50,160 --> 00:42:06,940
I got a letter today from Tokyo, a little Japanese girl that I'll never know.

838
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:14,100
She's eating pizza and singing, let my people go on the other side of the world.

839
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,740
So around and around and around we go.

840
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,580
So friends, that's where it all comes, all this subgenius stuff comes from.

841
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,240
It doesn't come from Dallas, it comes from all over the world.

842
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,120
Because the church is indeed the ultimate flattener of cultural differences,

843
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:41,140
and yet it's that which exaggerates cultural differences and will die to protect them.

844
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:49,060
The church of the subgenius is a weird clubhouse, friends, where the door says weirdos only,

845
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,880
and that means it's all nice folks.

846
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:59,400
Despite their galactic differences, because the most unusual thing these days is to be nice to your neighbors

847
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,820
and let them get away with murder as long as it doesn't hurt you or anybody else,

848
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,860
and that's a lot to ask of a religion.

849
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,320
I mean, all the great religions suggest that same dumb thing, be nice,

850
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:16,760
but that is the very first message to get lost as soon as that religion gets some good PR,

851
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,460
and that's a sick thing, friends.

852
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,100
That's what we stand against.

853
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:27,600
Bob Dobbs, that mighty man Bob Dobbs, set up a religion that you can believe in only as long as it works,

854
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,480
and when it does burn out, hell, you can go on to something else.

855
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,980
For the subgenius is a creature upon whom culture does not depend.

856
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,400
Culture is the last thing we care about, style, all that mess, up to you.

857
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,480
As far as we're concerned, we only want you to know

858
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,040
that you're not the only one who's going to be a part of this.

859
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,040
You're the only one who feels he or she must be the only one,

860
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,740
because yes, you are, and so are we, and we dig it, baby.

861
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,360
We're digging it, you know?

862
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,700
The only one.

863
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,100
See, we don't want a one-world government.

864
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,360
No, nay, nay.

865
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,860
We want as many governments as possible.

866
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,220
We want five billion independent governments.

867
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,780
Every man and woman with their own law.

868
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,300
Every yard of kingdom.

869
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,740
Every temple of king and queen.

870
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,580
Every child and dog a serf.

871
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:28,260
Each with its own territorial imperative, unimpeded by the assholism or censorship or crap

872
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,420
from others except when they cause a lack of slack to others.

873
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,640
Where has the idealism of insanity gone, my friend?

874
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,700
What's the problem?

875
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,800
What has Nicky wrought?

876
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,160
Why can't you people just simply get back to Bob?

877
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,960
Are ye so blind in your incomes and entertainment?

878
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,040


879
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:54,540
Must material slack mean spiritual blindness?

880
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,100
No, no, we think not.

881
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,820
That is only a condition of the conspiracy under which you all now live.

882
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,460
That is not a condition under Bob.

883
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,180
Bob is the answer, friends.

884
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,220
Bob is the answer.

885
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,980
Just give up your critical capacity.

886
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,260
Just thank Bob.

887
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,200
Because what else is there, huh?

888
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,100
What else makes more sense?

889
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:18,760
Does your stupid human existence make any more sense than Bobby?

890
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,040
Does your stupid human existence make any more sense than Bobby?

891
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,200
Nay, nay! So face it! Give up!

892
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,620
Join us, humans, and pretend you're one of us.

893
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,360
Send in that membership application fee.

894
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,580
We want to know who you are, and we won't tell the government.

895
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,260
We won't sell your soul for less than top dollar.

896
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,540
So get with Bob, or else...

897
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,100
And if you need more information, please do call the Will of Dobbs here at 823-729-0

898
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,940
or write to the Church of the Subgenius for information.

899
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,040
or write to the Church of the Subgenius for information.

900
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,300
We're from P.O. Box.

901
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:57,260
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

902
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,480
Yes, friends, that's Bob at Box.

903
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,540
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

904
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,360
www.subgenius.com

905
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,500
Oh, yes.

906
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,280
It appeals to not only kids, but also adults,

907
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,080
because we all think about,

908
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,220
gee, if I knew then what I know now,

909
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,280
I went back to high school.

910
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,600
What have they got to say, son?

911
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:34,000
What will be the next evil dispensation from the Church of the Subgenius

912
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,560
following the sponsored virus of the Macintosh computer across these United States?

913
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:44,360
The plague of boils on the buttocks of raining toads falling from the skies

914
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,780
like the torments of ancient Egypt.

915
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:47,700
What?

916
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:48,520
What are you talking about?

917
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,400
Hello, you on the air.

918
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,380
Yes, I know, all the way home.

919
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,660
Yes, yes, all the way home.

920
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,040
These bibulous boo-boos.

921
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,260
These bouffant, toad-like croakers.

922
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,000
Hello, you're on the air.

923
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:10,780
Hello.

924
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,720
I'm having trouble staying three-dimensional.

925
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,280
Boy, you weren't the only one.

926
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,420
I'm the only one.

927
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,380
What do you suppose to do?

928
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,320
What do you suppose to do?

929
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,800
How can the Church of the Subgenius help me?

930
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,020
Me?

931
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,440
Well, it started 50 hundred million years or so ago

932
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,800
when chemicals were mixing in the sea.

933
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,520
They kept mixing and kept mingling until they fell to little dingling

934
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,900
and that dingling was the start of eurony.

935
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,980
Now that stuff called protoplasm in the early oceans chasm

936
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:45,180
was the first stuff on our planet that could feel and, if what it felt like,

937
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:45,440
cause any kind of change.

938
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,680
If it was lonely, it's because it was the only stuff around that could continue.

939
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,380
Causality.

940
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:57,920
And the other exemplary, multi-dimensional anarchism of our professional prolapse.

941
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:03,680
Space is actually a fairly benign environment once one removes the interfering bodies

942
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:10,460
which traveling and velocities peculiar to them may inflict damage on the purely sessile object.

943
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,360
However, if one only cruises along in the galactic plane

944
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,600
the remaining speed derived from the averages of all nearby bodies

945
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,780
and some of them can be very remote indeed,

946
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:28,480
there's nothing more peaceful than to coast eternally betwixt the black holes of space.

947
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:39,780
Now you say you're hungry, you might want something to eat.

948
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,080
Oh, I ain't got no breath.

949
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,260
I'm hungry.

950
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,040
I can give you some meat.

951
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,360
Yes, friends, you can get you some meat.

952
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:54,020
Now when the rooster and the hen go to the bar to play

953
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,800
All the hen have chicken. How do they do it that way?

954
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:12,720
Well, friends, you can find out how they do it that way from the Church of the Subgenius P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

955
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,080
Yeah, as you callers, those of you who've heard this show for the first time tonight,

956
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,880
I pity you, oh, I pity you, but you can clarify things by, oh, calling up.

957
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,960
www.subgenius.com

958
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,000
Or writing for information to that box we just gave you.

959
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:35,840
Or hang around your local bookstore and just keep your eyes open for that mighty word, subgenius.

960
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,240
That's right.

961
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,000
You'll see there's far, far more in your heaven and earth

962
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,580
than you ever dreamt in your philosophies.

963
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,080
Humiliation is a sin.

964
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,060
You're in high school, for God's sake.

965
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,060
No smoking on the school grounds.

966
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,320
Are you supposed to be in this office?

967
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,600
Let me see your pen.

968
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,760
I don't have one.

969
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,120
I'm new here.

970
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,980
When my character first came out,

971
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,360
when my character gets to high school, he's faced with a little bit of a problem.

972
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,460
He has to register.

973
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

974
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,720
Who's he gonna register as? He can't register as himself.

975
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:37,880
Distinguished guests, brothers and sisters, ladies and gentlemen, friends and enemies.

976
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,360
Now commence.

977
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,240
No sellout.

978
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,120
Now commence.

979
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,900
No sellout.

980
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,900
Now commence.

981
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,620
No sellout.

982
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,620
Now commence.

983
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,420
No sellout.

984
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,200
Now commence.

985
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,200


986
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,040
White, black, brown, red, yellow.

987
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,060
What's making them put color you are?

988
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,060
I don't know.

989
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,300
I don't know.

990
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:09,980
I don't know.

991
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:10,920
I don't know.

992
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:12,920
It's a sex Ð½Ð°Ð·ÑÐ²ation.

994
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,720
I don't know.

995
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,080
I don't know.

996
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,080


997
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,080


998
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,260
Eh, I say I don't know.

999
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:27,660
If you can.

1000
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:27,660


1001
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:27,660


1002
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:27,660


1003
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:27,780
It's various letters in a book.

1004
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,800
It's very obvious we read books.

1005
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,700
It's very clear.

1006
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,160
It's sincere, and it inspires you.

1007
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,160


1008
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,580
What does it mean to hear?

1009
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:33,580


1010
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:33,580


1011
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:33,660
How many orders do you sell in two weeks?

1012
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,040

1013
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:34,440
How many do you powerful problems on a flight?

1014
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,960
New pink, witch-

1015
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,280
What's the use of a book?

1016
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,000
Whatchildren?

1017
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,000


1018
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,600
Who are people with the most power andSU

1019
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,940
b

1020
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,220
It's the truth. It's the truth. It's the truth.

1021
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:46,120
We don't care who likes it or not.

1022
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,320
As long as we know it's the truth.

1023
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,500
No, it's either this or that.

1024
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,200
This or that.

1025
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,200
If you're wrong, you're wrong.

1026
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,360
And if you're right, you're right.

1027
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,540
There'll be no children.

1028
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,860
No flim flam.

1029
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,700
No compromise.

1030
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,480
No sellout.

1031
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,540
No control.

1032
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:30,940
No doubt.

1033
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,900
No sellout.

1034
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,060
No sellout.

1035
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,480
No sellout.

1036
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,100
No sellout.

1037
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:10,160
You can't deny that.

1038
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:10,900
You may not deny that.

1039
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,500
You might think it, but you can't deny it.

1040
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:21,540
If you're afraid to tell the truth, why, you don't even deserve freedom.

1041
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,280
You can't say that you're not going to have an explosion and you leave your condition.

1042
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,020
And as long as those ingredients explode,

1043
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,320
ingredients,

1044
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,780
then you're going to have the potential for explosion on your hands.

1045
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,440
Now connect.

1046
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,320
No sellout.

1047
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,140
Now connect.

1048
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,940
No sellout.

1049
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:16,840
Now connect.

1050
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,760
No sellout.

1051
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,620
Now connect.

1052
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,920
Now connect.

1053
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,500
No sellout.

1062

It's about time

1063
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:40,900
To say goodbye to you

1064
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,500
I'm not the kind of person who can hear the sound that you like.

1065
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,860
I got a plate in front of me, but nothing is on it.

1066
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,720
Because all of us sitting at the same table are all of us diners.

1067
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,360
I'm not a diner until you let me dine.

1068
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,100
Then I become a diner.

1069
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,040
I was in a house last night that was by my own.

1070
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,660
It isn't something that made me lose confidence in what I'm doing.

1071
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:46,940
Brothers and sisters, friends, and I see some enemies.

1072
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,360
And here, Phil, for you, is a Mothers of World War II, Inc.

1073
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:10,760
membership.

1074
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,800
A membership certificate made out to Mrs. Hazel Yoder.

1075
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,100
Thank you.

1076
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:15,700
You're welcome.

1077
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,520
The pledge to the flag is on the other side.

1078
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,680
Do you know that unmarried women could be made mothers of the Second World War?

1079
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:24,800
Around 1942, I think, when we were in our most serious danger.

1080
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:28,200
And it looked like, indeed, we wouldn't be able to win the war for at least another year or two.

1081
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,780
Our great low point.

1082
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:35,480
Women were marshaled in by a member of Field Marshal Marshall, Marshall Plan, or Marshall Plain, actually.

1083
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,800
Because they were rolled down into these large buildings where these...

1084
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,660
Here comes one now.

1085
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,780
Women like this, indeed.

1086
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,820
Just put it right over there.

1087
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:41,960
Yeah.

1088
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,640
Just put it over there.

1089
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,480
She's wearing a turtle can, you'll notice, which keeps her moist-proof.

1090
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,880
And women, particularly unmarried women, were made official mothers of the American Revolution,

1091
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,840
which was what they were told the Second World War was.

1092
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:57,120
Was this the same time that Bob Jones and Lloyd Nolan were chosen by computers?

1093
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,240
To be first president and vice president of the U.S. Inc.

1094
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:01,620
That's right.

1095
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:01,960
That's right.

1096
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,440
Bob Jones, you've seen his cutout.

1097
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,280
He's on the, what, one groat, and Lloyd Nolan's on the five.

1098
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:08,240
The five groat, yeah.

1099
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:08,620
Yeah.

00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,080
A computer just in 1969.

1101
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:10,640
1969.

1102
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,040
Have you got that new money system down now, Peter?

1103
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:13,460
No.

1104
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,900
Because I know the change happened while I was away.

1105
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,660
And I am so confused.

1106
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,820
It happened at the same time as the earthquake, which made it difficult for a lot of people to get with it.

1107
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,660
I'll bet it did.

1108
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,260
But, uh...

1109
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:27,320
I mean, barrels of Grossman's now replacing those who were folding the green stuff.

1110
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:33,940
The Secret Service is taking the, uh, is confiscating all of the smoking papers made to look like $100 bills.

1111
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,760
But they won't tell anybody because it's a secret.

1112
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,460
Oh, sorry.

1113
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:37,840
No, you can.

1114
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,460
They won't.

1115
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,060
And he will not be killed by...

1116
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:47,160
By rampaging Yakutism in 1991 and end up with his head dangling from the Yakutism equivalent of a rearview mirror in one of their vehicles.

1117
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,120
Nothing.

1118
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,320
Nothing, friends.

1119
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,720
Well, stay tuned for, uh...

1120
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,560
Coming up, that was a little bit of Fireside Theater's old radio show.

1121
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,880
We would like to play more of that.

1122
00:57:59,020 --> 00:57:59,480
Couldn't.

1123
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,780
Had to get from one deck to the other.

1124
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,100
Robert, get his blanket.

1125
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,360
I got the poker bowl.

1126
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,620
Malcolm X was that, uh...

1127
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:09,960
Wonderful.

1128
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:10,400
Wonderful piece.

1129
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,400
Before Fireside Theater.

1130
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,820
The music was by D.K. Jones.

1131
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,500
Music and cut-up by D.K. Jones and huge voodoo.

1132
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:29,720
So, we'll let the Swingin' Love Corpses take us out with this lovely rendition of Handjob from the Swingin' Love Corpses.

1133
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,180
And the local hallway.

1134
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,520
See that boy, he's only eight.

1135
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,440
He's all there out of mind to play.

1136
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,560
See that girl on the 15th.

1137
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,580
She's the one who made my fingers stay.

1138
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:56,860
Handjob.

1139
00:58:58,760 --> 00:58:59,480
Handjob.

1140
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,100
Handjob.

1141
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,720
We'll be crazy.

1142
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,480
Handjob.

1143
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:16,020
See that girl with a rubble leg.

1144
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,980
I'm gonna fertilize her egg.

1145
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,900
See that girl, she all is to me.

1146
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,640
Sexy woman.

1147
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,060
See some of the music I write here, too.

1148
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:30,060


1149
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:30,060


1150
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:30,060


1151
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:30,060


1152
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:30,060


1153
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:30,060


1154
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:30,040
